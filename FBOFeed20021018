<DESC>The Center for Disease Control and Prevention intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Statistics of Canada a purchase order for services to provide health statistics to improve health care for the populations of Canada and the United States.  The services include data collection, transmission, processing, editing and delivery of a master and public use file.  This is a joint effort between Canada and the United States.  Statistics Canada provided the same services for the Canadian Government using the Computer Assisted Telephone Interviewing Program (CATIP).  This project requires the use of the CATIP to ensure comparable statistics and low percentage of error rate.  Comparable statistics are critical to improve the health systems and provide better health care for the populations of Canada and the United States.  Statistics of Canada is the only known source that can meet these requirements.  This requirement involves human subjects. The vendor must also comply with laws, regulations, and guidelines pertaining to managing and performing research involving human subjects including but not limited to the HHSAR Clause 352-280-1(b), "Protection of Human Subjects." We anticipate award in November 2002 with a performance period through June 2003. The RFQ will be issued on or about 21 October 2002.  The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) for this request for quote is 561422. Note 22 and 26.

<DESC>The NAVAIR Orlando Training Systems Division intends to negotiate a contract on a sole source basis with Bell Helicopter Textron, Inc. (BHTI) for a Visual System Upgrade to the AH-1W Weapons System Trainer (WST), Device 2F136, under authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1 "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements".  Using the current design and assorted hardware, software and interconnections previously procured for the program, the contractor shall be responsible for providing updates to AH-1W Aircrew Training Device. The contractor shall be responsible for design, fabrication, integration, documentation, shipping, installation and testing of the updates to specific device.  The training device is located at MCAS Camp Pendleton, CA.  BHTI as the OEM has gained intimate and unique knowledge of the current design and technology aspects of the AH-1W Trainer Program.  By leveraging their previous experience and design, BHTI is in a unique position of being able to provide a previously proven solution.  Because the contract requires in-depth knowledge of the current design, award through competition would require substantial duplication of cost that the Government would not recover through competition and would create unacceptable delays in fulfilling the AH-1W?s mission requirements.  In addition, key tasks are successful integration of new projectors, new image generator, new visual database, new display monitors (TSU and Maintenance), IG and/or host software modifications with the existing AH-1W WST, and lens/dome corrections.  The integrated visual system shall: include distortion correction and edge blending capabilities, including night vision goggle (NVG) (NVIS-6/9) and Night Targeting System (NTS) training, and shall be capable of withstanding current 6-DOF-motion systems environment.   Resolution of problems with the current maintainability of the existing projection system is required.  Key system knowledge of the AH-1W Training Device to include Skylight projectors and Vital 9 image generators which were developed and delivered by BHTI will be essential.  The Government anticipates that to meet timeframes, milestones, and schedules, that only BHTI has the established relationships with key personnel, who were instrumental in the design of the trainer, have successfully designed, fabricated, integrated, and delivered the AH-1W Training Device thereby possessing the demonstrated capability to perform the required contract.  This device is in a HAZREP / CASREP status which necessitates at a maximum a 6 month period of performance for completion.  Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government and can meet the required schedule.  In doing so, interested sources must submit detailed technical capabilities, pricing, and any other information, which demonstrates their ability to meet the needs of the Government. Detailed capabilities must be submitted to the above address (Attn: James Ward) by NOVEMBER 8, 2002.  All information shall be furnished at no cost or obligation to the Government.  Responses shall be limited to no more than FIVE pages.  This synopsis is not to be considered a request for quotations or proposals.  No solicitation document is available and telephone requests will not be honored.  No contract will be awarded on the basis of offers received in response to this notice, but will be used to determine if a comparable source is available and more advantageous to the Government.  If no affirmative written response is received, the contract will be awarded without further notice.

<DESC>Last year the FAA released a new draft specification for public comment, FAA-E-2952 for Steady Burning Semi Flush Approach Lights.  The new specification will replace the current 1975 specification, FAA-E-2491b.  After several subsequent rounds of internal reviews, the AND-740 Product Team expects that the new specification will be baselined for competitive procurement in early 2003.  Meanwhile, however, the FAA has requirements for fixtures to accompany ALSF-2 installations at three sites with near-term construction schedules:  Chicago, IL, and Manchester, NH, in April 2003 and Boston, MA, in July 2003.  The construction schedules will not allow for combined competitive procurement lead time and lead time to produce, test, and approve a first article prior to beginning production for site deliveries.  To fulfill requirements at these sites, the Product Team plans to negotiate a contract with Multi Electric Mfg., Inc., Chicago, IL, for its previously approved type no. ! FA10045 steady burning, semi flush, approach lights in accordance with the current specification and in the following quantities:  type no. FA10045/1 (clear) - 242 each, type no. FA10045/2 (green) - 168 each, type no. FA10045/3 (red) - 179 each.  The Product Team believes Multi Electric to be the only source whose fixtures have already undergone and passed first article tests under the FAA specification and therefore the only source capable of meeting the site construction dates. <P>

<DESC>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Center for Foods Safety and Nutrition (CFSAN), has a requirement to purchase on a sole source basis Mirage Software Perpetual Licensese (150 seats), along with annual maintenance.  This purchase will be made from Alchemedia Technologies, Inc. located in Grapevine, TX.  It is the understanding that this vendor is the sole source and manufacturer of the software.  This software is the only software known to the Government that prevents the unauthorized capture and distribution of sensitive documents being viewed on-line by FDA personnel.  Mirage is unique in terms of its reliability to ensure against screen capture.  Mirage is unique in providing protection against screen-capture by thirdy party software obtainable for free (in most cases) off the internet such: Snagit, Hypersnap, Jasc Paintshop Pro, A.S.C.T., and Timbuktu.  Mirage is the only software that has been found that is invisible to end-users in the following ways; access to documents is granted invisibly, no need to enter passwords, no need to sign-on to separate applications to view/use protected documents. Mirage is the only software found that eliminates the need for user name and password administration. Mirage is unique because: it accomplishes the assignment of rights to given documents and there is no need to individually assign authorization rights retroactively to each document in the OFAS' current database of electronic documents.  Mirage is the only software found that provide the option of "secure print" (printing from a designated printer, with a watermark and complete activity logging) along with the option to disallow printing altogether.  Mirage is the only software found that eliminates the need for document authors to laboriously assign protection separately to each document.  Therefor, award will be made on a sole source basis and no solicitation will result from this announcement.

<CONTACT>Roderick Matthews, 256-842-7693
<DESC>NA We wish to thank industry for comments and questions at Industry Day and via e-mail.  Since many questions are similar we have combined questions/comments where possible.    Below is the continuing set of responses to your questions if you have further que stions or comments please, let us know. It must be noted that the information provided here is only as a clarification and in response to your questions and comments; if any conflict exists with the information presented here and the formal RFP and SOW the  formal RFP and SOW will take precedence. Additional postings will follow as the CHS-3 technical team deliberates your questions.  Cases where we indicate that a SOW clarification is being made will be reflected in a future Draft SOW.   The numbering of th ese questions continues with the questions from industry day previously posted.  Several members of the government CHS-3 team who attended Industry Day have received e-mails containing information marketing various products.  The Industry Day attendee list was provided as a means of fostering intra industry cooperation and partnering.  It was not provided to give industry a list of CHS-3 team members as a potential list for marketing contract.  Due to the competitive nature of this effort, government team members will not consider this information.  A formal market survey has already be en conducted.  FOLLOW UP TO INDUSTRY DAY QUESTIONS:  31. 	Q: Could you define what is meant by ?business day? in the logistics approach.  (e.g. does a ?business day? refer to a 24 hour period work-day, not including weekends and holidays?) A:  For this effort a ?Business Day? is defined as any 24 hour day the United States Government is open for business. It does not include weekends, national holidays and other days when government operations are closed by direction of the President. 33. 	Q: What is the definition of ?unconditional warranty? desired for the V3 ? HTU?  A: This term has been revised to ??extended warranty? with the following definition:  The V3 extended warranty shall cover as a minimum all damage caused by the government.  The following exclusions exist: combat damage, damage from acts of nature, fire, f lood, crash, explosion, and unauthorized repair attempts by Army personnel or maintenance not in accordance with the Technical Manual.  39. 	Q: Please define RAID Level 10.  A: The proper reference is RAID 1+0.  ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS:  (paragraph numbers referenced in these questions and answers refer to SOW paragraph numbers in Draft Version 2 dated 16 September 2002) 42. 	Q: Why are the operational controls required to be on the rear for the 18? and 21? Color Flat Panel Displays?   A: The requirement that the 18?

This new requirement will be provided in the next draft SOW update.  67.	Q:  The projector power requirement shown in the bullet requirements in paragraph 3.1.4.13 is inconsistent with the requirements in 3.1.4.13.6.  A: Paragraph 3.1.4.13.6 will be revised to indicate operation from AC power 110/220 +- 10%, 50 to 60HZ +- 10%.  68.	Q:  Why require V2 cable for the projector since only V1 versions of the projector are to be procured? A: The requirement for V2 cables will be deleted in paragraph 3.1.4.13.9.  69.	Q:   There were several comments referring to power and signal cables indicating that it is unclear if cables were to be provided with the item or if they were to be procured as separate SLINS.  A: Paragraph 3.1.4.28, Cables, is being revised to indicate that all cables required for operation are to be supplied with the specific item.  For example the power cable and keyboard cable will be provided with each computer system.  The power cable and a ny interface cables (USB, serial, parallel, video) to allow a peripheral, (display, printer, etc.) to be connected to any of the specified computers for full operation will be included with the peripheral.  Sufficient space should be made in the appropriat e transit cases to accommodate these cables. In addition all cables will be assigned separate SLINs to permit individual cable purchases as spares.  70.	Q: Request clarification on whether system level features of a complete LSD solution integrated with the IBW are required, such as an operational transit case with cable I/O plate vs. a storage type transit case for the IBW, cable marking, cable retain ers, power strip, software, etc. A: The LSD will operate with the IBW.  Each item is being procured as V2 versions and each will have a separate transit case. There is no requirement that they be packaged together. The LSD will include all cables required to allow connection to the IBW.  The requirement will be revised to indicate that full operation of the LSD including connection to the IBW will be 30 minutes.  71. 	Q:  Is the requirement in paragraph 3.1.4.15.9 m. that the Flash memory cards be removed without opening the chassis and without using tools valid?  A: This requirement will be revised such that Flash Memory cards are user removable without using tools.  72.	Q:  Please clarify the requirement that three input cables and one output cable is to be included with each UPS and Power Converter Conditioner (PCC).  A: Each UPS and PCC is to include a separate input cable for AC operation and another for DC operation and a separate output cable.  Interface adapter connectors are acceptable to allow connection for various AC voltages (110 VAC and 220 VAC). However sepa rate cables are desired.  In addition, a software alert cable is required with each UPS to connect the UPS to the computer.  73.  	Q: Are the output connectors specified in paragraphs 3.1.4.16.11 and 3.1.4.17.9 to be used for both the 1000 watt and 2000 watt UPS and PCC?  A: The specified connectors are for 1000 watt usage.  Connectors for 2000 watt operation are to be deter mined.   74.	Q:  Is a 28 VDC input required for V1 UPS and PCC?  A: No, see question #46 above. 75.	Q:   Paragraph 3.1.4.22.8, 3.1.4.23.7 and 3.1.4.24.3 indicates that V2 cables are required yet the Large Format Printer Plotter, Lightweight Compact Color Inkjet Printer and Large Format Scanner are only procured in the V1 version. Please clarify.  A:  These paragraphs will be revised to indicate that only V1 cables are required.  76. 	Q: What are the differences between the CHS-3 and CHS-2 programs?  (I.e. what improvements/enhancements does this procurement seek to achieve?) A: The main differences between the CHS-3 and CHS-2 Programs are as follows: Term of Contract: 10 years contract for CHS-3 versus 5 years base contract plus option years for CHS-2 Contract Ceiling: higher ceiling for CHS-3 Type of Contract: Fixed price and IDIQ for CHS-3 versus fixed price and type C contract similar to IDIQ for CHS-2  Equipment Warranty: Minimum of 5 years warranty upon delivery for V1 and V2 equipment and extended warranty for V3 equipment for CHS-3 versus all equipment have a conditional warranty for the life of the contract. The CHS-3 Program objectives are to procure lower cost, state-of -the-art technologies, better reliability, and more variety of equipment. It is desirable to enhance the procurement procedure of CHS-3 equipment by adopting e-business practice for the on-li ne ordering guide and utilizing the web to streamline the procurement process, information exchange, and documentation deliveries.    The government intends to preserve the investment in software already developed and deployed made by the ABCS system developers and to be hosted on CHS-3 platforms with minimum or no breakage.

<DESC>THIS ITEM PREVIOUSLY POSTED UNDER SOLICITATION NUMBER F08635-03-R-0003.  The Precision Strike System Program Office (SPO), Air Armament Center, Eglin AFB, Florida is issuing a sources sought synopsis in response to the need for an aerial decoy, in relation to the Suppression of Enemy Air Defense (SEAD) mission.  The Precision Strike SPO plans to contract for the System Development and Demonstration (SDD) of a low cost, expendable, air launched vehicle that can present the radar signature and operational flight profile characteristics of a fighter/bomber/attack aircraft with sufficient fidelity to stimulate, deceive and decoy threat Integrated Air Defense System (IADS).  The aerial decoy is anticipated to be the first in the Miniature Air Launched Decoy (MALD) system family.  Provisions for spiral development of a stand-in jammer to counter early warning, acquisition, and fire control radar systems must be considered.  The short duration, expendable, low cost nature of the vehicle should be considered first in application of existing technology to the various vehicles.  It is desired that the physical appearance of all MALD family vehicles (decoy, jammer, etc.) appear to be identical to the casual observer.  As a threshold, the vehicle will be capable of being carried on and launched from a USAF B-52H bomber and F-16C/D fighter aircraft with objective carriage on the F-15C-E, B-1B, C-130, A/OA-10, B-2, F-22 and Joint Strike Fighter (JSF).  Any requirement for communication between the host aircraft and the MALD will be design dependent. A cost type contract for SDD is planned for award in the third quarter of FY03, and will be of approximately 60 months duration including 24 months of seamless verification .  The end product will be a low cost, producible, expendable decoy.   The development contract will contain an option for a 150 unit Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) phase prior to proceeding to a full rate production decision.  The acquisition strategy objective is to use, wherever possible, already developed and mature technologies and components in order to achieve a low cost and timely solution.  The most current MALD documents have been placed in the on line data exchange system - ATIMS for review and will be updated on a continuing basis.  Access to ATIMS is through the website http://atims.hill.af.mil.  A Draft Request For Proposal (DRFP) and subsequently a Request For Proposal (RFP) will be placed on the Government Website www.fedbizopps.gov.  The Program Office anticipates the release of the DRFP approximately 60 days from this announcement.  Interested firms are requested to submit information outlining their capabilities no later than 15 days after publication of this notice to Ms. Karen Schutt, AAC/WMGK, 102 W "D" Ave, Suite 300, Eglin AFB, FL 32542-6808 or by email at karen.schutt@eglin.af.mil.  Contractual questions should be addressed to Ms. Karen Schutt, Contract Specialist (850) 882-9514, ext 2243 or Mr. Statia McNeese, Contracting Officer, (850) 882-9514, ext. 2115.

<DESC>CONSTRUCTION CBD  244 Needy Road, Martinsburg, West Virginia
This requirement is for the procurement of a construction firm to provide all supervision, labor, materials and equipment necessary for the renovation of the 244 Needy Road Federal Office Building in Martinsburg, West Virginia. The existing facility is approximately 150,00 gross square feet on two floors (110,000 sf on the first floor and 40,000 sf at grade in the floor below).  The project is a multi-phased renovation of the building with Government occupancy throughout the entire renovation project. The work shall include, tenant improvements of the interior office space, HVAC, plumbing, and electrical upgrades. There will be limited exterior work, which will include the addition of windows and skylights
    	
The successful firm must have previous experience with projects of similar size and scope.  The Government has defined similar projects as:	(1)  Renovation of an occupied office building (Governmental, Courthouse or Institutional) of at least 5 million dollars or greater and at least 50,000 square feet of traditional bid/build contracts. Or (2)  New construction of office building (Governmental, Courthouse, or Institutional) of at least 5 million dollars or greater and at least 50,000 square feet of traditional bid/build contracts.

The contractor's personnel shall be required to obtain security clearances prior to working on this project.  The estimated cost of this project is between $5 million and $10 million.  The approximate duration of the contract is 18 months, and is expected to begin approximately October, 2002.  Award will be a firm fixed price contract, and the procurement method shall be a competitive negotiated Request for Proposal (RFP).  Source Selection Procedures, as identified in FAR PART 15.3, shall be utilized in the selection of a firm offering the best value to the Government in terms of price and technical merit, and whose performance is expected to best meet stated Government requirements.

The acquisition process shall consist of five phases: Phase 1- Receipt and evaluation of technical proposals utilizing the technical evaluation criteria; Phase 2 - Develop an advisory short list based on technical qualifications/proposals of the most technically qualified firms; Phase 3 - GSA shall advise each respondent that participates in Phase 1, in writing, as to whether it is likely or not to be a viable competitor in the next phase, based on the technical evaluation in Phase 1. GSA shall inform all respondents that not withstanding the advice provided by GSA in response to their submission in Phase 1, they may participate in Phase 3.  Phase 3- Receipt and evaluation of price proposals based on 100% construction documents, which shall be issued to offerors approximately August, 2002.  A competitive range shall be developed by the Contracting Officer.  Phase 4 - Oral presentations and interviews of firms in the competitive range may be required; and Phase 5 - Upon completion of negotiations, receive and evaluate final offers.  A formal selection of a firm shall be made that offers the greatest value to the Government based on a combination of technical evaluation and price factors.  Failure of offerors to submit a technical offer during Phase 1 will preclude them from further participation on this acquisition.  For this procurement, technical evaluation factors are more important than cost or price.  The Government has reserved the right to make an award at completion of Phase 4, without negotiations.  

The technical evaluation factors for the evaluation process are, in descending order of importance:  1. Past Performance on similar contracts; 2. Project Management and Staffing, and 3. Subcontracting.  For subcontracting, general contractors will be required to submit three subcontractors for each of the following trades: Mechanical, Electrical, and Skylights.  No other subcontractors shall be submitted at this time.  The RFP will contain more detail on the evaluation of the subcontractors in these trades. The NAICS code applicable to this project is 233320 with a size standard of $28.5 million.  This procurement is being conducted on an unrestricted basis in accordance with the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program.  This announcement also constitutes the synopsis of the pre-invitation notice.  Copies of the Solicitation (RFP) requesting technical proposals (no specifications or drawings) and the Document Security Notice to Prospective Bidders/Offerors shall be available through the World Wide Web the week of June 1, 2002 (www.fedbizopps.gov ).  Prior to issuance of the plans and specifications, contractors must comply with the Document Security Notice by completing it and returning it to the address below.

Proposals in response to this PRDA shall be submitted by 15 March 2002, 1500 hours Central Standard Time, to AFRL/MNK, Attn: Martin Kradlak, Bldg 13, 101 W. Eglin Blvd, Suite 337, Eglin AFB FL 32542-6810.  Responses must reference solicitation number MNK-PRDA-02-0001.  Proposals submitted must be in accordance with this announcement.  Since this is a PRDA, there will be no formal request for proposal or other solicitation regarding this announcement.  Offerors should be alert for any PRDA amendments that may be published.  This is an unrestricted solicitation.  Proposal receipt after the cutoff date and time specified herein shall be treated in accordance with restrictions of FAR 52.215-1(c)(3); a copy of this provision may be viewed at http://farsite.hill.af.mil/. Offerors may request a copy of the July 2000 AFRL publication entitled, "Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) and Program Research & Development Announcement (PRDA) Industry Guide."  This guide was specifically designed to assist offerors in understanding the BAA/PRDA proposal process.  The document may also be viewed and downloaded at http://www.wrs.afrl.af.mil/contract/Ind-gde.rtf. 
 
BACKGROUND:  In many cases denying access or inhibiting function is the only viable method for attacking certain targets.  In the past, unitary weapons have been utilized to deny access, but they could not be placed accurately at their intended target to accomplish their mission without the use of excessive numbers of weapons.  Existing guidance kits are capable of providing the required accuracy of emplacement for larger devices.  However, an influence fuze capable of being housed entirely within the aft 3" diameter fuze well is needed to completely fulfill the following requirements.
 
REQUIREMENTS:  The purpose of this solicitation is to obtain proposals to evaluate candidate technologies for the Hard Target Influence Fuze system, to design, fabricate and test a module capable of sensing and discriminating both military vehicles and clearing equipment from other vehicles, and to develop a preliminary design of the fuze system.  The system design must show a path to a tactical fuze that will reside within a single cylindrical package which fits within the 3" diameter rear fuze well of inventory weapons is combatable with existing guidance kits, and survives anticipated impact forces.
 
TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:  This program will last approximately 42 months, during which time, the offeror shall perform a requirements analysis, prepare a preliminary performance specification, investigate candidate component technologies for the vehicle sensing and discrimination module, develop a preliminary Hard Target Influence Fuze system design, and build Bread Board Technology Demonstrator (BBTD) evaluation units of their sensing module.  The BBTD evaluation units' performance shall be fully evaluated in contractor tests and these preliminary BBTD test results shall be delivered to the government within 30 days of test completion.  Upon approval of the government, the HTIFT BBTD evaluation units' performance shall then be evaluated by the government in a series of shock survivability tests and vehicle sensing and discrimination tests.  Upon completion of this testing, the contractor shall evaluate the results of the tests, refine the design, and build BBTD demonstration units based on the redesign.  Upon approval of the government, the HTIFT BBTD demonstration units' performance shall then be evaluated by the government in a series of shock survivability tests and vehicle sensing and discrimination tests.  A final technical report covering the component technology investigation, sensor module design, construction, contractor testing, and performance evaluation of the BBTD evaluation and demonstration units and the preliminary design and physical model of the fuze system shall be delivered to the government.  The proposed HTIFT vehicle-sensing module must meet the following requirements:
Detection and discrimination of military vehicles and large clearing equipment from other vehicles and the activation of the weapon at the point of closest approach within the weapon's lethal range.
Maximized constant surveillance duration.
Survivability of the shock loads associated with MK-82, MK-83, MK-84, and BLU-109 warheads (with inventory guidance kits) impacting targets ranging from soft soil to granite.
 
The proposed preliminary fuze design must meet the following requirements:
The potential to develop an influence fuze unit which will fit entirely within the 3" diameter rear fuze well of standard inventory weapons, utilizing existing guidance kits.
The potential to power this fuze unit for the maximized surveillance duration using a power source which fits entirely within the fuze unit.
Expected survivability of the shock associated with MK-82, MK-83, MK-84, and BLU-109 warheads (with inventory guidance kits) impacting targets ranging from soft soil to granite.
Show a path to a tactical fuze.
Meet the requirements of Presidential Decision Directive (PDD) 64 (http://www.fas.org/irp/offdocs/pdd-64.htm).
 
DELIVERABLE ITEMS: The following deliverable data items shall be proposed:
 
-	Monthly Reports
-	BBTD evaluation units
-	BBTD Demonstration Units
-	Final Report
-	Preliminary Fuze Design Model
 
REVIEWS:  The contractors shall plan, prepare for, and conduct program reviews at 6 month intervals throughout the program.  A Kickoff Meeting shall be held at the contractor's facility and a Final Review shall be held at Eglin AFB, FL.  The remainder of the reviews will be held alternately at the contractors' facilities and at Eglin AFB, FL.
 
SECURITY REQUIREMENTS:  Performing this research will require the contractor to have access to US Government classified information at the SECRET level. Contact Martin Kradlak, AFRL/MNK, for copy of DD Form 254.
 
OTHER SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS/CONSIDERATIONS:
 
	NONE

<SUBJECT>58--Airborne Joint Tactical Radio System
<SOLNBR>R459
<CONTACT>Maryann Watson maryann.watson@hanscom.af.mil
<DESC>The Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS) Airborne Cluster Program is part of a broader DoD JTRS initiative.  The Joint Tactical Radio System is the DoD family of common, software-defined radios that will form the foundation of wireless communications in support of Joint Vision 2010/Joint Vision 2020.  JTRS will introduce new capabilities to the warfighter and will eventually replace existing tactical radios through the Services’ migration plans.  The program employs a Software Communications Architecture (SCA) to allow common software waveform applications to be implemented across the family of radios. <br><br> Per the JTRS Operational Requirements Document (ORD), the JTRS family consists of the Airborne, Maritime/Fixed Station, and Ground (vehicle, manpack, and handheld) domains. To reduce overlapping RDT&E efforts and capitalize on DOD investment, Service requirements for JTRS are grouped into common “Clusters” based on similarity of requirements and required fielding schedules. As the Lead Service for the Airborne JTRS, the Air Force will acquire, test, and field Airborne Joint Tactical Radio (JTR) Sets for all Services.   <br><br> The objectives of the JTRS Airborne Cluster program in ESC/DIGR are:  <br><br> 1)	Design a family of software-reprogrammable, multi-band/multi-mode airborne radios meeting user’s needs as defined in the JTRS ORD, as well as platform-specific needs. <br><br> 2)	Leverage the JTRS Airborne program to achieve the vision for an airborne communications network, as an extension of the Global Information Grid (GIG).  JTRS Airborne can provide an airborne communications system that supports network-centric joint and combined operations, including use of the new Wideband Network Waveform (WNW) being developed by the JTRS Joint Program Office.   <br><br> The JTRS Airborne Cluster development program has two Phases.  <br><br> Phase 1 is a full and open competition, focusing on 1) defining an airborne network architecture and attributes that can be used to derive platform integration requirements for JTRS; 2) an evolutionary acquisition model to provide airborne JTRS to fulfill near term legacy system replacement requirements, transitional requirements for a gateway capability, as well as requirements for full networkability; 3) a packaging concept for a family of cost-effective, flexible radio modules to accommodate platform constraints to the maximum extent practical. The Government will award multiple requirements definition contracts in this phase. Phase 1A results (7 mos. after award)  will be used to finalize the statement of objectives and performance requirements document for the Phase 2 solicitation.  Phase 1B results (12 mos. after award) will feed directly into the front end of Phase 2, kick-starting the effort to allow a more efficient Phase 2 development schedule. <br><br> Phase 2 is the full and open competition for the system development, demonstration, and options for low rate initial production for JTRS Airborne Radio Systems.  Networking attributes and platform constraints identified in Phase 1, as well as the initial concepts for a family of flexible, cost-effective radio modules to supply the Airborne domain, will feed directly into the detailed design and demonstration efforts of Phase 2.

The purpose of Project is to develop, fabricate, and commission by July 2007 a Compact Stellerator.  In preparation for fabrication of critical components, scheduled to begin in late calendar year 2003, manufacturing development activities, which includes fabrication of a prototype coil winding form, are now being addressed.  PPPL is seeking firms to compete on a best value basis for two Subcontracts to be awarded for manufacturing development activities for modular coil winding forms, and fabrication of one prototype winding form.  The modular coil winding forms will be cast from stainless steel (or other PPPL accepted austenitic casting alloys with equivalent properties) heat-treated and machined.  The weight of each form, after machining, is about 5,000 lbs.  The forms will define the geometry of the modular coils and serve as their primary support structure.  The use of a manufacturing development / prototype fabrication Subcontracts selected because of the complexity of the coil winding form shapes (the NCSX will require 18 coil winding forms, six each of three different shapes), strict tolerances and the requirement for low permeability.  Statements of interest should be sent to Larry L. Sutton, e-mail lsutton@pppl.gov.

B. REQUIREMENTS: (1) TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: (a) Introduction: Advanced spacecraft antenna technologies form an integral element of an overall MILSATCOM communications system.  Current protected MILSATCOM systems incorporate high gain nulling antennas that provide adaptive spatial discrimination on the uplink (44 GHz) and a single downlink (20 GHz).  Transformational Communications (TC) studies have shown that future SATCOM systems will need to support higher data rates to existing terminal types as well as moderate data rates (T1) to a large number of small COTM terminals.  Antenna technologies that are capable of producing large numbers of high gain, steerable, spot-beams that provide active nulling and facilitate frequency reuse are key enablers to the TC vision.  (b) PRDA Objectives: The purpose of this PRDA is to award up to three research and development contracts on a range of transformational communication antenna technology alternatives. These contracts will have a 6-month period of performance. The effort will be focused on trade studies and analyses to identify antenna technologies for cost-effective support to small arbitrarily distributed medium data rate (~T1) users such as COTM terminals (1'- 2') as well as higher rates to existing terminals. The study should address the following high-level objectives: (i) Perform system studies and analyses to achieve a gross assessment of desirable antenna performance goals. From a systems perspective, including considerations of anticipated ground terminal capabilities and host platform limitations, determine antenna performance characteristics, such as desired beam sizes and shapes, numbers of beams, spatial separation of beams, anti-jam performance, beam adaptability. Evaluate systems constraints, such as antenna size, mass and cost. (ii) Develop conceptual designs and perform trade analyses for multi-beam antennas. Identify suitable design concepts including, but not limited to, phased array, array fed reflectors, and hopped multi-beam antennas. Consider alternative antenna subsystem architectures such as optical processing technology for improved performance and potential weight reduction.  Identify risk areas and required risk reduction efforts or technology development.  (iii) Provide recommendations and key performance metrics for critical technology development and prioritize these needs for adaptive multi-beam Extremely High Frequency (EHF) antenna capability. (iv) Identify technology development and prototyping efforts needed to retire risks of selected technologies and design concepts to acceptable levels for inclusion in near-term TC program developments.  Include cost and schedule estimates, risk management approaches, and verification and validation test plans. Develop conceptual designs of prototype (e.g. breadboard/brassboard) hardware and test equipment.  (2) DELIVERABLE ITEMS: The following items are required contract deliverables at the end of the 6 month period of performance: (i) a systems requirements allocation and antenna performance goals report, (ii) a description and associated design characteristics of the recommended antenna system(s), (iii) description of all simulation analyses performed, (iv) a technology and prototype risk-reduction plan with schedule, cost estimates and a work breakdown structure to take these technologies to Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 6, (v) trade studies of anti-jam (AJ) protection versus complexity/cost, (vi) draft performance specifications of both the antenna system concept and prototype experiment and (vii) technical interchange meetings (one day) (TIMs) with the Government management team(s) every month. Contractor recommendations on the most cost effective method of holding these technical interchange meetings will be solicited.  TIMs may consist of, but are not limited to, teleconferencing, video teleconferencing and meetings held at contractor and/or Government locations. Briefing packages and similar presentational materials associated with these meetings are deliverables to the Government.  Offerors may provide inputs at two levels: (1) proprietary and (2) non-proprietary with specific and clearly marked designations of the proprietary areas.   The final presentations must be non-proprietary and must contain complete final descriptions in the form of analyses, simulation analyses, solutions, designs and techniques and thus must not contain proprietary information. Deliverable items (i), (iii), (v), and (vi) will be treated as non-proprietary and cannot contain any information the contractor does not want included in future government-generated technology or requirements documentation provided to the TC community.  Reports from each TIM (Microsoft Word document or annotated PowerPoint document) will be due within 3 business days of the TIM and will be delivered electronically to the Technical POC listed below. (3) SECURITY REQUIREMENTS: (a) This acquisition will require access to classified material. Each PRDA contract will include a Contract Security Classification Specification (DD Form 254). Work performed under this acquisition may be classified up to and including the DoD SECRET level. (b) Notice to Foreign-Owned Firms:  Contracts will be awarded only to US companies. Foreign teaming, licensing, or subcontracting is not allowed. Proposals must be submitted with information no higher then SECRET classification. If an Offeror's proposal contains classified material it must be delivered/transmitted via normal security procedures IAW NISPOM guidance to the address and point of contact indicated above in Section A.  (4) GOVERNMENT BUDGET: The Government's estimated budget of $1.6M for this PRDA effort may be divided between three contracts. Contracts may be awarded for unequal amounts.

B. REQUIREMENTS: (1) TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: (a) Introduction:  The DoD is transitioning to force structures that increasingly rely upon information systems and a network based communications infrastructure characterized by ubiquitous connectivity across similar and disparate elements of US and Coalition forces.  This consequently results in a requirement for efficient, reliable, and timely communications under a wide range of operational scenarios.  A Transformational Communications (TC) architecture that leverages commercial, DoD, and national Satellite Communications (SATCOM) programs is currently being developed to address these emerging needs.  The required network-centric orientation of future military satellite communications (MILSATCOM) dictates the development of robust, efficient, packet and circuit switched Radio Frequency (RF) links to service the diverse applications present in the overall user community.  One of the critical elements needed to achieve this capability is a set of techniques that supports the efficient use/re-use of the available spectrum (i.e. allocated bandwidth) and satellite resources (e.g. apertures, on-board processors, amplifiers).  One such technique is dynamic monitoring and control of link parameters. The concept of demand assigned multiple-access (DAMA) provides a generic framework in which resource sharing can be applied.  In its greatest generality, DAMA allows the link parameters to be dynamically adapted to the environment (weather/jamming) and the user demand (traffic load).  Tactical MILSATCOM systems are typically designed to operate under the assumption that links are experiencing both weather and jamming.  By adapting the link parameters to the actual situation at hand, the total impact of weather and jamming on the system can be potentially reduced, while still providing assured access to those in severe conditions and dramatically increasing throughput or performance for those in benign conditions.  This type of operation may significantly increase total throughput available to the user community and is slated for early deployment in future TC satellite and terminal programs.  Generally, DAMA has been used in both military and commercial systems. These prior uses were in benign, homogeneous, and static communications environments.  In applying DAMA dynamic resource allocation concepts to more general MILSATCOM applications, a number of questions and challenges arise.  Chief among these is the dynamic and time-varying nature of the links themselves, due to factors such as intentional or unintentional interference, weather effects at SHF/Ka/EHF frequencies, and Communication-on-the-Move (COTM) link shadowing or antenna pointing errors.  Furthermore, the development of algorithms governing resource allocation becomes a significant challenge when incorporating network functions such as Quality of Service (QoS), traffic prioritization and pre-emption. (b) PRDA Objectives:  The purpose of this PRDA is to select up to three contractors to conduct research and development on dynamic bandwidth and resource allocation techniques for tactical MILSATCOM for a 9-month period of performance.  The study should address the following high-level topic areas and objectives: (i) Throughput advantages of dynamic bandwidth/resource allocation: Evaluate system capacities for up and downlink communications links with and without use of dynamic resource allocation.  The focus of the study will be on processing satellites with 44GHz uplink, 20GHz downlink although other frequency bands and satellite types may also be considered. Baseline SATCOM designs assume an allowance for rain losses on the uplink and on the downlink.  When actual rain losses are less than the allocated amount for individual ground terminals, the extra link margin can be translated into additional system resources which can be dynamically reallocated to this or other (higher priority) users.  The offeror shall identify link and satellite resources that can be efficiently reused or shared between multiple communications links on a dynamic and automatic basis and assess benefits derived from each controllable resource.  This evaluation should determine capacities under cases of perfect and imperfect link state knowledge and resource control and result in target specifications for link measurement accuracy.  At a minimum, these analyses should determine potential capacity increases or improvements in assured connectivity through the dynamic exploitation of weather and jamming margins.  The offeror may evaluate the performance as a function of the assumed baseline rain margins.  (ii) Resource allocation approaches: Investigate techniques, algorithms, and/or protocols necessary to direct and control resource allocation across space and ground segments.  This effort should specifically address issues of prioritization and pre-emption under scenarios of under and overabundant resources (e.g., amount of available on-board capability, available ground terminal processing, available allocated bandwidth).  At a minimum, the communications scenario from item (i) above shall apply.  Additional areas of interest include resource allocation under an end-to-end networking scenario, level of state knowledge of each individual link in the network needed to perform resource allocation, propagation of link state information, and centralized vs. de-centralized control. (iii) Implementation issues and architectures: Investigate satellite and ground payload/terminal/control modifications required to implement dynamic resource control.  Assess the ability of cryptographic devices to support dynamic bandwidth concepts.  Assess interaction between dynamic bandwidth concepts and terrestrial transport layer protocols (e.g., Transmission Control Protocol Performance Enhancing Proxies).  Investigate payload, terminal, and control architectures that will support/exploit dynamic resource allocation, optimizing the use of bandwidth for improved automated end-to-end system performance.  Analysis shall include means of ensuring a robust end-to-end link when the ends are experiencing substantially different link conditions.  Identify and assess system failure modes and conditions that could impact the dynamic bandwidth/resource allocation improvements. (iv) Link state knowledge measurement and dissemination:  Identify and evaluate techniques to perform link state measurement for up and downlinks under conditions of weather impairment and jamming.  Measurement accuracy objectives should be consistent with results from item (i) above.  Objective waveforms should include, at a minimum, the Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) Waveform (XDR) signal.

<DESC>BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT.   

The National Institute of Standards and Technology is soliciting proposals on Next Generation Ladar for Driving Unmanned Ground Vehicles.Based on the experience gained in support of the Army Research Lab (ARL) Demo III Unmanned Ground Vehicle program over the past four years, the Intelligent Systems Division at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has identified the need for high performance Ladar sensors for autonomous on and off-road driving. These sensors will be mounted on UGVs and are needed to provide reliable and robust obstacle/object detection and terrain feature information. The sensors will provide information about the environment surrounding the vehicle sufficient to enable the vehicle to drive autonomously. Current Ladar sensors used in UGV research have proven to have limitations in performance, are large in size and are expensive.  Phase I of this solicitation is for the design of an Engineering Prototype to advance the Ladar range imaging component/subsystem technologies to meet the needs for UGVs. Phase II will support prototype development.

The Government envisions the requirement for two types of Ladar range imaging sensors for this type of application, one having a wide field-of-view (40 X 90 deg.) with a resolution of about .25 degrees or better per pixel and the second, a foveal Ladar having a narrow field-of-view of approximately 1/10th of the wide field-of-view with a resolution of about .05 degrees or better per pixel. Inter-pixel spacing of no more than 10% of the specified spatial resolution is anticipated. The intent is to make the foveal Ladar steerable to any position within the field-of-view of the wide angle Ladar. Both types of Ladar sensors shall have a range resolution of about 5 cm in range, shall be able to detect the ground plane out to a distance of at least 40 meters and vertical surfaces out to a range of at least 100 meters. 10 Hz frame rates or better are expected. Both Ladars must be eye safe and shall be provided with capability to penetrate dust, fog, grass and light foliage (either by sensing multiple returns or looking for the last return) and be able to operate in full sunlight conditions. The criterion for scoring the proposed designs are provided below.

Two Phases are planned for this solicitation.  Phase I is intended to obtain designs.  Phase II may proceed to fund a prototype(s).   In Phase I, in response to this solicitation, responders are to submit proposals describing their intended design concept and their capabilities to perform the design.  Full designs are not sought at this point, however, the concept must be capable of leading to a design (and possibly a prototype) that can address the technical specifications provided below.  The concept description must include relevant analytical explanation and/or experimental data required to support the concept.  The concept description must make clear the principals of operation, attest to the scientific validity of the approach, and show how the proposed concept shall support the specifications.  These proposals shall be evaluated and one or more responders may be funded to develop a full design for their concept(s).  In Phase II, the completed designs shall be evaluated, and an award or awards may be made to developers of selected designs to build a prototype(s) according to the selected design(s).

The following describes the Phase I and Phase II components of this solicitation in more detail:

Phase I: Detailed concept design for Wide FOV Ladar, Narrow (foveal) Ladar or for the combination of both.
  	Concept Proposal:
o Proposals for the development of designs shall be reviewed and scored.
o As many as four awards to develop and provide designs may be given depending on proposal quality and available funding.
Design:
o Award funding level will be at least $50K for each award to provide a design. Higher award amounts are possible and will be based on "best value" to the Government.
o Within three months of an award, the offeror shall provide a detailed design for NIST to review.
o A budget and schedule plan (including when a prototype will be available for testing) shall be provided with the design.
o As part of the design, the offeror shall identify proposed computer interfaces necessary to interact with the sensor or sensor platform components, and describe the proposed software organization and proposed algorithms. Capability to be synchronized with external timing source shall also be supported by the design.

Evaluation of Phase I
The criteria and weights to be used for evaluation of proposals to develop a design will be:
1.	Soundness, technical merit, and innovation (Maximum 40 points)
In addition to the general technical soundness of the proposed concept, technical merit includes the likelihood that the proposed concept can lead to a design (and possibly eventual prototype) that can score well with respect to the specifications given below.
2.	Qualifications of the proposed technical staff to perform proposed conceptual design (Maximum 30 points)
Includes evaluation of experience with Ladar systems and similar or related system design experience, knowledge of Ladar measurement and performance issues, and knowledge of current approaches.
3.	Potential for use in military UGV applications and product development          (Maximum 30 points)
Degree to which concept can be applicable to unmanned ground vehicle systems.  Proposer shall show knowledge of technical issues associated with this application domain, and indicate how they will be addressed.


The following specifications define the performance capabilities desired in the next generation Ladar systems being sought.  In Phase I, the submitted design concepts will be evaluated  according to the criteria above, which includes the likelihood that the proposed concept can lead to a design (and possibly eventual prototype) that can score well with respect to these specifications.    In Phase II, these specifications and the associated points shown, will be used to score full designs as the means to evaluate the full designs for possible awards to build a prototype(s).  

Ladar Specifications (and Phase II Points):

The first two items are for the Wide FOV Ladar. The next two are for the Narrow FOV Ladar.  The Wide FOV and Narrow FOV designs will be scored separately, whether they are for part of a single, combined system or are for independent Wide FOV and Narrow FOV systems.

				Vertical FOV        Points 	Horizontal FOV      Points
Wide Field-of-view Ladar 	   40 deg		4	   90 deg		4
				< 40 but not < 30 deg	3	< 90 but not < 60 deg	3				       		< 30 deg		0	< 60 deg		0
				> 40 deg		5	> 90 deg		5

Spatial pixel resolution	.25 - <.3 deg 				12		
				< .25 deg				15		 
				.3 - .5 deg 				8		
				> .5 deg				0		

Narrow (foveal) FOV Ladar:	If a design for a foveal Ladar is offered, the proposed FOV will be rated on technical merit in combination with the proposed spatial resolution. A maximum of 10 points is possible. It is expected that the FOV shall not be less than 4 X 4 deg. or larger than 9 X 9 deg.

Narrow FOV Ladar                                                                        Points
Spatial pixel resolution	.05 - <.06 deg.				12
				< .05 deg				15
				.06 - .1 deg				8
				> .1 deg				0
The following specifications are common to either the Wide FOV or Narrow FOV Ladar
							
Range resolution		5 - 10 cm				3
(over min. to max. 		> 10 cm				0
measurement range)		< 5 cm					5

Maximum possible score of each type of Ladar for technical specifications:	110

Other Design Considerations:

Acceptable designs will be determined through evaluation of the above criteria.   Among the acceptable designs, additional points are available to those designs that may optionally address the following:  
Since the Ladars sought are engineering prototypes, requirements on size, weight, power, shock and vibration, protection from rain/humidity and temperature range of operation are not critical. However, since the ultimate intent is for vehicle-based systems, up to 10 additional points will be awarded for proposed designs according to their feasibility of implementation on Demo III XUV type (2500 - 3000 lb.) vehicles, where size, weight, power, shock and vibration, protection from rain/humidity and temperature range of operation will be important. It is anticipated that the size of the production prototypes for that purpose will need to be smaller than a cylinder (20 - 25 cm. high and about 12 cm. across)

If a design for a foveal pan/tilt stage is offered (in addition to the Ladar imager), up to 10 additional points will be awarded according to its technical merit. Servos in the stage shall be capable of at least 3 saccades (point to point moves) per second. Designs for image stabilization must also be provided.

Phase II: Engineering Prototype Development

The designs developed under Phase I award(s) will be evaluated according to the specifications and points above.  Based on the quality of the designs and availability of funding, NIST will consider funding one or more contracts to build a prototype Wide FOV Ladar, a Narrow (foveal) Ladar or a combination of both. We anticipate making Phase II award selections before the end of the calendar year.  For any prototype that is developed, the offeror shall fully describe interfaces necessary to interact with the sensor platform components, and provide software required to control components. Capability to be synchronized with external timing source shall also be provided.

<DESC>The Air Armament Center (AAC) Sensor Fuzed Weapon (SFW) Program  Office, AAC/YH, plans to contract with Alliant TechSystems (ATK)  for the design of an electronic timer which replaces a mechanical timer in the fuze for the Tactical Munition Dispenser (TMD) section of the SFW system. The fuze is currently manufactured by ATK, and a previous Value Engineering Change Proposal (VECP) 0026-E-0160 has been submitted which describes the detailed methodology that will be used to replace the mechanical timer.  The new electronic timer must be physically and functionally interchangeable with the current production fuze, improve performance by reducing timing tolerances, enhance producibility and testablility, and provide cost savings when compared with the present approach.  The new timer must operate from the system battery and cannot consume any power over and above the present combination of mechanical elements and electronic circuitry.  The new electronic assembly must interface with the current set of mechanical elements including piston actuators, explosive bolts, and detonators. The new circuitry must be laid out on the printed circuit board used in the current fuze section of the TMD.  The effort is to be accomplished in two phases. Phase 1 is a design and prototype hardware effort, and phase 2 (a contract option) is to be the qualification and implementation phase.  The scope of the design phase of the effort shall be the non-recurring development work required to update the previously submitted VECP fuze design to current electronic technology and to provide prototype hardware. Phase 2 will be the fabrication, prove out, and qualification of hardware effort.  The contractor shall identify tasks to be accomplished along with cost and schedule for each phase of the effort. The Contractor shall also provide estimated unit cost of the redesigned fuze.  It is anticipated that only one source, Alliant TechSystems, Janesville, WI, Developer of the fuze VECP can satisfy the minimum needs for this unique weapon system.  This contractual action is expected to be executed using ?Other than Full and Open Competition? procedures pursuant to FAR 6.032-1(a)(2)(ii).  This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only, does not constitute a solicitation for bid or proposals and is not to be construed as a commitment by the government.  Direct all communications concerning this acquisition to Vicki Keider at (850) 882-3416, extension 3162.  See Numbered Notes 22 and 26.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>NA We wish to thank industry for comments and questions at Industry Day and via e-mail.  Since many questions are similar we have combined questions/comments where possible.    Below is the continuing set of responses to your questions if you have further que stions or comments please, let us know. It must be noted that the information provided here is only as a clarification and in response to your questions and comments; if any conflict exists with the information presented here and the formal RFP and SOW the  formal RFP and SOW will take precedence. Additional postings will follow as the CHS-3 technical team deliberates your questions.  Cases where we indicate that a SOW clarification is being made will be reflected in a future Draft SOW.   The numbering of th ese questions continues with the questions from industry day previously posted.  Several members of the government CHS-3 team who attended Industry Day have received e-mails containing information marketing various products.  The Industry Day attendee list was provided as a means of fostering intra industry cooperation and partnering.  It was not provided to give industry a list of CHS-3 team members as a potential list for marketing contract.  Due to the competitive nature of this effort, government team members will not consider this information.  A formal market survey has already be en conducted.  FOLLOW UP TO INDUSTRY DAY QUESTIONS:  31. 	Q: Could you define what is meant by ?business day? in the logistics approach.  (e.g. does a ?business day? refer to a 24 hour period work-day, not including weekends and holidays?) A:  For this effort a ?Business Day? is defined as any 24 hour day the United States Government is open for business. It does not include weekends, national holidays and other days when government operations are closed by direction of the President. 33. 	Q: What is the definition of ?unconditional warranty? desired for the V3 ? HTU?  A: This term has been revised to ??extended warranty? with the following definition:  The V3 extended warranty shall cover as a minimum all damage caused by the government.  The following exclusions exist: combat damage, damage from acts of nature, fire, f lood, crash, explosion, and unauthorized repair attempts by Army personnel or maintenance not in accordance with the Technical Manual.  39. 	Q: Please define RAID Level 10.  A: The proper reference is RAID 1+0.  ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS:  (paragraph numbers referenced in these questions and answers refer to SOW paragraph numbers in Draft Version 2 dated 16 September 2002) 42.

<DESC>NA 124. 	Q:   Does the Army have data rights to above CHS-2 information? Also, to what extent will this data be made available for reuse to insure interoperability and to minimize impact on existing programs?  A: Since the CHS-2 program is based on a COTS/NDI approach, detailed technical data is not available.  The technical requirements in the SOW have been developed to allow industry to propose new and innovative solutions that satisfy these requirements.  It is however, the government?s intent to preserve the existing investment in software that has been developed by the Army Battle Command Systems (ABCS) to operate on CHS-2 equipments and it is desired that this existing software be ported to CHS-3 equipments  with minimum or no breakage.   125. 	Q:  Do you plan to allow orders of qualified CHS-3 equipments prior to the completion of the CHS-2 contract?  A: Orders will be allowed to be placed on the CHS-3 contract immediately upon award.  It is expected that it will take some time to complete the required CHS-3 testing and some customers may order from the CHS-2 contract until CHS-3 items pass all test req uirements.  126. 	Q:  Realizing that the current SOW is still in draft to what extent does the government expect changes prior to the release of the formal RFP?  A: As with any draft SOW changes are inevitable.   127. 	Q:  Will the Army define and/or supply a standard set of performance benchmarks and interoperability tests and if so, will they be available with the release of the RFP?  A: Based on the intention to procure COTS and enhanced NDI equipments we have stated our requirements in performance base specification terms and our requirements are currently found in the draft SOW already released.  The test requirements are currently d efined in section 3.9 of the SOW.   128. 	Q: Is it acceptable for industry to partner with Tobyhanna Army Depot and effectively subcontract the management and staffing of the Forward Repair Centers (FRC) to Tobyhanna? A: Yes. In fact, Tobyhanna currently has these capabilities in a variety of CONUS and OCONUS locations.  129. 	Q: The SOW indicates that CISCO routers or equivalent are required.  Will the government accept routers and switches from other vendors?  A: Yes. However, the bidder must completely explain how the proposed alternate is equivalent to specified CISCO equipments and how it is compatible with the Army-JTA and DII-COE-6 and should propose the full suite of network routers, switches and associate d software from the same vendor.  130. 	Q: Does the CHS-3 draft SOW require that all specified hardware products be developed and demonstrable prior to proposal submittal? A: V1 products are commercial off the shelf.  There is no requirement for a demonstration prior to proposal submittal. V2 and V3 hardware will take some period of time for development after award and that time is to be included in the proposed Integrated M aster Schedule.  Delivery dates based on the successful proposal will be included in the initial delivery orders.  131	Q: Is it the government?s intent that NRE and First Article Testing for V2 and V3 units be separately funded or are these costs to be incorporated into the unit prices of the hardware items on a prorated basis?  A:  The government intends to fund all non-recurring charges including NRE, FAT, and non-recurring documentation as separate contract line items.  These costs are not to be prorated across the unit hardware costs.  132. 	Q: Does the IBW drive into the individual LSD modules directly? (and paragraph 3.1.4.14.3 therefore describes the functionality of the IBW) or will some additional electronic device be connected between the IBW and LSD?  A: The IBW will connect directly to the LSD using the multi-port video cards in the IBW.  133. 	Q: Due to the LSD module grout requirement controls and indicators for the 18? CFPD are required on the rear.  Why is the same requirement for the 21? CFPD?  A: See question 42 above.  134. 	Q: Why is thanagement be part of the SOW? A:  All software products are to be delivered with licenses. Software license is not tied to a particular machine. Licenses management will be part of the contract. 92. 	Q: Will software updates to be downloaded from the network or distributed via CD?  A:  Both. Depending on customer needs.  93. 	Q: Is hardware/operating system change isolation middleware part of this procurement? A:  No. 94. 	Q: Is there a table of equipment for software for each organization level in the Army?  How will CHS-3 play into that table at each level of organization?   A:  Both questions are not applicable to this program. 95. 	Q: What are your expectations regarding interoperability and backward compatibility with existing applications?  A:  It is the goal of the CHS-3 Program to achieve backward compatibility with the existing application to the maximum extent possible. The SOW defines hardware requirements intended to maximize the portability of the existing CHS-2 mission software (much of which is Solaris based) to CHS-3 products with minimum or no breakage. It is also a goal of the CHS-3 Program to achieve interoperability between fielded mission software running on CHS-2 and fielded mission software running on CHS-3 equipment.  96. 	Q: How are capability enhancements released?  (i.e. will a block releases approach be used?) A:   Block release approach is not applicable to this program. Upgrades and new equipment will be accomplished through the engineering change proposals (ECP) process. 97. 	Q: Describe historic and planned testing requirements.  At what level is testing required and under what circumstances is testing initiated? A:  All V2 and V3 items will be subject to FAT, environmental tests, and reliability tests. Existing test data and analysis can be used if acceptable to the Government. 98. 	Q: Is there a required qualification methodology specified on new products and technology refreshments? A:  Yes, First Article Testing requirements are defined in Section 3.9.  99. 	Q: How, if at all, do you see any test, evaluation and validation program changing or evolving? A: See answers above. 100. 	Q: Would it be possible to provide a brief discussion on the projected CHS-3 change management approach? A: Upgrades and new technology will be introduced through the ECP process on an as required basis. Historically there have been on the average 40 changes per month for the CHS-2 Program. 101. 	Q: What is the technology refresh philosophy for this program?  How do you see this philosophy varying, if at all, within product categories? A: See above answers.   102. 	Q: At what rate do you anticipate deployment of new technology across the Army? A: CHS-3 products are acquired by responsible PMs for system development and fielding. New technologies will be acquired as they become available to meet the user?s need. 103. 	Q: Who determines when new or enhanced capabilities are required and added to the contract?  A: See above answer.  104. 	Q: Who is authorized to initiate an engineering change order? A: Either the Government or the contractor can initiate the ECP.  105. Q: Should the cost of interoperability testing and integration testing be included in the ECP multiplier? A: The ECP multiplier is being deleted.  106. 	Q: In order for any bidder to provide the best value, we feel the historical demand/trend data will be important to the process.  To what extent will you be able to provide bidders access to the level of data?   A: It is not the Government?s intent to provide detailedhistorical/trend data on the CHS-2 Program. 107. 	Q: What is the average yearly $ value of purchases against this contract?   A: Approximately $160 Million per year based on historical CHS-2 data and customer projections.  108. 	Q: What input does the end user community have in requesting new items?  Who are the present e nd users for CHS-2?    Who are the projected User programs for CHS-3?  A: The CHS-3 Program provides items to Project Managers who integrate them into their systems. There is no direct end user involvement with the CHS-3 Program. The PEO C3T PMs are the majority of the CHS-2 Program customers. CHS-3 Program projected users in clude the CHS-2 customers and other Army, Joint and Government Agencies. 109. 	Q: Will the army identify a select organization for the contractor to do beta test and evaluation of products prior to field deployment?  Will we have an opportunity to talk to them one-on-one similar to this prior to the RFP being published?    A: No to both questions.  110. 	Q: What is maintenance philosophy?  How is service provided today?   Will a central depot be provided?  Is service provided by a contractor or vendor? A: A three level maintenance/supply structure (unit level, Direct Support (DS), contractor depot), with a contractor warranty program will be utilized. The user will fault isolate systems to the faulty Line Replaceable Unit (LRU) utilizing maintenance and diagnostic software and exchange the faulty LRU with a spare from the Direct Support Supply Activity (DSSA) Authorized Stockage List (ASL). The DSSA will then turn the faulty LRU into Forward Repair Center (FRC) for repair and replacement. The warranty wil l cover a minimum five years period from the date of delivery to the Fielding Product Manager. The contractor shall repair or replace the failed LRUs coved under warranty within 3 business days, two business days desired. The contractor will provide a mini mum of four FRC, a minimum of three within CONUS and one in Germany. The contractor shall maintain a toll free Hotline number and web site in response to CONUS and OCONUS maintenance service or technical assistance calls.   The contractor is strongly encou raged to form a partnership with a DoD Repair Depot with goal of developing an organic support capability for CHS-3 out of warranty hardware repair and post contractor support.   111. 	Q: Who provides asset management and configuration management? A: In all cases, the Contractor will perform asset and configuration management functions with the Government exercising management approval of all actions. 112. 	Q: Are there ILS tasks other than warranty that need to be built into unit HW item pricing? A: All ILS tasks, identified in the SOW with the exception of TASS, will be part of the HW item price.  113. 	Q: (a) Briefly describe the objectives and composition of the Technical Assistance and Support Services contract.  (i.e. what is the role or purpose of TASS?)  (b) What Systems Engineering and System Integration tasks would typically be funded via T& M versus being considered part of the basic contract?  (c) What types of tasks will be contracted? A:  The contract will also include a Time and Materials (T&M) portion for Technical Assistance and Support Services (TASS). This assistance will include, but not be limited to, analysis of CHS-3 hardware and software requirements, integration of the hardwa re and software into new or existing systems, ?out of warranty repairs? (including other than fair wear and tear), and support for the materiel fielding of assembled systems. 114. 	Q: Warranty discussions ? What constitutes warranty coverage?  What specifically is not covered? A:  For V1/ V2 items, warranty is for a minimum of 5 years and covers failures from normal wear and tear and inherent defects. For V1/V2 items, what is not covered is other than fair wear and tear. For the V3 item, the requirement is for an extended condit ional warranty for a minimum of 5 years (see question 33 above).  Longer warranty periods are desired.  115.	Q: When will the draft Terms and Conditions be available?  Section L & M?  A:  Draft sections L and M have already been posted, however;  it is anticipated that  sections L and M will be revised.  116. 	Q: What is the anticipated acquisition schedu le? A: The acquisition schedule is being revised to reflect at least a 30 day slip to the RFP date. 117. 	Q: When are the key program events?   A: Program events provided during Industry Day should reflect a 30 day slip of the RFP.  118. 	Q: When will first orders be received? A:  It is anticipated that the initial delivery order will be placed at contract award. 119. 	Q: When is the first delivery under CHS-3 scheduled? A; Actual schedules will be determined at award. However current planning is that V2 products will be delivered 8 months after contract award, V3 products will be delivered 9 months after award and V1 products will be delivered 90 days after award.  120.  	Q: Why has the Army elected to cancel one on one sessions?  A: After careful review the government has determined that one on one sessions were not necessary for this competitive solicitation.  121. 	Q: What is the historical basis for the quantities provided in Table 1 in Section M?  A: These quantities are based on the projected average yearly requirement as provided from our potential PM customers of CHS-3 equipment.  122.	Q:  Will deviations or waivers be allowed on the CHS-3 contract?  A: See paragraph 3.5 for complete description of the Configuration Management requirements on this program.  123. 	Q:   Will potential bidders be given access to CHS-2 libraries to include Test Plans and reports, Deviations and waivers, CHS-2 technical data packages/drawing packages, and field reliability data and ILS support data?  A: CHS-3 library is being established to provide potential bidders access to all information required to submit a proposal.  This library will be operational prior to formal release of the RFP.  However based on the nature of this program to procure COTS/N DI equipment, specific CHS-2 information will not be provided to eliminate the potential to limit potential bidders from proposing new and innovative solutions to our requirements.  CHS-2 test plans and reports, technical data packages/drawings, field reli ability data and ILS support data will not be part of the CHS-3 library.

<DESC>NA This project entails the placement of sand along Miami Beach in the vicinity of Sixty-third Street to Eighty-third Street using an upland source of sand provided by the Contractor.  This project is to be a domestic upland sand source test.  The Florida Dep artment of Environmental Protection (FDEP) permit does not authorize dredging of an open water borrow site.  Approximately 600,000 cubic yards of material in place will be required to fill the beach area between monuments DNR-38 to DNR-46.  This segment of  beach is approximately 8,700 feet long.  It will have a 205-foot berm width from the Erosion Control Line (ECL) at El. 9 MLW with a foreshore slope of 1 vertical on 15 horizontal.  A 50-foot-wide pipeline corridor, centered at 553,290 North, is provided f or placement of fill from the offshore.  Any plan to use a large number of trucks hauling material along the local roads of the beaches will not be acceptable.  The Contractor based upon Government criteria will establish the sand source for this project.  The sand must be suitable for Southeast Florida beaches.  It must be free of debris, sharp rocks and pebbles, concrete rubble, and clay.  The average mean grain size shall be equal to or greater than 0.30 mm and less than 0.55 mm.  The fines must be less than 5 percent (passing the No. 230 Sieve).  Ninety-nine percent of the material must pass the three-eights inch sieve with no particles larger than three-fourths inch diameter.  The sand shall have a color similar to the existing beach.  Protection of the  environment, especially the existing offshore reef system, is very important.  The Contractor's operations will have to be carried out in accordance with permit requirements.  It is anticipated that this project may be constructed during the turtle-nestin g season and precautions will have to be taken.  The Contractor will be expected to provide the necessary permit documents and certificates of compliance for use of the sand source.  Equipment to be utilized would include, but not be limited to, the follow ing:  marine equipment (pumpout dredge, barges, boosters/mono-buoy, derrick barge, work tugboats/barges); bulldozers; front-end loader; and dump trucks.  Construction performance period is 270 calendar days.  Magnitude of construction is between $10,000,00 0.00 and $25,000,000.00.  Award will be made to the offeror whose proposal represents the best value to the Government.  The Contracting Officer will use a trade-off process to determine which offer represents the best value to the Government.  All evaluat ion factors other than price, when combined, are slightly more important than price.  The following factors will be used to determine best value:  Technical Merit, Past performance, and Price.

The estimated cost for design and construction of the project  is between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000.  Proposals will be evaluated using two-phase source selection procedures that will result in award of a firm-fixed price design/build contract to the responsible proposer whose proposal, conforming to the solicitation, is the BEST VALUE to the Government, price and technical factors considered.  Phase I of the procurement process is a narrowing phase to approximately five (5) offerors (design-build firms or teams) based on design-build factors that include:  FACTOR A-Past Performance, 1-Design Team, and 2-Construction Team; FACTOR B-Small Business Effort (Phase I); FACTOR C-Technical Qualifications, 1-Design Team and 2-Construction Team; and FACTOR D-Management Approach.

PROPOSERS ARE ADVISED THAT THE GOVERNMENT INTENDS TO EVALUATE PROPOSALS AND SELECT PHASE II OFFERORS WITHOUT DISCUSSIONS OR ANY CONTACT CONCERNING THE PROPOSALS RECEIVED.

<DESC>This is a revised market survey, DAAE30-03-Q-0403, Environmental Management System/ISO 14001 Market Servey, dated 10/17/2002. Description: The U.S. Army Tank-automotive and Armaments Command, Armament Research, Development and Engineering Center (TACOM-ARDEC), Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07806- 5000, is currently seeking qualified sources with the capability to aid in the  implementation of ISO 14001 environmental management system (EMS) at Army  installations.  Background: In April 2000, former President Clinton signed E.O. 13148 "The Greening the  Government through Leadership in Environmental Management" which established a  five year EMS implementation goal for all Federal Facilities.  In July 2001,  the Department of the Army published policy guidance on EMS implementation  establishing ISO 14001 implementation by December 2005 as an Army Goal and full  conformance to the standard by 2009.    ISO 14001 consists of a series of voluntary standards addressing the creation  and maintenance of an Environmental Management System. These standards require  companies to establish an environmental policy, determine the environmental  aspects and impacts of product/activities/services, plan environmental  objectives and measurable targets, work on implementation of programs to meet  these objectives and measurable targets, and create a system of corrective  action and management review.  Technical Requirements / ISO 14001 Implementation Activities: The Contractor implementation assistance experience should include performing  baseline assessments to review the status of the installation’s EMS with regard  to ISO 14001 requirements, developing programs/implementation plans to achieve  ISO conformance, developing objectives and targets, identifying significant  aspects and impacts of the installations operations, Internal Auditing training  and assistance, ISO general awareness briefings, Executive briefings to  management, implementation team training, and various reviews and report  development. Experience with Army and other DOD installations, Program/Project  Manager Offices (PMs) / Program Executive Offices (PEOs) preferred. Knowledge  of Army weapon system acquisition process and policies preferred. What is required for the contract recipient is to have knowledge and expertise  on ISO 14001 implementation at Army / DOD installations including PMs and PEOs,  EMS training courses, along with a demonstrated track record on previous DOD  efforts in this area. The applicant shall possess sufficient personnel to  manage this effort. Applicants’ response should include the following: 1. Information that describes their organization’s primary mission 2. Information on how you are organized to accomplish implementing ISO 14001 at  Army installations 3. Organizations’ strengths and weakness in accomplishing the implementation of  ISO 14001 at Army/DOD installations 4. Lists of DOD/ Army installations including tenants (PMs, PEOs) you have  assisted with ISO 14001 implementation 5. What in particular you have provided to each installation regarding ISO  14001 (i.e. baseline assessment, implementation plans, identification of  significant aspects/impacts, etc) 6. ISO 14001 EMS training courses you have provided (i.e., Internal and Lead  Auditor) 7. ISO 140001 EMS briefings (i.e., ISO 14001 Awareness, Executive Briefings)  you have conducted 7. Description of Army weapon system acquisition process experience 8. Any recommended military installations, universities, other government  agencies, or industry contacts you would suggest to be contacted to support  your application.   This is a market survey, not a pre-solicitation notice. If a formal  solicitation is generated at a later date, a solicitation notice will be  published. All information is to be submitted at no cost or obligation to the  Government. The Government reserves the right to reject, in whole or in part,  any private sector input as a result of this market survey.

<DESC>Sources are sought in research and development by the Air Force Research Laboratory Munitions Directorate Ordnance Division (AFRL/MNM) for Hard Target Influence Fuze Technology (HTIFT) to functionally defeat and/or deny access to facilities and areas.  The purpose of this sources sought synopsis is to obtain qualification packages from contractors interested in submitting proposals for the Hard Target Influence Fuze system: to design, fabricate and test a module capable of sensing and discriminating both military vehicles and clearing equipment from other vehicles and to develop a preliminary design of the fuze system which uses sensing module data to determine burst point.  The system design must show a path to a tactical fuze that will reside within a single cylindrical package which fits within the 3" rear fuze well of inventory weapons, is compatible with existing guidance kits, and survives anticipated impact forces.  This program will last approximately 42 months.
Firms having applicable interest, capability and background should submit particulars in accordance with Numbered Note 25 to AFRL/MNK, Bldg 13, 101 W. Eglin Blvd, Suite 337, Eglin AFB FL  32542-6810, Attn:  Martin Kradlak.  Firms will be evaluated on their experience, personnel, and facilities.  Responses to this synopsis must be received within 15 days from date of the synopsis publication.

<SUBJECT>Z -- Small Business Networking Session
<DESC>Jacksonville, Florida, Renovation and Alteration (Modernization), Charles E. Bennett Federal Building, Small Business Networking Session.

On Tuesday, November 19, 2002, The United States General Services Administration (GSA) will conduct a Small Business Networking Session for prospective Small Business Subcontractors for the construction phase of The Charles E. Bennett Federal Building Modernization Project.  The Networking Session will be conducted from 6:00 p.m. to
9:00 p.m. in The Bennett Federal Building, Room 116, 400 West Bay Street, 
Jacksonville, Florida.

The Bennett Federal Building will undergo a complete interior modernization.  Upon completion the renovated space will be occupied to The United States Internal Revenue Service and other Federal agencies.  The Estimated Total Project Cost (ETPC) is between $20,000,000 and $25,000,000.  The modernization project will consist of hazardous materials removal, interior demolition, the installation of new HVAC and electrical distribution systems, as well as the final space build-outs for the tenants.

The Subcontracting Networking Session is intended to affirm GSA's recognition of the talent that exists in the Small Business Community and its commitment to opening a dialogue between that community and the construction firm that has been selected for this modernization project.

Prospective Small Business Subcontractors will be given an opportunity to network with the selected prime construction contractor and to showcase their special talents and abilities as qualified subcontractors.  Although it is anticipated that this Networking Session will assist the Prime Contractor in identifying qualified subcontractors to meet the subcontracting goals established for this project, because GSA is not permitted by law to be a party to contractual relationships between potential Primes and Subcontractors, any contracts that may develop as a result of this Networking Session will be strictly private arrangements between the interested parties based on perceived ability and need.

Questions about the Networking Session may be directed to either David Gibson, GSA's Small Business Outreach Specialist, Telephone (404) 331-2366, E-Mail:
DavidA.Gibson@GSA.GOV; or Pat Geisinger, GSA's Small Business Technical Advisor, Telephone (404) 331-3031, E-Mail:  Pat.Geisinger@GSA.GOV.

Offerors must comply with all instructions contained in FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors--Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition and no addenda applies.   The provisions at 52-212-2, Evaluation--Commercial Items applies to this acquisition. The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the government, price and other factors considered.  The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:  1.  Past Performance and 2.  Price.  Past performance will be evaluated to ensure satisfactory business practices and timely performance.  Price and past performances are of equal importance. Price will be evaluated to determine its fairness and reasonableness as it relates to the item offered.  The best value will be determined by comparing differences in the value of past performance with differences in price to the government.  In making this comparison, the government is just as concerned with obtaining superior past performance as it is with selecting an offer at the lowest overall price to the government.  The lowest price quote may not necessarily be selected; likewise, the proposal receiving the highest past performance evaluation rating may not necessarily be selected.  No advantage will accrue to a contractor who proposes to manufacture this requirement for an unrealistically low price.   The Government intends to evaluate offers and make award without discussions; however, this does not preclude the Government from having discussions if it is in the best interest of the Government to do so.  Offers shall include a completed copy of the provision at 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications--Commercial Items, and the 252.212-7000 Offeror Representations and Certifications with its offer.
