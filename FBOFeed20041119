<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) plans to acquire an enterprise-wide, state-of-the-art Telecommunications Operations Support System (TOSS) to ensure that the new telecommunications infrastructure supports established business needs. This project will build on the environment established by the VA Telecommunications Modernization Project (TMP) to optimize the existing VA Wide Area Network (WAN) into a national integrated services platform.  The TOSS project will focus on the acquisition and development of a single, integrated system that will improve VA’s telecommunications asset and services management.  At a minimum, the system must provide the following components:  service request/order handling; hierarchy code management; invoice tracking and billing reconciliation; telecommunications asset inventory management; and funding allocation.  Furthermore, the VA believes that accountability for telecommunications costs is needed to meet the requirements of the VA Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Act of 1990, the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA), the National Performance Review (NPR), and the Federal Accounting Standards Advisory Board (FASAB).  RFP # 101-51-04 replaces RFP # 101-38-04 (which was cancelled) and will be available on or October 15, 2004.  This will only be available for download from (BOS) http://www.bos.oamm.va.gov/cgi-bin/WebObjects/BosPublic.woa and/or (Fedbizopps) http://fedbizopps.gov .

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Panama City intends to award a sole source  purchase order to Rotomotion, LLC of 501-C La Mesa St., Mt. Pleasant, SC 29464 for the development of a Joint Architecture for Unmanned Systems (JAUS) compliant network layer which will reside on a Flight controller box with an option for puchasing a Commercial Off-the-shelf (COTS) unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) for testing with the flight controller.  This acquisition is unsuitable for full and open competition for the following reasons:  this effort is a follow-on to the JAUS and NATO Cross Talk (JNXT) experiment utilizing a Rotomotion hobbiest model vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) UAV.  Due to the extreme similarities of this new project and the JNXT it is essential to have hardware and software that is 100% compatible to allow for comparison of previous results to the data to be collected. This requires using Rotomotion’s remote and autonomus controlled helicopters, flight control syst! em and platform control code.   Only Rotomotion, LLC has the initmate knowledge of their flight controller and UAV vehicles that  will significantly reduce the time for software code integration. Use of any other vendor would result in a substantial duplication of cost and would negatively impact the project schedule.  NAICS:  541511.

<DESC>100% SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE. 

The Prevention Research Branch (PRB) of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) has a requirement for the conduct of Studies evaluating the effectiveness of various approaches for the delivery of educational/behavioral interventions to increase parental management of teen driving. The Studies will be conducted in cooperation and collaboration with the designated NICHD Project Officer (PO).

One of the PRB areas of research emphasis is the prevention of motor vehicle crashes among young drivers.  Young drivers are at greatly elevated risk for motor vehicle crashes, and these risks are particularly elevated during the first six months and 1000 miles of independent driving, regardless of the amount of supervised practice driving prior to licensure and age of licensure (McCartt et al., 2003).  This may be due to age/inexperience, risk taking, or other factors (Williams & Ferguson, 2002). Teen passengers, nighttime, distracting activities, and other factors can increase crash risks for novice teen drivers (Doherty et al., 1998).  Graduated Driver Licensing (GDL) policies, now in place in most states, appear to reduce crash risks mainly by delaying licensure and possibly by reducing exposure to risk conditions.  One effect of GDL may be to increase parental management of teen drivers. With or without GDL, there appears to be great potential for increasing parental management of novice young drivers (Simons-Morton & Hartos, 2003).  

Previously, the PRB has developed, and evaluated in randomized trials, interventions designed to increase parental management of teen driving during the first year of licensure. This research demonstrated the efficacy of educational/behavioral interventions for increasing parental management of teen driving and reducing exposure to high risk driving conditions during the first 12 months after licensure (Simons-Morton et al., 2002, 2003, 2004, in press).  

The PRB’s overall objective for the current requirement is to obtain reliable and valid data from separate studies conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of various approaches to the delivery of educational interventions to increase parental management of teen driving. The objectives of the individual studies are as follows: 
 
Study 1 (Persuasion):
Determine the most effective approaches, including their source, timing, content, and delivery, of persuasive communications designed to increase parental management of teen driving and reduce teen driving privileges.

Option 1:  Study 2 (Routine Licensing Practice):
Determine the extent to which educational/behavioral interventions to increase parental management of teen driving can be delivered effectively as part of routine department of motor vehicle administration driver licensing practice.

Option 2: Study 3 (Driver Education):
Determine the effect of educational/behavioral intervention to increase parental management of teen driving when integrated into driver education.

This procurement is defined as code 541720 under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS).  As such, the applicable Small Business Size Standard for this announcement is $6 million or less in annual receipts. For the calculation of annual receipts see parts 121.104 and 121.106 in SBA's Small Business Size Regulations.  All responsible sources that meet the applicable Small Business Size Standard may submit a proposal, which will be considered by the agency.  It is anticipated that one cost-reimbursement incrementally funded type contract, with a period of performance of 40 months, will be awarded for the initial Study as a result of the RFP.  It is also anticipated that the resultant contract will contain options for two additional Studies with periods of performance of 40 months each.

This announcement is not a Request for Proposals (RFP).  It is anticipated that the RFP will be available on or before December 8, 2004 through the website at http://FedBizOpps.gov.  All proposals must be submitted on or before the due date and time stated in the RFP to: Charles Newman, Contracting Officer, Contracts Management Branch, OAM, NICHD, 6100 Executive Boulevard, Suite 7A07, MSC 7510, Bethesda, Maryland, 20892-7510 (if sending by overnight carrier, use 6l00 Executive Boulevard, Suite 7A07, Rockville Maryland, 20852).

<DESC>The Prevention Research Branch (PRB) of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) has a requirement for the conduct of Studies to examine aspects of driving risks among novice teen drivers.  The Studies will be conducted in cooperation and collaboration with the designated NICHD Project Officer (PO).

One of the PRB areas of research emphasis is the prevention of motor vehicle crashes among young drivers.  Young drivers are at greatly elevated risk for motor vehicle crashes, and these risks are particularly elevated during the first six months and 1000 miles of independent driving, regardless of the amount of supervised practice driving prior to licensure and age of licensure (McCartt et al., 2003).  This may be due to age/inexperience (Williams & Ferguson, 2002), risk taking (Jonah, 1986), or other factors.  Teen passengers, nighttime, distracting activities, and other factors can increase crash risks for novice teen drivers (Doherty et al., 1998).  

Research documenting the effect of passengers on driving performance has been based largely on analysis of databases of traffic crashes and injuries. Results indicate that, unlike experienced drivers, the effect of teen passengers is related to increased injury and accident rates for novice drivers. For example, Preusser et al. (1998) reported that for 16 year olds with two or more passengers present, the relative risk of being involved in a fatal crash was 7.86 times higher than drivers aged 30-59.  Rice et al., (2003) reported that teen drivers driving alone or with other teenagers in the vehicle were much more likely to be involved in a crash than adults. This may be due to increased risk taking, for example, as evidenced by higher average speeds and reduced gaps between vehicles (McKenna et al., 1998). Recent research efforts have also indicated a tendency for young drivers to be less likely to stop at an intersection during the yellow phase than either older drivers or as a result of having a passenger(s) present (Doerzaph, 2004; Mahoney, 2004; Steinberg, 2003).

Driving experience would appear to reduce teen driving risk (Williams, Ferguson, 2002), but no research trials have been conducted to assess the effect on objective measures of driving.  

The PRB’s overall objective for the current requirement is to obtain reliable and valid data to examine aspects of driving risks among novice teen drivers. The objectives of the individual studies are as follows: 

Study 1 (Experience):
Determine the effect of driving experience on the driving performance of teen drivers when newly licensed and again after substantial driving experience under normal, demanding, and distracted driving conditions (e.g., using electronic devices and in the presence of teen passengers) among males and females, and higher and lower risk taking/sensation seeking youth.

Option 1, Study 2 (Practice Driving): 
Determine the nature and extent of practice driving for newly licensed teens and determine the effect of greater and lesser amounts of supervised practice driving on the driving performance of newly licensed teens.

The required service is defined as code 541720 under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS).  All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which will be considered by the agency.  It is anticipated that one cost-reimbursement, incrementally funded type contract, with a period of performance of 36 months, will be awarded for the initial Study as a result of the RFP.  It is also anticipated that the resultant contract will contain an option for an additional Study with period of performance of 40 months.

This announcement is not a Request for Proposals (RFP).  It is anticipated that the RFP will be available on or before December 8, 2004 through the web site at http://FedBizOpps.gov.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>This is a synopsis for a noncommercial program entitled Helicopter Autonomous Landing System (HALS). The objective of the program is to design, develop, test and deliver, one completed palletized and functional HALS, with applicable radar, symbology,  patented Waveband antenna, and all associated cabling.  The contractor shall also provide incidental engineering and technical support to integrate the HALS into the UH-60L aircraft.  The HALS shall operate on 28VDC aircraft power.  The installed HALS wil l be used for developmental testing on the UH60L aircraft to assess the viability of utilizing a radar imaging system as an aid for landing in reduced visibility environments caused by brownout or whiteout conditions.  A Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) contract  will be awarded to Sierra Nevada Corporation, who is deemed to be the only responsible source uniquely capable of meeting this requirement.  The funding for this requirement is Congressionally directed to investigate HALS.  Accordingly, this acquisition w ill be procured in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(l) and FAR 6.302-1; Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements as market research has identified only Sierra Nevada Corporation as having a readily te stable, strap-on HALS.  Alpha contract negotiations, appropriate for sole source requirements, will be limited to Sierra Nevada Corporation.  The contract terms and requirements will be developed jointly between the Government and Sierra Nevada Corporation , consistent with alpha contracting procedures in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR).  HALS consists of an active millimeter wave radar sensor and display system designed to provide visible cues to the pilot during approach, hover an d landing during brownout or whiteout conditions.  The HALS is a small, compact, and lightweight system suitable for use as a strap-on application. It is capable of resolution required to identify smaller terrain features (i.e. large rocks, gullies, obstac les, etc.) of importance to the pilot in determining the suitability of a landing area and permitting the pilot to maintain the aircrafts attitude.  Sierra Nevada Corporation is the original designer and developer of HALS, and is deemed the only firm holdi ng the technical data and having the capability to make the system a strap-on application with the light weight and compactness needed for this effort.  The period of performance for this program is eighteen (18) months.  The North American Industry Classi fication System (NAICS) applicable to this is 541710.  The size standard is 1500.  While the Government does not anticipate competition, any responsible source may submit a proposal that shall be considered.  Written proposals should be addressed to AATD, Attn: AMSRD-AMR-AA-C (Jared Cariker), Building 401 Lee Boulevard, Fort Eustis, VA 23604-5577.  Mr. Carikers phone number is 757-878-5909.

<DESC>NA The U.S. Army Contracting Agency, in support of the U. S. Army Aberdeen Test Center and the Army's Environmental Quality Technology Program (EQT), is soliciting innovative proposals through this Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) in the area of unexploded ord nance (UXO) detection and discrimination technologies.  Proposed technologies shall significantly improve sensing, positioning, analysis, and visualization that efficiently and effectively characterize sites that may contain surface, subsurface, and underw ater UXO. Specifically, the Government is seeking proposals to demonstrate ground based UXO Detection and Discrimination Technologies.  The technologies shall be demonstrated on the Standardized UXO Technology Demonstration Sites that have been established at Aberde en Proving Ground (APG) and Yuma Proving Ground (YPG).  Descriptions of each site are located on the web at: www.uxotestsites.org.    These test sites provide standard and nonstandard inert ordnance targets in a wide range of environmental, geophysical, and clutter conditions to allow performance to be rated and validated.  Performance shall be documented by means of metrics such as the systems Probability of Detection (Pd), False Alarm Rate (Pfd), Background Alarm rate, discrimination efficiency, site coverage rates and estimated survey costs.  The technologies shall also be demonstrated at the Active Response Site currently under development at APG.  The Active Response Site is a one-acre site located within an area that contains actual ordnance and clutter.  Performance at the Active Response S ite will be documented by the same metrics as the Standardized Site. Demonstration of existing and emerging technologies may include but are not limited to time and frequency domain EMI, high resolution, fully-polar metric GPR, magnetometers /gradiometers, multi-sensor fusion, automatic target recognition algorithms, and hi gh accuracy navigational and tracking systems.  SCOPE OF PROJECT:  Total funding for this project is estimated at $500,000 from which a total of 10 awards are envisioned.  It is anticipated that increased funding levels will occur in the following three fiscal years.

<DESC>The Health Resources & Services Administration (HRSA), HIV/AIDS Bureau (HAB), intent to negotiate, on a sole source basis, to modify our contract with Jeff Murray’s Programming Shop of New Orleans, Louisiana.  This procurement shall be processed in accordance with the Contract by Negotiation Procedures as outlined in Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Parts 15 and 6.  The purpose of this negotiation is to acquire their Upgrading and Supporting CAREWAre software and training, which will allow direct extensions of the current application and therefore enable its use in international HIV treatment settings.  This modification to the existing contract will permit changes in internal codes and redesign of certain screens of the current proprietary software.  The current contractor is the only one who can make these adjustments.  Any other source would have to duplicate a substantial array of current and previous efforts to accomplish the same objectives.   
The Contractor has spent a considerable amount of effort in developing the Upgrading and Supporting CAREWAre software and will now be required to spend a small amount of effort to upgrade, again.  This is not a solicitation, but a notification of our intent to modify an existing contract.  A justification for other than full and open competition (JOFOC) is on file.

<RESPDATE>010505
<ARCHDATE>02162005
<CONTACT>Anthony Cicala, Contracting Officer, Phone (571)218-4639, Fax (703)248-1927, Email acicala@darpa.mil
<DESC>The purpose of Amendment 02 to SN05-05 is for the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) to promulgate the new date for attendance at this Proposer’s Day Conference, and to further clarify the intent and purpose of having this Proposer’s Day Conference.  The fol-lowing is applicable and supersedes previously published information associated with SN05-05.


PROGRAM OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION:  The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s (DARPA) Advanced Technology Office (ATO), in collaboration with the Defense Sciences Office (DSO), anticipates releasing a solicitation late February 2005 for the B-FAB program.  Recent developments drawing on the use of engineered biomolecules to guide the as-sembly of inorganic materials offer the potential of a new process path for fabricating nanoscale inorganic three-dimensional meta-structures with dimensional and assembly control not achiev-able with current technologies.  Combined, these independent advances suggest the potential for manufacturing a new type of high-efficiency, advanced photovoltaic solar power source. The ob-jective of the B-FAB program is to drive the concurrent development and integration of these technologies with current processes and demonstrate an affordable next-generation high-efficiency photovoltaic with a minimum of 50% efficiency.

The program requires that teams be formed to comprehensively address all aspects of the prob-lem including the development of a range of mutually compatible processes for the synthesis, manipulation, and assembly of nanoscale inorganic functional materials, process control and in-tegration, nanoscale device design, and ultimately develop high-efficiency photovoltaic cells as a product that is scaleable to industrial fabrication of the device.  Potential teams may be com-prised of elements from industry, academia, and national laboratories, but must include elements from industry appropriate to the subsequent manufacture of successfully developed devices. 

DARPA is unaware of any single organization capable of addressing the breadth and depth of technologies referenced above. DARPA is leveraging the breadth of both the Advanced Technology Office (ATO) and the Defense Sciences Office (DSO) of DARPA in this joint pro-gram to capture the diverse technical capabilities from academia, national labs and industry that will be required to achieve this challenging objective. 

DARPA will hold a Proposers Day Conference and Teaming Meeting in support of the B-FAB program on 10 February 2005 at System Planning Corporation, 1000 Wilson Boulevard Arlington, VA beginning at 8:00am with an anticipated ending time of 5:00pm.  The registration fee for the conference will be $50.00.  The purpose of the conference and teaming meeting is to provide program information, address questions from potential proposers, and provide a forum for potential proposers to present their capabilities for teaming opportunities.  A portion of the conference agenda will be reserved for a poster session by prospective proposers who wish to present company overviews and discuss their B-FAB relevant technology expertise.  In order to display a poster the proposer must submit a white paper for approval, describing their poster and relevant expertise to the B-FAB program.  The white papers must be no longer than three (3) pages, demonstrate the relevance of the technology to the B-FAB program, discuss process capabilities, design, or fabrication capabilities, and present ideas that will be amenable to team development.  Selected white papers will be notified to submit a poster for Proposers Day.  The white papers must be submitted no later than 5 January 2005.  The white papers can be submitted by e-mail to B-FAB@darpa.mil .  The selected white papers will then be required to submit electronic copies of the posters they will be presenting.  All posters must be received by 10 January 2005 for prior review by DARPA.  All material will be subjected to review by DARPA for sensitive but unclassified information.  It is the presenter’s responsibility to ensure that all material presented is approved by the organization that funded the research.  

Registration for the Proposers Day Conference is on-line at http://safe.sysplan.com/b-fab .  In order to submit an approved poster you must be registered.  If on-line registration is not possible, please contact the program e-mail at B-FAB@darpa.mil no later than 7 February 2005 to register.  The attendance at the meeting will be restricted to the first 200 people to register.  Foreign nationals will be required to complete and return the DARPA Foreign National Visitor Request (DARPA Form 60) no later than 7 February 2005 if they wish to attend the conference.

Attendance at the Proposers Day Conference is not required to propose to any BAA that may be associated with this technology area.  Updates to program information will be posted as necessary to http://www.darpa.mil/ato/solicit/BFAB/index.htm.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) – AIR FORCE RESEARCH LABORATORY.   In accordance with FAR 52.215-3, Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes (Oct 1997):  (a) The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this solicitation or to otherwise pay for the information solicited except as an allowable cost under other contracts as provided in subsection 31.205-18, Bid and proposal costs, of the Federal Acquisition Regulation.  (b) Although “proposal” and “offeror” are used in this Request for Information, your response will be treated as information only. It shall not be used as a proposal.  (c) This solicitation is issued for the purpose of market research relative to recompetition of the MAUI SPACE SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM (MSSS) and STARFIRE OPTICAL RANGE (SOR) OPERATIONS & MAINTENANCE and TECHNICAL/RESEARCH OVERSIGHT. RFI includes all commercial and academic institutions.  POC:  Ms Caroline Pultz, Procurement Contracting Officer, 505-846-2240, Caroline.Pultz@kirtland.af.mil.   BACKGROUND:  The current MSSS and SOR contracts expire in 2005 and will be recompeted.  An Integrated Product Team (IPT) has been formed to conduct market research associated with site operations and maintenance, and the long-term research strategy for the MSSS and the SOR facilities. REQUIREMENTS:  1) Industry Day:  AFRL will host an Industry Day at the Energy Training Complex (ETC), 1401 Maxwell St, Kirtland AFB-West, Albuquerque, New Mexico, on 12 October 2004, from 0800-1100 to review the MSSS and SOR site capabilities and other programmatic discussions.  This event will be conducted in accordance with FAR 15.201 -- Exchanges With Industry Before Receipt of Proposals.  2)  Oral presentations from potential offerors will be held in Albuquerque, New Mexico on 12 October 2004 beginning at 1300.  The AFRL is encouraging oral presentations covering planned operations and maintenance of the MSSS and SOR, business development strategies for moving MSSS and SOR towards self-sustaining sites by 2010, and support of existing directed energy and space situation awareness technology transition programs.  Additionally, presentations should address the potential for combining contract solicitations for MSSS and SOR that could provide consolidated support (operations, maintenance, and research thrusts) to both MSSS and SOR under a single contract.  Analysis should include resource consolidation, technology transition opportunities, links to customer requirements, and intensity of the competition to determine the best business strategy for a consolidated operation.  Offerors should also look at the strategic business/ technological opportunities and threats.  Potential customers include the Space and Technology community, United States Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM), Air Force Space Command (AFSPC), Missile Defense Agency RDT&E needs, NASA, other federal agencies, academia, and commercial users.  Special attention should be paid to identifying AF S&T programs that can be supported by the MSSS and SOR (other AF: Air Force Office of Scientific Research and the National Science Foundation), and relationships with academia, industry and the Maui High Performance Computing Center (MHPCC).  Potential offerors should also look at potential growth factors and core competencies necessary for site operations.   NOTE that any subsequent contract award(s) will be made only to offeror(s) who currently possess a Top Secret Facility Clearance and have sufficient Top Secret cleared and qualified personnel available at contract award.  Oral Presentations will be limited to not longer than one hour.  All potential offerors must preschedule their presentation prior to attending the morning session.  PREPARATION:  Offerors should be aware that this RFI announcement is an expression of interest for purposes of market research and that no funding will be provided from the AFRL for this effort.  Contact Ms. Irma Aragon at 505-846-5044 or Irma.Aragon@kirtland.af.mil  to schedule Industry Day attendance and oral presentations.  Request reservations be made prior to 7 October 2004.  Information packets are available upon request.

<DESC>REQUESTING INFORMATION REGARDING THE CAPABILITY & ACCESSABILITY OF
CLIMATE SENSITIVE COLLECTIONS TRANSPORT VEHICLES;   

The Library of Congress'opening of the NAVCC will require reliable daily transportation of its M/B/RS divisions audio-visual collection items between Culpeper, VA and the Library reading room and other public facilities on Capitol Hill. The vehicle used for this purpose must have certain minimum capabilities to insure that these collections are transported under conditions that guarantee environmental stability and high physical security at all times.  The following equipment specifications have been written keeping in mind both the "normal" atmospheric and traffic conditions that the vehicle and collections are likely to encounter during a routine delivery cycle, and a set of "abnormal" traffic conditions which occur frequently enough on Washington, D.C. area roadways to require that they be taken into account in developing minimally necessary specifications for any vehicle secured for this purpose.

(1)	Load capacity: (??) to be determined but most likely with a load capacity in the 4000 to 6000 lb. range.  A custom configured vehicle designed to transport collections packed inside rolling carts designed especially for multiple audio-visual formats.  The vehicle load space will be designed so that separately loaded collection carts can be locked down or be securely anchored within to protect the individual carts from excessive vibration and provide maximum protection in case of a traffic accident. 

(2)	Loading dock compatibility - height, width and truck bed height must be compatible with loading docks at NAVCC and James Madison building.

(3)	Environmental control - load hauling/storage area of vehicle must have environmental humidity & temperature controls capable of sustaining 55 degree temperature (+ or - 5 degrees) & 35% RH (+ or - 5%) for a period of 8 hours.  (Note: environmental control equipment should be designed in such a way as to avoid contamination of interior load space in case of coolant leakage or other catastrophic malfunction.)

(4)	High efficiency insulation - collection storage area on vehicle must be fully protected with high efficiency insulation (top, bottom, sides & access door) to make the most efficient use of vehicle fuel, and to maximize stabilization of temp & humidity within during transport.

(5)	Shock absorption - vehicle suspension must provide maximum protection to the transported collections from vibration, bumps and other harmful forces.  (Note: the audio-visual collection transport carts that will fit inside this vehicle will also be designed with foam and other materials to protect sensitive collection items.)

(6)	Environmental control monitoring - vehicle must be equipped with digital readout devices/recording devices that will allow the driver to monitor the environmental conditions in the collection hauling space.  These digital devices must be configured in a way that will allow the easy transferral of the recorded information to a computer or other such device each day in the NAVCC.

(7)	Two way emergency communication - vehicle must have mobile phone or other two communications equipment that will allow the driver to notify appropriate LC officials in the event of an on-the-road emergency and call for assistance.

(8)	Integrally designed, environmentally contained collection transport carts - insulated carts, to greatest practical extent possible, capable of protecting contents from vibration, shocks and from forces generated during an impact collision accident.  Also, these carts should be capable of passively maintaining appropriate temperature & humidity levels for an extended period in case transport vehicle is incapacitated while on the road or delayed for a long period of time in a traffic jam.

Anyone with extensive knowledge of these types of vehicles, please contact Carleton Myers at the Library of Congress via email: cmye@loc.gov or by phone 202-707-8604 between 2:00pm - 4:30pm; EST. *This is not a solication nor request for proposal.

<DESC>MARKET SURVEY – SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS:  The Government is issuing this sources-sought announcement as part of a market research effort to support a vendor demonstration of a medium/heavy caliber sniper rifle.  The Government is interested in viewing weapons with enhanced capabilities beyond that of the current .300 Winchester Magnum  sniper rifle within the Special Operations Forces inventory. The total weapon system (bipod, scope, ballistic computer, weapon, etc…) not to include ammunition should weigh less than 25 pounds.  This demonstration is in keeping with the United States Special Operations Command future weapons roadmap. The government has reserved the US Army Proving Ground, Yuma, AZ., during the period 1-3 February 2005.  During this time, vendors will brief and demonstrate their weapon system capabilities to US Government representatives.  Interested vendors shall respond to the POC below by 20 December 2004.  Vendors shall provide weapon system description, electronic copy of operators manual, weapon performance data, weapon test data, production history, and any previous safety releases granted by the US Government. Based on the information received, the government will screen all potential vendors based on the data submitted proving that their round is still sonic at a minimum of 1500 yards.  A schedule will then be established for approximately nine (+ or -) vendor demonstrations.   The government requests that selected vendors travel, at their own expense, to Yuma, AZ with their weapon system(s), and a minimum of 200 rounds of ammunition.  Each vendor will have approximately 3 hours to display, discuss (safety, operation, performance and maintenance) and demonstrate their weapon(s).    Weapons firing demonstration will include:  firing five round groups on targets utilizing the acoustic range at 500 yards, 1,000 yards, 1,500 yards, and 2000 yards for accuracy; additional firing, using Doppler Radar to assess ballistic performance.  Vendor representatives will fire their own weapons throughout all firing scenarios.

<SUBJECT>A -- Chemical Optimization and Preclinical Development of Molecular-Targeted Anticancer Drug Leads
<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI)-Developmental Therapeutics Program (DTP) - Screening Technologies Branch (STB) seeks Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) collaborator(s) to participate in the optimization of small molecule, molecular-targeted anticancer screening leads for potency and pharmaceutical properties consistent with clinical developmenta. The leads have been identified by the NCI-STB using high-throughput screening and preliminary structure/activity study of 140,000 samples from an NCI repository addressing a number of antitumor molecular targets of potential therapeutic significance.

Potential Areas if Application: Antitumor agents. Specifically, opportunities are available to optimize antitumor leads for inhibition of Hypoxia Inducible Factor-1 (HIF-1) alpha signaling and for inducers of the CCAAT/Enhancer Binding Protein   (CEBP- ) signaling pathway.

Main Advantages of the Technology: Lead compounds possess distinct mechanisms of antitumor activities.

Current State of Development: In vitro evaluation and preliminary structure/activity studies on-going at NCI for existing leads.

Further R&D Requireda: Initially, a medicinal chemistry partner is sought to identify and resolve potential structural problems / features thus optimizing lead compound(s) for activity, potency, formulation, stability, metabolism, toxicity, absorption/distribution etc. Secondary or in vivo biological testing would be carried out by the NCI-Screening Technologies Branch. In a second stage, in vivo active compounds will be subjected to additional analysis and analogs will be synthesized to further optimize structure/activity properties.
