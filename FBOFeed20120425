Correspondences related to the RFI should be submitted electronically via e-mail to anthony.love @maxwell.af.mil and to patrick.kennerson@maxwell.af.mil.</p>
<p>1. Background:</p>
<p>2. General Description. <br />The Language Enabled Airman Program (LEAP) provides language, regional, and cultural (LRC) training for Airmen across all Air Force Specialty Codes (AFSCs), in locations throughout the world, for the duration of their Air Force career. Participants require training to sustain and enhance language skills and, in some cases, retrain into another language. It is expensive and overly burdensome to follow a traditional language training method of sending members away from their home station for extended sustainment training on a frequent basis and difficult to arrange training for thousands of participants at various locations with various schedules. Therefore, LEAP has piloted an "eMentor" program in which LEAP student participants are provided live, online, instructor-facilitated language training in a distance learning environment. LEAP participants are assigned to an internet-based language cohort, varying in size but no more than 6 students, who are guided by a qualified language instructor in a "virtual" classroom setting. In addition to qualified distance learning instructors, LEAP requires an internet data connectivity platform that will be able to place LEAP students and eMentors in a simultaneous on-line classroom environment.<br /><br />3. Scope.</p>
<p>3.1 The contractor will provide mentoring support and data connectivity in a distance learning environment to help LEAP participants maintain and improve their foreign language skill proficiency.</p>
<p>3.2 The Government expectation is for the contractor to have all aspects of the requirement fully operational and ready to execute upon award of a contract; there would be no time for "development" or "creation" of a program. The Government anticipates, up to 400 LEAP participants to be actively engaged in eMentor training in at least two dozen languages. The number of participants is expected to grow to 700, 1000, 1300, 1600, and 1900 students in the following five years respectively. The number of languages expected to be taught will likely number over 100 within the next five years.</p>
<p>3.3 The technology should provide a Resource Library that allows for uploading, viewing and downloading by students and instructors. The Resource Library should also provide a powerful search capability so that users can use full text search to locate any resource material.</p>
<p>4. Performance Requirements.</p>
<p>4.1 Language Instruction through eMentors. The contractor must provide language instruction that includes the development of communicative competence in speaking, listening, reading and writing through curriculum that is aligned with guidelines provided by the LEAP Program Office. Training is student centered and tailored to the student's needs. For LEAP, language instructors are referred to as eMentors. The contractor is to provide eMentors for all languages as specified by the LEAP Program Office . Currently, LEAP participants speak the languages found in the following table. New participants are nominally selected into LEAP twice a year. New languages to be supported will not be known until after selections have been completed and will vary based on the needs of the Air Force.</p>
<p>LEAP LANGUAGES AS OF APRIL 2012<br />Afrikaans<br />Albanian<br />Amharic<br />Arabic (MSA)<br />Bengali<br />Bulgarian<br />Cambodian<br />Chinese-Amoy<br />Chinese-Cantonese<br />Chinese-Mandarin<br />Czech<br />Dari <br />Danish <br />Dutch <br />Farsi <br />Finnish<br />French <br />German<br />Gujarati <br />Haitian Creole<br />Hebrew<br />Hindi<br />Hungarian<br />Indonesian<br />Igbo <br />Italian <br />Japanese <br />Korean <br />Mongolian<br />Lao <br />Norwegian <br />Polish <br />Portuguese-Continental<br />Portuguese-Brazilian <br />Punjabi <br />Romanian<br />Russian<br />Serbo-Croatian<br />Spanish<br />Swahili<br />Swedish<br />Tagalog <br />Thai <br />Tigrinya<br />Turkish<br />Ukrainian <br />Urdu <br />Uzbek <br />Vietnamese-Central<br />Vietnamese-Hanoi<br />Yoruba <br />Zulu</p>
<p>The eMentors will be expected to work closely/collaborate with the LEAP Program Office to create/develop specific curriculum as well as translation of materials provided by the LEAP Program Office.</p>
<p>4.2 Cohort size. eMentor cohorts will vary in size from 1 to 6 students, depending on the specific foreign language. Students will be assigned to cohorts based on many criteria, but primarily based on the specific foreign language, the student's proficiency within that language (with students of similar proficiency being grouped together) and job-related skills within the Air Force. It is anticipated that most language cohorts will meet a total of between 3-5 hours each week in a virtual classroom setting, with each on-line classroom session lasting between 60 and 90 minutes.</p>
<p>4.3 Specified eMentor Duties. The contractor should be able to adjust curricula relative to the specific language(s) and needs of the specific cohort, administer the curricula, schedule participant activities, provide one-on-one coaching, facilitate group exercises/activities, monitor participant progress through qualitative and quantitative assessments developed in conjunction with the LEAP Program Office, and account for participant activity/participation in a distance learning environment. The contractor is to provide all classroom materials necessary for conducting classes to include textbooks, workbooks, dictionaries, audio files, video files, etc. The overarching goal for eMentors is to assist LEAP participants to attain and maintain a DLPT Score of at least "2+" in listening, "2+" in reading, and attain an OPI level "2" in speaking, as defined by the Interagency Language Roundtable (ILR) standard definitions of language proficiency levels as identified below. Ideally, LEAP participants should be able to attain higher levels of proficiency beyond these minimums. See <a href="http://www.dliflc.edu/">http://www.dliflc.edu/</a>. &nbsp;eMentoring support is expected to be available whenever necessary to connect with LEAP participants stationed worldwide. Since participants may be in any time zone, the contractor must ensure that eMentors are scheduled as necessary to support their assigned participants, based on the participants' time zone and work schedules.</p>
<p>4.4 eMentor Language Qualifications. The contractor must provide eMentors who are native speakers of their respective language or have a near-native foreign language capability in speaking, listening, reading and writing equivalent to or above an ILR proficiency level of 4/4/4 or an American Council for the Teaching of Foreign Languages (ACTFL) proficiency assessment of "Superior" in speaking and writing.</p>
<p>4.4.1 The Interagency Language Roundtable (ILR) is a loosely coordinated network of federal, academic, and non-governmental organizations that share a common goal of improving the nation's capacity to learn, teach, and effectively use foreign languages in the national interests. See http://www.govtilr.org. The ILR language skill-level descriptions are descriptions of different levels of proficiency for four different language skills: speaking, reading, listening, and writing. The scale used to describe each skill has six base levels, ranging from 0 (no functional proficiency) to 5 (functionally equivalent to a highly educated native speaker/reader). Level 4 is defined as "Advanced Professional Proficiency." Thus, a proficiency level of 4/4/4 indicates a level 4 in speaking, level 4 in reading, and level 4 in listening. This acquisition does not specify any required proficiency level for writing. .</p>
<p>4.4.2 The American Council for the Teaching of Foreign Languages (ACTFL) is a national organization of more than 9,000 foreign language educators and administrators from elementary through graduate education, as well as Government and industry, dedicated to the improvement and expansion of the teaching and learning of all languages at all levels of instruction. See http://www.actfl.org. Proficiency levels for speaking and writing are based in large part on the language skill-level descriptions used by the ILR, but have been refined to incorporate a non-numerical scale representing the ILR levels 3 - 5. A proficiency level of "Superior" is roughly equivalent to an ILR level 4.</p>
<p>4.4.3 The contractor may use any standard testing methods available for use by instructors that are based on the ILR language skill-levels or ACTFL certification.<br /><br />4.4.4 eMentor Regional/Cultural Qualifications. The eMentor must be deeply versed in the respective country and region's culture and customs. Ideally, the eMentor should have a bachelor's level degree in History, Political Science, International Relations, Anthropology, Archeology, or Cultural Geography with a specialty related to the language they will be teaching, or is a cultural practitioner who has acquired 5 years of embedded experiences in the specific country's culture.</p>
<p>4.5 Data Connectivity Requirement. The technology provided by the contractor must provide all the support needed for the LEAP Program Office in the deployment of virtual language training. This includes a plan to train the eMentors on the technology; synchronous and asynchronous delivery of language training to students at any location with sufficient bandwidth; and virtual administration assistance covering such management functions as registration of students, enrollment of students, system training, course management, eMentor management, participant management, and assessment delivery.</p>
<p>4.5.1 The technology must provide synchronous delivery of training including real time audio and video of instructor, students, and course matter with little-to-no lag time, delay or connection failure during class time at any location equipped with sufficient internet connection (non-DOD networks as well as Non-Secure Internet Protocol Router (NIPR) connections)</p>
<p>4.5.2 The technology must be available to support classes 24/7.<br /><br />4.5.3 Technical support to troubleshoot and resolve any technical problems must be available 24/7. A tech support representative will actively observe and record every virtual classroom session for every eMentor cohort, making real-time adjustments as needed to correct any system problems or failures. A database will track every class, student attendance, downtime during class (as well as causes and actions taken), and any tutoring that is conducted. The system should be built for flexibility and correlate students' information with their respective cohort to identify trends such as attendance, behavior, tutoring, certification, etc. Weekly attendance will be made available to the LEAP Program Office. Monthly and other as-needed reports will be given to the LEAP Program Office so that the vendor's staff may take any necessary actions to maintain class operation and allow the LEAP Program Office to know how students and cohorts are progressing.</p>
<p>4.5.4 The desired technology should provide a fully collaborative environment that addresses the following requirements:</p>
<p>&bull; Light application - easy to install, easy to use<br />&bull; Compatible with Windows XP and later, MAC OS X 10.5 "Leopard" and greater<br />&bull; Multi-point video/audio for more than 15 concurrent participants <br />&bull; Optimized for standard, residential broadband Internet connections, but can be adjusted to work in<br />lower-bandwidth connections, as well as NIPR connections<br />&bull; Supports any standard USB webcam and headset<br />&bull; Supports High-Definition Video, PowerPoint, Word, Excel, and PDF document sharing<br />&bull; Fully collaborative whiteboard with on screen annotation<br />&bull; Supports international fonts and keyboard inputs (e.g. Chinese characters, etc)<br />&bull; Shared audio and video with ability for students/instructor to speak while shared media is playing<br />&bull; Shared web browser with ability to do live annotations on screen<br />&bull; Shared web browser with ability to share embedded audio and video (i.e. News videos, YouTube<br />videos, etc)<br />&bull; Live annotation with any standard application, web browser or whiteboard<br />&bull; Chat support<br />&bull; Can support creation of more than 100 separate virtual classrooms immediately with the ability to <br />expand as needed.</p>
<p><br />Provide additional information the Government should consider in developing a potential acquisition strategy.</p>
<p>Responses: There is no set format. Submissions should address all of the above and include any additional information which would assist the Government in formulating its acquisition strategy. All submissions become Government property and will not be returned.

<DESC>The mission of the Delta Leadership Institute ("DLI") is to recognize, train and develop the leadership skills needed for the 21st Century and for the global challenges of the future in the eight state Delta region. The board of the Delta Regional Authority ("DRA" or "the Authority") has initiated various programs to help the residents of the Delta to reach these goals. One of the priorities of the DRA is to improve the leadership skills of the region's current and future leaders. The Delta Leadership Institute is the vehicle through which the DRA will pursue these efforts. The result obtained from the implementation of the DLI programs will be the creation of a cadre of leaders that will work for future improvements in the region by "thinking and acting regionally".<br /><br />DRA has previously held seven years of the DLI. The purpose of this RFP is to expand and build upon DLI. The focus of the executive academy training is on regional leadership and topics important to DRA and the Region such as health, information technology, small business, bio-economy, transportation and education. DRA will require the contractor to secure prominent speakers on subject matters vital to the region at each of the sessions to be held in the DRA region and Washington, DC where the participants of DLI will be exposed to issues/cultural history in each of the cities where the meetings/sessions are held and a cultural outing or business excursion be provided at every location. Upon the completion of the Executive Academy the participants should possess the knowledge and skills necessary to make a direct impact in their community, county/parish, and state. <br />

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'">The District of Columbia Courts' Capital Projects and Facilities Management Division (CPFMD) is seeking the services of an Architect of Record (AOR) to implement the design of a 175,800 gross square foot (gsf) Project consisting of a 111,700 gsf addition to the H. Carl Moultrie I Courthouse and the demolition and reconstruction of 64,100 gsf of contiguous space within the existing structure. The addition is to be located on the south of the existing building. The Project will be phased to permit construction while the Courts remain fully operational. The AOR is to be responsible for the preparation of all architectural and engineering documents and the provision of all services necessary to realize the Courts' objectives. The Project is to achieve LEED Gold certification.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'">&nbsp;</span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'">The H.

The building houses the judicial operations of the D.C. Courts including courtrooms, judges' chambers, prisoner holding areas and other court support operations. The building is eight [8] stories in height and approximately 800,000 SF in size. It sits above a single level, secure, parking garage.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'">&nbsp;</span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'">The site of the new construction is nominally between the south fa&ccedil;ade of the existing Moultrie Courthouse and the proposed relocated north curb line of C Street</span> <span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'">NW, the existing property line along 6th Street</span> <span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'">NW and the west edge of John Marshall Plaza. The Project includes a proposed landscaped area which separates the public sidewalks from the building face providing both enhanced security and a civic amenity. The site design includes integral security elements and is consistent with the overall Master Plan for Judiciary Square.</span></p>

<CONTACT>Sara Stoops, Contracting Officer, Phone 301-435-0329, Fax 301-480-3432, Email stoopssb@mail.nih.gov
<DESC>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) is seeking a Clinical Coordinating Hub (Hub) for a NHLBI Engine For Fast Execution of Clinical Trials (EFFECT).  The purpose of this announcement is to provide a Presolicitation Notice for the release of Solicitation NHLBI-ECB-HR-2013-20-SS.  THIS IS A SYNOPSIS.  THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION.<br /><br />
<p>The Hub will be responsible for organizing a virtual network of approximately 40-50 Clinical Sites and executing one to three Clinical Trials in patients with serious pulmonary disease, especially patients requiring hospitalization for exacerbations of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD).  Trials may start in the inpatient setting and continue in the immediate post-discharge period.   The objective is to rigorously test the efficacy and/or effectiveness of treatments that have inadequate clinical trial evidence to support their confident use. This initiative will generate data that is urgently needed to inform the inpatient treatment of individuals experiencing acute exacerbations of COPD that require hospitalization. The trials of EFFECT may test medical and/or surgical interventions in Phase II or Phase III efficacy, effectiveness, or comparative effectiveness trials. Up to 5 foreign Sites may be included in the network. This organization will allow for considerable flexibility with regard to specific studies and for NHLBI oversight of study operations and budget.</p>
<p>Each of the Clinical Sites recruited by the Hub will have a Principal Investigator responsible for the conduct of trials at the site.  Trials will typically involve a total of approximately 500-700 subjects with severe exacerbations of COPD study wide.  The Hub will coordinate and manage the conduct of the trials at the Clinical Sites and will report to NHLBI.  Clinical Sites will also be responsible for collecting and shipping to the Hub high quality biospecimens as required to address study objectives.</p>
<p>The Hub will support the development and maintenance of a clinical structure ready to execute trials in hospitalized patients with COPD exacerbations. This includes recruiting and training Clinical Sites, writing a Manual of Procedures, developing and maintaining core data collection forms and a data management system, developing and maintaining a 508 compliant study website, managing study boards and committees, monitoring study compliance, analyzing trial results, and preparing a final data set.</p>
<p>1)	The NHLBI anticipates one award under the solicitation for a Hub.  The Hub shall be experienced and highly competent in the coordination of complex studies involving patients with severe pulmonary diseases, especially COPD.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2)	Key personnel of the Hub will have demonstrated expertise and leadership in biostatistics and clinical trial design and conduct as evidenced by a record of peer-reviewed publications.&nbsp;</p>
<p>3)	Key personnel of the Hub will also have demonstrated experience in clinical trials and be board-certified and actively involved in the care and treatment of patients hospitalized with severe pulmonary diseases, especially COPD.  This investigator should be actively involved in research involving pulmonary diseases.&nbsp;</p>
<p>4)	The Hub will develop a core collection of forms and data elements appropriate for screening, enrollment, phenotyping, medical record abstraction, follow-up, and outcomes assessment of subjects enrolled in inpatient trials of therapies for acute exacerbations of COPD.  The Hub will develop a data management system that provides for secure electronic transmission of data from the Clinical Sites, real-time range and error checking, quality assurance and control, reliable archiving of study data, timely generation of summaries and reports, and statistical analyses of trial data.</p>
<p>5)	Offerors will propose two protocols involving approximately 500-700 subjects, to test the efficacy of medical interventions designed to prevent readmissions within 30 days in COPD patients hospitalized for an acute exacerbation.  One trial protocol should be fully developed.  The second protocol does not need to be fully developed, but should contain sufficient detail to allow evaluation of its scientific merit and public health impact.&nbsp;</p>
<p>6)	The Hub will solicit ideas from the pulmonary research community at large regarding additional clinical trials in hospitalized patients with severe pulmonary diseases, especially COPD.</p>
<p>7)	The Hub will present trial Protocols to an Independent Board of Experts (IBE), a Protocol Review Committee (PRC), and a Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB); incorporate revisions recommended by the DSMB, and obtain approval of the NHLBI.</p>
<p>8)	The Hub will provide expertise in working with the FDA to obtain approvals for new drugs and/or devices.</p>
<p>9)	The Hub will be responsible for developing a plan for biospecimen collection by sites and storage at a central lab.&nbsp;</p>

The Naval Air Warfare Center Training Systems Division (NAWCTSD) intends to solicit and negotiate, on a sole source basis, a contract with the Bell Boeing Joint Project Office (BB JPO) located in Amarillo, TX under authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1, "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements."  

The United States Marine Corps (USMC) and Air Force (USAF) have identified a requirement to upgrade the existing V-22 flight training devices to maintain concurrency with the operational V-22 aircraft configuration, identified as Block C2.01 and 20.2.01 respectively.  In addition to the hardware and software upgrades required for this concurrency, initial provisioned items (spares), and associated technical data required for operational and maintenance support will also be procured for each flight training device.
  

BB JPO, the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) of the of the MV-22 and CV-22 aircraft platform and all MV-22 and CV-22 flight training devices procured to date, is the only responsible source capable of upgrading the current flight training devices to the aircraft configurations, Block C2.01 and 20.2.01 respectively.  Under contract with NAVAIRSYSCOM, BB JPO continues to further develop, manufacture, and deliver operational V-22 aircraft to the USMC and USAF, as well as upgrade existing operational V-22 aircraft.  The flight training device upgrades must be performed in parallel with operational aircraft development and upgrades using aircraft engineering data, not previously released to the Government, in order to be able to provide flight training capabilities concurrent with operational aircraft performance characteristics.
  To meet AFSOC Systems Training Plan and Marine Corps Aviation Plan objectives this concurrent training capability is required to exist when the upgraded aircraft configurations are delivered.  Concurrent training prior to delivery of the new aircraft configurations is essential for fleet readiness to support operations overseas and reduce aircraft operating costs associated with using the aircraft for training. As such, it is not possible for any other source to upgrade the existing training devices to the new configurations.

This synopsis is not a request for competitive proposals.  Interested sources desiring to contest this synopsis may do so by asserting its supportable rationale via email to Erin Barton, erin.barton@navy.mil in an electronic format that is compatible with Word 2003, no later than 15 May 2012 at 1300 EST.
 All information shall be furnished at no cost or obligation to the Government.  No solicitation document is available. If no written contest to this synopsis is received, a Justification and Approval (J&A) in accordance with FAR Part 6.303 based on the rationale provided above will be initiated.  If conducted as a sole source procurement with BB JPO, no further synopsis will be provided.

The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), Office of Affordable Housing Preservation (OAHP) has a need to solicit Post Closing Portfolio Management (PCPM) and Surplus Cash Analysis (SCA) for the support of HUD-held debt generated by several HUD programs. Also, HUD requires support for HUD's Project Managers (PMs) nationwide in analyzing certain unique loans that have been and will be created and held by HUD under the M2M Program, an earlier pilot program known as the Portfolio Re-Engineering Demonstration Program (Demo Program) and the Partial Payment of Claim (PPC) Program. The primary task is a review and analysis of each property's Annual Financial Statement (AFS) to verify the surplus cash calculation and to confirm that HUD received the correct payment. The M2M Program was established in the Multifamily Assisted Housing Reform and Affordability Act (MAHRA) which was created to restructure the FHA-insured or HUD-held mortgage loans on a large number of privately owned properties with above-market rents and expiring project-based Section 8 Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) Contracts. The PPC Program is conducted pursuant to authority found at the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Title 24, and Section 207.258(b). The Contractor shall review the AFS and prepare a SCA for approximately one thousand five hundred (1,500) restructured properties. HUD will provide the actual list of properties for which SCAs will be prepared and may add or remove properties from that list. The NAICS code is 523920 "Portfolio Management.

<DESC>The purpose of the proposed contract is to alleviate current capacity constraints in select governmental, non-governmental and other private organizations of key importance to the implementation of the USG's Post-Earthquake Strategy for Renewal and Economic Opportunity in Haiti. Specifically, USAID requires the services of a Contractor to provide Specialists to counterpart organizations addressing agreed programmatic objectives of:<br /><br />&bull; More Responsive Governance and Improved Rule of Law;<br />&bull; Increased Food and Economic Security; <br />&bull; Improved Health Status and Learning Environment; and, <br />&bull; Improved Infrastructure that Supports Community and Commercial&nbsp; Development.<br /><br />USG strategy is to engage the private sector in the reconstruction process, stimulate economic activity, and enhance the delivery of basic services in designated development corridors while promoting stronger democratic governance and rule of law. In implementing this strategy the USG seeks to build the capacity of state and local institutions to respond to local constituencies as a prerequisite to overall program sustainability.<br /><br />&bull;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">More Responsive Governance and Improved Rule of Law <br /></span>USG programs aim to help rebuild and reform public administration, improve local and national government resource management and basic service delivery; support the Haitian parliament to enable it to represent constituents, oversee federal reconstruction efforts, and draft and enact reform laws; strengthen judicial independence and operational capacity of the courts and criminal and civil justice systems; increase protection of human rights and vulnerable populations; renovate the corrections sector; develop national police capacity; and enhance transparency and combat corruption in GOH institutions.
<p>&bull;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Increased Food and Economic Security<br /></span>This is a two-part objective addressing job creation, increased productivity and improved well-being. The component parts are: <br />Food Security - Agriculture and Nutrition; and, <br />Economic Security - Support to Micro, Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises. The Mission's approach to Food Security is to align the development assistance program with GOH priorities and develop activities that are consistent with the U.S. global hunger and food security initiative (Feed the Future) . Activities are carried out in the three geographic corridors to increase agricultural productivity, improve watershed management, and strengthen agricultural markets. The Mission's Economic Security program aims to achieve job creation through micro, small and medium size enterprise development. Activities aim to enhance industry and firm competitiveness, ease access to financial products and services, and improve the business investment environment.</p>
<p>&bull; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Improved Health Status and Learning Environment<br /></span>The health and education sectors in Haiti are characterized by limited government capacity to provide services. The GOH is equally unable to regulate the quality of private sector service provision in these sectors. USG health and education programs aim to strengthen public institutional capacity while supporting current service delivery. The USG is a major contributor to strengthening Haiti's health system. A five-part program consists of primary care service delivery and targeted infectious disease prevention; capacity building for care and rehabilitation services for persons with disabilities; management reform and construction of public health infrastructure; overall systems and governance capacity building in the Ministry of Health; and development of comprehensive referral networks at the communal and departmental levels within the targeted geographic areas. The primary aim of the USG education program is to improve Ministry of Education capacity to plan, coordinate, and deliver quality education services, with a focus on early grade reading; contribute to the GOH's education reform plan via the Multi-Donor Trust Fund; increase the provision of complementary youth-focused services in targeted communities within the GOH development corridors; and facilitate public private partnerships for education.</p>
<p>&bull;<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> Improved Infrastructure that Supports Community and Commercial Development<br /></span>Investment in infrastructure reinforces other donor investments, capitalizes on USG programs in food and economic security and health, and catalyzes economic growth. Investment in shelter, energy and ports represent major new initiatives in the post-earthquake program. Rural road and irrigation system rehabilitation continues as an ongoing and important program investment in respect to agricultural productivity and improved marketing objectives.&nbsp; The USG is sponsoring a Shelter and Settlements program. The aim is to improve shelter sector performance in Haiti by upgrading neighborhoods, developing new settlements within the Port-au-Prince and Cap Haitien development corridors, strengthening urban management, and increasing access to housing finance. USAID is providing advisors to help in building the capacity of GOH, municipalities and community structures enabling local actors to play relevant roles in Haiti's recovery and reconstruction efforts.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Human and Institutional Capacity Building <br /></span>The Government of Haiti (GOH)&nbsp;prioritizes institutional rebuilding as one of four priorities. An essential precept for USG delivery of foreign assistance world-wide is the commitment to build the capacity of local partners to sustain development progress beyond the period of U.S. support. In Haiti, efforts are sponsored across the USG assistance portfolio of projects to strengthen the ability of the GOH and sub-national governing bodies, private sector entities, nongovernmental organizations, and other civil society institutions/organizations to implement programs effectively, and to achieve their strategic objectives with diminishing reliance over time on external technical assistance and financial support.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall provide management, administrative, and technical services to alleviate current capacity constraints in select governmental, non-governmental and other private organizations of key importance to the implementation of the USG's Post-Earthquake Strategy for Renewal and Economic Opportunity in Haiti. The recruitment and placement of individual subject matter experts is expected to provide the planning, managerial and other subject matter skills needed for GOH follow-through on the Action Plan for National Recovery and Development, and contribute to the implementation and achievement of mutually agreed objectives for sustained economic growth and development.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The recruitment and placement of&nbsp;technical advisors will be demand-driven in the collaborative undertaking of joint USG and GOH development programming. The skill and qualification requirements, purpose, objective and expected deliverables, time frame and duration of each technical advisor will be determined prior to recruitment and documented in an agreed scope of work for each specialist. In-country, locally-resident Haitian expertise is the preferred source for recruitment of identified skill requirements. Only upon determination of lack of in-country availability, is out-sourcing to US and other third-country nationals expected. Country-knowledge and French and Kreyol language skills may suggest the recruitment of Haitian diaspora when out-of-country sourcing is necessary. Monitoring of specialist performance against the terms of employment is a critical aspect of overall Contractor performance. Support of recruited personnel, especially expatriates, will be equally demanding and important. <br /><br />Work in Haiti can be a logistical and administrative challenge and as such, any personnel recruited must be capable of working in a demanding and difficult environment.</p>

<DESC>Solicitation Number: <br />TBD
<p>Notice Type: <br />Sources Sought - Request for Information (RFI)</p>
<p>Synopsis:</p>
<p>The United States Air Force (USAF) is requesting information from interested parties on aircraft sun shades (here after referred to as "shelters) to protect aircraft for Air Combat Command (ACC) and selected overseas deployed locations. Currently, ACC is investigating various options to standardize shelter procurement and sustainment (maintenance).<br />16b. PURPOSE<br />The purpose of this RFI is to seek information on current and existing technologies (to include minor modifications to existing technologies) that can be used to answer the questions listed in paragraph 16c for all metal sun shades. This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes. It does not constitute a solicitation (Request for Proposal or Request for Quotations) or a promise to issue a solicitation in the future. This RFI does not commit the USAF to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. At this time, proposals are not requested. Responders are advised the USAF will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI. All costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the responder's expense. The USAF will not be obligated to pursue any particular acquisition alternative as a result of this RFI. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future solicitation. All information received in response to this RFI that is marked PROPRIETARY will be handled accordingly. Proprietary information or trade secrets should be clearly identified. The USAF will not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for any proprietary information not properly identified. Proprietary information will be safeguarded in accordance with the applicable government regulations.</p>
<p>16c. AIRCRAFT SUN SHADE INFORMATION SOUGHT<br />Questions:</p>
<p>Q-1. Does your company offer a commercial warranty and if so what does the commercial warranty specifically cover?</p>
<p>Q-2. Is this warranty negotiable as to what it will cover and can it be changed to cover the following sustainment inspection/maintenance items:</p>
<p>a. Within 48 hours of notification from the Contracting Officer (CO), or designated representative, of a storm incident - A contractor representative will be on site to inspect the sun shades for structural integrity and safety; there will be no charge for this service. Maximum of 2 trips per year for the first 5 years after acceptance from the Government.</p>
<p>b. Inspect all columns, beams, joists, girders and lateral cross bracing for proper connections, faulty/cracked welds, loose or missing bolts and corrosion. Tighten bolts to manufacturer specifications or replace if necessary. Treat corrosion and fatigue IAW manufacturer's specifications.</p>
<p>c. Inspect turnbuckles and cables for severe corrosion, fraying or breaks, tightness, proper connection and security. Repair or replace IAW manufacturer's specifications.</p>
<p>d. Inspect for loose/missing and damaged attaching hardware. Tighten or replace IAW manufacturer's specifications.</p>
<p>e. Inspect anchor plate bolts for embedment, tightness and severe corrosion. Tighten and treat corrosion as required IAW manufacturer's specifications.</p>
<p>f. Inspect anchor plate for levelness (i.e. ensure it is flat on the ground).</p>
<p>g. Inspect concrete around all anchor plates for cracks/spalling.</p>
<p>h. Inspect frame for severe corrosion, treat corrosion as necessary.</p>
<p>i. Inspect roof panels and fasteners for security. Tighten or replace IAW manufacturer's specifications.</p>
<p>j. Inspect for loose/missing and damaged attaching hardware. Tighten or replace IAW manufacturer's specifications.</p>
<p>k. Inspect metal roof for severe corrosion, treat corrosion or replace IAW manufacturer's specifications.</p>
<p>l. If installed, inspect gutters to ensure they are securely fastened. If loose or damaged, tighten/repair or replace IAW manufacturer's specifications.</p>
<p>m. If equipped, inspect bird netting and fasteners for tightness. If loose or damaged, tighten, repair or replace IAW manufacturer's specifications.</p>
<p><br />Q-3. Will your company give consideration in order to keep the "bottom line" between a commercial warranty and sun shade sustainment the same? For instance, would you be willing to shorten the standard commercial warranty period for workmanship and defects, corrosion and deterioration if a sustainment piece is added to cover inspection, repair and reporting? Possibly a shorter warranty for all of the items?</p>
<p>Q-4. Is it more cost-effective for the Government to sustain sun shades via a warranty or a service sustainment contract?</p>
<p>Q-5. If your company is willing to provide a warranty for the sustainment piece of inspection, repair and reporting for a lesser cost than a sustainment contract, can this warranty be extended at a similar price? If so, for how many years at a time? What would possibly change this cost (higher or lower) when extending?</p>
<p>Q-6. What if a separate contractor installs the sun shade?</p>
<p>a. What liability is held by the Government?<br />b. By the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM)? (We assume that if the installation contractor is sub-contractor to the prime/OEM, the OEM is held liable)</p>
<p>Q-7. What would void your standard commercial warranty?</p>
<p>Q-8. How long would it take to build the following all metal sun shades for the following sizes (both lead-time for parts as well as installation):</p>
<p>a. Length 73', Width 78', Height 38'6"<br />b. Length 54'6", Width 146'2", Height 35'6"<br />c. Length 162'11", Width 175'9", Height 72'9"</p>

<p>STATEMENT OF DUTIES</p>
<p>GENERAL STATEMENT OF THE PURPOSE OF THIS CONTRACT AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE CONTRACTOR</p>
<p>A. General Statement of Contract Purpose<br />The Bureau for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL) is responsible for the development, supervision, coordination, and implementation of international narcotics control and law enforcement assistance activities and international criminal justice issues for the Department of State (DOS). Since 2002, INL's Afghanistan/Pakistan Program Office (INL/AP) through its in-country presence at the Narcotics Affairs Sections (NAS) at US Embassy Islamabad and US Consulate Peshawar, have managed several programs to build the capacity of the Government of Pakistan's (GOP) law enforcement and border security personnel through training, mentoring, equipping, and infrastructure assistance.</p>
<p>To date, these programs have built useful relationships and positive results across the country. Law enforcement personnel in Pakistan routinely face improvised explosive device bombings, assassinations, kidnappings, and other terrorism-related contingencies, in additional to standard criminality. Following the deterioration in security in Pakistan's northwest region in 2009, NAS Islamabad quickly and substantially enhanced its law enforcement effort in Pakistan, beginning with an effort to build the capacities of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Police Elite Force through technical support, training, equipping, and infrastructure assistance. Since then, the program has expanded to include police from the remaining provinces, levies in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas and Balochistan, and other federal law enforcement entities.</p>
<p>Position Elements<br />1) Supervisory Controls<br />The SPA reports to and receives broad policy guidance and general direction from the NAS Director and Deputy Director. The SPA is responsible for planning and implementing many aspects of organizational and project and logistical operations. The SPA coordinates and communicates with the NAS Islamabad and the INL/AP Pakistan Team. The SPA's actions, decisions, and recommendations are reviewed on the basis of results achieved and conformance with appropriate laws and regulations. The SPA must depend in part on his/her own professional judgment to further the mission of NAS. <br />2) Guidelines<br />The SPA is recognized as a substantive authority on overall management and/or interpretation of guidance on program and project planning and evaluation in a specialized area. Therefore, guidelines for this position consist of USG and DOS Acquisition Regulations, and accepted legal principles and theories. In addition, incumbent must be able to determine application of basic administrative policy statements concerning the issue or problem being studied. The incumbent must also consider and adhere to various other existing federal regulations, and the interaction between DOS policies, legislation, the Foreign Assistance Act, and other authorization and appropriations in the INL account, applicable National Security and Presidential Decision Directives, OMB Circulars, and Department of State financial operating procedures and policies. <br />3) Complexity<br />Develops detailed plans, goals, and objectives for the long-range implementation and administration of the program, and/or develops criteria for evaluating the effectiveness of the program. Coordinating plans with various other groups including international donors, the US Embassy, and the GOP can be complicated. Projects require dynamic leadership and expertise and complex innovation, strict adherence to high-level policy without lower level interpretive assistance, and the ability to single-handedly or in concert with a variety of other stakeholders resolve critical problems and achieve difficult goals that may affect other programs. <br />4) Scope and Effectiveness<br />The SPA completes extensive assignments in support of DOS, INL, and GOP priorities and activities. Assignments are broad in scope and complicated by many complex features and are technically, administratively, or politically sensitive in nature.<br />5) Personal Contacts<br />The SPA works closely with the INL Director, Deputy Director, INL staff (including third-party contractors and locally hired staff), and embassy personnel. In addition, the SPA maintains contact with host government officials, other law enforcement agencies as needed, and international and non-governmental organizations. The SPA works closely with INL Office of Afghanistan and Pakistan Affairs (INL/AP) in Washington DC as well. <br />6) Travel<br />Frequent travel in and around Pakistan is required with other occasional international travel.<br />7) Work Environment<br />Primarily, work is conducted in an office setting and sedentary in nature. The position is located at US Embassy Islamabad. <br />8) Level of Effort<br />The level of effort required over the period of this contract is 100%. The position is full-time, with a minimum of 40 hours per week and based on the core hours of the US Embassy Islamabad. Occasional work on weekends or after regular work hours is required.</p>

<p>STATEMENT OF DUTIES</p>
<p>GENERAL STATEMENT OF THE PURPOSE OF THIS CONTRACT AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE CONTRACTOR</p>
<p>A. BACKGROUND. The Bureau for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL) is responsible for the development, supervision, coordination and implementation of international narcotics control and law enforcement assistance activities and international criminal justice issues for the Department of State. Since 2002, INL's Afghanistan/Pakistan Program Office (INL/AP) through its in-country presence at the Narcotics Affairs Sections (NAS) at U.S. Embassy Islamabad and U.S. Consulate Peshawar, have managed several programs to build the capacity of the Government of Pakistan's (GOP) law enforcement and border security personnel through training, mentoring, equipping, and infrastructure assistance. To date, these programs have built useful relationships and positive results across the country. Law enforcement personnel in Pakistan routinely face improvised explosive device bombings, assassinations, kidnappings, and other terrorism-related contingencies, in additional to standard criminality. Following the deterioration in security in Pakistan's northwest region in 2009, NAS Islamabad quickly and substantially enhanced its law enforcement effort in Pakistan, beginning with an effort to build the capacities of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Police Elite Force through technical support, training, equipping, and infrastructure assistance. Since then, the program has expanded to include police from the remaining provinces, levies in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas and Balochistan, and other federal law enforcement entities.</p>
<p>B. PURPOSE. The Deputy Senior Police Advisor (DSPA) will serve as an in-country advisor responsible for implementing NAS Islamabad's civilian law enforcement assistance efforts. The DSPA will work within Embassy Islamabad under the direct supervision of the NAS Director, Deputy Director, and the Senior Police Advisor. S/he will provide subject matter expertise to the NAS on law enforcement matters, coordinating efforts as they relate to mission objectives, the size and structure of the international police presence, USG roles and responsibilities for civilian policing, developing Pakistani law enforcement capacities and institutions, USG police assistance, and training plans. The DSPA will oversee the development and expansion of INL's civilian law enforcement program. This includes, but is not limited to, coordination with Pakistani authorities, management of police training, curriculum development, training center and police station construction, logistical and security planning, vendor/contractor coordination, and commodity provision to host nation law enforcement entities. The DSPA will serve as the senior law enforcement expert within the NAS in the absence of the Senior Police Advisor.</p>
<p><br />C. POSITION ELEMENTS. Supervisory Controls: The DSPA reports to and receives broad policy guidance and general direction from the NAS Director, Deputy Director, and Senior Police Advisor. The incumbent is responsible for planning and implementing many aspects of organizational and project and logistical operations. The DSPA coordinates and communicates with the NAS Islamabad and the INL/AP Pakistan Team. The DSPA's actions, decisions, and recommendations are reviewed on the basis of results achieved and conformance with appropriate laws and regulations. The DSPA must depend in part on his/her own professional judgment to further the mission of NAS.</p>

If questions and discussion topics are submitted in advance they will be kept confidential up to the time of the session. The session will not be restricted to those questions and discussion topics.
WRITTEN RESPONSES:  If providing a written response to the following questions, please submit not later than May 7, 2012 to: gabrielle.harris2@va.gov.    
1.	What is the business size and socioeconomic status of your organization?

2.	What kind of geographical coverage does your organization have, i.e. regional, national? If regional how do you determine your coverage area? 

3.	Does your organization provide coverage in U.S. Territories (i.e. Puerto Rico, Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands, American Samoa, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands). Does providing coverage in U.S. Territories present any potential issues?

4.	The country will likely be divided up into five regions. The regions are defined by VA Integrated Service Networks (VISNs) grouped by geography. While VISNs will be kept intact, there will be multiple states in each region an some states could be split between regions.  A map of the tentative regional breakout is included at the end of this document. Does this pose any potential issues providing coverage? 

5.	Do you see any potential issues with the insurance provider being completely responsible for administering the insurance plans and managing the relationship to include premium collection directly with beneficiaries? 

6.	Does the industry have network adequacy standards, if so what are they? 

7.	Does your organization have any recommendations on how to incorporate access standards across the country that aren't too detailed but are still enforceable contract standards? 

8.	VHA will not provide lists of eligible beneficiaries, but is exploring the use of  EDI 270/271 Health Care Eligibility Benefit Inquiry and Requests to verify eligibility real time. The intended verbiage is included below, please provide any issues with this solution.

	The Contractor must have established (time will be allotted-60 days contemplated) a contractual relationship for transactions with the VA's EDI (Electronic Data Interchange) clearinghouse contractor (To Be Determined-TBD) prior to enrolling Veterans in VADIP, or as an alternative, use their own "value-added" contractor that has an existing relationship with the VA's EDI contractor.
If VA changes the EDI clearinghouse contractor, all contracted carriers will be given ample notice and the ability to establish a working arrangement with the new clearinghouse. All EDI transactions accepted for this effort will have to go through this clearinghouse and responses will be returned through this clearinghouse.  All costs associated to transactions between the contracted entity and the EDI contractor is the responsibility of the contracted entity.  This solution would only provide eligibility verification and Personally Identifiable Information (PII) information has to be maintained according to approved VA standards and regulations.  
Normal method for receiving eligibility information on the prospective Veteran is by submission of the standard formatted 270 transaction set that results in the responding 271 standard formatted transaction set being returned with eligibility status via the EDI clearinghouse Contractor. Standard information returned by this EDI transaction is Name, Gender, SS#, Enrolled or Not Enrolled, Enrollment Date and Veteran Primary Facility. Current charges are estimated at eighteen cents (.18) for Veteran verification and twenty two cents (.22) for a CHAMPVA beneficiary.
9.	At a minimum what information would your organization need to market the insurance program? 

10.	VA will not be able to preempt state law. Does that present any obstacles in contracting at the regional or national level? If so what are those obstacles? Please provide recommendations.

11.	What are your hours for customer support? 

12.	Do you have any recommendations for the Schedule of Services, Contract Line Items (CLINS) structure?

13.	What are the drivers for premium adjustment and can adjustments be made on an annual basis or are more frequent adjustments recommended? (This would exclude the base period of performance, rates would be set for the first period.)

14.	The law mandating this program does not allow for coverage of non-beneficiary dependents.  We do not intend to restrict the industry's ability to provide insurance plans outside of VA's Dental Insurance Program if the beneficiary requests coverage for non-eligible dependents, however this coverage cannot be provided under the purview of this program or through resultant contracts.  Can your organization provide similar plans to non-eligible dependents? If so, will your organization provide detailed reports to VA regarding the number of non-eligible dependents who have signed up for other plans and the premium costs that they incurred for those plans? This information might be reported to Congress.

15.	If awarded a contract, what period of time is necessary to ramp up and begin enrolling beneficiaries to include building a web page for the VA Dental Insurance Plan, and start receiving phone calls from beneficiaries? If willing please provide an estimated timeline with associated actions. 
16.	Describe, how your organization would market the program and how this differs from your typical enrollment campaign and why.
17.	What do you consider the major challenges in the education/communication of the VADIP? What approaches do you propose to overcome these obstacles?
18.	How do you intend to provide individualized advice and counseling?  
19.	Will customer service representatives (CSR)/counselors be dedicated to the VADIP Program account?  If no, how will you ensure that they consistently represent the VADIP Program appropriately?
20.	If possible, based on your past experience and based on the estimated population please provide your enrollment projections for the first and second enrollment years and the rationale for your projections.
21.	Detail your web-based or online capabilities.  Do you have all of them in place now or are they in planning? Provide examples, URLs, and references.
22.	Detail your contingency plan for system overload on education and information requests from both a technology and/or staff sufficiency basis. 
23.	What education and advertising resources have you found to be most effective for large groups, and why?  How would you propose to utilize these for the VADIP Program?  

24.	 Do you have any recommendations that would simplify the insurance industries administrative efforts and reduce the price of premiums while still meeting the objectives of the pilot?

25.	Are there portions of the Performance Work Statement that are not in-line with industry standards?

DRAFT 
SECTION B.3 PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT 
1.  Overview: The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Health Eligibility Center (HEC), through the Denver Acquisition and Logistic Center (DALC) intends to contract with qualified dental insurance carriers to provide insurance plans to eligible VA beneficiaries and administrative services to support the program.  Coverage for dental services will be provided in the United States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands, American Samoa, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands.
The Department of Veterans Affairs, Chief Business Office's (CBO) Health Eligibility Center (HEC), serves as the National Service Center for registration, enrollment and eligibility activities and serves as the business owner for administrative information systems supporting the delivery of VA health care benefits.  The HEC achieves VA's Gold Standard of honoring America's veterans by providing accurate and timely health care eligibility and enrollment determinations and accurate, responsive and respectful customer service.
HEC supports VA's health care delivery system by providing centralized eligibility verification and enrollment processing services. HEC determines veteran's health eligibility and facilitates the process by providing guidance to the field through training, and collaborates with CBO Policy and other administrative offices on the implementation of policy. 
2.  Background: Section 510 of the Caregivers and Veterans Omnibus Health Services Act of 2010, Pub. L. 111-163 (the 2010 Act) proposes that the VA shall carry out a pilot program to assess the feasibility and advisability to offer competitive, private, premium-based dental insurance to enrolled Veterans and certain survivors and dependents of Veterans.  The private insurer shall be responsible for virtually all aspects of the administration of the dental insurance plan.  VA's role is to administer the contract with the private insurer and verify eligibility of Veterans, survivors and dependents.  
3. Objectives:  The statement of objectives represents the desired outcomes of this contract.  These objectives are supported by technical requirements identified throughout the Performance Work Statement (PWS). Objectives are as follows: 
3.1 Carry out a pilot program to provide and administer a dental insurance plan(s) to Veterans and the Civilian Health and Medical Program of the VA (CHAMPVA) beneficiaries.
3.2 Provide desirable enrollment options and plan benefits. 
3.3 Maximize number of participants through marketing efforts, customer satisfaction, and versatile services
3.4 Customer Service - provides and maintains high levels of enrollee and provider satisfaction 
4.  Scope of Work:  
The contractor will provide all personnel and resources necessary to provide the services in this Performance Work Statement (PWS).  Contractors will provide and manage dental insurance plans for eligible beneficiaries, performing all administrative tasks and associated financial transactions.  
Eligible beneficiaries include (1) any Veteran who is enrolled under 38 U.S.C. 1705 in accordance with 38 CFR 17.36 and (2) any survivor or dependent of a Veteran who is eligible for medical care under 38 U.S.C. 1781, which includes participants in CHAMPVA under 38 CFR 17.271.  Throughout the remainder of the document, eligible beneficiaries will be referred to as "eligible Veterans and CHAMPVA beneficiaries."
Total enrollment in the VA healthcare system is roughly 7.4 million.  Independent studies estimate participation in VADIP to be between 100,000 and 300,000, depending on the success of the marketing and outreach programs to these Veterans and beneficiaries.  Truly successful marketing programs could result in higher participation.  Approximately 61 percent of the eligible populations are age sixty or older.  
The Law mandating this program does not allow for coverage of beneficiary dependents.  We do not intend to restrict the industry's ability to provide insurance plans outside of the VA Dental Insurance Program if the beneficiary requests this directly to the insurance carrier, however it cannot be provided under the purview of this program or through resultant contracts.
5. Marketing: VA, will market VADIP through existing communication channels (internally-facing and externally-facing websites), as well as through print media (posters and brochures).  VA will also publish press releases and present plan information at Veteran Service Organization meetings.   
The contractor, in connection with VA will be responsible for notifying all eligible persons of their right to voluntarily enroll in VADIP. The contractor shall be responsible for continued marketing efforts. The Contractor will capitalize the "V" in Veteran, per VA communication standards.  The contractor shall submit an annual education (or marketing) plan to inform and educate VA beneficiaries and network providers on all aspects of the VADIP.  The plan at a minimum must include the contractor's approach and marketing techniques identified and accepted in its original proposal.  The VA Program Office will review the plan and provide concurrence or feedback for recommended changes.  
The Contractor shall not utilize any beneficiary Protected Health Information (PHI) or personally identifiable information (including enrollees' addresses and phone numbers) for any purpose other than enrollment and/or administration of dental benefits.  However, the Contractor is permitted to market and enroll family members in a non-VADIP plan. It must be clear the VA does not endorse or include family member's enrollment and plan as part of VADIP. 
6. Eligibility, Enrollment and Disenrollment:
6.1 Enrollment: The participating insurer will manage the enrollment process,  notify all eligible persons to include providing instruction on its enrollment process to beneficiaries  The contractor will verify the beneficiaries eligibility through VA prior to informing potential beneficiary of their eligibility or ineligibility for the program or beginning the enrollment process.  
The initial period of enrollment will be for a period of 12 calendar months, followed by month-to-month enrollment as long as the insured remains eligible for coverage and chooses to continue enrollment, so long as VADIP continues to authorize the insurance plan.
The participating insurer will agree to continue to provide coverage to an insured that ceases to be eligible for at least 30 calendar days after eligibility ceased. The insured must pay any premiums due during this 30 day period.  This 30 day coverage does not apply to an insured who is disenrolled under any of the scenarios outlined in the disenrollment section below. 
6.2 Eligibility Verification: Through VA and Contractor marketing efforts, Veterans will be contacting the Contractor by phone, web or other means of communication. The Contractor will start the enrollment process by querying for eligibility status through approved means once the potential Veteran or CHAMPVA beneficiary contacts the Contractor Call Center.  The eligibility verification process will be determined at a later date.  
6.3 Disenrollment: Insured beneficiaries may be involuntarily disenrolled at any time for failure to make premium payments.  Insured beneficiaries will be voluntarily disenrolled, and will not be required to continue to pay any copayments or premiums, under the following circumstances:
	a. For any reason, during the first 30 days that the beneficiary is covered by the plan, if no dental 	services or benefits were used by the insured
	b. If the insured relocates to an area outside the jurisdiction of the plan that prevents the use of 	the benefits under the plan.
	c. If the insured asserts that he or she is prevented by serious medical condition from being able 	to obtain benefits under the plan, or that he or she would suffer severe financial hardship by 	continuing in VADIP.
	d. For any reason during the month to month coverage period, after the initial 12 month 	enrollment period.
6.4 Requests for Disenrollment:  All insured requests for disenrollment will be submitted to the insurer for determination of whether the insured qualifies for disenrollment.  Requests for disenrollment due to financial hardship or serious medical condition must include submission of written documentation that verifies the existence of a serious medical condition or financial hardship. The written documentation submitted to the insurer must show that circumstances leading to a serious medical condition or financial hardship originated after the effective date coverage began, and will prevent the insured from maintaining the insurance benefits.

7.9 Benefit Plan Designs (to be completed by offeror(s) with proposal submission and incorporated into contract(s) as a result of the RFP and evaluation process). 
7.9 General Policies: All covered dental services are subject to the following general policies: 
Services must be necessary and meet accepted standards of dental practice. Services determined to be unnecessary or which do not meet accepted standards of practice are not billable to the patient by a participating dentist unless the dentist notifies the patient of their liability prior to treatment and the patient chooses to receive the treatment. Participating dentists shall document such notification in their records.
An appeal is not available when the services are determined to be unnecessary or do not meet accepted standards of dental practice unless the dentist notifies the patient of his/her liability prior to treatment and the patient makes the decision to receive the treatment. This is because such services are not billable to the patient, and there would be no amount in dispute to consider at appeal. 
Procedures must be reported using the American Dental Association's (ADA) current dental procedure codes and terminology (CDT). 
Covered services will include only those which have an associated CDT code.  Adjunctive services are not covered under this contract.
Services, including evaluations, which are routinely performed in conjunction with or as part of another service, are considered integral. Participating dentists may not bill members for services denied if they are considered integral to another service. 
Charges for the completion of claim forms and submission of required information for determination of benefits are not payable to participating dentists by either the contractor or the enrollee. 
8.  Network Requirements: The Contractor must provide a stable, high-quality network or networks of general dental care participating providers that are available to all enrolled Veterans and CHAMPVA beneficiaries. The network must include appropriate specialty care providers such as oral surgeons and endodontists.
8.2   VA requires nationwide coverage which could be comprised of national options, regional options, or    a combination thereof.  
8.3  The Contractor must provide a robust network of dental providers in order to ensure adequate access to Veterans. The network must provide enrollees with provider selection within a reasonable distance from their homes, and must ensure that enrollees are able to obtain an appointment within a reasonable amount time. Reasonable is defined as beneficiaries traveling a distance that is not extreme or excessive in terms of travel time where dental services are readily available in the community based on a reasonable person's expectation. The contractor must provide and maintain adequate networks for the delivery of dental services. Network adequacy is based on proposed and accepted distances to general and specialty dentists in urban, rural, and highly rural areas.  Network adequacy must be based on the percentage of available access to general dentistry care within the proposed and accepted mileage.
8.4  Allowed charges for out-of-network providers will be 100 percent of the usual, customary, and reasonable charges for the area (50th percentile charged in the region according to the Fair Health Data).  For geographic areas that do have enough dental providers to meet the contracts minimum access standards, there is no requirement for the carrier to offer an out of network benefit, except in the case of emergency care, or in exceptional cases where no network provider is available to provide a covered service.  
8.5  All preferred providers must accept the patient cost sharing as payment in full at the point of  service.
8.6  All provider contracts must indicate that the provider cannot bill the patient for covered services provided during a period for which premiums have been paid for other than stated patient cost sharing.  Alternately, an offeror may provide proof of reinsurance to protect Veterans and CHAMPVA beneficiaries in the event of plan insolvency.
8.8 Prior to the payment of any claim for dental services, the Contractor shall ensure that the provider has complied with the licensure requirements established by the state in which the services were rendered.  Claims for services rendered by providers who do not meet applicable licensure requirements shall be denied.  
9. Administration: The Contractor shall provide Veterans and CHAMPVA beneficiaries a full suite of integrated benefit and financial tools that can provide individualized help in selecting the right type of benefits and level of coverage for each unique circumstance.  
9.1 Information Technology: The Contractor shall provide Veterans and CHAMPVA beneficiaries' information with which to compare available dental plans and select the plan which best meets his or her needs. The contractor will establish a website for the VADIP to allow public access to check for eligibility and to compare available plans to facilitate a decision by eligible participants on selecting a dental plan.  Minimum features shall include:
A tool that will allow an individual accessing the site self-determine if they would be eligible for benefits.  (Business rules will be provided by VHA.)
A dynamic side-by-side comparison table of features (coverage, copays, deductibles, exclusions, inclusions, special notes and premiums as a minimum).

Directing callers to other VA business areas based on caller needs.
 9.3 Premiums:  VADIP premiums are determined by each contracted insurance provider annually, in consultation with VA.  Premiums will vary based on geographic location of the enrollee (his or her residence address). VADIP plans may have up to five rating regions.  During enrollment, a Veteran or CHAMPVA beneficiary can enroll in a regional plan only if he or she lives in a ZIP code serviced by the plan.  If the enrollee moves during the plan year, there may be a change in premium due to a change in the rating region or a change in the plan because the enrollee no longer lives in a regional plan's service area.
9.4  Claims Processing: The Contractor shall process dental care claims to completion (payment or denial) in an accurate manner, within the timeframe established by each state's insurance policy/regulations or, if not defined at state level, within 30 days of receipt from provider. Non-	network provider claims filed by the enrollee shall be paid to the enrollee in U.S. Dollars. The Contractor shall retain all claims that contain sufficient information to allow processing and all claims for which missing information may be developed from in-house sources, including Contractor-operated or maintained electronic, paper, or film files.
9.5  Dental Explanation of Benefits (DEOB): An industry standard Dental Explanation of Benefits (DEOB) is expected to be provided to each beneficiary and provider. Information provided in the DEOB is expected to follow Federal HIPAA and privacy standards.
9.6  Appeals:  Denials of voluntary disenrollment; when the participating insurer denies a request for voluntary disenrollment, the participating insurer will issue a written decision and notify the insured of the basis for the denial and how to appeal.  The participating insurer will establish the form of such appeals whether orally, in writing, or both.  The decision and notification of appellate rights will be issued to the insured no later than 30 days after the request for voluntary disenrollment is received by the participating insurer.  The appeal will be decided and issued in writing to the insured no later than 30 days after it is received by the participating insurer.
All other appeals:  Procedures for appeals of any issue other than a denial of a request for voluntary disenrollment will be established by, and be the responsibility of, the participating insurer.
An enrollee has the right to appeal to the VA the Contractor's determination that a disenrollment request does not qualify under the preceding paragraphs.  The enrollee may appeal that determination by submitting a written request to the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR).
10. Reporting Requirements and Deliverables

<DESC>The U.S. Army Product Manager Soldier Clothing and Individual Equipment has identified the need for a capacitive touch screen compatible Army combat glove built to purchase description (PD) GL-PD-08-081C GLOVES, COMBAT, ARMY. The design shall be allowed to vary from (PD) GL-PD-08-081C GLOVES, COMBAT, ARMY only when necessary to implement the capacitive capability and/or highly increase the tactility and accuracy of use with the smart device.<br><br>The intentions of this RFI are to investigate capacitive touch screen compatible gloves that meet minimum Flame Resistant (FR) and heat and thermal requirements. The capacitive gloves are being researched to determine if there are available options to provide Soldiers the capability to wear combat survivable gloves while manipulating a Graphic User Interface and tactical software applications loaded on a Commerical-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) smart device (i.e. smartphones and tablets with capacitive touch screen displays) in a combat environment.  The smart device will reside inside a protective case making the corners of the capacitive touch display difficult to reach due to the depth and sharp angles of the case.  Therefore the capacitive glove must be form fitting to the hand, focused on the fingers and finger tips in order to provide more tactile accuracy when interacting with the capacitive touch screen.  <br><br>Aside from PM SCIE's interest in capacitive gloves, The Nett Warrior (NW) program, a Program of Record within PEO Soldier, is also a stakeholder in the capability.  The NW system will be fielded to Team Leaders and above across 38 Brigade Combat Teams between FY13 and FY16.  Soldiers receiving the NW system will require a capacitive touch glove to operate the NW system in a combat environment.<br><br>Interested firms that currently or will have capabilities that can meet the requirements of this product description are requested to submit relevant information on their product and company within ten (10) days following the publication of this RFI. Any relevant company background/experience, business category, costs, and any other information that the company believes demonstrates their value/ability to meet the aforementioned requirements should be included. Respondents must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) Database and provide a DUNS number. Firms may register for the CCR at www.ccr.gov. All information and evaluation results will be controlled and used for Governmental purposes only. The submitted responses and data will be reviewed by both Government and embedded support contractor personnel.  <br><br>Responses to this notice are to be sent to PM Soldier Clothing and Individual Equipment, ATTN RDNS-WPW-C Ms. Stacey Lee, 15 Kansas Street, BLDG 4, Natick, MA 01760-5000. This notice is for information only. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATIONS. No solicitation document exists for this action. POC for this request is Ms. Stacey Lee (508) 233-5118, FAX (508) 233-4795 or e-mail stacey.l.lee8.civ@mail.mil (Please note email change from previous notices). E-mail responses should include Company Name and Sources Sought Number in the subject line, and a short synopsis which includes the following items of information: CAGE Code, Company Name, Business Type (Large, Small, HUB Zone), Qualification (i.e. current producer of iCVC, can meet production), Estimated Price, and NAIC Code.

<DESC>This NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD A SOLE SOURCE CONTRACT is conducted in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 12, Commercial Items. The authority for this award is FAR 13.106(b), soliciting from a single source; Purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, contracting officers may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available.
<p>The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) has a requirement, in support of its mission of "Recruiting, Retaining and Honoring a World-Class Workforce to Serve the American People," to provide graduate level educational course(s) in support of the Federal Executive Institute's (FEI) program for senior executives in the Federal government. OPM intends to issue a non-competitive award that will result in a purchase order to National Preparedness Leadership Initiative Harvard University 8 Story Street, Suite 310 Cambridge, MA 02138. The graduate course will be delivered at the FEI in Charlottesville, VA . The period of performance for this award shall be from the date of award through July 30, 2012.</p>
<p>The National Preparedness Leadership Initiative (NPLI) is "a joint venture of the Harvard School of Public Health's Division of Policy Translation and Leadership Development and the Harvard Kennedy School's Center for Public Leadership, developed the framework for the Meta-Leadership approach. NPLI works in collaboration with key government agencies to ensure today's unprecedented challenges are met with uncommon leadership from federal, state, and local officials and encourages connectivity across public, private, and non-profit sectors." NPLI/Harvard School of Public Health created the course curriculum integrated into the FEI Leadership for a Democratic Society (LDS) Program. To ensure senior executives and managers receive the same high quality program and to standardize the information provided, it is in the best interest of the Government to procure these services from Harvard University.</p>
<p>NPLI's approach to dealing with challenges faced by modern leaders is called Meta-Leadership. Meta-leadership is an overarching leadership framework for strategically linking the efforts of different organizations or organizational units to provide guidance, direction, and momentum across organizational lines that develop into a shared course of action and commonality of purpose among people and agencies that are doing what may appear to be very different work. These principles dovetail appropriately with the competencies and methods participants of FEI's Leadership for a Democratic Society (LDS) master during their time in Charlottesville. This program will provide federal executives in LDS with exposure to the concepts of Meta-Leadership.</p>

<DESC>This is an Indefinite Quantity (IQC) Solicitation under FAR Part 12 Procedures. This procurement is for an AEQ of 1,000 EA of a Pivot-Pylon Shaft. NSN: 5315-01-322-8846 is coded "1-G / Fully Competitive Item", and solicitation is being issued "100% Restricted to Small Businesses". This solicitation requests offers on a stock basis only, and will contain a guaranteed minimum of 10%. Award of a fixed-price, with economic price adjustment contract, is contemplated. The proposed contract is for a two year base, and contains an option to extend the term of the contract for three (3) additional years, on a yearly basis.
<p>Contractor First Article Testing is required. Expected delivery for First Article Test Report is 120 days. Production should be delivered 120 days after approval of FAT Test Report.</p>
<p>All offers shall be in the English language and in U.S. dollars. All qualified sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the agency.</p>
<p>The anticipated award date is September 28, 2012. Inspection &amp; Acceptance will be at ORIGIN. FOB at DESTINATION. Delivery shall be to any destination within the Continental United States, and the District of Colombia, excluding Alaska and Hawaii.</p>
<p>Proposals will be evaluated to determine compliance with the terms and conditions of the solicitation. The resultant contract will be based on the technically acceptable, lowest evaluated priced proposal.</p>
<p>Technical acceptability will be the non-price factor in the evaluation process and will be defined as an offeror that takes no exception to the terms and conditions in the solicitation. Proposals being evaluated against the technical acceptability requirement will receive a rating of acceptable/unacceptable:</p>
<p>Acceptable: Proposal clearly meets the minimum requirements of the solicitation.</p>
<p>Unacceptable: Proposal does not clearly meet the minimum requirements of the solicitation.</p>
<p>Past Performance will be evaluated and rated on an acceptable/unacceptable basis using the following:</p>
<p>Acceptable: Based on the offeror's performance record relating to contracts of similar scope and complexity, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort based on the offeror's quality and delivery track record indicating no major issues, or the offeror's performance record is unknown. (See note below)</p>
<p>Unacceptable: Based on the offeror's performance record relating to contracts of similar scope and complexity, the Government has no reasonable expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort based on the offeror's quality and delivery track record indicating major issues. Any instances of major quality discrepancies that have not been promptly remedied will be deemed unacceptable.</p>
<p>Past Performance evaluation will be applied to offerors, and sources of supply.</p>
<p>Note: In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available or so sparse that no meaningful past performance rating can be reasonably assigned, the offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (See FAR 15.305 (a)(2)(iv). Therefore, the offeror shall be determined to have unknown past performance. In the context of acceptability/unacceptability, "unknown" shall be considered "acceptable".</p>
<p>After proposals are determined technically acceptable, they will be evaluated based on price submission for inclusion in the competitive range.</p>
<p>During the award evaluation process, the Source Selection Authority will determine which proposal is determined to be the Lowest Price Technically Acceptable. This factor, along with Past Performance, will be the basis for selecting the awardee.</p>
<p>Buy American Act, applies.</p>

The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.

<p>Line Item 0001 - (1) JOB -- Carbon Management: In-situ Studies of Co2, Capture for Clean Coal Technology. Please submit a listing of items that make up line item 0001. <br />Line Item 0002 - (1) LOT -- TRAVEL</p>
<p>BACKGROUND:</p>
<p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Ceramics Division is currently developing a project on materials for carbon mitigation for application to clean coal technologies. One particular area of interest pertains to carbon dioxide capture from the coal-fired power plants. The continual rise in anthropogenic atmospheric CO2 and the concomitant effect on climate change underlie the urgent need for the implementation of carbon capture approaches to stabilize the CO2 concentration while more sustainable energy technologies are developed.</p>
<p>Currently, more than 33% of global CO2 emissions are from coal-fired power plants, which represent the largest point source of CO2. Before carbon dioxide can be sequestered from power plants and other stationary sources, the CO2 generated from exhaust and production streams must be captured and concentrated. Carbon mitigation technology has three components: capture, transportation, and sequestration. Carbon capture is the most energy intensive and costly component of carbon capture and sequestration (CCS), estimated to represent about 75 % of the total cost.</p>
<p>The largest cause of efficiency reduction observed in carbon capture technology is the energy required to regenerate the amine solution presently used as the CO2 sorbent material. Mid-term to long-term opportunities to lower capture costs via improved performance could come from the development of energy efficient membranes and multi-scale solid sorbents. In that light, the development of a series of metrologies for a systematic sorbent performance analysis, and the construction of a physico-chemical property/performance database would be the key enablers to screen, select, and design energy efficient solid sorbent materials for carbon capture applications.</p>
<p>The objective of this work is the following: (1) to develop a suite of in situ measurement techniques including high pressure differential scanning calorimetry (HP-DSC), in situ near edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS), and in situ small angle neutron scattering (SANS) to address the need for metrologies to determine the &lsquo;active' structural state and characteristics of candidate materials during CO2 adsorption/desorption, and (2) vet a preliminary roadmap of standards and metrology needs for carbon capture materials research with the help of stakeholders from industry and Government. The combination of in situ measurement techniques will address the need for: (i) metrologies related to CO2 adsorption/desorption performance evaluation of sorbent materials (with emphasis on amino-functionalized mesoporous silica and metal-organic framework materials) and (ii) a physico-chemical property/performance database for sorbent materials. The construction of a roadmap of standards and metrology needs for carbon capture materials research and the successful development of such metrologies and property databases would advance the scientific foundations for lowering the overall cost of CCS.</p>
<p>SCOPE of WORK</p>
<p>The Contractor shall design and perform experiments using the new combined instrumentation (in situ structure/kinetic characterization related to CO2 evolution and adsorption) using an appropriate number of selected sorbent materials, including multi-scale porous materials.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall also set up the new high pressure Differential Scanning Calorimeter (HP-DSC) and ensure proper operation. After establishing the new instrumentation, the Contractor shall develop measurement methodologies and procedures, selecting suitable sorbent systems, and designing and performing analysis of the kinetic/structural studies related to the CO2 capture process. The number of experiments will be such that the relative standard deviation shall be 0.3 or less. To achieve reliable results, the Contractor must calibrate the system with known reference materials provided by the manufacturer of the HP-DSC. The Contractor shall compile at least 50 literature articles, and use his/her knowledge base to continue to develop new and sound approaches to CCS research for the Ceramics Division of NIST.</p>
<p>Important functions of the NIST Ceramics Division are dissemination of research results describing development of new measurement methods and standards for advanced materials, and engagement with customers and peer developers of such measurement methods and results. One dissemination and engagement mechanism is the presentation of the results by talks, posters, and discussions with customers and other researchers at technical meetings. Accordingly, the Division requires the Contractor to present a technical research presentations at the following conferences: MRS October 16-18, 2012 in Pittsburgh PA; Boston, MA, November 26-30, 2012; a conference in Brookhaven National Laboratory, Upton, NY on February 4-7, 2013; and MRS conference in San Francisco, CA, April 1- 5, 2013.</p>

<DESC>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D.

OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).<br /><br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested Parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br /><br />INFORMAL FORUM WITH THE OMBUDSMAN. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br /><br />FORMAL AGENCY PROTEST WITH THE OMBUDSMAN: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protests to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:<br /><br />Commandant (CG-931)<br />U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters<br />Procurement Planning &amp; Oversight Division<br />1900 Half Street, SW, JR11-0203<br />Washington, DC 20593-0001<br />Telephone: (202) 372-3692<br />FAX: (202) 475-3904<br /><br />A.

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

STATEMENT OF WORK (SOW)
CONTRACT TITLE:
Purchase of active pharmaceutical ingredient (API), N-Acetyl Cysteine (NAC), United States Pharmaceopeia (USP) grade). The API (NAC, USP grade) is needed to manufacture 300 milligram capsules for use in the CSP 578 Clinical Research Trial (Study).

BACKGROUND:
The VA Cooperative Studies Program is the Division of VA Research and Development that is responsible for the planning and conduct of large multicenter clinical trials and epidemiological studies in the Department of Veterans Affairs.  The VA Cooperative Studies Program needs a company to manufacture the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API), NAC, USP grade, to make 300 milligram capsules to be taken by veteran patients participating in the CSP 578 Study for the "Prevention of Serious Adverse Events Following Angiography: A Department of Veterans Affairs Cooperative Study (PRESERVE)."

SCOPE:
The company manufacturing the API (NAC, USP grade) must have a Drug Master File (DMF) on file with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The DMF demonstrates to the FDA how the manufacturer meets the regulatory, processing, quality and safety requirements for the manufacturing of the API. The CSPCRPCC must submit an Investigational New Drug Application (IND) to the FDA to obtain permission to conduct the CSP 578 Study. The information contained in the DMF assures the FDA employee reviewing the IND that the API used to make the clinical research product is made under the appropriate regulatory, process, quality and safety conditions.

The CSPCRPCC needs to immediately purchase one 50Kg drum of the API to manufacture 300 milligram capsules for use in the CSP 578 Study. The first drum of API is needed immediately because in February 2012, the manufacturer that had agreed to donate the drug product decided not to provide it for the study. The CSPCRPCC must receive the API no later than May 30, 2012 to allow enough time to formulate, manufacture, bottle, label, package, and ship the 300 milligram capsules to US and Australian clinic locations participating in the CSP 578 Study so they can dispense the product to patients starting September 1, 2012.

Any delay getting the first 50Kg drum of API (NAC, USP grade) product will seriously impact the mission of the Cooperative Studies Program and the health of the veterans enrolled in this research study by delaying research designed to prevent serious adverse events following angiography. The research study budget which includes providing veteran patients with drug product also includes hiring and training employees, and is based upon starting the veteran patients on the drug beginning September 1, 2012.

The CSPCRPCC expects to purchase a second 50Kg drum of the API (NAC, USP grade) in the fourth quarter of Fiscal Year 2013 in order to continue manufacturing the 300 milligram capsules for the completion of the CSP 578 Study. The CSPCRPCC needs to purchase the second drum of product approximately 12 to 18 months after the first drum. The API expiration dating impacts the timing of the purchase. The CSPCRPCC must manufacture and package the 300 milligram capsules so they are ready to distribute from the start of the study through the last day a patient is enrolled. This requires multiple manufacturing runs. Purchasing the API (NAC, USP grade) in FY12 and again in FY13 provides additional assurance that the product's expiration date will stay good through the end of the CSP 578 Study.

DEFINITIONS/ACRONYMS:
a.	API - The active pharmaceutical ingredient in a dosage form or experimental drug that is expected to cure or minimize the symptoms of the disease the patient is experiencing.

b.	BLINDED PRODUCT - Experimental drug and placebo manufactured so the experimental drug looks like the placebo and the patients cannot tell whether they are taking the experimental drug or the placebo.

c.	CLINICAL INVESTIGATOR - A medical researcher in charge of carrying out a clinical trial's protocol.

d.	CLINICAL TRIAL - A clinical trial is a research study to answer specific questions about vaccines or new therapies or ways of using known treatments. Clinical trials (also called medical research and research studies) are used to determine whether new drugs or treatments are both safe and effective. Carefully conducted clinical trials are the fastest and safest way to find treatments that work in people.

e.	CO - Contracting Officer. The Federal employee who is warranted by the Government to enter into contracts on behalf of the Government and is the only person authorized to make changes to those contracts.

f.	COR - Contracting Officer's Representative. Individual designated by the CO to place orders, furnish technical guidance, advice, certify invoices, and provide general supervision of the work performed under the executed contract.

g.	CSPCRPCC - Cooperative Studies Program Clinical Research Pharmacy Coordinating Center

h.	CUSTOMS BROKER - The Customs Broker prepares the documents and/or electronic submissions, the calculation (and the payment) on behalf of the client, of taxes, duties and excises, and facilitates the communications between the importer/exporter and governmental authorities.

i.	DISTRIBUTOR - Organization that serves as the authorized agent of the NAC manufacturer

j.	DMF - Drug Master File. The main objective of the DMF is to support regulatory requirements and to prove the quality, safety and efficacy of the medicinal product for obtaining an Investigational New Drug Application (IND).

k.	DOSAGE FORM - Dosage form is a mixture of active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) and non-drug component, i.e., liquid dosage form, solid dosage form and semi-solid dosage form.

l.	DOUBLE-BLIND STUDY - A clinical trial design in which neither the participating individuals nor the study staff knows which participants are receiving the experimental dosage form and which are receiving a placebo (or another therapy). Double-blind trials are thought to produce objective results, since the expectations of the doctor and the participant about the experimental dosage form do not affect the outcome.

m.	ENCAPSULATION - In the manufacture of pharmaceuticals, encapsulation refers to a range of techniques used to enclose medicines in a relatively stable shell known as a capsule.

n.	EU - European Authorities or the European equivalent of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)

o.	FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION (FDA) - The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services agency responsible for ensuring the safety and effectiveness of all drugs, biologics, vaccines, and medical devices.

p.	FORMULATION DEVELOPMENT - The research process for determining the dosage form ingredients, the amounts of the ingredients and manufacturing processes for adding the ingredients, mixing or blending them together and testing them to assure a tablet or capsule that meets the specifications for the dosage form is manufactured.

q.	GMPs - Good Manufacturing Practices. GMPs are used by pharmaceutical, medical device, and food manufacturers to produce and test products that people use. In the US FDA issues the GMP regulations as the minimum manufacturing requirements.

r.	IMPORT DUTY - Refers to the tax an importer must pay to the US Government in order to bring foreign products into the commerce of the United States.

s.	IND - Investigational New Drug. A new drug, antibiotic drug, or biological drug that is used in a clinical investigation.

In the letter, the API manufacturer grants the FDA the right to review their Drug Master File on behalf of the organization submitting the IND (in this case the CSPCRPCC) to assure the API they manufacture is tested following GMPs. It assures that the tests meet the product specifications prior to shipment of the API. The manufacturer must also supply the CSPCRPCC with a signed original copy of the Letter of Authorization so the CSPCRPCC can include a copy with the IND submission.

u.	PLACEBO - A placebo is dosage form that does not contain API and thus should not treat or minimize the illness the patient is experiencing.  In clinical trials, experimental dosage forms containing API are often compared with placebos to assess the treatment's effectiveness.

v.	POTENCY - The strength or amount of API in a dosage form. The specifications for the NAC potency of 90.0 to 110.0% are defined in the USP monograph for Acetylcysteine. The API product must meet the potency specifications through the expiration date.

w.	SPONSOR - Person who initiates a clinical investigation, but who does not conduct the investigation.

x.	USP - The United States Pharmacopeia is the official pharmacopeia of the United States. Pharmacopeia meaning literally, 'drug making,' is a reference work for pharmaceutical drug specifications. USP establishes written (documentary) and physical (reference) standards for medicines, food ingredients, dietary supplement products and ingredients. These standards are used by regulatory agencies and manufacturers to help to ensure that these products are of the appropriate identity, as well as strength, quality, purity, and consistency.

y.	VA - Veterans Affairs

<p><strong>PROPOSAL DUE DATE AND TIME:</strong> This BAA will remain open through 30&nbsp;October 2012, or until amended or superseded. It may be reissued and/or amended periodically, as needed.

<p><strong>1. BACKGROUND - BATTLEFIELD AIRMEN</strong></p>
<p>Certain ground combat capabilities are an Airman's responsibility and require unique surface operations that are integral to the application of air and space power. To meet this responsibility, the Air Force recognized the need to organize, train, and equip a force of Battlefield Airmen (BA) capable of delivering distinctive expertise in a ground combat environment with unequaled firepower, accuracy, responsiveness, flexibility and persistence. These BA include Combat Control, Pararescue, Tactical Air Control and Battlefield Weather professionals. BA provide skill sets not commonly found across the Air Force and typically operate in combat zones outside the perimeter of Air Force bases, often in the deep battle space.</p>
<p>Each of these career fields has unique missions in support of both Special Operations Forces and conventional forces. However, many core disciplines are common to the majority of BA. These commonalities include areas such as methods of employment, mobility, force protection methods, communication, and advances in mission planning and rehearsal. Advancements are sought to support specific mission areas as they pertain to each individual career field. To better understand the needs of each BA expertise, a short summary of each career field's mission is provided below.<br />The Air Force Combat Controllers are Special Tactics ground operators who work as members of Air Force Special Tactics Teams and as members of Army Special Forces, Navy SEAL, and Joint Special Operations teams. Combat Controllers are certified to act as air traffic controllers and Joint Terminal Attack Controllers in hostile and dangerous environments. They can be deployed by sea, air, and land to take over or construct an airstrip, set up navigational equipment, and direct airplanes and helicopters to a safe landing without the use of a tower or elaborate communications system. They also establish drop zones and control parachute drops of personnel and equipment, and control airstrikes and air attacks from fixed and rotary-wing aircraft from all military services.</p>
<p>Pararescue Airmen, known as PJs, conduct conventional or unconventional rescue operations. These PJs are the ideal force for personnel recovery and combat search and rescue. PJs' primarily function as personnel recovery specialists with emergency medical capabilities in humanitarian and combat environments. They deploy in any available manner, to include air-land-sea tactics, into restricted environments to authenticate, extract, treat, stabilize and evacuate injured personnel, while acting in an enemy-evading recovery role. PJs participate in search and rescue, combat search and rescue, recovery support for NASA and conduct other operations as appropriate. They are among the most highly trained emergency trauma specialists in the U.S. military, maintaining emergency medical technician-paramedic qualification throughout their careers. With this medical and rescue expertise, along with their deployment capabilities, PJs are able to perform life-saving missions in the world's most remote areas. <br /><br />Battlefield and Special Operations Weathermen are meteorologists with advanced tactical training to operate in hostile or denied territory. They gather and interpret weather data, and provide intelligence from deployed locations while working primarily with Army (Battlefield Weather) and Special Operations (Special Operations Weather) forces. They collect localized weather information, assist mission planning, and generate accurate, mission-tailored target and route forecasts in support of conventional and special operations. They deploy into restricted environments by air, land or sea to observe and analyze weather data. They also train joint force members to take and communicate limited weather observations. Additionally, Special Operations Weathermen conduct special reconnaissance, collect upper air data, organize, establish and maintain weather data reporting networks, determine host nation meteorological capabilities and train foreign national forces. <br /><br />Tactical Air Control Party (TACP) personnel advise U.S. Army conventional and special operations ground maneuver commanders on the integration and execution of air and space power. Qualified individuals, serving as Joint Terminal Attack Controllers, provide final attack control to aircrew when aircraft are inbound to the target, ensuring the aircrew identifies and attacks the correct target, minimizing the risk to friendly ground forces and preventing unwanted collateral damage. Operating on the forward edge of the battle area and behind enemy lines, TACPs coordinate with Theater Air Ground System elements through the use of state-of-the-art communications, and maintain proficiency in the tactics, techniques and procedures of their aligned Army units. When deployed, the TACPs live under austere field conditions, and coordinate, de-conflict, and execute air-to-ground missions within the Army's area of operation.</p>
<p>To continue to maintain superiority over our enemies, research and development to improve the effectiveness of Battlefield Airmen is vital. The Air Force Research Laboratory seeks to address capability gaps, limitations or deficiencies through this Broad Agency Announcement.</p>
<p><strong>II. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION</strong></p>
<p>This is a Broad Agency Announcement of the Air Force Research Laboratory, Munitions Directorate (AFRL/RW), under the provisions of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) paragraph 6.102(d)(2), which provides for competitive selection of research proposals. Proposals submitted in response to this BAA, that are selected for award, are considered to be the results of full and open competition and in full compliance with the provisions of PL 98-369, the Competition in Contracting Act of 1984.</p>
<p>Tactical Capabilities for Battlefield Airmen and Security Forces white papers may also be submitted for the acquisition of test assets. In the event these submissions are selected for award, they could be awarded under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2373, Acquisition for Experimental Test Purposes.</p>
<p>For purposes of this announcement, AFRL/RW intends to contract with private industry, non-profit organizations, and educational institutions for research in tactical capabilities for Battlefield Airmen and Security Forces (BA and SF). Research includes scientific study and experimentation directed at developing technologies, components, and quick reaction capabilities (QRC). This work includes tactical level Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR), threat intercept, and force application capabilities for Battlefield Airmen and Security Forces. Potential areas of interest include tactical level targeting applications such as wireless network applications, line-of-sight and beyond-line-of-sight communication links, remote sensing, remote switching, target tagging, tactical command and control of ground forces, tactical electrical energy, small Unmanned Aerial Systems, and general improvements in situational awareness, targeting, force protection/fractricide prevention, and damage assessment Efforts proposed under this BAA should be designed to demonstrate well defined and substantive research results, should not be overly ambitious or open-ended, and should not be a paper study that inherently requires a substantial testing effort; however, there is the possibility of analysis efforts to support experimental testing or to support other demonstrations proposed under this BAA.</p>
<p>These basic and applied research effort results could include deliverables with provisions for future prototyping, field demonstrations and warfighter evaluation. Prototypes may be a deliverable but only as may be necessary to evaluate the basic or applied research efforts in a meaningful manner. Under some circumstances, we expect that narrowly focused white papers or proposals for advanced research may be required during the time of this open announcement. Under those circumstances, a specific or special BAA amendment may be issued describing the requirement in greater detail, defining funding available, elaborating on white paper or proposal submission due date and format, and possibly providing more specific evaluation criteria.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: center"><strong>PROSPECTIVE RESEARCH AREAS</strong></p>
<p>The following narratives are intended to provide an abbreviated description of the prospective research areas mentioned in the Program Description. These descriptions furnish specific examples of areas of interest and Technical Directorate focal points associated with these nine technology focus areas. Proposed efforts under this BAA must be in the realm of basic or applied research. Hardware development that is unrelated to a specific weapon system and not intended directly for the Air Force inventory may qualify if it falls into a category often called "breadboards/brassboards" or exploratory development models. Development of prototype hardware may be pursued under a BAA; however, such development must be for the purpose of demonstrating the feasibility of a technology or solution. It should not be for the purpose of acquiring specific hardware that has already been defined or developed by the Government.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: center"><strong>RESEARCH AREA 1 - FORCE PROTECTION ENHANCEMENTS</strong></p>
<p>The goal of this work is to perform basic and applied research in the areas of force protection to enhance the safety, survivability and capabilities of the deployed battlefield airman. The objective is to conduct research which could eventually lead to the development of improved shelters, materials, armor and related items for the deployed Battlefield Airmen. Research to effectively detect, deceive, avoid and prevent contamination and/or injury or exposure to Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear and Explosives (CBRNE) and other threats will greatly enhance BA effectiveness. Research in areas that will allow the Battlefield Airmen to engage threats from greater standoff distances is also desired. This research area addresses the following deficiencies from the AFSOC Prioritized Deficiency List (may not be all inclusive): 0069, 0070, 0071, 0119, 0153, 0272, 0393, 399 and 0409.

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>RESEARCH AREA 5 - NAVAIDS AND SENSORS</strong></p>
<p>The goal of this work is to perform basic and applied research in the areas of sensors and navigational aids to enhance the safety, survivability, and capabilities of the deployed Battlefield Airmen. The objective is to conduct research and development that improves our ability to emplace and maintain remote sensors that operate autonomously and in all weather and environments. These sensors shall feed collected information to the Global Information Grid (GIG) for dissemination to air, sea, and ground systems in near real time and will leverage advances in imaging and sensing technology to increase situational awareness across the force. Research to develop multispectral, all weather, covert visual and electronic navigational aids and technology to aid in employing these devices may be proposed. Threat situational awareness advancements may also be proposed that alert friendly forces in the event threat forces are targeting them by laser, ladar, Radio Frequencies (RF) or any other means. This research area addresses the following deficiencies from the AFSOC Prioritized Deficiency List (may not be all inclusive): 0066, 0157, 0292, 0352, 0356, 0358, 0361, 0363, 0405 and 0406.

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>RESEARCH AREA 7 - CLANDESTINE MOBILITY</strong></p>
<p>The goal of this work is to perform basic and applied research for technologies that can provide improved clandestine, long-range ground and water mobility platforms that can be inserted via all SOF air assets. Current mobility platforms are becoming obsolete as new detection technologies make vehicle movement more observable than in the past. The objective is to conduct research that would lead to the modification of existing ground/water platforms or development of new ground/water platforms with reduced signatures (heat, acoustic, electromagnetic, and other emissions) capable of operating for extended durations/ranges. The focus should be on detection avoidance and solutions that reduce signatures to cloak SOF presence in the area of operations. These technologies must be rugged, lightweight, compact, waterproof, and operable in all light and weather conditions and must be comparable or better in performance (speed, capacity, armor, weapon integration, etc.) than current capabilities. This research area addresses the following deficiencies from the AFSOC Prioritized Deficiency List: 0089, 0394, 0399, and 0415.

<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: center"><strong>RESEARCH AREA 9 - TACTICAL METEOROLOGICAL SYSTEMS</strong></p>
<p>The goal of this work is to perform basic and applied research for technologies that can improve weather collection, communication and transmission systems and/or sensors. Technologies should be developed to collect, automatically and accurately measure, and securely transmit weather information (surface and upper atmosphere conditions) and Meteorological and Oceanograhic (METOC) data across the battlespace from any location and in any environment. Sensors should have the capability to be emplaced either remotely or by hand, turned on and off remotely, and should be small, lightweight, long endurance and when possible, include camouflage or deception capabilities to avoid detection. The capability to create a weather state depiction for use on common mission planning, mission rehearsal and operational C2 platforms with the capability to be automatically updated in real or near-real time is also desired. All systems and sensors should be standardized and networked to existing and future C2 systems so the data can be provided in real or near-real-time to staff commanders, operators, planners, weather forces, and global weather databases.

The Government reserves the right to select all, part, or none of the proposals received in response to this announcement, subject to the availability of funds. These criteria will also be used to evaluate formal proposals, should they be requested. <br /><br /><strong>1. Evaluation Criteria:<br /><br /></strong>a. An integrated assessment of the proposed approach to include scientific and/or technical merits, associated risks, and the potential contributions of the effort to meet/fulfill Battlefield Air Operations Kit (Battlefield Airmen and Security Forces) mission requirements. Potential value to the government (technical promise) will be assessed, based on innovation (originality and feasibility), transitionability, and desirability to the warfighter.<br /><br />b. The offeror's capabilities, related experience, facilities, techniques, or unique combinations of these that are integral factors for achieving the proposed objectives.</p>
<p>c. The qualifications, capabilities, and experience of the proposed principal investigator, team leader, and other key personnel who are critical to achieving the proposal objectives.</p>
<p>d. The reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees, if any, the proposed cost share by the offeror, if any, and the availability of funds (i.e., considering budgets and funding).</p>
<p>e. The extent to which the proposal supports government field testing when applicable.</p>
<p><strong>2. Proposal Risk Assessment:</strong> Proposal risk for technical, cost, schedule, and other will be assessed as part of the evaluation of the above evaluation criteria. Proposal risk relates to the identification and assessment of the risks associated with an offeror's proposed approach as it relates to accomplishing the proposed effort. Tradeoffs of the assessed risk will be weighed against the potential payoff.</p>
<p>No further evaluation criteria will be used. Individual white papers/proposals will be evaluated against the evaluation criteria without regard to other white papers and proposals submitted under this BAA. White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.</p>
<p>It is the policy of AFRL/RW to treat all white papers and proposals as privileged information, and to disclose the contents only for the purposes of evaluation. Those selected as a result of initial review will be subject to an extensive evaluation by highly qualified Government scientists. The offeror must appropriately indicate any limitation to be placed on disclosure of information contained in the white paper or proposal (see also paragraph IV.B. above). Should portions of a proposal be incorporated into a resulting contract, that portion may be subject to release under the Freedom of Information Act unless exempt from release.</p>
<p><strong>B. Review and Selection Process:</strong> The evaluation described above will generally result in white papers being placed in one of the three Categories below:</p>
<p><strong>1. Category I:</strong> Proposal is well conceived, scientifically and technically sound, pertinent to the program goals and objectives, and offered by a responsible contractor with the competent scientific and technical staff and supporting resources needed to ensure satisfactory program results. Proposals in Category I are recommended for acceptance (subject to availability of funds) and normally are displaced only by other Category I proposals.<br /><br /><strong>2. Category II:</strong> Proposal is scientifically or technically sound, requiring further development and is recommended for acceptance, but at a lower priority than Category I.</p>
<p><strong>3. Category III:</strong> Proposal is not technically sound or does not meet agency needs.</p>
<p><strong>VI. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION:</strong></p>
<p><strong>A. Award Notices (White Papers):</strong> Offerors of those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email or letter will be sent by the Contracting Office. Such invitation does not assure that the submitting offeror will be awarded a contract. Offerors of those white papers not selected for further consideration will be notified in the same manner. Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.</p>
<p>Offerors may request status of their white paper no earlier than 45 days after submission.</p>
<p><strong>B. Award Notices (full proposals):</strong> Offerors will be notified whether their proposal is recommended for award after evaluation of the proposal. The notification is not to be construed to mean the award of a contract is assured, as availability of funds and successful negotiations are prerequisites to any award.</p>
<p><strong>C. Administrative and National Policy Requirements:</strong></p>
<p>Depending on the work to be performed, the offeror may require a classified facility clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to information at the equivalent level of security at the time of award. In addition, the offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility to support work under this BAA.

<p>C. In accordance with AFFARS 5301.9102, an ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition announcement. Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution. AFFARS Clause 5352.201-9101 Ombudsman (Aug 2005) will be incorporated into all contracts awarded under this BAA. The Ombudsman is as follows:</p>
<p>Karen Sue Hunter<br />Director of Contracting (AFRL/PK)<br />Phone: (937) 904-4407<br />Email: <a href="mailto:karen.hunter@wpafb.af.mil">karen.hunter@wpafb.af.mil</a></p>
<p><strong>VIII. OTHER INFORMATION PERTINENT TO AWARD OF CONTRACTS AND/OR ASSISTANCE INSTRUMENTS</strong></p>
<p><strong>A. Support Contractors:</strong> Only Government employees will evaluate the white papers/proposals for selection. The AFRL Munitions Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in the administrative support contract, which do not require the review, reading, or comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks." These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements. The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: <br />1. Assembling and organizing information for R&amp;D case files;<br />2. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and<br />3. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries.<br />Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.</p>
<p><strong>B. Communication:</strong> Dialogue between prospective offerors and Government representatives is encouraged until submission of proposals. Discussions with any of the points of contact shall not constitute a commitment by the Government to subsequently fund or award any proposed effort. Only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.</p>
<p><strong>C. Debriefings:</strong> When requested, a debriefing will be provided. The debriefing process will follow the time guidelines set out in 10 USC 2305(b)(5), but the debriefing content may vary to be consistent with the procedures that govern BAAs (FAR 35.016).</p>
<p><strong>D. Wide Area Work Flow Notice:</strong> Any contract award resulting from this announcement will contain the clause at DFARS 252.232-7003, Electronic Submission of Payment Requests and Receiving Reports, which requires electronic submission of all payment requests. The clause cites three possible electronic formats through which to submit electronic payment requests. Effective 01 October 2006, the Department of Defense adopted Wide Area Work Flow-Receipt and Acceptance (WAWF-RA), as the electronic format for submission of electronic payment requests. Any contract resulting from this announcement will establish a requirement to use WAWF-RA for invoicing and receipt/acceptance, and provide coding instructions applicable to this contract. Contractors are encouraged to take advantage of available training (both web-based and through your cognizant DCMA office), and to register in the WAWF-RA system. Information regarding WAWF-RA, including the web-based training and registration, can be found at https://wawf.eb.mil/ . Note: WAWF-RA requirement does not apply to Universities that are audited by an agency other than DCAA.</p>
<p><strong>E. Item Identification and Valuation:</strong> Any contract award resulting from this announcement may contain the clause at DFARS 252.211-7003, Item Identification and Valuation, (Aug 2008) which requires unique item identification and valuation of any deliverable item for which the government's unit acquisition cost is $5,000 or more; subassemblies, components, and parts embedded within an item valued at $5,000 or more; or items for which the government's unit acquisition cost is less than $5,000 when determined necessary by the requiring activity for serially managed, mission essential, or controlled inventory. Also included are any DoD serially managed subassembly, component, or part embedded within a delivered item and the parent item that contains the embedded subassembly, component, or part. Per DFARS 211.274-3 policy for valuation, it is DoD policy that contractors shall be required to identify the government's unit acquisition cost for all items delivered, even if none of the criteria for placing a unique item identification mark applies. Therefore, your proposal must clearly break out the unit acquisition cost for any deliverable items. Per DFARS 211.274-3 policy for valuation, "the government's unit acquisition cost is the contractor's estimated fully burdened unit cost at time of delivery to the government for cost type or undefinitized line, subline, or exhibit line items" (per DoD, "fully burdened unit costs" to the government would include all direct, indirect, G&amp;A costs, and an appropriate portion of fee). If you have questions regarding the unique item identification requirements, please contact the contracting point of contact listed above. For more information, see the following website: http://www.acq.osd.mil/dpap/sitemap.html .</p>
<p><strong>F. Forward Pricing Rate Agreements:</strong> If formal proposals are requested, offerors who have Forward Pricing Rate Agreements (FPRAs) should submit them with their proposals.</p>
<p><strong>G. Pre-Award Clearance</strong>: Pursuant to FAR 22.805, a pre-award clearance must be obtained from the U.S. Department Of Labor, Employment Standards Administration, Office Of Federal Contract Compliance Program's (OFCCP) prior to award of a contract (or subcontract) of $10,000,000 or more unless the contractor is listed in OFCCP's National Preaward Registry http://www.dol-esa.gov/preaward . This registry indicates that the contractor has been found to be "in compliance" within the past 2 years with The Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) regulations that the OFCCP is mandated to enforce. The registry is updated nightly and facilities reviewed more than 2 years ago are removed and new ones are added. Award may be delayed if you are not currently listed in the registry and the contracting officer must request a preaward clearance from the OFCCP.</p>
<p><strong>H. Excessive Pass-Through Charges:</strong> Any contract award resulting from this announcement may contain the clause at DFARS 252.215-7004, Excessive Pass-Through Charges, (May 2008) which requires the contractor to identify in its proposal the percentage of effort to be performed by the prime contractor and the percentage expected to be performed by each subcontractor. If the contractor intends to subcontract more than 70% of the total cost of work under the contract or task order, then it shall identify the amount of the contractor's indirect costs and profit applicable to the subcontract work, and a description of the value added by the contractor. If any subcontractor intends to subcontract to a lower tier subcontractor more than 70% of the total cost of its work, then it shall identify the amount of the subcontractor's indirect costs and profit applicable to the lower tier subcontract work, and a description of the value added by the subcontractor. <br /><br /><strong>I. Associate Contractor Agreements</strong>: Associate Contractor Agreements (ACAs) are agreements between contractors working on government contract projects that specify requirements for them to share information, data, technical knowledge, expertise, or resources. The contracting officer may require ACAs when contractors working on separate government contracts must cooperate, share resources or otherwise jointly participate in working on contracts or projects. Prime contractor to subcontractor relationships do not constitute ACAs. For each award, the contracting officer will identify associate contractors with whom agreements are required.</p>
<p><strong>J. Post-Award Small Business Program Rerepresentation</strong>: As prescribed in FAR 19.308, FAR Clause 52.219-28, Post-Award Small Business Program Rerepresentation (Apr 2009), is incorporated by reference in this solicitation. This clause will be contained in any contracts resulting from this solicitation. This clause requires a contractor to rerepresent its size status when certain conditions apply. The clause provides detail on when the rerepresentation must be complete and what the contractor must do when a rerepresentation is required.</p>
<p><strong>K. Enabling Clause</strong>: Any contract award resulting from this announcement may contain a special clause entitled "Enabling Clause between Prime Contractors and Service Contractors", in Section I when a prime contractor must agree to cooperate with a support contractor during the performance of this contract. <br /><br /><strong>L. Provisions of the Federal Acquisition Regulation</strong> may be accessed electronically at this address: <a href="http://farsite.hill.af.mil">http://farsite.hill.af.mil</a> &nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>M. CCR Registration:</strong> Unless exempted by 2 CFR 25.110 all offerors must:<br />(1) Be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) prior to submitting an application or proposal;<br />(2) Maintain an active CCR registration with current information at all times during which it has an active Federal award or an application or proposal under consideration by an agency; and<br />(3) Provide its DUNS number in each application or proposal it submits to the agency.<br /><br /><strong>N. Executive Compensation and First-Tier Sub-contract/Sub-recipient Awards:</strong> Any contract award resulting from this announcement may contain the clause at FAR 52.204-10 - Reporting Executive Compensation and First-Tier Subcontract Awards. Any grant or agreement award resulting from this announcement may contain the award term set forth in 2 CFR, Appendix A to Part 25 http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;sid=c55a4687d6faa13b137a26d0eb436edb&amp;rgn=div5&amp;view=text&amp;node=2:1.1.1.4.1&amp;idno=2#2:1.1.1.4.1.2.1.1</p>

Offerors must clearly state in their quote if they do not have at least two (2) past performance references. Failure to provide this information may render an offeror's quote non-responsive and may not be considered for award. <br /><br />A strong history of relevant past performance may be more advantageous to the Government than a less relevant record of favorable performance.

<p><br /><strong>II. EVALUATION FACTORS: PAST PERFORMANCE AND TECHNICAL CAPABILITIES</strong></p>
<p>(1) Corroboration that contractor is a Registrar accredited through the American National Accreditation Program for Registrars of Environmental Management Systems as administered by the American national Standards Institute-ASQ National Accreditation Board (ANSI-ANAB). The scope of this accreditation shall include North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes 92811, 336611, and 336612 Ship and Boat building and repair, 493190, Warehousing, 561110, Office Administrative Services. The contractor shall supply a list of companies that they have audited to the ISO 14001 standard.<br /><br />(2) The contractor shall submit a resume and statement of experience of the proposed lead auditor for this project. Based on the resume (two pages maximum; only the first two pages will be considered) and experience (two pages maximum; only the first two pages will be considered) of the Lead Auditor, a rating will be determined regarding the working knowledge of the Lead Auditor of the ship repair industry (other than CG YARD). This is a critical element for this contract because the Lead Auditor needs to be able to evaluate the Environmental Management System (EMS) at the CG YARD with similar facilities in the shipbuilding/repair industry.<br /><br />(3) The prospective Audit Team must be able to function safely in a heavy industrial situation when interviewing all levels of CG YARD personnel to determine implementation of the EMS. The audit team must be able to meet the physical demands of auditing in a ship repair environment which involves stair climbing, accessing vessels under repair, and sometimes dirty work conditions. Familiarity with personal protective equipment is crucial and interviewing of employees must be done on the work site only when it does not interfere with production. Describe for us the company policy for interviewing our employees and the Audit Team's knowledge of the use of personal protective equipment (2 pages maximum).<br /><br />(4) The Contractor will provide a tentative audit schedule at least 30 days prior to the start of each audit (one re-certification and two surveillance) that specifies particular members of management to be interviewed and what functional shop areas are to be audited. The CG YARD will be given an opportunity to suggest the tentative schedule. Provide an example of a tentative schedule for review (1 page maximum).<br /><br />(5) The Lead Auditor will conduct an opening meeting and closing meeting for the CG YARD's top management to summarize audit results, note difficulties, and give a draft report with recommendations for the continued certification. Provide an outline of typical opening/closing meetings (2 pages maximum).<br /><br />(6) The contractor shall have a multi-layered appeals system through which the CG YARD may appeal any ruling, determination, or action of the Contractor relating to the auditing and registration processes. Explain how the appeals process works including how long each step should take (2 pages maximum).</p>

<p><br /><strong>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS </strong>- United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<DESC>*For clarification purposes, the response date has been extended to 4 May 12, which is beyond the 2 May 12 date listed on the RFI.<br /><br />KC-10 and KC-135 VMT Background
<p>The Agile Combat Support Directorate, Simulators Division is conducting market research to identify potential sources that may possess the capabilities to deliver separate virtual maintenance training systems for the KC-10 and KC-135 aircraft. The trainer suites shall be designed to fit in existing classrooms. The KC-10 virtual maintenance trainers (VMTs) shall be delivered to Travis AFB, CA and McGuire AFB, NJ. Please reference the attached requirements document, Appendix B, to view the existing sizes for the KC-10 VMT classrooms. The KC-135 VMTs shall be delivered to MacDill AFB, FL, McConnell AFB, KS, and Fairchild AFB, WA. The classroom sizes for the KC-135 VMTs are to be determined.</p>
<p>KC-10 and KC-135 maintenance training is still accomplished on actual aircraft; these training activities have an impact on mission capabilities, and mission requirements regularly delay maintenance training. All training is conducted by Air Force instructors. The VMT system will be used as a training aid in the current Air Force courses and for certain proficiency levels and tasks, and consequently decrease training on an operational aircraft.</p>
<p>Please note, that at this current time, this effort will replace all previous KC-10 and KC-135 efforts to procure or obtain further information about Interactive Multimedia Instruction (IMI). The requirement is for a virtual maintenance trainer that purely replicates the operations of the actual aircraft.</p>

Please note that only certified personnel are allowed to apply pesticides on DoD lands, no technicians or apprentices are permitted!!  There are training and testing sessions throughout the state literally every month; interested parties can review the Texas Department of Agriculture (TDA) website for times and locations.<br><br>40.	 For 8(a) contracts, what is the minimum required percentage of work preformrd by the prime contractor 8(a)? <br><br> At least 51%<br><br>41.	Who are the two current contractors performing the grounds maintenance on Fort Bliss? <br><br>Delta- Pride<br><br>42.	 What are the current contractor annual prices? <br><br>The current contracts can be researched on EDA.  <br><br>43.	During the site visit, it was stated that the government would not provide a breakdown of Improved Grounds - landscape areas (gravel) and Improved Grounds - turf areas and the government would only be providing acres of Improved Grounds.  Due to the varying nature and labor power needed to complete these two tasks, not supplying this information would cause a wide range of price proposals for these areas.  <br><br>Contractor will be provided a map and this is a live contract where areas will change from semi-improve to improve.<br><br>44.	Can the government provide historical data on the types and quantities of herbicides applied on Fort Bliss?   <br><br>The contractor should consider that potential use of herbicides will include actions to suppress grasses, broad-leaved weeds and sedges in a variety of site types and sizes as shown during the field tour.  Also, the acreage and maps can be used by the contractor to establish the pricing.  <br><br>45.	Can the government provide historical data on frequencies of maintenance visits for each: improved grounds and semi-improved grounds?   <br><br>This information is not available at this time.  Based on this acquisition being a commercial service, we are looking for commercial practices.<br><br>46.	I am under the understanding that the contract for Grounds Maintenance for Fort Bliss will be posted on Fedbid.com is that correct?  If it is indeed to be posted on fedbid will contractors have multiple opportunities to bid? <br><br>Once the formal solicitation is posted, instructions will be given for the submission of formal proposals.  The FedBid processes will be followed for this procurement.  <br><br>47.	Ms. Sanchez I wanted to inquire about what the stipulations are in the solicitation for joint ventures. Will sub and primary contractors be reviewed as individuals or and one entity? <br><br>Please be advised that if you are considering a joint venture, it needs to be approved by SBA prior to submitting a proposal.  Once the joint venture is approved, the proposal from the joint venture will be reviewed as one entity.<br><br>48.	Fort Bliss consists of 1,110,000 un-improved acres as stated, how many acres are actually maintained in the different categories listed;<br> 	Improved Grounds<br> 	Semi-Improved Grounds<br> 	Un-Improved Grounds<br>Acreage will be provided for improved and semi-improved grounds.<br>49.

Along with a Pest Management program to control insects and un-wanted vegetation as well as animal carcass removal. The service you have listed for improved grounds please provide an acreage, square footage, estimated annual event of occurrences for each requirement. <br>Government will provide acreage and approximate number of trees and shrubs.<br><br>50.	Semi-Improved grounds are normally grounds that are not populated with buildings and parking lots. Please provide the acreage and estimated annual event of occurrences and breakdown of areas requiring service for the Semi-Improved grounds. <br>Acreage will be provided.<br><br>51.	Irrigation; 7.1.1. Installed irrigation systems that do not provide adequate coverage, area where system is inoperable or does not exist. You state contractor shall utilize portable, manual sprinkler type systems to deliver water uniformly to the affected areas. How many areas are affected that require portable or manual watering, and what is the size/acreage of areas that will require assistance with watering due to improper coverage? (Proper knowledge of affected areas quantity and sizes are vital for costing purposes for manning and equipment needs). Portable or manual watering could present an issue/problem when there is insufficient watering hook ups or water pressure at any given area to adequately water the affected area(s). <br>The Government's intent is to turn over as many operable systems as possible. In the event there are inoperable or inadequate systems, this shall be predetermined before new contractor begins work and an estimate will be requested by KO to repair or replace said areas.<br><br>52.	Irrigation; 7.1.2. This paragraph states the contractor shall maintain automatics and other permanent systems to function as designed. You state the contractor shall repair malfunctioning components systems inventory listed; you have omitted some important components such as water lines, risers, valve boxes, controllers, etc. Vital question regarding the repairs is who will burden the cost for the required repairs. Should the contractor assume that the Government will reimburse the cost of repairs, labor, fuel, equipment cost, and materials? How many systems are there that require repair services, please include [their] sizes. Also you indicate installation along with repairs, and programming of timers please expand and define your intent. <br>Line items will be within the IDIQ for said items.<br><br>53.

You indicate in the event of a prolonged drought the contractor will be required to water shrubbery, please provide a quantity along with size of areas that will require a portable watering device such as a truck or wagon. <br>Acreage and approximate measurement of irrigation system will be provided. <br><br>54.	Portable Sprinkler; 7.1.5. Please provide a better explanation regarding removal from lawn when not in use. If the contractor is required to remove the manual watering devices at the end of each working day this creates a labor intense service, in turn very costly. A more feasible and common practice would be to roll the hoses up into a neat and orderly pile/pattern. Having the manual sprinkler system ready for the next watering as needed. <br>Comply with PWS<br><br>55.	Edging: 7.2. Please provide the linear footage of your edging requirements. <br>Acreage for improved and semi-improved areas will be provided.<br><br>56.	Surfaced, Parking, and Storage Areas; 7.3.2. Please provide square footage/acreage of vegetation control of cracks and joints of the required areas. <br>The square footage will be provided in the solicitation.   <br><br>57.

You state that application rates are to be applied based on the recommendations of a laboratory's analyzes. As a prospective bidder(s) we would not have that information. This knowledge is a major factor determining the cost of this requirement.

Contractor responsibility to maintain said areas within PWS.<br><br>59.	Perform Pest Identification and Control; 7.7. (IPM) A plan is required to be submitted for approval. Information is needed for costing purposes and proper drafting for implantation. Previously in paragraph #2 you indicate control for insects, rodents and other nuisance pest along with weed control. For fair and accurate costing an estimated quantity, acreage annually, is needed for each stated required pest requiring control. <br>See 63<br>60.	Soil Aeration; You state aeration is to be performed twice annually, please provide the acreage/quantity of this requirement. You also state the contractor is to collect soil clumps resulting from aeration, please clarify your intent... (Do you require the actual soil core slug created from the aeration process to be collected?   <br><br>At this time, the acreage involved is not available.  During routine soil aeration in landscaped areas the soil cores have been collected and disposed of. MICC should contact the DPW-roads and grounds to verify this procedure.<br><br>61.	Remove Sand & Snow; 7.9. Please provide the annual events and quantity for this requirement. <br>As required in PWS.<br><br>62.	Mowing; 7.10. Please provide the annual events and quantity of these two areas. <br>As required in PWS<br><br>63.	Plantings; 7.12.1. Please provide a listing of all natural adaptive native plants required to perform this service: trees, shrubs, hedges, plants, and grasses. In replacing is it fair to assume other than contractor damage to plant life the government will reimburse all related costs to repair/replace all listed plants required for this service?  <br>On an as needed basis through delivery order.<br><br>64.	Tree Removals; 7.12.3. Please provide an annual amount of tree removal required and sizes. Please clarify near electrical lines, if tree limbs or tree parts are in contact with the power lines as this presents an issue/problem as specialized equipment and personnel are required. On many Military installations when power lines and trees have encroached into each other's space this has been contracted out to a contractor that specializes in this field or the local utility companies perform this task. <br>Removal of trees will be on an as needed basis through delivery order.<br>65.	Weeds and Other Noxious Plant Control; 7.14. Please provide a list of noxious plants for your geographical area/region, throughout the country there are many different noxious plant varieties. As geographical regions change the plan varieties change as well, so what we consider as noxious in our region may not be noxious in your, or other, regions. <br><br>There are dozens of weed species that might require some type of control in our area including grass-like and broad-leaved plants. Preparing a list will require more time.  The contractors bidding for this proposal should be able to identify the species in the region when the need for control arises.   Likewise the contractors shall keep in mind that we are using integrated weed management and that herbicide applications should neither be routinely nor scheduled but based on site evaluation and assessments.<br><br>66.	Tumbleweed Clean-Up; 7.15. Please provide the estimated annual events and quantity this service will be required. You require special care in Natural Recovery Areas, please provide a description of clarifying what this area is and why you caution the contractor to exercise care. <br>Tumbleweed control will be within the improved and semi-improved areas only for said contract. Natural recovery areas will be removed within the PWS.<br><br>67.	Maintain Semi-Improved Grounds; 8. Please provide estimated annual events and acreage quantity of your Semi-Improved grounds.<br>(Paragraph) 8.1., 8.2., 8.4.1., 8.4.2. You state when required and during term of Delivery Order these tasks are to be accomplished. What will be the timeline length of a delivery order when issued? <br><br>Annual events will not be provided; actions must be taken as required through PWS. Period of performance for task orders will be based on a thirty day period unless otherwise indicated on Delivery Order.<br><br>68.	General Pest Control; 9. You have provided an in depth description of rules and regulations for pest control management. You expand on treatments of turf and trees for weeds and insects; will the Government Issue a work order/delivery order for the contractor to execute these desired pest control applications? <br>Contractor will maintain health for all grounds listed with-in PWS and will utilize proper means through approval of Environmental dept. Time frames not provided.<br><br>69.	When an area becomes flooded and damage occurs, who supplies the needed materials for replacement/repairs? <br>KO will request cost estimate for repairs due to Mother Nature or other unforeseen incidents causing damage to grounds area.<br><br>70.	For manually watering purposes of trees, will the contractor be allowed to re-fill water wagon/tank?  <br>Yes.<br><br>71.	Can the Contractor do spraying in the evening? <br>Typical herbicide applications should be conducted during business hours unless there is a need for other schedules and the chemical label allows it.<br><br>72.	Do Contractors need sterilants and or pre-emergent herbicides? <br>These types of herbicides can be used after the application sites are evaluated for need and the product label is strictly adhered to.<br><br>MORE QUESITONS CAN BE ANSWERED AFTER THE POSTING OF THE SOLICITATION WHICH IS ESTIMATED TO BE POSTED IN JUNE 2012.

<DESC>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute anticipates posting a request for proposals (RFP) under NHLBI-HV-12-07 will be available on or about March 31, 2011. The objective of the RFP is to continue Preclinical Vector Production Core Laboratory (PCL) activities for five years. The purpose of the program is to facilitate the translation of basic research in gene therapy to clinical application in the areas of heart, lung, and blood diseases. The GTRP provides resources in the areas of preclinical and clinical-grade vector production in accordance with Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP), and in the conduct of pharmacology/toxicology studies. In addition, the GTRP provides funds and regulatory assistance to investigators wishing to conduct gene therapy clinical trials.
<p>The GTRP consists of a clinical coordinating center that oversees and coordinates the logistics of the four core laboratories and provides regulatory assistance for clinical trials; a preclinical-grade vector production core laboratory; a clinical-grade vector production core laboratory for adeno-associated virus (AAV); a clinical-grade vector production core laboratory for lentivirus; and a pharmacology/toxicology core laboratory. The PCL shall continue to 1) participate in the Steering Committee (SC), and subcommittees as necessary, and attend SC meetings and participate in teleconferences, 2) provide and maintain a Manual of Procedures (MOP), 3) develop, in collaboration with the SC, a customer satisfaction survey for investigators to evaluate the quality and acceptability of the product and timeliness of the service provided, 4) develop, in collaboration with the Clinical Coordinating Center (CCC), maintain and update a secure and password protected web site page and provide updates to the CCC as needed, 5) produce large-scale, preclinical-grade vectors (both viral and non-viral), in accordance with Good Laboratory Practices (GLP) and applicable State and Federal regulations, for use by NHLBI-funded investigators. Vectors may include, but are not limited to, retroviruses, lentiviruses, adenoviruses, adeno-associated viruses, and non-viral plasmid vectors. Preclinical vectors shall be highly characterized in terms of physical and biological titer, amount of replication competent virus, and other quality control tests including but not limited to sterility, mycoplasma, endotoxin, and cell DNA, 6) maintain, in a secure and confidential manner, an electronic database of all orders made for vector production and submit data, as defined and called for in the MOP, 7) prepare and ship vectors, in accordance with the MOP and state and Federal guidelines, upon completion of production and testing, 8) maintain product-related inventories in a secure and confidential manner, 9) monitor facilities to ensure quality control of vector production and accuracy and completeness of production data, and maintain and make available for review, as necessary, records of monitoring activities, and 10) prepare materials for and participate in site visits to the contractor's facilities and ensure that up-to-date versions of all required certifications, inspections, and assurances are available for review during site visits.</p>
<p>This announcement is not a request for proposals (RFP) and, although one award is anticipated, the Government is not committed to award a contract pursuant to this announcement. A five-year "Cost-Reimbursement-Completion" type contract with a "Multi-year" FAR 17.1 funding mechanism, is being considered for this requirement. The ultimate contract type and funding mechanism will be determined by the NHLBI, based on what best fits the GTRP program goals and the available funding. The RFP will be available on the FedBizOpps web page at http://fedbizopps.gov. Prospective offerors are responsible for downloading the RFP and all attachments. It is also offerors' responsibility to monitor the FedBizOpps web page for the release of any amendments to the RFP.

<DESC><p>NOTICE OF INTENT TO SOLE SOURCE</p>
<p>The National Marine Fishery Service is in need of Satellite Tags that are to be deployed on a marine mammal research cruise in the Gulf of Mexico during the summer of 2012. These tags will utilize the ARGOS satellite system to transmit dive data from select marine mammals and also provide the means for accurate geo-location while the animal is surfaced. The tags will be applied remotely via a compressed air powered launcher from the bow of a small boat at the zenith of a close approach to a select animal. These tags must withstand the impact g-forces generated by the delivery process and must sustain regular dives to at least 1000 meters. The tags will be packaged in a slender cylindrical sleeve made of surgical stainless steel. This stainless steel body must allow for the attachment of a screw on anchor mechanism on the end opposite from the wet switches and transmission antenna. These tags are routinely used in research to determine spatial distribution, better understand habitat use and help to understand population dynamics.</p>
<p>Based upon a review of both the government's requirements and market research conducted the Sources Sought Notice for this solicitation, NOAA intends on soliciting and negotiating a sole source purchase order with only one source under the Authority Cited: The Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994 (Title VIII, PL 103-355) as implemented at Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.102 and FAR Subpart 13.106-1(b). Wildlife Computers, Inc. has designed and built the above satellite tags. They have proprietary drawings, engineering data and parts necessary to build these essential components. As an example of the intricate requirements of these satellite tags, the following are minimum functional requirements of the tags: operational range in open ocean environment attached to moving animals to depths of 1000m, temperature of 0o to 60o C, and placed globally; lithium battery sufficient to sample data for one year and transmit at least 10,000 32 byte transmissions; tag with salt-water switch and with out-of-water sonsor;16 Mbytes of non-volatile flash memory; 12-bit analog converters to provide high-accuracy depth and temperature readings; 8-bit analog-to-digital converter for light level and battery voltage readings; depth accuracy of 1% or better, measureable between 0-1000m with a resolution of 0.5m; temperature accuracy of 1% or better, measurable from 0 to +60o C with a resolution of 0.05C; on-board real-time clock temperature-compensated to accurately time data readings. These specifications are essential to ensure the compatibility of results with earlier results of the similar studies. Wildlife Computers is the only U.S. Supplier that has satellite tags meeting the requirements for obtaining the data required by the project objectives.</p>
<p>All responsible sources that believe they have they have products that meet these requirements may submit a proposal or quotation, which if considered by the agency is received no later than April 30, 2012 by 3:00 PM CST. Responses may be forwarded electronically to Joan Clarkston at joan.e.clarkston@noaa.gov or fax at (816)274-6966. The response shall be no more than ten (10) single-sided pages in length and shall address the following topics:<br />- Organization's name, Address, Phone Number, Email, and Point of Contact Information<br />- Brief summary describing your organization and how it fits into this requirement<br />- Product Information and Specifications for proven and available items offered that meet the requirements stated above.</p>
<p>All documentation shall become the property of the Government. Unless otherwise stated herein, no additional information is available.</p>

<DESC>The following are the vendor responses to our announcement to purchase name brand products:
VENDOR COMMENT I think the requirement for the ability to read old technology recordings is a slippery slope. Many old digital recorders used .wav files that can be read by any manufacturer even if it were to mean removing a "proprietary" header.Lastly, the effective "sole source" would undoubtedly increase your procurement cost, being mindful that open procurement is preferred in federal acquisitions.
RESPONSE: The technicians in Yellowstone have always been the individuals who retrieve the scenario reconstruction assignments. We are currently trying to pass this on to the Law Enforcement office (they are the majority of requests) due to the high volume of requests that have been coming in and increasing yearly over the past 5 years. We feel strongly a solution that only requires users to learn one system would greatly best meet the needs of  Yellowstone Park. Telephone or radio communications call requests often go back a number of years. Yellowstone is attempting to acquire the newest technology possibly by looking for a recorder with options such as word recognition, Project 25 PTT ID displayed, drag and drop functions for the incident reconstruction program along with ability to record VOIP phone and digital ROIP radio circuits. We are not sole sourcing to an individual company. We are requesting a name brand allowing suppliers of that name brand to compete.*****************************************************************************VENDOR COMMENT: My techs here are looking at the 'retrieval' options you discuss for Yellowstone and NICE
RESPONSE: It would be great if all the recorder companies ran open architecture. With today's technology evolving rapidly, the time frame for upgrading these systems is getting smaller and smaller. This would open up opportunities for consumers like Yellowstone that are upgrading. Our Wordnet Series 3 is about 8 years old and the support for it ended March 2010.*****************************************************************************VENDOR COMMENT: I understand your desire to be able to go back to archived recordings.  I am assuming that it is the base technology that Red Box took over so that is why they have that capability.  It is highly likely that there are going to be no other products that will be backwards compatible with that NICE system.This effectively makes it a sole source so I would request that the park reconsider its position for two reasons.The first is that Red Box is not a US based company.  Although I am sure that the Park is not required to "Buy American", in the state of this economy, I would hope that this would play a very large role in your decision making process. It is all over the nation in the public sector and the American call recording companies should be considered first.
The second reason is that I believe there will be a substantial price difference between Red Box and many other systems that are available that can do the same or more.  Our experience with our installed systems which is in excess of 1,000 placements is that 95% of all incidents are identified within the first 60 days.  So the question is how much time savings is there for the ability to retrieve archived data.  It is our opinion that the extra time using an antiquated system for a minimal number of searches is negligible for archived data.
RESPONSE: See response above for retrieval requirements in Yellowstone. I do not know why Red Box is the only product that can be configured to be compatible with the NICE Wordnet series 3. This is a great feature that fits into Yellowstone's operational needs. The Red Box system that Yellowstone is looking into is assembled in Maryland with a server bought in the U.S. (standard Dell/HP/other). The software is bought from Red Box in the U.K. and installed on the server by American Telecom Solutions in Maryland. The Red Box is at least 60 percent derived from the U.S. 
After reviewing vendor comments to the sources sought notice Yellowstone National Park will proceed with a Brand Name Only Combined Synopsis/Solicitation.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial', 'sans-serif'">The proposed Phase 2 scope of work for the logical follow on project is as follows:<br style="mso-special-character: line-break" /><br style="mso-special-character: line-break" /></span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial', 'sans-serif'">Item 1 - Complete the mailroom requirements in order to meet NARA standards for the x-ray machine.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial', 'sans-serif'">Item 4 - Demolition of existing DX Roof Top Air Handler feeding entire North End of VA office space and replacement with chilled water Air Handler tied into the new energy efficient chilled water system installed under Phase 1. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial', 'sans-serif'">Items 1 through 4 were originally designed to be included in the initial task order, but the indicated said items were not allowed due to ARRA fund restrictions, so they were removed from the scope of the original order's solicitation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial', 'sans-serif'">The VA operates this space 24 hours a day and requires special VA security clearance for the contractors as well as GSA security clearance.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>VA security is in addition to GSA security and is given only to persons requiring access in the space.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Not many contractors have this access because they have not worked in VA space.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The current contractor already has GSA and VA clearances which is crucial, so there are not more delays and/or setbacks.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There will already be multiple interim work stoppages that will be required to perform the work, so the current contractor's knowledge of the VA's operation is also critical.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial', 'sans-serif'">Failure to add said items back via the logical follow-on contract may lead to multiple warranties that need to be administered, causing additional administrative burden. By utilizing this logical follow on action, the client would incur less disruption and retain a superior technically qualified contractor throughout all phases of the project requirements. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial', 'sans-serif'">The benefit to VA and GSA awarding a follow on contract to the current IDIQ-CMc contractor on site is a savings based on Overhead &amp; Profit (OH&amp;P) which is approximately 2% lower than other IDIQ-CMc contractors who bid on the current project.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial', 'sans-serif'">In addition, this work is a natural progression of the current work: the parties are familiar with the project requirements, integrated into a team, already mobilized, and familiar with the current conditions. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>The follow on methodology keeps this material solution within the confines of the current contractor/vendor/project team - ensuring the correct fit to the specific needs of the VA.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial', 'sans-serif'">The services required are so co-mingled that this could cause performance, continuity, warranty administration and compatibility problems resulting from another contractor performing services.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial', 'sans-serif'">Prices will be reviewed against current similar projects and the R.S. Means catalog along with competition from the subcontracting opportunities.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial', 'sans-serif'">Furthermore, the incumbent contractor had a technically superior proposal in conjunction with the lowest price proposal which was determined to be the best value to GSA.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Given the brief passage of time, the prices quoted for the initial work will provide a negotiating reference for the follow-on work, and the quality of the offer for the follow-on would be of similar quality.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Competing the highly similar and compatible follow-on work among the same pool of vendors is unlikely to result in a better value in terms of quality for the price.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial', 'sans-serif'">Utilization of the proposed follow on contract would allow the work to commence immediately and would allow the client to meet their mission goals.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial', 'sans-serif'">As identified in paragraph #3 above, the initial contract was competed and of the 3<span style="COLOR: red"> </span>offerors received, Hof Construction's was technically superior to the others and offered the lowest price proposal.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It is unlikely that an additional procurement would yield a better offer for the logical follow-on work.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial', 'sans-serif'">In addition, the learning curve on this project could potentially put our contract milestones at risk.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Depending on the successful contractor, security clearances would have to be received before any new associates could perform work on this contract.</span></p>
