<SUBJECT>PREP Multi-Component Evaluation
<SOLNBR>11-233-SOL-00206
<CONTACT>Camille M. Timmerman, Contract Specialist, Phone 3014436851, Email camille.timmerman@psc.hhs.gov
<DESC><p>The proposed acquisition listed herein is unrestricted. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Program Support Center, Division of Acquisition Management intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) on behalf of the Family and Youth Services Bureau (FYSB) and the Office of Planning, Research and Evaluation (OPRE) within the Administration for Children and Families (ACF) of HHS for the multi-component evaluation of the State grant portion of the Personal Responsibility Education Program (PREP) authorized by Section 2953 of the Patient Prevention and Affordable Care Act (ACA). The RFP number is 11-233-SOL-00206. The NAICS code is 541611</p>
<p>PREP is one of multiple efforts at the Federal level to reduce teen pregnancy through the use of evidence-based practices. The program provides $55.25 million in formula grants to States to "replicate evidence-based effective program models or substantially incorporate elements of effective programs that have been proven on the basis of rigorous scientific research to change behavior, which means delaying sexual activity, increasing condom or contraceptive use for sexually active youth, or reducing pregnancy among youth." More information on the program can be found here: <a href="http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/fysb/content/programs/tpp.htm">http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/fysb/content/programs/tpp.htm</a></p>
<p>The goal of the PREP Multi-Component Evaluation will be to document how programs funded through the State PREP program are implemented in the field and to assess selected PREP-funded programs' effectiveness. The evaluation is expected to include three primary, interconnected components, or "studies": (1) a broad descriptive analysis of how States designed and implemented PREP programs, (2) the collection and analysis of performance management data, and (3) impact and in-depth implementation evaluations of four to five specific PREP-funded sites. Below is a description of each of these components:</p>
<p>1.) Design and Implementation Study: A survey of how States designed and implemented PREP programs. Using multiple methods of information collection, including surveys that may be conducted with all states operating PREP programs, the study would document the general design and implementation of PREP State grant programs. Among other information, ACF is interested in the following: how States and/or sub-awardees elected to replicate evidence-based effective programs or substantially incorporate elements of effective programs; how States and/or sub-awardees placed substantial emphasis on both abstinence and contraception; and how States and/or sub-awardees addressed the required adulthood preparation subjects.</p>
<p>2.) Performance Analysis Study: Creation of a system to monitor grantee performance and analysis of performance data. The contractor would develop performance measurement instruments and set up a system for tracking performance, including integrating the system with ACF's On-Line Data Collection (OLDC) system and providing training and technical assistance to reporting agencies. The contractor would use the system to quarterly and annually report on State PREP performance outcomes, in order to determine if PREP grantees (i.e. States and sub-awardees) are meeting performance benchmarks related to the program's mission and priorities.</p>
<p>3.) Impact and Implementation Study: An impact and in-depth, high-quality implementation evaluation of a select number of PREP-funded programs. Using an experimental design in approximately 4 to 5 sites, with an average of approximately 1,500 research sample members at each site, this study would test the effectiveness of a range of PREP program models to impact behavior and related outcomes. The impact evaluation is expected to involve a baseline survey and two follow-up surveys (e.g. a short-term follow-up survey at 6 months post-program and a long-term follow-up survey at some point between 12 and 24 months post-program). A critical component of this impact evaluation will be an in-depth, high-quality implementation data collection and analysis effort of each site evaluated. In addition to measures of fidelity (e.g., adherence, exposure/dosage, quality of service delivery, participant response), this in-depth analysis would document how specific programs implemented key components of the PREP programs (e.g., substantially incorporating elements of effective programs, placing substantial emphasis on abstinence and contraception, and addressing adulthood preparation subjects).</p>
<p>The evaluation - which is expected to be a seven-year effort - will make a significant contribution to the teen pregnancy prevention evidence base and literature.</p>
<p>The RFP will be made available electronically at http://www.fedbizopps.gov no sooner than 15 days after the issuance of this notice. All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the agency.The closing date will be approximately 60 days after issuance of the RFP.</p>

<SUBJECT>National Center on Child Care Subsidy Innovation and Accountability
<SOLNBR>11-233-SOL-00260
<ARCHDATE>07152011
<CONTACT>Camille M. Timmerman, Contract Specialist, Phone 301-443-6851, Email camille.timmerman@psc.hhs.gov
<DESC>The proposed acquisition listed herein is unrestricted. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Program Support Center, Division of Acquisition Management intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) on behalf of the Office of Child Care (OCC) within the Administration for Children and Families (ACF) for a National Center on Child Care Subsidy Innovation and Accountability, as described below. The RFP number is 11-233-SOL-00260. The NAICS code is 541611.
<p><br />The OCC supports low-income working families&nbsp;through child care financial assistance and promotes children's learning by improving the quality of early care and education and after-school programs. The OCC is responsible for administering the Child Care and Development Fund (CCDF) - a program that helps low-income families access child care for children while parents work or participate in education or training. A portion of CCDF also is used to improve the quality of child care. In FY 2010, the OCC awarded $5 billion in CCDF funds to States, Territories, and Indian Tribes through block grants. States and Territories invest $1 billion each year in quality improvements.<br /><br />Each State, Territory and Tribe appoints a Lead Agency to administer the CCDF funds. These Lead Agencies make decisions about CCDF priorities, policies, and expenditures, including: determining eligibility requirements, setting family co-payment levels, establishing provider payment rates, setting target populations, and prioritizing quality investments. States, Territories and Tribes are required to complete a comprehensive planning process every two years, and to provide information on child care policies to ACF in biennial CCDF Plans.</p>
<p>OCC recognizes that efficient, well run programs enhance access to services for eligible families and children and create a key link in the education of young children and the self sufficiency of families. The National Center on Child Care Subsidy Innovation and Accountability will provide technical support that combines strong policies that support access, quality, and accountability into a holistic framework. Subsidy administration encompasses a wide range of activities that may include, but is not limited to, program management and governance, strategic planning, policy review and development, community partnerships and business practices. Program integrity involves the strengthening of accountability while continuing to preserve access for eligible children and families. The center will coordinate activities that combine subsidy administration and program integrity through coordinated technical assistance activities. The intersection of these two areas will help ensure that child care subsidy programs are being managed in an efficient and effective manner and that limited program dollars are leveraged to benefit the low-income eligible families for which assistance is intended.</p>
<p>OCC has established a Child Care Technical Assistance Network (CCTAN) to support the work of States, Territories, and Tribes that administer the CCDF. In the years 2007-2011, CCTAN projects included: After-School Investments; the Center on the Social and Emotional Foundations for Early Learning; Child Care Aware; Child Care and Early Education Research Connections; the Child Care Information System Technical Assistance Project; the Communications Management Center; Healthy Child Care America; the National Child Care Information and Technical Assistance Center; the National Infant and Toddler Child Care Initiative; the Tribal Child Care Technical Assistance Center, and the Child Care Improper Payments Initiative.</p>
<p>In FY 2011, OCC will reorganize its CCTAN to specialize its technical assistance (TA) in core areas, including the following new projects: the National Center on Child Care Quality Improvement; the National Center on Child Care Professional Development Systems and Workforce Initiatives; the National Center on Child Care Subsidy Innovation and Accountability; and the State Child Care Systems Specialist Network.</p>
<p>The period of performance for this contract is expected to be a base year plus four option years. The purpose of this contract is to create an integrated technical assistance framework that provides valuable support to Lead Agencies in their efforts to: <br />&nbsp; - Develop and maintain a strong subsidy administration that promotes policies and implementation strategies that are child-focused, family-friendly, and that work in partnership with child care providers; and <br /><br />&nbsp; - Increase accountability and integrity of programs to ensure that program dollars are utilized appropriately and efficiently to promote high-quality services and best serve the low-income eligible families for which assistance is intended.</p>
<p>While the specific topics for new technical assistance will evolve based on current needs, input from stakeholders and the CCDF Plans and goal setting, OCC's objective is for the technical assistance, consultation, training and materials under this contract to help States and Territories work toward four core goals:</p>
<p>1) A higher proportion of low income children, in particular children who receive child care subsidies, served in higher quality care.<br />2) Increased stability and continuity of subsidy receipt and quality child care arrangements to promote families' financial security and children's development. <br />3) An adequate and stable supply of high quality providers.<br />4) Strong program integrity in the context of CCDF.</p>
<p>The RFP will be made available electronically at http://www.fedbizopps.gov no sooner than 15 days after the issuance of this notice. All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the agency. The closing date will be approximately 40 days after issuance of the RFP.</p>

<DESC>This is a notice of American Embassy Kuwait, in accordance with FAR Part 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirement, to continue with ALICO the current contractor with health coverage as a sole source. The current health insurance coverage contract expires October 15, 2011. A pre-solicitation FedBizOpps notice was posted on September 17, 2011 for the upcoming new contract (SKU200-11-R-0752). However, with such short time it is not possible to release, and award a new fully competitive contract. Therefore, and to insure there is no break in health insurance coverage, it is required to continue with ALICO the current contractor with health coverage as a sole source. The duration of this bridge contract is six months with two three-month option periods. Base period will start October 16, 2011. American Embassy Kuwait proposes to award a sole source contract for these services. Attached is Justification and Approval For Other Than Full and Open Competition (Overseas Contracting Activities).
