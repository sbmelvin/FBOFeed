This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of Panduit non-metallic raceway, fittings, and accessories.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government’s requirements, for Department of State infrastructure distribution requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. IRM/OPS/ITI/LWS/ITL has identified the Panduit non-metallic raceway, fittings, and accessories as key components of the Department’s network distribution system. Equipment listed above is required to provide network cabling distribution to existing Department of State’s enterprise network distribution systems based on compatibility (size, color, fit, etc) with existing Panduit non-metallic raceway presently installed at U.S. Foreign Missions worldwide.  The Installations Branch currently has Panduit non-metallic raceway in stock and requires the same name brand to maintain distribution system integrity, and standardization of warehouse, bill of materials, and installation management. As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements as a key component of the Department’s network distribution system. The Panduit non-metallic raceway, fittings, and accessories are necessary for seamless integration and installation to existing non-metallic network cabling distribution systems.  Using other brand name non-metallic raceway, fittings, or accessories would require restocking the warehouse with the same other brand name non-metallic raceway components and subsequent replacement of entire distribution systems at U.S. Foreign Missions worldwide to ensure compatibility.  Simple one-for-one replacements or additions as needed would not be practical as it may entail a completely new cabling distribution system at one or more locations.<BR><BR>

The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government’s requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. CA/CST has identified the HP 9250c Digital Sender as equipment that will enable the government to scale down bulky files by scanning documents and storing them in a digital format.  The Digital Sender 9250c is designed to support network authentication, which will require users to log on before they can use the digital-sending options.  The Digital Sender 9250c can also make use of Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) to find e-mail addresses on directory servers that are located elsewhere on a network.  The HP Digital Sender 9250c is a net accessible device that users can employ to scan, package, and distribute scanned documents.  It converts black-and-white and color documents, drawings, and photographs into an electronic form for direct distribution to multiple destinations.  It includes a flatbed scanner as well as an automatic document feeder that accepts up to 50 pages. As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements as a key component of the Department’s networking system. The HP 9250c Digital Sender has undergone test and assessment, received final approval from the Department of State IT Configuration Control Board, and has been deployed at several offices of the U.S. Department of State.  The following features are unique to the HP 9250c Digital Sender and best meet the Department’s requirements for a digital sender: •	E-mail can be used to distribute the electronic forms.  The document can be scanned and sent to one or more e-mail recipients in the form of a PDF, JPEG, TIFF, or MTIFF file. •	The 9250C is designed to directly send documents to a LAN fax, Internet fax, or Windows 2000 fax destination •	Network folders or FTP can be used to save electronic forms created by the 9250c Digital Sender with additional information about the document.   •	A printer can also be set up as a workflow destination, allowing scanned documents to be printed<BR><BR>

<DESC>Current Contractor will educate multidisciplinary health care providers about chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) to enable timely detection, diagnosis, and management of the illness, ultimately resulting in improved care for persons with CFS.  The purpose of this procurement is to continue and further develop health care provider educational activities initiated under contract 200-2002-00793 with the CFIDS Association of America.  The CFIDS Association of America successfully competed and was awarded a five-year contract to develop, implement, and evaluate a program to educate health care providers concerning evaluation, diagnosis, and management of CFS.  This is a continuation and further development of the initial contract.  The health care provider education contract is closely associated with CDC?s CFS Public Awareness Campaign, which is also managed under contract by the CFIDS Association of America.  It is the opinion of CFS subject matter experts responsible for developing, monitoring, and evaluating CDC?s CFS control program that award of the health care provider education contract to another contractor would disrupt the current tight coordination between the two related activities and complicate CDC?s current CFS control effort.  Building on this existing program for various reasons (time-efficient, cost-effective) is in the Government?s best interest.  Consequently, it is believed that the CFIDS Association of America is the sole source having the capabilities which will meet the above mentioned requirements of the CDC.  It is the intent of the CDC to award a contract with CFIDS if this is found to be true.

<DESC>Contractor (CDC Foundation) will provide administrative support for a research project conducted at CDC.  Contractor will hire staff scientist to conduct laboratory tests and analyses at CDC in consultation with approval by CDC.  Contractor will oversee the collection and transport of breast milk specimens from mothers who have young infants in resource-rich and poor countries as well as the support of testing and analyses of these specimens.  CDC has been working with the CDC Foundation because of its experience and expertise in managing personnel and finance, and the established infrastructure and network with scientists and experts in the field of rotavirus worldwide.  The CDC Foundation has unique authority to hire and place fellows at CDC.  The CDC and the CDC Foundation already have established arrangements for other rotavirus programs using funding from outside donors.

<CONTACT>Christie VandenDries Contract Specialist 9077863415     christie_vandendries@fws.gov;
<DESC>The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Region 7, intends to award a sole source procurement to Western Ecosystems Technology, Inc., to perform consultation, statistical analysis, modeling population data, and report writing regarding Chukchi/Bering Seas polar bear populations. The work involves using models for changing sea ice conditions and the potential effects of global warming on design of line transect monitoring procedures for estimation of the abundance and distribution of polar bear, a species that is under consideration for listing under the Endangered Species Act. Additional intensive computer simulation analyses are required to investigate the statistical properties and logistical constraints of a line transect aerial survey for polar bears for the Chukchi/Bering Seas population. This simulation will aid in determining necessary sample sizes (number of transects) and survey stratification necessary for obtaining a population estimate with a desired level of precision (cv ? 20%) necessary for management actions in the event of changing sea ice conditions. A final report summarizing the methods and results of the simulation analysis will be written and if the simulation indicate an aerial survey for polar bears is a viable and cost-effective option under varying sea ice conditions, a final study plan will be included in the report which will describe recommended methods for incorporating predictive maps from a resource (i.e., sea ice) selection function into survey planning and design, a final survey design, and detailed statistical methods for development of a population estimate. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and the Government does not intend to accept proposals received.  Award will be made 15 calendar days after publication of this notice. See numbered note 22.

<DESC>BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT (BAA) 07-44 Sensor Tape; 
CLOSING DATE: 19 June 2008.  PROPOSALS FOR FIRST SELECTIONS DUE: 4:00 PM (Arlington VA local time), 13 August 2007.  POC: Dr. Jennifer Ricklin, DARPA/STO; Email: BAA07-44@darpa.mil; Website: http://www.darpa.mil/sto/solicitations/sensortape/index.html.  This BAA plus the associated Proposer Information Pamphlet (PIP) constitute the full BAA and proposers must obtain and follow the details of submission set forth in the PIP.

PROGRAM OBJECTIVE AND DESCRIPTION:  The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Strategic Technology Office (STO) is soliciting research proposals to develop, test and demonstrate medical monitoring systems for DoD applications and operations. The objective of this program is to develop low-cost medical sensor systems to support DoD missions, in particular to measure the cumulative effects of blast exposure, and to assist in combat medical care, patient triage, and physiologic monitoring in support of physiologic performance. It is anticipated that meeting the goals of this program will require furthering print-on electronics and ink formulation technologies. DARPA is interested in receiving proposals that exploit the novel properties of print-on electronics to develop these medical monitoring systems.   
There are two principle systems of interest: helmet (or body-mounted) blast dosimeters; and basic patient physiological monitoring devices that measure, for example, heart rate, body temperature, pulse, respiration and blood oxygen saturation.  Each system should consist of a patch-like sensor device, and a monitoring unit for communicating with the sensor tape patch.  Other innovative medical devices that incorporate print-on electronics and related enabling technologies may also be proposed.  Proposals may address one or more systems of interest, but must propose a full and complete program for the development, test, field demonstration and, if necessary for the proposed device, Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of each system. 
The program will consist of two phases with metrics that must be met to progress to the second phase.  The bidder should develop a program plan that clearly delineates major work efforts and critical milestones in each phase so that a logical technical development path for each proposed system is evident.  Bidders must also outline a path for obtaining FDA approval, if necessary for the devices to be developed, and document their ability to follow Federal guidelines for the protection of human subjects.  DARPA expects that performers will develop the hardware and software necessary to accomplish these program objectives.  Their plan should include testing to be performed by a government activity in independent government-monitored tests at key milestones.  The program will culminate in Phase 2 with a field demonstration of the devices developed, which have been scaled and packaged to in-service system size, weight and power.
Phase 1 
Phase 1 will focus on developing and demonstrating the proposed sensors and the communications capability for the patient monitoring device. A design using all print-on sensors is strongly desired and encouraged, including the patient monitoring device communications capability.  However, hybrid solutions that meet the required size, form factor and cost metrics will be considered.  It is anticipated that this will require a focused effort to further the performance of conductive, semi-conductive and resistive inks and associated technologies, as well as improvements in printing resolutions.  Required deliverables in Phase 1 include: at least twenty-five sensors for Government testing (with the specified communications capability for the patient monitoring device); an analysis of the cost of the proposed sensor tape patches when produced in lots of 100,000; and, for those devices that require FDA approval, a detailed plan and list of required documentation to complete an FDA approval process.  
Phase 2 
Phase 2 will focus on the integration of all components (sensors, communications, memory, etc) onto a flexible substrate, scaled and packaged to in-service system size, weight and power, with adequate shelf life and field durability. A monitoring unit (preferably hand-held for the patient monitoring device) for communicating with the sensor tape patch shall be developed, along with suitable algorithms for data extraction and display.  The developers shall produce ten monitoring unit prototypes and 1000 sensor tape patches for each system developed.  After obtaining FDA approval (for the devices that require this), the program will conclude with a demonstration of the developed systems in suitable field exercises. Proposers should include the support of these exercises in their program plan.

This solicitation covers technologies in the following areas: print-on electronics, micro-electronic machines, radio frequency radios, wireless networks and protocols, medical triage and patient monitoring, human physiological sensing, acoustic sensing and mensuration, micro power storage.

DARPA requests proposals for the full scope of development (e.g., an end-to-end system designed by a team of multidisciplinary research organizations, plus an integrator for coordination and implementation support).  Proposals addressing only individual component-level technologies will be considered nonresponsive to this BAA.

This BAA shall remain open through 19 June 2008.  Although the Government may select proposals for award at any time during this period, it is anticipated that the majority of funding for this program will be committed during the initial selections.  Proposers may submit a full proposal at any time up to the BAA closing date.  In order to be considered during the initial round of funding, full proposals must be submitted to DARPA, 3701 North Fairfax Drive, Arlington, VA 22203-1714 (Attn.: BAA07-44) on or before 4:00 PM (local Arlington VA time), August 13, 2007.  

The Government encourages responses to this BAA by non-traditional defense contractors, nonprofit organizations, educational institutions, small businesses, small disadvantaged business concerns, Historically-Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU), Minority Institutions (MI), large businesses and Government laboratories.  Teaming arrangements between and among these groups are encouraged.  However, no portion of this BAA will be set aside for organizations of a specific business classification due to the impracticality of preserving discrete or severable areas of research in the technologies sought.  Government/National laboratory proposals may be subject to applicable direct competition limitations, though certain Federally Funded Research and Development Centers are excepted per PL 103-337 ? 217 and PL 105-261 ? 3136.  Any responsible and otherwise qualified offeror is encouraged to respond.

Proposers may be foreign firms or may team with foreign firms as long as the firm meets the criteria in this BAA and the Government is otherwise permitted to conduct business with the firm.  Proposers may include foreign personnel as part of their proposed resources as long as these personnel qualify technically, export control laws are complied with, and such foreign personnel sign any and all appropriate non-disclosure agreements prior to participating in the research effort.

This BAA affords proposers the choice of submitting proposals for the award of a Cooperative Agreement, Contract, Technology Investment Agreement, Other Transaction for Prototype Agreement, or such other appropriate award instrument.  The type of procurement vehicle is subject to negotiation.  

The Government intends to issue awards based on the optimum combination of proposals that offer the best overall value to the Government.  The Government reserves the right to award without discussion.  The Government reserves the right to select for award all, some, or none of the proposals received in response to this BAA.  The Government also reserves the right to select for award some portion(s) of the proposals received; in that event, the Government may select for negotiation all, or portions, of a given proposal.  The Government may incrementally fund any award issued under this BAA.

EVALUATION CRITERIA:  The criteria to be used to evaluate and select proposals for this project are in (descending) order of importance: (A) Technical Approach; (B) End Product Benefits and Cost; (C) Management Approach; (D) Potential Contribution and Relevance to the DARPA Mission; and (E) Cost and Schedule Reasonableness and Realism.  Each proposal will be evaluated on the merit and relevance of the specific proposal as it relates to the program rather than against other proposals for research in the same general area, since no common work statement exists.

SECURITY:  The Government anticipates proposals submitted under this BAA will be UNCLASSIFIED.  

ADDITIONAL GUIDANCE:  Additional information regarding program objectives, anticipated schedule, technical milestone criteria, and proposal preparation and submittal is provided in the PIP associated with this BAA.  Proposers choosing to respond to this BAA must obtain the PIP associated with this BAA.  You can access these documents at www.fbo.gov.  This BAA and PIP together constitute the full BAA for this project. All questions regarding this announcement should be sent to BAA07-44@darpa.mil.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman:  solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).

The reason justifying other than full and open competition is that Kollsman Inc. produces the only system capable of meeting the requirement with the specific proprietary software, hardware, and interfaces required. Under the authority of U.S.C. Title 10 2304(d)(1)(B) Contracts competition requirements and pursuant to FAR 6.302.1(B)(1)(i), when there is a reasonable basis to conclude that the agency’s minimum needs can only be satisfied by unique supplies or services available!   from only one source or only one supplier with unique capabilities.  Kollsman Inc. is the original equipment manufacturer and the vendor of the AN/PAS-22 LRTI. The LRTI APS will allow the Government to organically troubleshoot, diagnose, repair, and maintain the AN/PAS-22 LRTI systems at the Field Level, by fielding the capability to select Intermediate Maintenance Activities (IMA) geographically located in support of Marine Forces (MARFORs), both CONUS and OCONUS, which best meets the Government’s needs and current mission requirements. It is essential that the Government uses the original equipment manufacturer to purchase the systems and incorporate the variant needed. Kollsman Inc., has the proprietary rights to the AN/PAS-22 LRTI and can incorporate the required software and interfaces to the LRTI APS. Kollsman Inc. is the only source that can meet the Government's requirement in quality and time. This announcement is not a request for competitive proposals; however, !  if you believe that your company can provide the required items, pleas e call or e-mail the Contract Specialist.  Inquiries should be directed no later than July 9, 2007 at 4:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time (EST) to Tom Anable , Contract Specialist at thomas.anable.ctr@usmc.mil or via telephone at 703-432-3632, Reference: M67854-07-R-1148.  The Government anticipates contract award on or about 15 August 2007.  The Government will review all responses, without prejudice; whether or not the Government initially determines that another firm is fully qualified to fulfill the PG-13 IWS/ONS Program requirements.  Note:  If documents are sent via e-mail, the contractor will be responsible for validating Government receipt by calling the Contract Specialist.

Repair and Maintenance of AN/PVS-10(V)1, 5855-01-410-8979, Sight, Night Vision, Sniper Scope (SNS) and AN/PVS-10(V)2, 5855-01-499-1239 Sight, Night Vision, Sniper Scope. This is a market survey to locate potential sources of repair and maintenance for the AN/PVS-10(V) family of day/night scopes. The AN/PVS-10 SNS system is an integrated day/night weapon system providing both day and night firing capabilities in a single sight.  The SNS is used on the M24 rifle for the Army and the M40A3 rifle with the Marine Corps.  Typ ically, night sights are only used for operations at night and as such have only a night channel. Operation in the daytime would require removal of the night sight and installation of a day scope. This would require alignment each time a sight is removed and re-installed. Alignment is critical to sniper weapon accuracy for both day and night operations. The SNS is an integrated day and night sight and thus eliminates the need for changing sights between day and night operations. The govern ment is seeking interested sources for the Repair and Maintenance of the AN/PVS-10(V) family of day/night scopes. The government intends to purchase these services using an indefinite quantity/indefinite delivery (IDIQ) contract over a five-year period. Re spondents must have extensive knowledge of the AN/PVS-10(V) system. Potential offerors will be responsible for turning the nonfunctional components received from the government into ones which meet the most current operation form, fit, and function as call ed out by applicable technical data within a repair cycle time of thirty (30) days. This effort also requires the maintenance of a parts inventory sufficient to support the aforementioned repair cycle time.  Depot Maintenance Work Requirements (DMWRs) do n ot exist for this equipment.  A complete technical data package was never procured and therefore is unavailable.  The Government will not provide any test equipment or facilities for this effort.   Any interested sources must send the following information, NLT 10 July 07, to C-E LCMC IEW/S Directorate, ATTN: AMSEL-LC-IEW-N-II (Adam Butryn), Bldg. 1201, Ft.

<DESC>NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) intends to issue a sole source Request for Proposals (RFP) to Ball Aerospace & Technologies Corporation (BATC) for continued performance under the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Instrument Servicing (HIS) contract.  This continued performance is required to ensure uninterrupted support to cover existing and potential repairs to HST science instruments through Servicing Mission 4 (SM4). The HIS contract was awarded in 1998 as an Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract to maximize long-term HST science return through repair and re-use of previously developed hardware and software and common support functions. The HIS contract allows the Government to leverage this unique opportunity by achieving efficient, optimized use and allocation of common resources.  Due to numerous programmatic changes, which have resulted in delays of SM4 to the current September 2008 schedule, continued support is required to complete the effort needed for SM4. In order to meet the HST SM4 schedule, and provide the specialized expertise to implement instrument repair solutions, a sole source procurement from BATC is required. No other companies have the knowledge and understanding of the unique HST instruments who can provide the flight hardware in time to support the September 2008 launch date. BATC has designed, built, assembled, integrated and tested three generations of flight instruments for HST. There are currently four instruments on HST built by BATC and they are providing new instruments for SM4. The continued operations will allow Ball to continue support for on-orbit anomaly investigation as well as hardware for the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) and Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) repairs that are planned for SM4. BATC will continue support of overall HST on-orbit instrument servicing and anomaly resolution; participate as a member of the Independent Team to review the current HST instrument power supply designs; provide flight-quality power supply electronics boxes and CCD Electronics Boxes (CEB) for ACS repair; provide support for designing the interfaces to the ACS power connector; complete development of the STIS repair; and  provide support for testing and evaluating system performance for Engineering and Flight Model builds of the instrument repair solutions. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Statutory authority for this sole source procurement is 10 U.S.C. 2304 ( C ) (1)—Only One Responsible Source. However, organizations that believe they can provide these services without any detrimental impact to the program schedules, may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 3:00PM EST on June 30, 2007. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All qualified responsible sources may submit an offer, which shall be considered by the agency.  An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<CONTACT>Roberta J. Truax Contracting Officer 3039695582     roberta_j_truax@nbc.gov;
<DESC>The Department of Interior, National Business Center Request for Quote, NBCR07017, Market Analysis Report, is a solicitation for Fixed-Price Contract.  Solicitation Number NBCR07017 applies and will be issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ) for the following requirements: GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF SERVICES:  The Office of Minerals Evaluation (OME) conducts mineral assessments and market analyses of various Indian Reservations in support of the Indian Land Consolidation Act activities.  The estimated value of mineral estates is a factor that must be considered in determining an overall fair market value for the land.  Under this contract, the OME is seeking a market analysis of the mineral commodities considered marketable on the Wind River Reservation. The goal of this proposed contract is to receive a well written, unbiased, logical, and supported market analysis report reflecting current conditions within and in the vicinity of the Reservation and reviewing all information for the surrounding area.  This information will be used to determine if the lands under analysis may contain a potential mineral contribution to their value. A preliminary list of mineral commodities present within the general area of the Wind River Reservation includes but is not limited to oil and gas, coal, coal bed methane, limestone, travertine, gypsum, phosphate, bentonite, and sand and gravel.  Other potentially viable mineral commodities may become evident during the information gathering phase of the report, and should be reported on in the same fashion as those already mentioned above. Information being sought includes all leases (business permits and mineral leases), royalties (terms, rates and amounts) and any direct sales information of all mineral commodities.  Along with leasing information the contract is seeking all sales and exchanges of mineral properties both on the Wind River Reservation and in the surrounding area.  If the property sale was for fee simple estate then the contractor needs to relate how the subsurface estate was considered in the appraisal exercise.  Surrounding area should be considered the area of influence of each potential mineral commodity and how they influence value of that mineral commodity for lands within the Reservation.  The report is all information gathered up to but not including the preparation of an appraisal report.  When the contractor finds numerous comparables for sales of the subsurface, all sales are required under this contract, complete with results of interviews for each sale.  A large part for the fulfillment of this contract will be the compilation and analysis of leasing information for all mineral commodities and the proper displaying and analysis of that leasing information.  OME expects a review of historical leasing records to properly reflect trends in the leasing activity of the mineral commodity. The contractor is expected to provide analysis and discussion of the mineral commodities found during this exercise.  The mineral assessments phase of the report will be an ongoing effort during the period of time for this contract. It is the responsibility of the contractor to ensure that an extensive search for data is conducted and that all minerals/commodities of interest in the area are adequately covered.  It is the responsibility of the contractor to keep OME abreast of their activities.  OME and contractor will meet at a minimum of once a month to review status. The estimated award date is August 1, 2007.  This is a full and open competition.  The Government intends to award this contract on an all-or-none basis. Contractors must be registered at http://www.ccr.gov in order to be eligible for award.  The solicitation will be made available at http://www.fedbizopps.gov on or about June 22, 2007.  The solicitation must be downloaded via the Internet, as hard copies will not be made available.  Please print the Standard form (SF-1449) and print all clauses and attachments.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

NOTE:  (THIS BAA IS A RE-PUBLICATION OF DARPA BAA 07-19 SUSPENDED ON 13 FEBRUARY 2007)

The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is soliciting research proposals in the area of survivability of microwave receiver front-ends from high energy threats.  The objective is to create a microwave receiver front-end which can withstand high energy exposure without compromising receiver sensitivity, bandwidth, or dynamic range.  

The objective of the Electromagnetic Pulse Tolerant Microwave Receiver Front-End program is to develop a novel robust and sensitive microwave receiver front-end capable of surviving high energy electromagnetic attacks.

This notice does not obligate the Government to award a contract nor does it obligate the Government to pay for any bid/proposal preparation costs.
Per AFFARS 5352.201-9101: An ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition. When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official. Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern.  Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution. Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMB Circular A-76 competition performance decisions).  If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the Center/MAJCOM ombudsmen, Mr. Michael R. Jackson, HQ AMC/A7K, 507 Symington Drive, Scott AFB, IL 62225-5022, (618) 229-0267, fax (618) 256-6668, e-mail: michael.jackson@scott.af.mil.

The ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds the agency.  Do not contact the ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical requirements. Such inquiries shall be directed to the Contracting Officer.

<DESC>The 77th Aeronautical Systems Group (77 AESG), Aircrew Performance Division (TA), seeks input from industry on the Modular Aircrew Common Helmet (MACH) Draft Request for Proposals (RFP). The objective of the MACH program is to provide a single helmet system capable of meeting all rotary and fixed wing mission requirements.  The joint forces require the ability to easily and rapidly transition between required capabilities (e.g. symbology displays, cueing, and night vision) or use these devices simultaneously for optimum capability. The MACH will provide a common, modular solution to permit units to tailor helmet capabilities to suit mission requirements. The Draft RFP and associated documents are attached separately from this notice. Interested vendors must have an account with FedTeDS to access the Draft Performance Specification. This account can be set up at https://www.fedteds.gov. Comments to the Draft RFP are due no later than 4:00pm CDT on 09 July 2007.

<DESC>South PBC Synopsis

POC: Mr Thomas Flagmeier, Contracting Officer, (210) 536-4517, Tom.Flagmeier@brooks.af.mil; Mary Ellen Laick, Contract Specialist, (210)536-5668, MaryEllen.Laick@brooks.af.mil
DESC: NAICS 562910 (Environmental Remediation Services) applies to this acquisition, with a size standard of 500 Employees. The Air Force Center for Engineering and the Environment (AFCEE), Brooks-City Base, TX desires to enter into a Performance Based Contract (PBC) for the Southern Bases.  The objective of this PBC contract is to reduce the Air Force life cycle cost while maximizing the number of sites closed at Former Bergstrom AFB, Texas; Eaker AFB, Arkansas; England AFB, Louisiana; Homestead AFB, Florida; Myrtle Beach AFB, South Carolina; and Reese AFB, Texas.  The Air Force prefers to maximize the number of Site Closures.  If Site Closure cannot be obtained, the next preferred objective is to reduce life cycle costs through Optimized Exit Strategies.  Maintaining the status quo, while acceptable, is considered the least preferred objective.  

The period of performance (POP) of this solicitation (including options) will be ten years with an estimated award date in first quarter FY08.  Offerors are required to stay within the AF budget. The total projected ceiling for this program is $32.6M. The anticipated ceiling for the full and open award is $19.2M; and the anticipated ceiling for the Small Business set aside is $13.4M.  The Status Quo rough order of magnitude (ROM) is based on the continuation of the current AF approach (e.g. status quo) on all sites for the next 10 years.  The Full Site Closure Scenario is based on all sites in the Statement of Objectives (SOO) within the POP with no financial liabilities being returned to the AF.

The Government plans to award two (2) contracts.  The Government anticipates that one (1) contract will be awarded to a large or small business under a full and open competition and anticipates that the other contract will be awarded as a small business set-aside.  The Full and Open competition will be open to both large and small business contractors and will address the restoration and site closure requirements at the former Myrtle Beach and England AFBs.  The small business set aside is only open to small business and will address the requirements at the former Reese, Bergstrom, Homestead, and Eaker AFBs.

 
Large business firms must comply with FAR 52.219-9 ?Small Business Subcontracting Plan?. The subcontracting goals/targets for the South PBC contract are as follows: 

Small Business  28% of total awarded or obligated dollars
Small Disadvantaged Business  5% of total subcontracted dollars
Woman Owned Business  5% of total subcontracted dollars
HUBZone Small Business  3% of total subcontracted dollars
Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business  3% of total subcontracted dollars
Veteran Owned Small Business  3% of total subcontracted dollars

Personal visits to discuss this announcement WILL NOT BE SCHEDULED.

<SUBJECT>99 -- Overt Small Laser Marker (OSLM)
<SOLNBR>OSLM0002
<RESPDATE>062207
<ARCHDATE>07072007
<CONTACT>Richard Boast, Contracting Officer, Phone 813-826-7975, Fax 813-826-7504, Email richard.boast@socom.mil
<DESC>Background

This is a market survey to locate potential sources for the development of an Overt Small Laser Marker (OSLM).  The United States Special Operations (USSOCOM) is researching the use of a light and compact laser marker system to mark targets for Laser Spot Track (LST) capable aircraft.  

Combat operations require Fire Support elements to be able to mark targets for LST capable aircraft from MOUNT and rural environments.  This laser marker must be light and compact enough for soldiers to carry on helicopter assaults and foot movements.  Reducing the size and weight of Fire Support equipment (e.g. Laser Target Designators (LTDs), Radios, Infrared (IR) pointers, etc.) is critical to ensure soldiers are able to carry vital equipment during all possible infiltration/exfiltration options.  These factors will reduce soldier fatigue, provide accurate target mark/identification (ID) in order to accurately engage enemy targets and ensure mission success. The tasks proposed by the customer in this Request for Information (RFI) shall provide for specifications of the (OSLM) for use in developmental and operational testing.  

This RFI is to assist the Government in determining the extent and capabilities of existing technology to meet the requirements of the OSLM.  The Government places emphasis on the proposed system?s size, light weight, and its ability to achieve the stated requirements.   The Government anticipates a formal Request for Proposal (RFP) to be published in 1QFY08 based on the outcome of this RFI. 

The Government requests respondees provide a plan to achieve the Threshold/Objective (T/O) requirements in a concise manner which shall consist of no greater than 10 pages and be composed in Times New Roman 12 pt font.  The Government requests that the offeror?s intended plan include a Schedule and Compliance Matrix detailing the plan?s compliance to stated specifications.  Moreover, it is requested the respondees provide information specifically addressing those items/specifications that can not be achieved during this effort.  The intended plan shall also include an estimated cost which shall consist of all design, development, non-recurring engineering and production costs for 2 prototype units which shall be used for testing and operational evaluation by the user.  Additionally, respondees shall submit a proposed production plan to meet fabrication requirements of the current customer?s Basis of Issue Plan (BOIP) of approximately 10 systems.

Required Specifications

The United States Special Operations Command has identified the following required specifications of the prototype OSLM system.

5.	The OSLM shall have a manual override for over-heating (T/O)

6.	OSLM Power Source:  The internal power source for the OSLM shall be CR123 or AA with the ability to be connected to a BA 5590 or BA 5557 for longer duration lasing (T/O).  New lightweight battery technology used to reduce overall weight of the system as well as increasing the length of laser bursts will be sought and tested (O).

7.	The OSLM shall have the ability to be mounted to a tri-pod system for terminal guidance operations (T/O).

8.	The laser display shall be easily visible to the operator with the ability to adjust the brightness and display of the following, at a minimum:

b.	PRF Code (T/O)
c.	Overheat/Time for Cool Down (T/O)

9.	The OSLM shall have a safety switch for on/off that is similar to the safety for a pistol (T/O).

10.	The OSLM shall include a holster that can be worn on the leg or detached to be fixed on a Modular Lightweight Load-carrying Equipment (MOLLE)-type vest (T/O).

11.	The OSLM shall allow for quick boresighting in the field with the SEE Spot III (T/O).  This may include a removable rail that allows the system to be mounted on the SEE Spot III.

12.	The OSLM shall include field bore sighting targets (T/)

13.	All laser output power data shall be provided in milliWatts (mW) (T/O)

Performance Requirements

The United States Special Operations Command has identified the following performance requirements for OSLM system:

1.	The OSLM power output shall be sufficient for aircraft using advanced targeting pods to acquire the spot at 8,000 ft AGL (T) / 25,000 ft AGL (O) using aircraft specific standoff during all environment conditions.
2.	The OSLM shall be able to mark a target, with the aircraft able to acquire, at a range to target of 1,500 meters (T) / 5,000 meters (O).
3.	The beam divergence of the system shall be 0.5 mrad (T), 0.25 mrad (O).
4.	The OSLM shall mark targets for laser spot capable aircraft (T) and conduct terminal guidance operations for laser guided munitions (O).
5.	The OSLM shall have a fixed sighting system (T/O). This sighting system should work like common fixed sights on a pistol.
6.	The OSLM?s internal power source will operate (insertion and extraction) like a pistol magazine (T/O) and include three of these ?magazines? per system.

<DESC>The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is issuing this Request for Information (RFI) seeking information for market research and planning purposes.  The IRS will consider the information received in order to better understand industry capabilities as well as determine the best acquisition strategy.  This synopsis shall not be construed as either a solicitation or Request for Proposals (RFP).  No solicitation document currently exists; please do not request a copy of a solicitation.  The IRS does not intend to award a contract on the basis of responses received nor otherwise pay for the preparation of any information submitted to the IRS.  No acknowledgement of receipt of responses will be made, nor will respondents be notified of the IRS? evaluation of the information received.  Telephonic inquiries regarding this RFI will not be accepted.  Any question submitted regarding this potential requirement will not receive responses.  Interested firms are highly encouraged to participate in the establishment of our future requirement. 
The RFI detail document will be provided on the internet at https://www.fedteds.gov (FedTeDS), and is available on the IRS Procurement Business Opportunities website at: http://www.irs.gov/opportunities/procurement/article/0,,id=171073,00.html additional documents may be added or existing documents may be replaced with revised versions.  Notification to Vendors/Contractors will be made via http://fedbizopps.gov if documents are added or replaced.
The IRS is requesting industry information regarding Contact Center Services to support the Automatic Call Distributor (ACD), Interactive Voice Response (IVR), Work Force Management (WFM), and Contact Recording technology components of its contact center infrastructure.  The Contact Centers are an infrastructure dedicated to support taxpayers who want to communicate with IRS via telephone network.  The IRS requests a high level description of the vendor?s approach, practices, and capabilities to provide the services requested in this RFI.  The vendors are also encouraged to propose alternative approaches that may be different than the requirements outlined in the RFI detail document published on the FEDTEDS system (identified above)
The scope of the Contact Center Support Services requested in this RFI includes both contractual and operational elements to support and improve IRS? existing operations. The scope of the Contractor services will include the maintenance and support of the IRS Aspect ACD, IVR, WFM, and Verint Contact Recording technology components, and their interoperability with other existing IRS contact center elements.  The high level objectives of this initiative, as defined by both the contracting and operations organizations, are summarized as follows.
Streamline service ordering process.  The new contracting vehicle will address ordering, managing, and accounting for day-to-day operational support required to expand or modernize the current technology.  The contracting organization will interface with one source for all services and supplies.
Improve incident response and troubleshooting process.  The Contact Center Support Services Contractor will be responsible for end-to-end system troubleshooting of technologies covered under the support services; minimizing the coordination requirements.  The Contact Center support services operation will implement a common methodology, based on the overall IRS incident and problem management approach, for classifying and tracking problems. The support structure will clearly define the lines of responsibility between organizations and the escalation procedures.
Improve quality of operations.  The contract will implement innovative proactive monitoring and management techniques to identify issues before they become performance impacting events. The Contractor will leverage root cause analysis to improve problem management.  Service Level Agreements (SLAs) will be established along with empirical performance measurements to measure and improve operations.  
Business Focus approach.  The system expansion and operations will be defined by IRS in terms of business needs. Contractor will be tasked with identifying solution options to meet these needs.  Proposed solutions will be presented to IRS and will be evaluated as part of the standard IRS change management process.
Common change management process.  The process for system and configuration changes will adhere to the overall IRS change and configuration management process.
Incorporate security as an integral process.  The contract will incorporate IRS security requirements into the overall technology planning, implementation and support process. The Contractor will be required to interface with the applicable internal and external security organizations and ensure that all vulnerabilities are addressed in a timely manner.
The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes that would apply to this RFI would be 811213 Communication Equipment Repair and Maintenance with the small business size standard of $6.5 million, and 334210 Telephone Apparatus Manufacturing with the small business size standard of 1,000 employees.

All development activities related to this BAA are subject to International Traffic in Arms  Regulations (ITAR).  Depending on the specific projects proposed within a concept paper, performance may require access to and/or generation of technical data, the export of which is restricted by the Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2751), Executive Or der 12470, and/or DOD Directive 5230.25.  Violation of these export laws is subject to severe criminal penalties.  As this BAA seeks concept papers to evaluate prior to a government determination to request a formal proposal, qualified foreign contractors shall be permitted to submit concept papers for evaluation through their appropriate embassy.  However, a foreign company, entity, or foreign national who submits a concept paper, or upon request by the government, a formal proposal, is hereby advised that  contract award is contingent upon meeting established national security requirements for countries determined eligible to participate relating to the subject matter contained or proposed within the concept paper and/or formal proposal.  In addition, forei gn contractors are advised that depending upon the specific subject matter submitted with a concept paper or formal proposal, the underlying duties relating to contract performance may be considered classified or require access to controlled unclassified d ata or information. In such instances, performance of the duties required may necessitate that the contractor and/or subcontractor(s) have the legal authority and security criteria as to some, if not all of the following: 1) Authority to access classified, military sensitive, or controlled unclassified data; 2) The capability of any contractor, subcontractor, and the respective employees of each subcontractor or prime contractor to access U.S. classified data; 3) a secure facility to perform the inherent duties required under any proposed effort relating to contract award as demonstrated by a duly approved DD 254; 4) The possession of a U.S. security clearance for any contractor, subcontractor or their respective employees; 5) A current COMSEC account; and 6) A current valid license duly approved by the U.S. Department of State under the Arms Export Control Act, 22 U.S.C. § 2778.  Any contractor or subcontractor considering this BAA is advised that foreign national employees may be prohibited from participating or working on a proposed effort, depending upon the national security issues presented within the specific concept paper or  formal proposal.  Foreign Nationals (also known as foreign persons) means any person who is NOT a citizen or naturalized citizen of the US; or a lawful permanent resident; or a protected individual as defined by 8 U.S.C 1324b(a)(3). To streamline the proposal process, offerors must first submit a summary concept paper for evaluation. From this summary concept paper, the Government will indicate whether the subject matter technology described in the proposal is of interest to the Gover nment and whether to request that the offeror submit a formal proposal for further consideration.  The Government, at its option, may provide comments that may be of assistance to any submitter on whether to submit a formal BAA proposal. Concept papers wil l be evaluated upon receipt.  Acknowledgement of receipt of concept papers will not be made nor will the concept paper be returned.  After initial review, the Contracting Office will ask only those offerors with promising concept papers to submit full tech nical and cost proposals.  The Contracting Office will notify offerors within 90 days of receipt of concept paper if a full proposal is requested.  Concept papers not selected for full proposal submission will be disposed of in a manner to protect propriet ary data.  All proprietary material in any submission should be clearly identified as such. The concept paper should include the proposed technical concept, rationale, objectives, methodology, expected results, and the potential contribution to the USA AMR DEC.  In addition, the concept paper should include a period of performance, anticipated cost, and any evidence of the offerors past performance on Government contracts. The concept papers are limited to 5 pages (8 1/2 x 11 single-spaced), in English text, in MS Word for Windows" format, with one a dditional page for technical drawing if necessary.  All concept papers, proposals, written communications or documentation concerning this BAA shall be forwarded to the Contracting Officer, Mr. Earnest Taylor, via e-mail,  earnest.taylor@conus.army.mil wit h a copy to Ms. Valerie Tipton, via e-mail,  valerie.tipton@conus.army.mil.  Facsimile proposal submission is not authorized under this announcement.  In no event shall classified data be included in any concept paper or formal proposal.  Concept papers wi ll be evaluated based on technical merit, offerors past performance, and potential contribution to the USA AMRDEC mission. Technical merit will rank significantly higher than past performance. Technical merit will be determined by evaluating the following  factors:  (1) The white paper has pertinent novel ideas in the specific branch of science and technology involved; (2) The offeror has availability, from any source, of necessary and qualified research, test, laboratory, or shop facilities, and; (3) The p roposal is from a technically qualified source.  Evaluation of concept papers will determine which efforts are of sufficient interest to the Government to merit a request for formal proposal. Contractors are not authorized to submit a formal proposal unles s expressly requested to do so. THE GOVERNMENT EXPRESSLY RESERVES THE RIGHT TO REQUEST A FORMAL PROPOSAL FOR ANY, ALL, PART, OR NONE OF THE SUMMARY CONCEPT PAPERS RECEIVED. This announcement is an expression of interest only and does not commit the Governm ent to make any contract award or to obligate government funds to pay for response preparation costs. In the event a formal proposal is requested, it shall identify subject areas that may be deemed classified, or require access to controlled unclassified i nformation. The cost of proposal preparation or response to this BAA is not considered an allowable direct charge to any resultant contract or any other contract. Interested parties should be alert for any BAA amendments that may be published. Concept pape rs may range from theoretical studies to a proof-of-concept, including fabrication, delivery and test of prototypes. USA AMRDEC seeks to receive concept papers only for the research efforts described herein. USA AMRDEC contracts with educational institutio ns, nonprofit organizations, and private industry for research in those technical areas listed above.  Any contract awards that result from this BAA are expected to be either in the form of Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee completion and/or level of effort. For plannin g purposes, awards made in response to formal proposals are anticipated to be in the $100K to $30M range for the basic contract with a period of performance not to exceed 36 months.  In addition to the basic contract, up to four option years can be propose d.  However, the total contract value (of each individual contract) within the formal proposal for both the basic and option years may not exceed $75M, and the total period of performance for the basic and option years cannot exceed 60 months, including ti me for preparation, approval, and distribution of any final report.  The following reports may be required (specific reporting requirements will be specified by the Government in the event a contractor is requested to submit a formal proposal):  1. FUNDS A ND MAN-HOUR EXPENDITURE REPORT, DI-FNCL-80331/M, monthly; 2. TECHNICAL REPORT, DI-MISC-80508, as required and a one time Final report; 3. STATUS REPORTS, DI-MGMT-80368, monthly; 4.

PERIODIC PROGRAM REVIEWS (such as IPRs, SRRs, SDRs, etc.), as required.  7.DA Manpower Reporting Requir ements.   Proposals that include both the basic contract period and option periods, should contain a work summary contemplated for each 12-month period, to enable negotiation for an entire five-year project or for individual one-year increments of a total project.  Formal proposals shall contain a detailed performance schedule for each discrete task, with cost data including labor-by-labor categories. The Government will provide selected offerors with formal proposal content requirements. Formal proposal co ntent and format shall contain, not be limited to: (1) Statement of Work (SOW): A concise document suitable to incorporate into a resultant contract that provides a qualitative description of the proposed work in terms of technical advancement, improvement , or end product to be developed.  The SOW should state objectives, how those objectives benefit the Government, and stated in terms of their potential utility to the R&D and Warfighter communities. The SOW should also include a proposed schedule detailing  significant milestones and deliverables. (2) One page resumes of the offeror's key personnel (including alternates, if desired) who will be involved in the effort, with documentation of previous relevant work experience especially important. (3)  The type  of support, if any, the offeror requests of the USA AMRDEC, such as facilities, equipment, or materials. Any request by offerors for Government furnished property/equipment must be clearly identified in the formal proposal, although in no event shall the Government be under any obligation to grant such requests. Offerors should be prepared to provide viable alternate approaches if the Government is unwilling or unable to provide the requested property/equipment. (4)  A statement regarding possible impact, if any, of the proposal's effect on the environment. (5)  A brief description of your organization.  (6)  The facilities to be used for the work.  (7) A listing of current R&D contracts along with Government POCs (contracting officer & technical). Offerors  shall specify any identified potential organizational conflicts of interest.  The financial portion of the proposal should contain a detailed cost estimate sufficiently detailed for meaningful evaluation by Government officials. The budget must include th e total estimated cost of the project, including any potential for cost overruns.  Universities are reminded that costs for research projects conducted on behalf of the U.S. government are governed exclusively by OMB Circular A-21.The estimated project cos ts must be broken down for each year of the program to show the following: (1) A list of participants, not necessarily by name, showing the time and number of direct productive person hours (DPPHs) to be charged by principal investigator(s), research assoc iates, and assistants, and the total amount per year to be paid to each from the project.  For proposals from universities, the time and amounts to be charged should be identified by academic year and summer effort. (2)  An itemized cost list of permanent equipment. Permanent equipment is any article of non-expendable tangible personal property having a useful life of more than two years, and an acquisition cost of $500 or more per unit. (3)  A general description and total estimated cost of expendable equi pment and supplies. (4)  Contemplated expenditures for travel with a brief explanation.  Travel budgets that exceed $1,500 per principal investigator per year or that include foreign travel or travel by other than principal investigators will require speci al investigation. (5)  Other direct costs. (6)  Cost for consulting services, if any, showing number of days, daily rates, and estimated travel/per diem costs.  The need for consulting services must be fully justified. (7)  Indirect costs indicating whethe r rates used are fixed or provisional, and the time frames to which they are applicable (e.g., a fixed rate may apply until a specified date, after which the ra te becomes provisional). (8)  The fee, if any, which the organization proposes to assess the research project. (9)  Subcontracts and material costs proposed must be fully supported and documented (written quotes, engineering estimates, etc).  Pursuant to S ection 8(d) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(d)), it is the policy of the Government to enable small business concerns to be considered fairly as subcontractors to contractors performing work or rendering services as prime contractors or subcontrac tors under Government contracts, and to assure that prime contractors and subcontractors carry out this policy.  Subcontracting goals for small and small disadvantaged businesses (including HBCUs/MIs) are 23 and 5 percent, respectively.  Subcontracting goa ls for women-owned small business are 5%, for HUBZone small business 3%, and for service-disabled veteran-owned small business 3%.  These goals will be considered when proposals are submitted.  The Government anticipates that any contract resulting from th is BAA will be funded on an incremental basis as provided by FAR 52.232-22, Limitation of Funds.  Any formal proposal approval is subject to fiscal law statutory restrictions governing the availability of government funds.  Proposals will be evaluated on t heir own merit and not against other proposals submitted under this announcement.  The primary basis for selecting proposals for award shall be technical merit and importance to agency mission requirements and R&D programs.  Management, cost realism, and p ast performance shall also be considered.  The following factors will be considered in the evaluation of formal proposals received under this BAA. General:  The government selection of the proposal(s) for award will be based on an assessment of which propo sal(s) is/are the most advantageous to the government considering technical and management in accordance with the evaluation criteria, cost, and fiscal law constraints governing availability of funds, using the factors set forth below. The Government antic ipates the possibility of multiple awards under this Broad Agency Announcement, although no minimum or maximum number of awards is guaranteed.  THE GOVERNMENT EXPRESSLY RESERVES THE RIGHT TO SELECT FOR AWARD ANY, ALL, PART, OR NONE OF THE FORMAL RESPONSES RECEIVED. Evaluation Factors for Technical Area: a. Overall Scientific/Technical Quality - The offeror will be evaluated on the overall scientific/technical merits of the proposed research and development.  The scientific/technical merits may include poten tial for state-of-the-art improvement, with special emphasis on innovation, originality and uniqueness. b. Qualifications - Capabilities and qualifications of the key research personnel, relevant offeror experience, and adequacy of facilities and instrumen tation as required. c. Research and Development Contribution - Potential contribution of the proposed research to USA AMRDEC in the above technology areas. Evaluation Factors Management Area: a. Overall Scheduling and Planning - The offeror's approach will  be evaluated based on the overall scheduling and planning for performance of the effort. b. Expenditure Control - The approach for controlling expenditures and labor hours. Evaluation Factors Cost Area: a. Cost realism analysis will be conducted to assess  the likelihood that the technical management approaches proposed could be accomplished at the cost proposed. b. Total Evaluated Probable Cost.  The proposal will be evaluated to develop the government's estimate of the most probable cost to the government  of successfully completing the contract using the technical and management approaches proposed.  An unreasonably priced proposal may be indicative that the offeror does not fully understand the scope of the proposed effort.  The cost area will not receive  an adjectival rating.  Evaluation Factors Past Performance Area: a. Past Performance is one indicator of an offerors ability to perform the contract successfu lly.  b. The proposal will be evaluated upon information received from the offeror, as well as information obtained from any other sources, when evaluating the offerors past performance.  Currency and relevance of the information, source of the informatio n, context of the data, and general trends in an offerors past performance shall be considered.  c. Proposals should include evidence of past performance of both management and technical performance, including past or current contracts (including Federal,  State, local government and private contracts for efforts similar to the proposed effort.  Offerors are also authorized to provide information on problems encountered on the identified contracts and the offerors corrective actions, if applicable.  The ev aluation team shall determine the relevance of any similar past performance information, including predecessor companies, key personnel with relevant experience, or proposed subcontractors that may perform major or critical aspects of the requirement if re levant to the proposals at issue here.  Past performance of offerors in complying with subcontracting plans goals for small disadvantaged business concerns (SDB), monetary targets for SDB participation, and extent of participation of SDB concerns in terms of the total value of the acquisition, are all factors that will be considered in evaluating past performance. Proposals from entities without a record of past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available are still encouraged, a s such offerors will not be evaluated either favorably or unfavorably on this evaluation subfactor.  Relative Importance of Evaluation Criteria: 1. Technical:  The technical area is significantly more important than the management area.  The factors under the technical area are of equal importance. 2. Management:  The management area is significantly less important than the technical area.  The factors under the management area are of equal importance. 3. Cost: Although the technical and management areas ar e more important than the cost area, cost is still considered a significant evaluation factor. Proposed costs must be fully detailed and have a complete justification.   The total proposed cost must be within the total contract value as specified in the In troduction of this BAA. 4. Past Performance: Past performance is significantly less important than the technical factor, but is still considered significant, as it indicates that the offeror can successfully accomplish the proposal upon any award.  Governm ent will award favorably evaluated proposals based on availability of funds and interest to AMRDEC.  Selection of proposal(s) for award will be based on an assessment of which proposal(s) is/are the most advantageous to the government considering technical , management, and cost.  The number of awards, if any, are subject to availability of funds.  Participants are requested to submit proposals containing information in either the unclassified or classified category, up to the Secret level.  The contractor w ill be required to receive and store information at a classification level matching his submittal, which must fall within the categories of unclassified or classified up to the Secret level. This BAA is issued under the provisions of paragraph 6.102(d)(2) of the Federal Acquisition Regulation, which provides for the competitive selection of research proposals.  Contract(s) based on responses to this BAA are considered to be the result of full and open competition and in full compliance with the provisions o f PL 98-369, The Competition in Contracting Act of 1984.   Previous concept papers submitted prior to amendment of this BAA shall be duly considered.  This BAA amends the previously issued BAA, and shall remain in effect for a period of one-year from date of synopsis.

<DESC>1.  INTRODUCTION: a. This Request for Information (RFI) is issued solely for information and planning purposes; it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. This request for information does not commit the Government to con tract for any supply or service whatsoever. Further, the Department of Defense is not seeking proposals, and will not be responsible for reimbursing cost incurred in response to this RFI.  All costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested partys expense. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP.  If a RFP is released, it will be synopsized on the Army Single Face to Industry (ASFI) website at https://acquisition.army.mil/asfi/.  It is the responsibility of potential offerors to monitor this webssite and any other pertinent website for additional information pertaining to this requirement. b. The request is for information only and will allow the Army to identify alternative technical approaches and develop an estimate of program cost and effectiveness.  As part of the first phase, the Army may conduct an information exchange meeting with re presentative companies under each of the alternatives cited in Paragraph 2, below.  It is anticipated that these meetings will take place in the July timeframe or earlier.  As stated in Paragraph a., this does not constitute a RFP.  Life cycle costing info rmation will strictly be used as an aid in ascertaining a Government estimate for these candidate representative solutions as a means to completion of the required Economic Analysis. 2.  PURPOSE:  The purpose of this RFI is to gather information to support the investigative case management system utilized by the Department of Defense Criminal Investigative Task Force (CITF). The government is looking for information in the following ca tegories: (1) firms that have the resources (people and facilities); (2) Commercial Off-the Shelf (COTS) or Government Off-the Shelf (GOTS) products capable of fulfilling the Criminal Investigation Task Forces needs as they are determined; (3) a combinat ion of categories (1) and (2); and (4) development of a personnel manning solution that would fulfill CITF sourcing needs within the stated timeframe. 3. BACKGROUND: The Criminal Investigation Task Force (CITF) has sole responsibility for conducting the investigation of alleged or suspected war crimes, acts of terrorism, and other related offenses committed by non-U.S. citizens against the United States or U.S. personnel. The CITF provides Department of Defense (DoD) a unique joint investigative capability tailored to the specific terrorist target and specifically designed to support the Global War. The CITF utilizes a centralized case management and investigation information automation system that provides a means of tracking and saving all collected investigative/intelligence information with reports being automatically populated and published; as w ell internal data mining tools for developing investigative leads This investigative information system structure allows for critical link analysis on the fly, which means an investigator/analyst will have all previous reports and incidents related to the subject at his or her finger tips during subsequent investigations. The main location of service will be at Fort Belvoir, Virginia. One position may be located at the Guantanamo Bay Naval Station, Cuba. Travel outside the National Capital Region will be ne eded on an opportune basis and managed by exception. 4.  TIMEFRAMES:  For planning purposes, this RFI is being conducted in support of an acquisition decision in the August 2007 timeframe.  5.  CAPABILITIES:  The functional responsibilities listed below provide the Investigative Case Management System requirements. Those responding to this request,  must categorize responses by identifying capabilities that currently exist, capabilities curre ntly  under development, and capabilities that can be planned and scheduled.  For each of these three categories, responses are expected to address each subparagraph below.  All responses must be accompanied by a plan addressing the approach, including a schedu le, which describes the candidate technology and proposed approach for the CITF Investigative Case Management System, method of supply/delivery (e.g. full delivery or spiral delivery with proposed approach to provide full capability), training, deployment,  maintenance and sustainment.  Responses must also include information on licensing arrangements, if applicable, and an estimate of cost for the development, training, deployment, maintenance and sustainment of the Investigative Case Management System. Res ponses are not to exceed the maximum equivalent of 20 pages, including schedules. Functional Requirements Overview The Contractor shall initially be able to provide no less than eighty percent immediately functionally qualified personnel to support all aspects of the CITFs investigative case management mission. An illustration of how the CITF employs its central over -arching case investigative information system follows. The over-arching case information management system is utilized to identify investigative leads and prepare prosecutorial material against enemy detainees awaiting trial by Military Commission. It has been and continues to be the Criminal Investigation T ask Forces major information technology (IT) tool in support of the war on terror. It performs critical investigative mission functions that are not duplicated by any other single information management system or group of management information systems th at are collectively available to the investigative special agents.  Because many of the specific CITF missions supported by this system are classified, an exhaustive list of critical missions supported by it is unavailable. This case investigative manageme nt system assist CITF in examining, investigating and verifying potential participant object relationships to identify, track and investigate potential or suspected terrorists.  Participant object relationships, simply described, represent the relation ship of the individual detainee to his/her environment, including the detainees friends, family members, related institutions, sources of financing, and group (including terrorist group) affiliations.  The case investigative management system serves as th e central point for gathering of information from a wide variety of sources, integrates that information, and presents this information to CITF agents in an easily comprehensible form. It thus facilitates and expedites agents recognition of potential sign ificant object relationships and answer, for each detainee, such critical questions as:  Who is he? Where has he been? Who does he know? Who knows him? Where has he trained, schooled? When did he train, who trained with him? What is his travel history? How  does he support himself?   Detection of potential object relationships often requires review of a huge amount of data in which trends and commonalities are not readily apparent even to a skilled agent. The case investigative management systems ability to  process this data almost instantaneously allows CITF to quickly, effectively and efficiently identify investigative leads.  Further, once an initial investigation is completed, the case investigative system provides critical support to military or if requ ired civilian justice operations and prosecution of war crimes. The case investigative management system is capable of supporting the ultimate prosecution of an individual in any law enforcement arena whether it is military commissions, US or international  court. The case management system contains all the investigative and intelligence information that is available to the prosecutors used in the conduct of the commissions in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. It is the only information source ac credited by the CITF and the Office of Military Commission (OMC). During the conduct of the commissions, all exhibits will be provided to the court and detainee from this system.  The CITF case investigative management system is the repository of the case history of the detainee and as such represents the accumulation of evidence supporting the guilt (or innocence) of the detainee. It facilitates the development of Reason to Believe (RTB) statements that are prepared to assist the President in making his decision whether or not to approve this detainee for trial.  Purpose The purpose of this document is to set forth the CITFs functional requirements and specifications for a web-based Investigative Case Management System. The remaining personnel must be fully capable within two month. General requirements and operational co ncepts are provided in the following subsections. General Description This requirement document is written from the procurement and contracting perspective.

STORAGE AND TRANSPORTATION, LAUNCH SUPPORT, ON-ORBIT OPERATIONS SUPPORT, AND CONSTELLATION SUSTAINMENT OF
NAVSTAR GPS IIR/IIR-M - SATELLITES

18 June 2007


1.0	SCOPE AND ORJECTIVES

1.1	Scope   This Statement of Work addresses the Phase IIC support activities, including Space Vehicle (SV) storage and transportation, launch support, on-orbit operations and the sustainment support of the Global Positioning System (GPS) IIR/IIR-M SVs.

1.2	Objectives  The tasks contained herein delineate the personnel, facilities, materials, and documentation required to support pre-launch storage and transportation, launch support operations, on-orbit operations, and constellation sustainment of the GPS IIR/IIR-M satellites.

2.0	GENERAL BACKGROUND   The first phase of this program was known as Phase IIA and included the preliminary design of the GPS IIR satellites to a level of detail commensurate with a Preliminary Design Review.  Phase IIA also included the completion of the development program.  The production element was known as Phase IIB.  The SV storage and transportation launch, and on-orbit operations support comprise Phase IIC.  On 21 June 1989, the Air Force awarded Contract F04701-89-C-0073 (GPS IIR contract) to Lockheed Martin Space Systems Company (LMSSC).  Under that competitively-awarded Fixed Price Incentive Firm (FPIF) contract, LMSSC designed, developed, produced, tested and delivered GPS IIR SV to the Air Force.  

On 18 August 2000, the Air Force awarded Contract F04701-00-C-0006 (GPS IIR-M contract) to LMSSC.  Under this sole-source Cost Plus Incentive Fee (CPIF) contract, the Air Force furnished eight IIR SVs to LMSSC as Government Furnished Property (GFP) to begin modernization development activities.  

The modernization effort of the GPS IIR SVs incorporated two new military signals, M-Code on L1 and L2 for enhanced accuracy, and a second L2 civil signal on a different frequency to each of the eight existing GPS IIR spacecraft already built and held in storage.  In addition, the modernized SVs offer a modernized antenna panel that provides increased signal power to receivers on the ground and enhanced encryption and anti-jamming capabilities to military users.

Modernization efforts were completed under the GPS IIR-M contract, F04701-00-C-0006, on 19 March 2007.  The government took delivery of the final IIR-M SV and furnished it back to LMSSC as GFP under the GPS IIR contract, F04701-89-C-0073.  Storage and transportation, launch support, and on-orbit operations support services are needed for the remaining three IIR-M SVs beginning 1 January 2008.  Once the remaining IIR-M SVs are launched in CY08, constellation sustainment support for the 20 on-orbit IIR/IIR-M SVs will remain.  The constellation sustainment contract will begin 1 January 2009.

One SV is being modified for an L5 research and development demonstration package.  This particular SV will be one of the last two SVs to be launched.  This contract effort is on the FA8807-07-C-0005 contract to Lockheed Martin.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Technical Support Branch KC (TSBKC) located in Kansas City, MO, intends to establish a fixed price purchase order for MSP Patchlink Security software that will be utilized by NOAA nationwide on a sole source basis from Patchlink Corporation, Scottsdale, AZ based on the following reasons:  1) NOAA currently makes use of Harris Stat Guardian ver. 4.3 and Nessus to scan and detect vulnerabilities on NOAA devices located on their Network LANs; 2)Harris Stat Guardian was recently acquired by Patchlink Corporation,  Patchlink, prior to acquiring Harris Stat, offered an add-on product to the Guardian scanner which provided some level of automated mitigation for vulnerabilities discovered by Guardian; 3) In the last few years Patchlink has become a much more robust product, eventually becoming an integral option of the Harris Stat Guardian product; 4) By purchasing Patchlink licensing, NOAA will be able to acquire both continued Harris Stat Guardian usage, plus the use of the Patchlink mitigation tool.  This tool automatically ties into the Guardian scanner to automatically mitigate all MS vulnerabilities, in addition to a very large number of third party patches; 5)No other product offers this scanning/mitigation ability in an integrated product with the same speed, capability, and proven record; 6) NOAA has invested a large amount of funding into Harris Stat User training which allows an almost seamless transition to the new application architecture; 7) Acquisition of Patchlink will reduce the length of time vulnerabilities remaining on NOAA systems, reduce the IT workload involved in Network Security scanning/mitigation/reporting, and require no additional training for users on software that can be extremely complicated in scope; 8) The upgrading of security that will result from using this product on NOAA Systems has the possibility of preventing losses of data and systems that could be irreplaceable.
 
The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive responses.  However, all responses received within ten days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  Responses can be faxed to Carey Marlow at (816) 274-6923 or submitted via email to carey.m.marlow@noaa.gov .  Interested firms shall include, in writing, the company name, address, point of contact, telephone number, and business size; a statement regarding their capabilities and qualifications; and any additional supporting literature.  Submissions received in response to this notice shall be evaluated based on the following criteria: 1) Demonstrated technical ability to successfully provide the required Patchlink software.  The applicable NAICS code is 511210.

THIS NOTICE IS ONLY FOR MARKET RESEARCH PURPOSES. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Office of Public Health and Science is seeking capabilities statements from organizations with the core competency to provide goods and services towards a 2009 National Blood Collection and Utilization Survey (NBCUS). The NAICS Code is 541690 and the size standard is $6.5M. The NBCUS is a comprehensive survey of blood and blood products establishments which ultimately facilitate DHHS and the PHS Agencies in formulation of national policy regarding the blood supply. Historically, the NBCUS is an approximately 200 question national survey of 3000+ blood banks and blood collection centers which addresses all aspects of blood collection and utilization ranging from amounts of various products to efficacious use of blood regulatory standards. The DHHS intends to survey these facilities regarding their entire 2006 calendar year data; the data collected will need to be analyzed for specific findings and then compared to previous data to look for patterns. Additionally, the concept of Bio-vigilance patient safety monitoring will need to be utilized in the formation of the questionnaire. The objectives to be achieved in this requirement are the following: a) identify, solicit, convene, and foster relevant stakeholder participation in the identification and approval of survey data elements, b) design and produce appropriate paper-based compartmentalized survey instrument, and c) identify appropriate participant facilities and select a sample with appropriate weighting algorithms. The following capabilities are necessary to the Government in satisfying the requirement: (a) experience and expertise in bringing relevant stakeholders together for the purpose of designing a comprehensive blood products related national questionnaire of relevance to the federal government?s role in public health service policy formation. (b) detailed knowledge of systems involved in the blood and blood products community such as collecting, processing, distributing and transfusing blood products. (c) knowledge of blood inventory management practices used by blood collection centers and hospital-based transfusion services (contractor must demonstrate an understanding of blood inventory accounting concepts and statistics) (d) expertise in federal public health responsibilities, current policies and programs relating to the safety and availability of blood and (e) demonstrated experience in building business relationships with and communicating effectively with key staff of blood collection centers and hospital transfusion services. Experience in recruiting and retaining organizational participation in programs similar to the NBCUS is essential. Interested contractors possessing ALL of the required capabilities to meet the above requirement should submit a cover letter along with the capability statement not to exceed 10 pages demonstrating the ability to perform ALL aspects of the effort described therein. Responses must include the following: name and address of the firm, named central point of contact along with email address; DUNS number; any applicable commercial price list(s); size of business, including average annual revenues for the past 3 years and number of employees; ownership; whether they are a large, small, small-disadvantaged, 8(a), HUBZone, woman-owned, veteran-owned, or service-disabled veteran-owned historically black college or university and/or minority service institute, number of years in business; affiliate information: parent company, joint venture partners, potential teaming partners; list of customers covering the past five years; and additional documentation such as company literature and brochures. If this additional documentation supports the required capabilities it is incumbent to address this reference in the cover letter or other area of the capability statement and indicate specifically how it addresses the capabilities sought. A mere referenced website is unacceptable for purposes of this announcement and will not be considered or reviewed. Capability statements must be submitted via email to pscacquisitions@psc.gov to the attention of Jonathan Hamlet and referencing this announcement number. No statements delivered by mail or by hand shall be accepted under any circumstances. Responses are due no later than 12:00 PM Eastern Time, July 2, 2007.

<SUBJECT>A -- Prevention of SHIV Transmission By Antiretroviral Prophylaxis
<DESC>Title:  TITLE: PREVENTION OF SHIV TRANSMISSION BY ANTIRETROVIRAL PROPHYLAX

In the absence of an effective vaccine, HIV continues to spread globally emphasizing the need for novel strategies to limit its transmission. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) with antiretroviral drugs has been demonstrated to be effective in nonhuman primate (NHP) models of HIV infection. Studies have mainly focused on single-drug PrEP with tenofovir (TFV) and have shown the prophylactic efficacy of this drug following high-dose virus inoculation by different routes (oral, intrarectal and intravaginal). More recent work with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF), the currently approved oral prodrug, showed that PrEP with TDF at dosing comparable to the human dose was also partially protective against rectal or oral SIV/SHIV transmission. 

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for HIV, Hepatitis, STD, and Tuberculosis Prevention intends to award a sole source contract under Simplified Acquisition procedures to Alpha Genesis, Inc., Yemasee, SC 29945, the only source that can provide 12 STLV and SRV-free rhesus macaques housed in complex social and physical environments that can be available within one month.  Macaques must be 4 years of age or older and weigh 5 kg or greater.  Macaques must be shipped to CDC, Atlanta, GA 30333. The period of performance is 12 months from date of award.  

This is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation is available.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action based on response to this notice is solely with the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  

Contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR).  Contractors may register by calling 1-888-227-2423 or register via the Internet at www.ccr.gov.

<SUBJECT>A -- Follow up to NEOPAIN, Pain, Morphine and Developing Brain:  School Age Outcomes
<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL.  A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.  The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, Office of Acquistions, The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) Branch, intends to negotiate with Arkansas Childrens Hospital for a three-year noncompetitive contract to conduct a follow up study of the surviving cohort of preterm infants enrolled in the NEOPAIN Grant study 1-R01-HD036484. The Government is interested in obtaining status and information about the role of pain and its long-term effects on the overall health, well being, cognition, academic skill, executive functions, self regulation, attention and school status of the children now reaching ages 6 through 8. As a result, the NICHD does not have legal rights to the identifying data on the original cohort participants. Therefore, the cohort could not be transferred to any other contractor by the NICHD. In order to perform the continued work a new prospective contractor would need access to a comparable cohort of mothers and infants, similar in age, that have been subject to a comparable assessment from infancy. With the exception of the incumbent (Arkansas Childrens Hospital), there is no domestic source presently known to the NICHD that has access to such a cohort and ownership of the specific patient population (required for this study) via data from the initial NEOPAIN Grant. It will cost the government additional time and effort to duplicate the initial NEOPAIN Grant study 1-R01-HD036484. All of the above factors, taken together, make Arkansas Childrens Hospital uniquely qualified for carrying out this study. Authority: 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), as set forth in FAR 6.302-1. Inherent duplication of cost to the Government and unacceptable delays in completing the project make competition unfeasible for this final phase of the study, which provides for longer follow-up and data analysis. The purpose of this synopsis is to determine whether there are other sources capable of meeting the Government's requirements as described. Contractors are encouraged to submit three (3) copies of their written Capability Statements to the contract specialist, at the address provided within 45 days of publication of this synopsis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received should document access to a comparable cohort of mothers and infants, similar in age, that have been subject to a comparable assessment from infancy. The capability statement will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Overnight deliveries should be mailed to the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, Contracts Management Branch, 6100 Executive Boulevard, Suite 7AO7, Bethesda, Maryland 20852. See Numbered Note 22 ****. No collect calls or facsimile transmissions will be accepted.

<SUBJECT>A -- National Standard for Normal Fetal Growth:  Data Coordinating Center
<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL.  A SOLICITATION DCOMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.   The The National Institute of  Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases,  Office of Acquisitions,  The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) Branch, at the National Institutes of Health intends to negotiate and award a contract modification on a noncompetitive basis to the Emmes Corporation,401 North Washington Street, Suite 700, Rockville, MD  20870.    The contractor is to provide for expert coordination, monitoring, data management and statistical oversight ensuring data compliance for a multicenter, prospective study of the National Standard for Normal Fetal Growth.  The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), Division of Epidemiology, Statistics and Prevention Research (DESPR) proposes to conduct a multicenter prospective observational study to: (1) establish a U.S. national standard for normal fetal growth (velocity) and size for gestational age; (2) create an individualized standard for optimal fetal growth; and (3) improve accuracy of fetal weight estimation.  This study will recruit 2,400 healthy, low risk pregnant women. Approximately 600 women each will come from the following self-identified race/ethnicity background: African American, Asian, Caucasian, and Hispanics. Women will be recruited in the first trimester and followed up through pregnancy.  Each woman will receive 5 scheduled ultrasound exams, which include 2-dimensional (2D) and 3-dimentinoal (3D) fetal anthropometric measurements.  Uterine artery and fetal Doppler studies will be performed at selected gestational weeks.  After delivery, neonatal anthropometric measures will be carefully taken.  Obstetric and neonatal information will be extracted from medical charts.  Normal fetal growth is a critical component for a healthy pregnancy and for the long-term health of the child.  An objective assessment of normal and abnormal fetal growth has enormous implications for prenatal care, neonatal care and outcome-based research.  How to define fetal growth restriction is a long-standing challenge in modern obstetrics. Small-for-gestational-age, defined as a birthweight or estimated fetal weight below the 10th percentile at a given gestational week, is commonly used as a surrogate to fetal growth restriction.  The main problem with this definition is that babies with a weight less than 10th percentile are not necessarily growth restricted (e.g., constitutionally small but healthy babies).  On the other hand, a weight above the 10th percentile does not necessarily mean a normal fetal growth.  For example, the rate of fetal growth may undergo pathological decline in late gestation (say, from 75th percentile in early pregnancy to 25th percentile at birth).  In such a case, the birthweight is still above the 10th percentile but the fetus may have suffered from growth restriction indicated by higher perinatal mortality and morbidity.  The key to solving this problem is to develop a method that can identify growth potential for individual fetuses.  The underlying concept proposed by Gardosi et al.(1992) was that fetuses who significantly deviate from their individual optimal fetal size at a given gestation are considered either overgrown or growth restricted.  Mounting evidence demonstrates that this method is a significant improvement over the 10th percentile in identifying and classifying fetal growth restriction.  However, no good standard currently exists for fetal anthropometric parameters measured longitudinally throughout pregnancy in a sufficiently large number of normal pregnancies in the U.S.  The Government proposes to conduct a multicenter prospective study to establish a U.S. national standard for normal fetal growth.   The purpose of this acquisition is to provide a Data Coordinating Center for the above project.  Specifically, the Contractor shall work closely with the NICHD Project Officer and study sites to provide support for data management and coordination.  The requirement to be fulfilled in the proposed contract modification is for expert coordination, monitoring, data management and statistical oversight ensuring data compliance.  Included in this requirement is the use of a web-based data management system for managing the data of a multi-center prospective study.   The contract to be modified is contract N01-DK-3425 with the Emmes Corporation for the project entitled Data Coordinating Center for the Consortium on Safe Labor.   This sole source determination is made under the authority set forth in FAR 6.302-1(a) (2)(ii), only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirements due to a duplication of costs that could not be recovered through competition.  This sole source determination is based up the fact that the Emmes Corporation has developed a web-based data management and specimen tracking system responsive to the research study's needs (e.g. multiple remote users; privacy and confidentiality protection; monitoring recruitment; collecting data; tracking biological specimen) under Contract N01- N01-HD-3-3358.  By virtue of their development of a web-based data management and specimen tracking system that matches the requirements of the proposed study, they are uniquely qualified to perform the proposed effort.  Further, the web based system that has been developed under this contract needs minor modifications in order for it to be used in the proposed action.    For another web-based data management system to be developed a duplication of costs would result.   This duplication is not expected to be recovered through competition.  The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 541710 and the size standard is 500 employees.  The purpose of this synopsis is to determine whether there are other sources capable of meeting the Governments requirements as described. Contractors are encouraged to submit three (3) copies of their written Capability Statements to Elizabeth Shanahan, Contract Specialist, at the address provided within 45 days of publication of this synopsis.  Capability Statements will be evaluated using the following technical evaluation criteria:  1) TECHNICAL APPROACH / UNDERSTANDING THE REQUIREMENTS: a. Demonstrated understanding of the purpose of the project;  b.  Adequacy of the proposed web-based data management system to ensure accurate, reliable and timely data collection; c. Adequacy of the proposed technical approach to randomize subjects and monitor recruitment in a timely fashion; d. Adequacy of the proposed technical approach to implement quality control procedures on accuracy of ultrasound image reading; e. Adequacy of proposed strategies for successfully completing various tasks with multiple research sites and ensuring their timely completion.  2) STAFFING PLAN / EXPERIENCE AND QUALIFICATIONS OF PROPOSED PERSONNEL:     The adequacy, feasibility, and cost-effectiveness of the proposed Staffing Plan for the conduct of the project, including:  a. Adequacy of the Principal Investigators knowledge in pregnancy and evidence of peer reviewed publications involving reproduction and prospective clinical/epidemiological investigations.  b. Adequacy of demonstrated evidence of prior PI experience directing multi-site clinical/epidemiologic investigations.  c.  Adequacy of demonstrated experience by the PI and key staff in a contemporary web-based data management and specimen tracking system and excellent writing and communication skills with multiple sites.  d. Efficiency and cost-effectiveness of the proposed Staffing Plan.  3)  EXPERIENCE AND QUALIFICATIONS OF THE ORGANIZATION:  a.  Demonstrated capability, facilities and equipment to compile, store and transmit the information necessary for the web-based database, including the large, digital sonographic images;  b.  Demonstrated capability to resolve unforeseen difficulties in randomization, data entry  and data transfer;  c.  Adequacy of the proposed real-time, web-based data management and biospecimen tracking system.   Past Performance of the contractor on the same or similar projects will be evaluated as well.   A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. The capability statement will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Overnight deliveries should be mailed to the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, Contracts Management Branch, 6100 Executive Boulevard, MSC 7510 Bethesda, Maryland 20852.

<SUBJECT>A -- Verbal Autopsies
<DESC>In accordance with and FAR 6.302(a)(2), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) intends to issue a sole-source, cost-reimbursable contract to The London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM).  The purpose of this contract is to develop a refined algorithm. The product of this contract will be an algorithm to detect the validity of verbal autopsies which will be delivered to CDC within 30 days of project completion.  Verbal Autopsy (VA) questionnaires will be reviewed using expert algorithms. The expert algorithms will be finalized at the end of the evaluative activity, and will be based on exiting algorithms reported in the literature. The physicians involved in the review of the VQ questionnaires and medical records will contribute to the refinement of the algorithms using their clinical experience, and the additional experience gained during evaluative activity participation. During the review of medical records and VA questionnaires, physicians will be asked to transcribe the diagnostic criteria used to attribute malaria and other major illnesses as a cause of death, and this information will be used to refine existing algorithms. Causes of death will be classified as underlying, immediate, and associated causes, according to ICD-10 guidelines. As above, VA questionnaires will be re-interpreted using the expert algorithm approximately one month after the initial review, and similar procedures will be followed to determine cause of death.  This will allow the precision of expert algorithm for ascertaining cause of death to be assessed, and compared to that of physician review.   Therefore, the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) is the only organization that can provide the Verbal Autopsy data in Uganda and meet all of the program requirements including cost and time constraints.  The LSHTM is the only institution with the combination of specific expertise and experience that meets the specific requirements for this award. The LSHTM is uniquely qualified for this award based on the following experience and capabilities: 
  1.  LSHTM has the support of and a working relationship with the Uganda Malaria and Surveillance Project (UMSP) and The University of California at San Francisco (UCSF).LSHTM/ UCSF scientists have conducted and published numerous scientific papers on malaria indicating the scientific soundness of research conducted by the institution. LSHTM's expertise in clinical epidemiology is highlighted by its role longstanding work in Uganda.
  2.  LSHTM currently employs the principal investigator who wrote the protocol, and the epidemiologist who has set the standard for verbal autopsy validation studies. 
  3.  LSHTM scientists have numerous publications in peer-reviewed journals.
  4.  LSHTM is the only organization poised to collect the information within the time line of the President's Malaria Initiative for use of applicable funds.

Interested parties who feel that they possess the capabilities to provide the services described above should submit a capability statement demonstrating their abilities to provide the services.  The information received in response to this notice will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct a competitive procurement.  Please send your documentation to Sharon Cunningham at the office identified above, by fax (770) 488-2688 or email to cux0@cdc.gov.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for a commercial service prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will NOT be issued.  This is a Request For Quote (RFQ) and the solicitation number is F2VVJ67135A200. The 6th Contracting Squadron, MacDill AFB, Florida, requires the following items: Google Search Appliance ? 500,000 documents, includes hardware, software and 2 years ?disconnected? support, plus software updates. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-16 effective 22 March 2007, DFAR DCN 20070426, and AFFAR AFAC 20070314. Fed Biz Ops Numbered Notes per FAR Part 5.207-13(e) Apply: 1. The North American Industry Classification System code (NAICS) is 423430, Computer and Computer Peripheral Equipment and Software Merchant Wholesalers. The Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) is 5045, Computers Merchant Wholesalers. This requirement is being solicited as a 100% small business set aside. A firm fixed price contract will be awarded. All interested parties must bid on all items.
DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENT:  

1.	Part # GB-1001-500K-DIS - 500,000 documents, includes hardware, software and 2 years ?disconnected? support, plus software updates 

This requirement is a Brand Name. See Justification below:
United States Central Command (USCENTCOM) J6, requires the continual services and support provided by the Google Search Appliance.  The Google Search Appliance is compatible and authorized for use with systems operating on the Secret Internet Protocol Router (SIPR) Network.  The Google Search Appliance is the only search engine that meets or exceeds all standards required for USCENTCOM.  The Google Search Appliance allows USCENTCOM users to efficiently manage and search more than 500,000 documents within a single network using a single search engine.  USCENTCOM personnel are trained and familiar with the Google Search Appliance.  To pursue another option would cost many man hours in training and implementation which could be avoided by purchasing the maintenance renewal for the Google Search Appliance.  It is not reasonable nor is it cost effective to purchase another brand when it too would require maintenance renewal.

Award will be made to the quotation which offers the best value to the government. Multiple awards may be accomplished if any items are determined to be unbalanced. The Government also reserves the right to make no award at all.

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-A) U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters 1900 Half St. SW, Room 11-0402 Washington, DC 20593 Telephone: (202) 372-3692 Fax: (202) 475-3904

Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman:  solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

    (a) Prohibitions. 
    Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause or with any subsidiary of such an entity. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
    (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
    Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears. 
    Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
    Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- 
    (1)  The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
    (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity 
is held- 
    (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
    (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
    (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
    Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
    (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
    (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
    (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign 
incorporated entity; or 
    (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 
    (2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
    (3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purpose of this section.
    (d) Special rule for related partnerships.  For purposes of applying section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 
    (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
    (1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
    (i) Warrants; 
    (ii) Options; 
    (iii) Contracts to acquire stock; 
    (iv) Convertible debt instruments; 
    (v) Others similar interests. 
    (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of section 835.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

The Program Support (PS) Division provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA's Washington and field offices.  The Disaster Response and Mitigation (DRM) Division is responsible for coordinating with other organizations for the provision of relief supplies and humanitarian assistance.  DRM also devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human caused disaster situations. DRM hires sector specialists to provide technical expertise in assessing the quality of disaster response.  The Operations (OPS) Division develops and manages logistical, operational, and technical support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations.  OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue (SAR) Teams, Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs).

The Resources Team is part of the Program Support Division of the Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance.  The core functions of the Resources Team are management of contracts for program-funded personnel, procurement, procurement planning, budgeting, and policy guidance.  The Program Operations Specialist (POS) works closely with the Resources Team Leader to carry out these functions.

<DESC>This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; offers are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This notice is being issued as a Request for Quotations (RFQ) for Battery Cells for NASA Constellation Missions per the following Specification: NASA/GRC has a requirement for Lithium-based (Li-based) aerospace battery cells for evaluation for a common battery module concept for Constellation missions. The objective of this effort is to evaluate the general performance of new generation Li-based cells, to determine the ability of new generation Li-based cells to meet preliminary mission requirements, to identify promising new generation Li-based cell technologies that can enhance or enable missions, and to identify gaps that exist in the ability of current Li-based cell technologies to meet future mission requirements. Results from these evaluations will feed into the design of a common battery module. The common battery module will be applicable across multiple Constellation missions and platforms, which may include, but are not limited to the following: o	Orion Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV) o	Ares Crew Launch Vehicle (CLV) o	Extravehicular Activities (EVA) (spacesuit and astronaut tools) o	Lunar Surface Ascent Module (LSAM) o	Lunar Precursor and Robotic Program (LPRP) o	Rovers o	Landers New generation technologies that incorporate research enhancements that advance the capabilities of state-of-the-art Li-based cell performance to meet the requirements are highly sought. Proposed cell designs that maximize specific energy and energy density while addressing one or more of the following additional features are desirable: o	High specific energy and energy density o	Long calendar life (up to five years)  o	Wide operating temperature range and operation at high or low temperature extremes (-60 to +60 degrees Celsius) o	Fast recharge times (high charge rates – 4C rate) o	High discharge rates (up to 8C) combined with low self discharge rates o	Low-Earth-Orbit cycle life greater than 3500 cycles at 50% DOD  o	Less than 7% irreversible capacity loss after 3 years of storage at room temperature or below Cells of capacities ranging from 40 to 60 ampere-hour (Ah) capacity are sought. Multiple awards will be made. Vendors may propose more than one cell design. Vendors shall identify the specific requirements that the proposed cell addresses.  Cells shall originate from the same manufacturing lot. Cell delivery is desired within nine months After Receipt of Order. Early delivery is a best value criterion. The proposed cell design shall be available for a period of at least three years after delivery of the cells so future builds of the same cell can be made if the government desires to make additional purchases.  Future availability of the cell is a best value criterion. A varying number of cells will be procured.  Vendors shall provide separate quotes for cells in the following quantities: 6 cells, 9 cells, 12 cells, 15 cells and 18 cells. A minimum of six cells of any one design will be purchased. Vendors shall specify the following:  1.	Nameplate capacity of cell 2.	Voltage operating ranges at an operating temperature of 20 to 23 degrees Celsius 3.	Average voltage of cell at C/2 and 20 to 23 degrees Celsius 4.	Mass of cell 5.	Volume of cell 6.	Ampere-hours delivered by cell at C/2, C, 2C, 5C, and 10C discharge rates to 100% depth-of-discharge at 20 to 23 degrees Celsius (shall be specified for all of the above rates the cell is capable of achieving) 7.	Separate quotes for cells in the quantities given above 8.	Delivery timeframe of cells (if it varies by the quantity of cells, specify all timeframes) Data Package At a minimum, documentation that accompanies cells upon delivery shall include: o	Disclosure of cell makeup including separator type, electrolyte composition, electrode composition o	Date of manufacture (fill date) o	Individual cell dimensions and masses o	Individual cell formation data for irreversible capacity loss o	Individual cell capacity and energy data for the first three cycles at 20 degrees C o	Recommended operating conditions and temperatures  o	Recommended charging procedures (voltage limits, temperatures, regimes) o	Maximum charge current o	Recommended storage conditions and temperatures o	Cell case polarity o	Restraining procedures (if cells must be restrained during operation) The provisions and clauses in the RFQ are those in effect through FAC 05-14.

<DESC>At the request of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Office of Managing Director (OMD), and to ensure wide exposure of the Universal Service Administrative Company's (USAC) solicitations, the FCC is alerting the public that USAC has posted on its web site, a copy of the Request For Proposals (RFP) for its 2007 Annual Financial and Agreed Upon Procedures (AUP) Audit.  The RFP is available electronically at http://www.usac.org/about/tools/procurement.  This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation.  Proposals are being requested and a separate written solicitation will not be issued.  No additional notification will be issued by the FCC.  ALL COMMUNICATIONS IN REFERENCE TO THESE OPPORTUNITIES SHALL BE THROUGH USAC'S Contracting Office.  The RFP describes the services requested and provides instructions on how to respond. --- BACKGROUND: USAC is a not-for-profit Delaware corporation. The FCC has appointed USAC as the permanent administrator of the Universal Service Fund (USF) and the universal service support mechanisms (Support Mechanisms):  High Cost, Low Income, Rural Health Care and Schools & Libraries as set forth in Title 47, Part 54, Section 701 of the Code of Federal Regulations.  As part of its administrative function, USAC performs, subject to FCC oversight, the billing, collection, and disbursement functions associated with the USF and the Support Mechanisms.  Additional information concerning USAC and its administration of the USF and Support Mechanisms can be obtained from USAC's website located at:  www.usac.org.

Title 47, Section 54.717 of the Code of Federal Regulations provides that USAC shall obtain and pay for an annual audit conducted by an independent auditor to examine its operations and books of account to determine, among other things, whether USAC is properly administering the USF and Support Mechanisms to prevent waste, fraud, and abuse.    

The purpose of this RFP is to invite the submission of offers from independent accounting firms to perform the annual audit of USAC's operations and books of account for the period beginning January 1, 2007 through December 31, 2007 and for each of the three following calendar years (2008, 2009, and 2010).  USAC intends to award a contract that has a base period of one year for performance of the 2007 annual audit and three one-year option periods, to be exercised at USAC's discretion, for performance of the 2008, 2009, and 2010 annual audits.  The annual audit shall include:  (i) an audit of the financial statements of USAC, (ii) an AUP review of USAC's operations for compliance with FCC rules and orders, and (iii) during each of the three available option years, an attest engagement to issue an examination report on the effectiveness of USAC's internal control over financial reporting for the USF.  The AUP review shall encompass each of the Support Mechanisms as well as procedures to review the billing, collection, anti-fraud measures, corporate governance, continuity of operations, program administration expenses, and fund disbursement functions.  The annual financial audit, the AUP review of operations, and the audit of internal control over financial reporting for the USF (during potential option years) shall be performed in accordance Generally Accepted Government Auditing Standards (GAGAS) and with Generally Accepted Auditing Standards (GAAS) established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA).  

All proposals submitted in compliance with the instructions and requirements of the RFP will be evaluated.  USAC expects to award a contract to the selected independent public accounting firm (Contractor) no later than August 2007 to perform the functions identified in the RFP. 

THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT BY A FEDERAL AGENCY, GOVERNMENT CORPORATION, GOVERNMENT CONTROLLED CORPORATION OR OTHER ESTABLISHMENT IN THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH OF THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT.  THE CONTRACT AWARDED AS A RESULT OF THIS RFP WILL NOT BE A SUBCONTRACT UNDER A FEDERAL PRIME CONTRACT TO USAC.  Complete proposals must be submitted to Mr. Jay Beard, USAC Purchasing Manager, USAC Contracting Office, no later than the date and time set forth in the RFP.  Proposals must be submitted by mail, courier or hand delivered to: Universal Service Administrative Company  Attn: Mr. Jay Beard, 2000 L Street, NW, Suite 200. Washington, DC 20036.  Please submit an original signed by a duly authorized representative, four additional complete paper copies, and an electronic copy of the proposal in Microsoft Word format on magnetic disk or CD-ROM.

No classified material shall be generated, transmitted, or stored as part of this tasking; All documentation will be delivered to the Electronic Proving Ground.  Net Centric Metrics:  Focus areas for the study should include an assessment of Service Oriented Architectures and what is required to test them.  Does the move  to SOAs reduce the importance of traditional metric such as message completion rates?  If so, what are the new measures that best describe performance within a SOA environment?  Do we already collect the data elements that can be used in building the data  products that permit assessment of performance in a SOA environment or is there a new set of data elements to collect to answer SOA performance?  Another focus area should address the impact of mobile ad hoc networking upon overall network performance and  its impact upon battle command capabilities such as consistency in maintaining a common operating environment picture within the tactical network and the network management picture across the entire battle space.  Are there metrics to collect - metrics th at inform on the time it takes for an entity or slice of the network to be restored into the COE?  What impact do rapid changes to the network have on quality of service, and how well does management of quality of service management keep up with rapid on t he move re-configurations of the network? How do we test network management system performance within a network that integrates several NMSs in a common network environment? How do we test the self healing attribute of networks?  From an operational pers pective, it may be enough to know that a message was completed regardless of path taken.  From a technical test perspective where identification of causality is to be addressed, we may need to understand more about the path taken and ensure that the condit ions of the network was consistent with movement of data over one path as opposed to another. This is not an all-inclusive list of topics but represent the breath of scope of issues that could be addressed. FOB DESTINATION:  Fort Huachuca, Arizona.

SUBJECT:  Solicitation for U.S. Personal Service Contractor for a Program Operations Specialist - Resources Team in Washington, DC.

Ladies/Gentlemen:

The United States Government, represented by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), is seeking applications (Optional Form 612 only) from qualified U.S. citizens to provide personal services as a Program Operations Specialist - Resources Team under a personal services contract, as described in the solicitation.

The pupose of this Amendment is to provide the attachments referenced in the main solicitation.

ATTACHMENT 1

ACQUISITION & ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10
PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY

General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY
(OCTOBER 2006) 

(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16
FAM 116 available at http://www.foia.state.gov/REGS/fams.asp?level=2&id=59&fam=0 .

Note:  personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.

(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."

(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).

(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:

(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;

(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and

(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.

(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.

(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.

(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.

(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.

(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).

ATTACHMENT 2

ACQUISITION & ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-12
HOMELAND SECURITY PRESIDENTIAL DIRECTIVE-12 (HSPD-12) IMPLEMENTATION

FAR Clause 52.204-9	Personal Identity Verification of Contractor Personnel.

As prescribed in 4.1301, insert the following clause: 
Personal Identity Verification of Contractor Personnel (Nov. 2006) 
(a) The Contractor shall comply with agency personal identity verification procedures identified in the contract that implement Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12), Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance M-05-24, as amended, and Federal Information Processing Standards Publication (FIPS PUB) Number 201, as amended.
(b) The Contractor shall insert this clause in all subcontracts when the subcontractor is required to have routine physical access to a Federally-controlled facility and/or routine access to a Federally-controlled information system. 
(End of clause)

Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12) (September 2006)

In response to the general threat of unauthorized access to federal facilities and information systems, the President issued Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12).  HSPD-12 requires all Federal agencies to use a common Personal Identity Verification (PIV) standard when identifying and issuing access rights to users of Federally-controlled facilities and/or Federal Information Systems.  USAID will begin issuing HSPS-12 "smart card" IDs to applicable contracts, using a phased approach.  Effective October 27, 2006, USAID will begin issuing new "smart card" IDs to new contractors (and new contractor employees) requiring routine access to USAID controlled facilities and/or access to USAID's information systems.  USAID will begin issuance of the new smart card IDs to existing contractors (and existing contractor employees) on October 27, 2007.  (Exceptions would include those situations where an existing contractor (or contractor employee) loses or damages his/her existing ID and would need a replacement ID prior to October 27, 2007.  In those situations, the existing contractor (or contractor employee) would need to follow the PIV processes described below, and be issued one of the new smart cards.)

Accordingly, before a contractor (including a PSC* or a contractor employee) may obtain a USAID ID (new or replacement) authorizing him/her routine access to USAID facilities, or logical access to USAID's information systems, the individual must provide two forms of identity source documents in original form and a passport size photo.  One identity source document must be a valid Federal or state government-issued picture ID. (Overseas foreign nationals must comply with the requirements of the Regional Security Office.)  USAID/W contractors must contact the USAID Security Office to obtain the list of acceptable forms of documentation, and contractors working in overseas Missions must obtain the acceptable documentation list from the Regional Security Officer.  Submission of these documents, and related background checks, are mandatory in order for the contractor to receive a building access ID, and before access will be granted to any of USAID's information systems.  All contractors must physically present these two source documents for identity proofing at their USAID/W or Mission Security Briefing.  The contractor or his/her Facility Security Officer must return any issued building access ID and remote authentication token to USAID custody upon termination of the individual's employment with the contractor or completion of the contract, whichever occurs first.

The contractor must comply with all applicable HSPD-12 and PIV procedures as described above, and any subsequent USAID or government-wide HSPS-12 and PIV procedures/policies, including any subsequent related USAID General Notices, Office of Security Directives and/or Automated Directives System (ADS) policy directives and required procedures.  This includes HSPD-12 procedures established in USAID/W and those procedures established by the overseas Regional Security Office.

In the event of inconsistencies between this clause and the later issued Agency or government-wide HSPD-12 guidance, the most recent issued guidance should take precedence, unless otherwise instructed by the Contracting Officer.

The contractor is required to include this clause in any subcontracts that require the subcontractor or subcontractor employee to have routine physical access to USAID space or logical access to USAID's information systems.

The purpose of this Amendment is to answer the questions stated below. All questions must be submitted to the Contracting Officer via email at donita.hood@nara.gov not later than COB Thursday, June 21, 2007.

QUESTION:  Page 40 of the RFP under section 2.3 states: "Oversize
documents....up to at least 49" x 29" at Archives I and 40" x 24" at Archives II"- does this mean a 35mm Microfilm camera is required at each location?

Oversized copies refer to copies of oversized paper documents; this is not related to microfilm. 

QUESTION: Does NARA require any documents to be filmed on 16mm microfilm cameras? If so-will the vendor be responsible for providing a single or multiple 16 mm cameras?

ANSWER:

NARA has a several 16mm cameras onsite at AI; however, currently, the requests for 16mm file reproduction is zero. 

QUESTION: Please list the make and model number of the current 35mm microfilm camera being used.

ANSWER: Omina OK300E Microfilm Camera 

QUESTION: Please provide annual estimates for the following:

ANSWER:
*Number of 16mm microfilm rolls that require processing - zero 
*Number of 35mm microfilm rolls that require processing - 90,000 images (this fluctuates) - 95 rolls 
*Number of 16mm and 35mm microfilm rolls that require duplication - cannot provide at the moment 

*Silver of Diazo dupes
*How many duplicates per roll

The main focus of this contract will be paper to paper copies. Microfilm is definitely secondary to paper to paper.

NARA will provide the media for which the images will be burned.
