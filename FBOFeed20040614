<DESC>The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), Plant Protection and Quarantine (PPQ), in conjunction with New Jersey officials, requires a firm fixed-price, requirements contract for the application of a systemic insecticide (Imidacloprid) for control of the Asian longhorned beetle (ALB), Anoplphora glabripennis (Motschulsky) in the Jersey City and Hoboken areas of the State of New Jersey.  This spring, APHIS anticipates treating an estimated 955 trees with an estimated total diameter at breast height (dbh) of 6,224 via soil injection and an estimated 102 trees with an estimated total potential for damage from this major pest of trees.  ALB bores into and kills a variety of tree species including, but not limited to, species of Elm, Maple, Birch, Willow, Box Elder, Horsechestnut, Buckeye, Rose of Sharon (dbh equal or greater than 4 inches), European Mountain Ash, Ash, Poplar, Albizza, London Plane, and Sycamore.  This nonnative pest has the potential to spread to other areas of the United States and cause extensive losses to ornamental and commercial tree species.  As a consequence, the Secretary of Agriculture declared an emergency for the eradication of ALB in the areas identified.  Control treatments must be completed prior to adult emergence and flight which begins in late spring and early summer.  Therefore, all projected control treatments must be applied by mid August of 2004.  A requirements contract will be awarded in the event additional control applications are needed or PPQ decides to apply control treatments in the fall of 2004.  The effective period of the contract is anticipated from mid March 2004, through September 30, 2004, with unilateral four options to extend the effective period.  This solicitation is issued on an unrestricted basis, however, award preference will be provided to companies qualified under the Small Business Administration HUB Zone and Section 8(a) programs and other small and small disadvantaged businesses.  NAIC Code:  115310, Size Standard:  $5.0 million dollar average receipts.  This agency does not issue hard copies of the solicitation; you must download a copy from this website. The solicitation is expected to be issued on or about the first week in February 2004, with proposals due to the Contracting Officer three weeks thereafter.

<RESPDATE>041504
<CONTACT>Joe Guerci, DARPA Program Manager, Phone 000-000-0000, Fax 703-516-7360, Email none
<DESC>BAA03-14; This BAA is open and effective until 15 April 2004; POC: Dr. Joseph Guerci, DARPA/SPO Deputy Director, is the overall technical POC for this BAA, e-mail: JGuerci@DARPA.MIL.  Contact information for the SPO Program Managers (PMs) under each technical area is specified in Attachment 1.  Bidders are strongly encouraged to contact the relevant PMs directly before submitting a response to this BAA. PROGRAM OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION: The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency/Special Projects Office (DARPA/SPO) researches, develops, demonstrates and transitions technologies focused on addressing present and emerging national challenges.  SPO investments range from the development of enabling technologies to the demonstration of large prototype systems.  SPO is developing technologies to counter the emerging threat of underground facilities, used for purposes ranging from command-and-control, to weapons storage and staging, to the manufacture of weapons of mass destruction.  SPO is investing in novel space technologies across the spectrum of space control applications including rapid access, space situational awareness, counterspace, and persistent tactical grade sensing approaches including extremely large space apertures and structures.  Investments are being made in technologies to provide full-scale protection systems against the threat of chemical and biological attack.  SPO is also developing significantly more effective ways to counter non-RF air defenses as well as proliferated, inexpensive cruise missiles, UAV’s and other platforms used for weapon delivery, jamming, and surveillance.  SPO is initating efforts to defend against radiological weapons (so called “dirty bombs”) and is interested in concepts to defeat suicide bombers and to deal with urban threats.  In all of these areas, SPO efforts encompass the full range of activities required to develop complete prototype systems, from hardware development and characterization to algorithms, exploitation techniques, and full-scale system experimentation.  To support this range of efforts, SPO is also home to DARPA’s expertise in the areas of advanced sensor systems and guidance and navigation technologies.  Proposed efforts may address the development of prototype components, or systems; studies and modeling of existing or proposed systems; and data collections that will overcome deficiencies in existing data.  Attachment 1 provides additional information and POCs for these areas of interest; bidders are encouraged to contact these POCs before submitting a response to this BAA.  This information is provided to focus interest on innovative concepts that contribute to ongoing SPO investments, but is not meant to preclude white papers on other research efforts.  PROGRAM SCOPE: Principal funding of this BAA and the anticipated award of contracts will start in FY 03 and may occur at any time through the closing date as funds are available.  White papers and proposals determined to not be of interest under this BAA will not be considered if resubmitted unless significant changes in the approach or new technical information becomes available.  Individual awards will not normally exceed 12 months or $1M, although exceptions are possible; in addition, follow-on work may result in further funding for an extended period of performance.  Awards of efforts as a result of this BAA will be in the form of contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or other transactions depending upon the nature of the work proposed.  GENERAL INFORMATION: SPO is accepting white papers in response to this BAA.  The purpose of the white paper is to preclude unwarranted effort on the part of an offerer whose proposed work is not of interest under this BAA. To further reduce burden, it is suggested that the offerer directly contact the cognizant PM by email (preferably) or telephone to quickly assess suitability under this BAA. For those submitting white papers, a SPO Program Manager most closely related to the submitted topic will review white papers and provide a written response to the offerer within 30 days.  Those offerers whose white papers are found to be of interest and consistent with the intent of this BAA will be encouraged to submit a technical and cost proposal.  Such encouragement does not assure that the submitting organization will receive a subsequent award.   Those offerers whose white papers are not found to be of interest to the cognizant Program Manager will be provided feedback regarding why their proposal is not of interest.  This does not preclude the offerer from still submitting a full proposal.  All awards will be subject to availability of government funds.  Awards will be made to those offerers whose proposals are considered most advantageous to the government.  The government reserves the right to select for award any, all, part or none of the proposals received in response to this announcement.  No portion of the BAA will be set aside for Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) or minority institutions (MI) participation due to the impracticality of reserving discrete severable areas of research for exclusive competition among the entries.  DARPA/SPO will accept classified responses to this BAA when the classification is mandated by classification guidance provided by an Original Classification Authority of the U.S. Government, or when the bidder believes the work, if successful, would merit classification.  Security classification guidance in the form of a DD Form 254 (DoD Contract Security Classification Specification) will not be provided at this time since DARPA is soliciting ideas only.  After reviewing incoming proposals, if a determination is made that contract award may result in access to classified information, a DD Form 254 will be issued upon contract award.  If you chose to submit a classified proposal you must first receive the permission of the Original Classification Authority to use their information in replying to this BAA. The point of contact for classified responses is Mr. Frank Purdy, DARPA/SPO, and he can be reached at 703-812-1992.  Bidders who are unsure about the appropriate classification of their proposal should contact this POC before submitting a response.  Those offerers submitting white papers are required to submit five (5) copies of a three (3) to four (4) page white paper with a cover letter indicating whether the offerer is a large, small, woman-owned, small business, Historically Black College or University, or Minority Institution.  The white paper should follow the same general format as described for Volume I under PROPOSAL FORMAT but include only Section I and II A and D.  Section I: Administrative, including Cost Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM). Section II: Summary of Proposal: A. Innovative claims for the proposed research; B. Technical rationale, technical approach and constructive plan.  Each cost proposal shall contain a section addressing the following: Awards made under this initiative are subject to the provisions of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 9.5, Organizational Conflict of Interest.  All offerers and proposed subcontractors must affirmatively state whether they are supporting any DARPA technical office(s) through an active contract or subcontract.  All affirmations must state which office(s) the offerer supports and identify the prime contract number.  Affirmations shall be furnished at the time of proposal submission.  All facts relevant to the existence or potential existence of organizational conflicts of interest, as that term is defined in FAR 9.501, must be disclosed.  This disclosure shall include a description of the action the Contractor has taken, or proposes to take, to avoid, neutralize or mitigate such conflict.  If the offerer believes that no such conflict exists, then it shall so state in this section.  Only those offerers whose proposal is expected to result in contract award will be required to submit a completed and signed copy of “Representations, Certifications, and other Statements by Offerers or Respondents”.  This document is not required for the submission of a proposal unless specifically requested. Offerers are notified that this document is frequently updated and any offerer selected for award may be requested to submit an updated “Representations, Certifications, and Other Statements by Offerers or Respondents.” White Paper format and complete instructions for proposal preparation can be found at Attachment 2.  EVALUATION CRITERIA: Proposals submitted may be evaluated as they are received.  Individual proposal evaluations will be based on acceptability or non-acceptability without regard to other proposals submitted under the announcement.  Evaluation of proposals will be performed using the following criteria: a) Overall Scientific and Technical Merit;  b) Potential Contribution and Relevance to DARPA/SPO Mission; c) Plans and Capability to Accomplish Technology Transition; d) Offerer’s Capabilities and Related Experience; e) Cost Realism. The criteria used to evaluate proposals will also be used to determine whether white papers submitted are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government.  Only (a) and (b) above will apply to white papers.  SUBMISSION INFORMATION:
The administrative addresses for this BAA are: Fax:  (703) 516-7360 (Addressed to: DARPA/SPO, BAA 03-14), Electronic Mail:  BAA02-10@darpa.mil, Mail: DARPA/SPO, ATTN: BAA 03-14, 3701 North Fairfax Drive, Arlington, VA 22203-1714.

Offerers are requested to provide their Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) number with their submission as well as a fax number and an e-mail address. The cost of preparing proposals in response to this announcement is not considered an allowable direct charge to any resulting contract or any other contract.  Offerers are warned that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.

<DESC>Project calls for the replacement of built-up roofing, rigid insulation, gutters and downspouts, and gravel guards/fascia at approximately 20,700 square foot, single story component repair shop, Building 8130, at Dyess AFB, Texas. The facility was originally built in the early 1960’s with three additions constructed since then. The configuration of the existing roof is a combination of roof sections of various slopes. Roof sections abut awkwardly at some locations; particular attention shall be paid to flashing and counter-flashing at these locations. A special area of concern is where an addition with a varying wall height adjoins the original structure, resulting in a water trap.  This requires the construction of a cricket using tapered insulation. Abandoned penetrations and rooftop equipment shall be removed and the resulting openings patched. Interior equipment formerly served by the abandoned rooftop equipment, but now not in use, shall also be removed and resulting voids in the interior finishes shall be patched and repair. The roof has a number of penetrations requiring special attention. Higher curbs shall be provided for solar tracking skylights mounted on the roof.  Removal and reinstallation of the skylights will involve electrical work. New boots shall be installed at the existing stack vents. One roof hatch shall be removed and reinstalled. Another roof hatch shall be removed; its ladder shall also be removed and the holes in the interior finishes shall be patched. New sheet metal items, such as gutters and downspouts, gravel guards, and fascia, shall be painted. Existing rooftop equipment to remain shall be repainted. The debris and scrap generated under this contract shall be removed and disposed of off-base at an approved facility and in accordance with federal, state, and local regulations. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this project is 238390 with a size standard of $12,000,000.00. This project will be competitive HUBZONE Set-aside.

The C-37A pilot courses must be presented at a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 142 certified training center for the Gulfstream V aircraft at time of training.  All contractor C-37A pilot instructors shall be certified under the 14 CFR Part 142 Training Center certification.  For all courses, the contractor shall provide:  all the necessary facilities, certified instructors, management personnel, scheduling/administrative personnel; materials; rights for use of materials for this contracted training, training devices, simulators; and courseware/materials needed for each course.

The course shall minimally consist of classroom training, corporate class cabin trainer (similar to Gulfstream V) training, and in-pool water survival training that addresses equipment like that used in the C-37 (Gulfstream V).

Serving etiquette/protocol/menu training is required.  

Courses are stand-alone in that no contractor, pre-arrival training requirements of the trainee will be allowed.

The contractor will be required to submit training syllabus for each course for government approval.  C-37A training will not result in a FAA check flight or certification.

<DESC>The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) in a negotiated procurement for microfilm/microfiche duplication services for NARA. The proposed requirement provides for the acquisition of all management, facilities, supervision, personnel, shipping, supplies, and equipment necessary to duplicate requested microfilm and microfiche. NARA is the repository for the permanently valuable records of the Federal Government.  Under the authority of 44 U.S.C. 2307, the National Archives Trust Fund Board conducts the NARA microfilm publication program that provides the general public with access to records of high interest through the sale of microfilm copies of archival records.

This contract proposes to replace the current contract so that more of NARA’s microfilm and microfiche products can be reproduced by a contractor on an “as needed” basis.  Such a contract will allow NARA to concentrate its microfilm services on the preservation of permanent records. The contract awarded as a result of this RFP will be a Firm-Fixed Price contract with Department of Labor wage determinations incorporated. The term of the contract will be for a base period of twelve (12) months with four (4) 12-month option periods. All responsible sources may submit a proposal that will be considered by NARA. Copies of the RFP, which will be available on or about June 25, 2004, may be obtained through the Federal Business Opportunities web site at www.fedbizopps.gov.

<DESC>The following is an INTENT TO SOLE SOURCE ANNOUNCEMENT. It constitutes the only written announcement. Under the authority of FAR Part 6.302-1, the Government intends to negotiate on a sole source basis and award a contract using FAR Part 15 Negotiated Procurement Procedures to one source without full and open competition. As justified below, there are no other vendors who can provide the required expertise or have the knowledge base regarding this customized software program to satisfy agency requirements within the required time frame for completion of the work. This requirement is not a recurring one, but is only for completion of an existing project. The contract period of performance shall be for four months.  The contract will also include one 2-month option period that may be exercised if efforts are not completed during the base period.  If additional work is necessary in support of this program beyond December 31, 2004, then it shall be conducted as a new requirement under the ITS-ESE EPA Contract. Transitional efforts will occur during the two-month option period.. SAIC has been the sole contractor performing maintenance of ICMS under Contract No. 68-W1-0055, Delivery Order 72, and under Contract No. 68-W-99-002, Task Order 23.  The current SAIC assigned personnel have a thorough and in-depth understanding, as well as a historical knowledge, of ICMS and its support systems: Clause Administration, User Maintenance, Utility Update, EPAYS conversion, Reference Tables, and Vendor Maintenance. ICMS is a complex relational database application that is comprised of over 100 tables, multiple views that allow users to enter data to populate those tables, a document management system that allows for retrieval of all electronic documents compiled or associated with an ICMS action, and a word processor to create and print the hard-copy documents for Contracting Officer signature and distribution. SAIC employees have been involved in the preliminary planning and development for future mandated upgrades that are quickly forthcoming as a result of the President's Management Agenda, Integrated Acquisition Environment goals mandated by OMB, and other Agency initiatives.  SAIC employees have unique capabilities associated with understanding the different characteristics and nuances of ICMS. Historically, newly-assigned but experienced SAIC developers have taken several months to learn the functionality, programming, and structure of ICMS.  The expense of training and bringing a new contractor up to speed would be cost prohibitive due to imminent system replacement. Furthermore, the introduction of a new contractor would severely impact  this progress due to the possibility of the new contractor either not understanding the prior progress and planning, thus, negating any prior progress made and potentially backtracking before any new progress is made. THE GOVERNMENT KNOWS OF ONLY ONE SOURCE, SCIENCE APPLICATIONS INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION, 1213 JEFFERSON DAVIS HWY, ARLINGTON VA 22202, CAPABLE OF FULFILLING THE REQUIREMENT.  The NAICS Code is 541519 with a Small Business Size Standard $21 M.  Direct all questions or inquiries or references by telephone (202) 564-0366 or E-mail (Hammond.Barbara@epa.gov) by June 29th, 2004.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 334516   The US Environmental Protection Agency, under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures of FAR Part 13, ERTC-West located in Las Vegas NV is seeking to acquire a handheld, portable Environmental Metals analyzer to identify and quantify chemical compounds at sites where hazardous substances have been released.  Given the intended use of the analyzer in conducting site assessments, the instrument must be light enough for one person to carry while wearing protective equipment conducting on-site XRF analysis.   Due to the intended use of the analyzer, it must also  have the ability to add user-generated calibration coefficients and to apply this calibration data to future testing or recalculate stored results as well as the ability to calibrate to matrices other than soil.  The analyzer must allow the user to add elements to the analyte list and to generate  additional calibration curves using the Compton Normalization Method.  This analyzer will be used in the field, so the analyzer must also have the flexibility to add analytes in the field as needed.  The analyzer shall have the ability to meet the following detection limits. These detection limits  are for a soil matrix at the 99.7% confidence level with a 120 second count time. Phosphorus 2.5% mg/kg soil; Sulfur 2.5%; Chlorine 2.5%; Potassium 1500; Calcium 1000; Titanium 400; Chromium 100; Iron 200; Nickel 100; Copper 50; Zinc 50; Arsenic 20; Selenium 20; Silver 50; Cadmium 50; Mercury 15;  Thallium 50; Lead 20; Barium 2000 parts per million.  Due to the nature of the site assessments ERT-LV conducts, the instrument must have the ability to detect these contaminants at either regulatory or risk-based levels.  Finally, an airline approved shipping case is required to be provided with  the system.   This acquisition is designated as a small business set aside under NAICS code 334516. The acquisition will be processed under FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures. It is anticipated that a Request For Quotation (RFQ) will be issued on or about June 21, 2004. To receive a  copy of the RFQ, interested firms must submit a written request to Mr. David Plagge  (plagge.david@epa.gov). Requests submitted via email are preferred or a fax is acceptable. The fax number is 513-487-2107. Requests must include company name, mailing address, fax number, and email address. See  Numbered Note 1 and 26. For answers to any questions regarding this RFQ, contact Mr. David Plagge at 513-487-2022 or plagge.david@epa.gov.

<DESC>Negotiations are being conducted on a sole source basis with Healthetech, Inc. for 12000 MedGem snorkel mouthpieces, part number 400-0002-02 and for 5000 nose clips, part number 402-0009-03.

BACKGROUND INFORMATION AND CAPABILITIES REQUIREMENT:  The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) is conducting the Work and Health Study, a 5-year cohort of 20,000 workers aged 45 to 60 in major US companies, looking at the relation between specific job stressors and heart disease and depression.  As part of the baseline evaluation (the work up at the start of the study), a subset of the study participants will have their resting metabolic rate (RMR) measured.  This measurement along with blood pressure, body mass index and serum total and HDL cholesterol will form part of the baseline risk calculation for heart disease and other pathologies.  The measurement is performed in a quick, safe and comfortable way using a handheld indirect calorimeter (the MedGem):  the study participants only have to breathe through a single-use mouthpiece.  NIOSH has purchased three MedGem devices and a limited number of the single-use mouthpieces to evaluate the efficacy of using the devices during the full-blown field component of the study.  It has been determined that these devices can be feasibly used at field sites and NIOSH now needs to purchase 12,000 snorkel mouthpieces and 5,000 nose clips in preparation for the evaluation of study participants.

Through this announcement, alternate sources are being offered the opportunity to demonstrate their capabilities to provide the items specifically identified above.  To be considered qualified, sources must submit a capabilities statement which demonstrates in writing that they can provide 12,000 mouthpieces and 5,000 nose clips that are designed to work with the MedGem or otherwise demonstrate that they work effectively and efficiently with the MedGem devices.  The MedGem device specifications are described in the following link:  http://www.healthetech.com/medgem/MedGemUserManual.pdf

Qualified organizations are encouraged to submit a capabilities statement which addresses the requirements and contains material in sufficient detail to allow NIOSH to determine if the party can furnish this requirement.  Capabilities are to be received in the contracting office no later than fifteen (15) days from the dated of this announcement.  Submit written information to:  DHHS, PHS, CDC, NIOSH, ATTN:  Jenny Bayer, Mail Stop C-4, Robert A. Taft Laboratories, 4676 Columbia Parkway, Cincinnati, Ohio 45226, Reference 000HCC51-2004-10223.

The intent of this synopsis is to determine whether alternative sources exist.  Information received will be used solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely with the discretion of the Government.  All responsible sources may submit a response, which shall be considered by the Agency.  This is a simplified acquisition requirement.

<DESC>POC: Evangela Kunene, Procurement Data Manager, Tel: 703-875-4357, Fax: 703-875-4009, E-mail: ekunene@ustda.gov  :  PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT CONTRACTS OFFICE  :  Proposal Submission Place: Mr. Ignatius Sama Juma, Director General, Cameroon Civil Aviation Authority, BP/PO Box 6998, Yaoundé, Cameroon  :  The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to conduct technical assistance on airport security in Cameroon.

The technical assistance is designed to provide services to Cameroon Civil Aviation Authority (CCAA) to modernize and refine legal, regulatory and operational frameworks for security in Cameroon’s aviation sector.   Improved security management at Cameroon’s airports and with airlines serving them is needed to meet International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) requirements.  Cameroon is one of the eight member countries of the U.S. Safe Skies for Africa Initiative.  The assistance proposed strongly follows USTDA’s mandate to support worldwide aviation safety and security improvements.    

Cameroon’s Civil Aviation Authority was established in 2000 under the Cameroon Aviation Code to be the statutory authority to oversee the civil aviation sector, including airports, air traffic control, and airlines operating in and serving the country.  As part of its effort to carry out its mandate, the CCAA seeks technical assistance to review the current aviation code and to make recommendations for changes needed to revise CCAA’s authority to implement security requirements.  

The study will give recommendations for revising the CCAA organizational structure to administer, control and organize a national civil aviation security program as required by Annex 17.  The critical elements of a national civil aviation security program are the formation of a civil aviation committee, a national training program, an inspection and testing program, a security contingency plan, emergency procedures, a cargo security program and a national plan to develop and implement a security plan for each airport. As part of the review, the existing airport security measures at the airports of Douala, Yaoundé, and a third airport of the Contractor’s choice will be reviewed to establish whether Annex 17 is currently being followed.  In addition, standard operating procedures are to be developed for each security function and operating position, i.e., screening protocols, access control procedures (personnel and vehicle), perimeter fence controls, aircraft security, search procedures, and identification (badging) procedures.  

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $237,178 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm’s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English and French directly to the Grantee by 4:00PM, July 29, 2004 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

Objective -  Objectives of this project extension are to evaluate the use of the Franz diffusion cell as part of the bioequivalence criterion for topical products. Different membrane types will be evaluated and the ability of the diffusion cell to detect differences in product attributes due to differences in the manufacturing process between test and reference products.


Detailed Description  -  In the previous part of this project test products that were Q1 and Q2 identical were manufactured under controlled conditions with known modifications. A variety of tests were applied to these products. Based on these results and discussions at the FDA advisory committee, further evaluation of the Franz diffusion cell is desired.

The test products from the previous work shall be evaluated in the Franz diffusion cell using low resistance and high resistance artificial membranes as well as cadaver skin membranes.

It is desired to find the optimal membrane for two cases:
•	Detecting formulations (Q3) differences in products that at Q1 and Q2 to each other
•	Detecting differences in thermodynamic activity of the drug substance in products that have Q1 and/or Q2 differences. 

The University of Kentucky shall verify these tests by applying them to a variety of topical products (gels, lotions, creams, ointments) that are Q1 and Q2 different and also to products that are Q1 and Q2 similar but differ in a controlled manner through changes to a manufacturing process. Measurements shall be repeated over a time period to evaluate the variation.

The period of performance is for one year.  This not a request for quotes.  However, other bidders/offers who believe they posses the capabilities and expertise to perform this work must respond to the responsible contract specialist prior to the response due date.  The FDA’s evaluation/award will be based on the technically acceptable quote that offers the best value to the Government.  The sole source procurement will be awarded as a simplified acquisition in accordance with FAR 13.5

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center for Cancer Research (CCR), Laboratory of Molecular Cell Biology (LMCB) plans to procure Schizosaccharomyces pombe (fission yeast) microarrays from Agilent Technologies, 2850 Centerville Road, Wilmington, DE 19808.    The LMCB investigates basic cellular processes of homeostasis, growth, division and differentiation, with an emphasis on the genetic and molecular biology of chromosomes and the cell nucleus. Accordingly, LCMB is engaged in research on the structure of chromatin and how chromatin is packaged to regulate gene expression and maintain genomic integrity.  The Schizosaccharomyces pombe  microarray, contains over 44,000 genes designed with 60-mer oligo probes, which are commonly used for differential gene expression studies and Chromatin IP applications to develop an epigenetic map of the fission yeast genome. The Agilent arrays are highly sensitive with a detection limit of 1 transcript/cell/million cells and have a dynamic range of 0.05 – 5 pM.  Only 50 ng of total RNA is required for labeling when using the low RNA input amplification kit.   The probe design is critical in that work has been done to determine the best 60-mer probe to specific gene, requiring only one probe per gene and reducing redundancy of the content of the array. The arrays are manufactured by performing the phosphoramidite chemistry directly onto the glass surface, adding each nucleotide base at one time, resulting in better hybridization characteristics.  All arrays undergo rigorous performance and QC tests from the QC of the proprietary surface chemistry, to photographing each base addition, laser dicing of the larger wafer into 1” x 3” slides.  Finally, each batch has a portion, which is tested in actual experiments to insure quality.  All of the manufacturing detail is provided in the barcode which is on the array and is read by the Agilent scanner, detailing date manufactured, gene I.D., machine which is printed, and date. In addition, the In- Situ Hybridization and Low RNA input kits are designed to work exclusively with Agilent arrays and contain controls which specifically hybridize to Agilent arrays.  Because measurement accuracy is absolutely critical to microarray experiments and directly effects a scientist’s downstream research efforts, it is important that certain engineering advances are utilized in making these measurements.  Agilent’s microarrays are the only ones that incorporate the features described above.  The Agilent arrays  will be used in conjunction with existing Government owned Agilent equipment that is already in the lab.  Therefore, it is essential that these arrays be procured from Aglient in order to maintain the comparability of the data from ongoing experiments.  This equipment is commercial as defined in FAR Part 2, and this acquisition is being made in accordance with the test program using simplified procedures for certain commercial items as authorized in FAR 13.5.  Affymetrix, Inc is the only organization known to the NCI researcher that has aforementioned features that are required and believed to be unique. This is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement and the noted features, it may submit a statement of capabilities. The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the NCI research to determine if the party can perform this requirement. An original and one copy of the capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 p.m. EDT, on June 22, 2004.  All questions must be in writing and can be faxed to (301) 402-4513 or emailed to dm170b@nih.gov .  It is the vendor’s responsibility to call (301) 402-4509 to insure questions have been received.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect call will be accepted.

<DESC>See Commerce Business Daily Note 22. The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) intends to issue a sole source contract to George Mason University (GMU) for Blast Effects Computational Support. This project will include computational support for calculating blast environment in and around structures. In the first year of this effort, the contractor will focus on the development of technologies to assist in the prediction of blast effects on structures.  Additional focus areas will include development of blast mitigation techniques; development of bombing forensic techniques; and development of building response algorithms and software for assisting in the design of blast-resistant structures. The Computational Fluid Dynamics Group at GMU’s School of Computational Sciences has mounted a considerable effort in the area of blast effect prediction.  It pioneered first-principles-based fluid-structure interaction codes that are currently being used, by DTRA contractors, in assessing the effects of blasts on structures. This group developed some of the codes that were used in the forensic analysis of the explosions in the World Trade Center (first explosion), Khobar towers (Saudi Arabia), Nairobi (Kenya) and the USS Cole (Aden, Yemen).  The Evolutionary Design Group at GMU’s School of Information Technology and Engineering has conducted research on evolutionary design with specific applications to structural engineering, including the development of Inventor, an evolutionary design tool, initially developed for designing steel skeleton structures of tall buildings.  The most recent version, Inventor 2003, is a universal multi-population Java-based tool intended for distributed and Internet applications.  It can be integrated with various design-specific simulation programs, and was recently integrated with the gas flow simulation software developed by the Computational Fluid Dynamics Group.  Present research is focused on proactive approaches to security of structural systems and infrastructure systems.  The objective of this effort is to leverage previous work at GMU related to computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and computations structural dynamics (CSD) codes and evolutionary design methods, to develop fast running PC-based vulnerability assessment and blast mitigation design tools. The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is 10 USC 2304 (c)(1) implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1, 'Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.'

<DESC>Arnold AFB is located in middle Tennessee, just off of Interstate 24 and halfway between Nashville and Chattanooga; it is 7 miles SE of Manchester, TN.  The base covers approximately 40,000 acres, straddling Coffee and Franklin counties and situated in the tri-city triangle composed of Tullahoma, Manchester, and Winchester.  Arnold's primary mission is the Arnold Engineering Development Center (AEDC), which supports the development of aerospace systems by testing hardware in facilities that simulate flight conditions.  This heavy industrial center operates aerodynamic and propulsion wind tunnels, rocket motor and turbine engine test cells, space environmental chambers, arc heaters, ballistic ranges and other specialized units.  There are approximately 300 facilities on Arnold AFB, most located in the AEDC industrial area supporting the industrial mission.  Arnold Village is a small, 40-unit military family housing complex, VOQ, recreation area, conference/leadership facility, club, and golf course located at the Woods Reservoir.  Key to successful test operations is timely, accurate delivery of utility services.  Utility operation is fully integrated in plant management through a single Tactical Integration Group (TIG) in the AEDC operations center.  Utility operators are envisioned to be full-time, on-site partners in the TIG.  Test operations fluctuate daily, even hourly, with a high percentage of schedule change occurring.  Maintenance and Repair (M&R) requires close coordination with operations to ensure availability and safety.  Ultimately, utility service delivery may not be allowed to negatively impact test scheduling and test operation

Electric System –Electricity is provided to the base by the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) via two 161kV circuits from TVA's Franklin Substation.  The primary power at 161kV enters the base from the southwest.  It terminates at the dead-end structure, which is located in the government-owned 161kV switching station.  The main switching station is constructed in a main and transfer scheme consisting of four oil-filled and nine SF6-filled 161kV power circuit breakers.  The main switching station provides power to two 161-13.8kV TCUL power transformers which in turn each feed a 15kV class metal enclosed switch gear utilizing vacuum breakers.  The 13.8kV 3-wire service from the metal enclosed switchgear provides electricity to ten (predominately overhead construction) distribution circuits feeding mainly facility power to the site, including five 13.8kV breakers (123,946 feet of overhead and 127,304 feet of underground wire service).  In addition to the 13.8kV circuits, there are twelve 161kV oil insulated underground circuits from the main switching station which feed 27 power transformers located at eight location throughout the test site area, with an additional five SF6-filled 161kV power circuit breakers and fifteen 161kV circuit switchers.  Annual consumption varies widely from 789,737 MWH (1994) to 361,615 MHW (1991).  Consumption averaged 607,968 MWH over past five calendar years.  Peak power requirements vary widely from 605,952KW (1994) to 356,544KW (1996).  Street lighting is provided along the primary roads with pole-mounted lights.  

Natural Gas System – The natural gas distribution system receives gas from a gate station at 100 psig for distribution throughout the base.  There are pressure-reducing stations in the system.  The system has approximately 10,000 feet of steel pipe, which is protected by a cathodic protection system.  The pipe sizes range from 12-inches to 3-inches in diameter.  Annual consumption is approximately 600-800 million cubic feet.  The primary use of the gas is for testing purposes, fuel for the steam plants and heating.

Potable Water Treatment Plant and Supply System – The water treatment facility receives water from Woods Reservoir via a secondary reservoir.  The treatment plant has a maximum capacity of 2.25 million gallons per day.  The treatment plant consists of two coagulation and sedimentation basins, three gravity filters, three chemical feeders, three distribution pumps, and one laboratory for operational monitoring.  Treated water is stored in two 250,000-gallon clear wells and one elevated tank.  The base water distribution system consists of approximately 25 miles of piping, 50 percent of which is 6-inches in diameter and below.  The remainder of the piping system is larger than 6-inches (upto14-inches).  The pressure in the distribution averages 60-70 psi.  There are approximately 145 fire hydrants.

Sanitary Sewer Collection System –The sanitary sewer system consists of 16 lift stations and approximately 55,000 feet of collection lines, which are mostly vitrified clay pipe.  The system flow discharges into the one of the base's wastewater treatment facilities, of which there are two.  The main plant (plant1) supports the AEDC industrial area.  A smaller plant (plant 2) supports Arnold Village area.  Plant 1 is a standard rate trickling filter plant, which consists of primary settling tanks, trickling filter, various pumps, aerobic digesters, and drying beds with a plant design capacity of 660,000 gpd.  Effluent is discharged into Rowland Creek.  Plant 2 is package type extended aeration design, with a capacity of 30,000 gpd.  It's effluent is discharged in Woods Reservoir. 

The Contractor(s) shall furnish all facilities, labor, materials, tools, and equipment necessary to own, maintain and operate the utility system(s) in a safe and reliable condition.  The Contractor(s) shall manage the maintenance, repairs, replacement, etc., of the system(s) to ensure continuous, adequate, and dependable service for each Government or tenant connection within the service area.  Real property interests will be conveyed in the form of a Right of Way as an attachment to the RFP.  The utility system(s) will be conveyed via a Bill of Sale upon award of the contract.  

THIS SOLICITATION WILL BE ISSUED ON OR AROUND JUNE 30, 2004.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), Plant Protection and Quarantine (PPQ), in conjunction with New Jersey officials, requires a firm fixed-price, requirements contract for the application of a systemic insecticide (Imidacloprid) for control of the Asian longhorned beetle (ALB), Anoplphora glabripennis (Motschulsky) in the Jersey City and Hoboken areas of the State of New Jersey.  This spring, APHIS anticipates treating an estimated 955 trees with an estimated total diameter at breast height (dbh) of 6,224 via soil injection and an estimated 102 trees with an estimated total potential for damage from this major pest of trees.  ALB bores into and kills a variety of tree species including, but not limited to, species of Elm, Maple, Birch, Willow, Box Elder, Horsechestnut, Buckeye, Rose of Sharon (dbh equal or greater than 4 inches), European Mountain Ash, Ash, Poplar, Albizza, London Plane, and Sycamore.  This nonnative pest has the potential to spread to other areas of the United States and cause extensive losses to ornamental and commercial tree species.  As a consequence, the Secretary of Agriculture declared an emergency for the eradication of ALB in the areas identified.  Control treatments must be completed prior to adult emergence and flight which begins in late spring and early summer.  Therefore, all projected control treatments must be applied by mid August of 2004.  A requirements contract will be awarded in the event additional control applications are needed or PPQ decides to apply control treatments in the fall of 2004.  The effective period of the contract is anticipated from mid March 2004, through September 30, 2004, with unilateral four options to extend the effective period.  This solicitation is issued on an unrestricted basis, however, award preference will be provided to companies qualified under the Small Business Administration HUB Zone and Section 8(a) programs and other small and small disadvantaged businesses.  NAIC Code:  115310, Size Standard:  $5.0 million dollar average receipts.  This agency does not issue hard copies of the solicitation; you must download a copy from this website. The solicitation is expected to be issued on or about the March 11, 2004, with proposals due to the Contracting Officer three weeks thereafter.

<DESC>THIS SOLICITATION IS CANCELLED.....The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), Plant Protection and Quarantine (PPQ), in conjunction with New Jersey officials, requires a firm fixed-price, requirements contract for the application of a systemic insecticide (Imidacloprid) for control of the Asian longhorned beetle (ALB), Anoplphora glabripennis (Motschulsky) in the Jersey City and Hoboken areas of the State of New Jersey.  This spring, APHIS anticipates treating an estimated 955 trees with an estimated total diameter at breast height (dbh) of 6,224 via soil injection and an estimated 102 trees with an estimated total potential for damage from this major pest of trees.  ALB bores into and kills a variety of tree species including, but not limited to, species of Elm, Maple, Birch, Willow, Box Elder, Horsechestnut, Buckeye, Rose of Sharon (dbh equal or greater than 4 inches), European Mountain Ash, Ash, Poplar, Albizza, London Plane, and Sycamore.  This nonnative pest has the potential to spread to other areas of the United States and cause extensive losses to ornamental and commercial tree species.  As a consequence, the Secretary of Agriculture declared an emergency for the eradication of ALB in the areas identified.  Control treatments must be completed prior to adult emergence and flight which begins in late spring and early summer.  Therefore, all projected control treatments must be applied by mid August of 2004.  A requirements contract will be awarded in the event additional control applications are needed or PPQ decides to apply control treatments in the fall of 2004.  The effective period of the contract is anticipated from mid March 2004, through September 30, 2004, with unilateral four options to extend the effective period.  This solicitation is issued on an unrestricted basis, however, award preference will be provided to companies qualified under the Small Business Administration HUB Zone and Section 8(a) programs and other small and small disadvantaged businesses.  NAIC Code:  115310, Size Standard:  $5.0 million dollar average receipts.  This agency does not issue hard copies of the solicitation; you must download a copy from this website.

<DESC>Work consists of providing all labor, supplies, materials, supervision, transportation, equipment, and all else necessary to complete Construct Dare County Range Operations Building at Seymour Johnson AFB, NC.  The work involved includes, but is not limited to: provide demolition and removal of two existing double wide office trailers, concrete wash pad and sand filter; adjust grade and construct a new pre-engineered metal building of approximately 2700 square feet complete with finished internal office, toilet mechanical and conference room spaces; new mechanical, electrical and plumbing systems shall be installed and connected to the existing services on site as indicated in the Construction documents.  All work shall be in strict compliance with the specifications and drawings.  A firm-fixed price contract award is contemplated and the period of performance is 180 calendar days.
This action is being considered for 100 percent set-aside for HUBZone or Service Disabled Veteran Owned small business concerns.  Interested HUBZone and Service Disabled Veteran Owned small business concerns should indicate interest to the Contracting Officer, in writing, as early as possible but not later than 5 calendar days after the date of this notice.  As a minimum the following information is required:  (a) a positive statement of your intention to bid on this contract as a prime contractor; (b) evidence of  recency and experience in work similar in type and scope to include contract numbers, project titles, dollar amounts, and points of contacts and telephone numbers; (c) evidence of bonding capability to the maximum magnitude of the project to include both single and aggregate totals, if applicable.  All of the above must be submitted in sufficient detail for a decision to be made on availability of interested and qualified HUBZone and/or Service Disabled Veteran Owned small business concerns.

A decision on whether this requirement will be pursued as a HUBZone small business set-aside, Service Disabled Veteran Owned small business set-aside or on an unrestricted basis will be posted on EPS within 2 calendar days after the 5 calendar days have expired.

The successful contractor will be selected using Performance Price Tradeoff (PPT) procedures, resulting in the Best Value to the Government. Past performance is significantly more important than price.  It is anticipated the solicitation will be issued electronically on or about 20 Jul 04 on the Federal Business Opportunities web page at http://www.eps.gov.  Paper copies will not be available. Once the solicitation is posted, it is incumbent upon the interested parties to review this site frequently for any updates/amendments to any and all documents.

ADDENDUM TO THE
CONTRACT DOCUMENTS
FOR THE JOHN W. BRICKER FEDERAL BUILDING


1.1	GENERAL

A.	This Addendum covers changes to the Documents and will become a part thereof. 

B.	These items modify only the portion of the Documents specifically noted. All other wording and Drawings remain in effect.

C.	Each Contractor shall include these items to the extent they affect his quote.

D.	There is a conflict in requirements of Section 00120, Attachment A, Item 2  - Key Team Member Qualifications and Specification Section 01310, 1.5 Administrative and supervisory personnel.
1.	It is the intent of the referenced portion of Section 00120 to gather resumes of the three key personnel that will be involved and guide the project for the contractor.  Therefore for clarification provide the requested resumes and experience for the following:  
a.	Project Manager – ultimate responsibility for all aspects of the project for the contractor. 
b.	Project Superintendent – the on-site manager, responsible for the day-to-day running of the construction and all on site constuction personnel, and as further defined in section 01310,1.5,B and labeled as Project Coordinator
c.	Tenant Coordinator/Liason - as defined in section 01310,1.5,G
2.	The contractors standard format is acceptable for the presentation of this documentation.


E.	Questions:

1.	Is a Subcontracting Plan required with this submission or upon award?  It is not identified as a document to be submitted with our offer, according to the “Notice Concerning Solicitation” document.
Response:
Subcontracting Plan  - The Subcontracting Plan shall be requested by the Contracting Officer at a later date, and does NOT need to be submitted with the Bid Form.

2.	It is clear that we are to submit a two ( 2 ) package proposal , a Technical and Price. It is not clear however how the Government would like to see the information distributed between the two packages, please clarify which documents are to be submitted in which package? 
Response:
For distribution of technical and price proposal package, see specification Section 00120 - Supplementary Instructions and Notice Concerning Completion of Solicitation

3.	Please clarify if the contractor will be able to do any work or what kind of work during Government normal business hours?
Response:
Work can be performed during these hours as indicated under Section 01140 – Work Restrictions, paragraph 1.4 and as further described elsewhere in that section and as described in the  Phasing Narratives in Section 01100

4.	Can a complete work area be shut down electrically , or a whole weekend to replace electrical panels?
Response:
See specification Section 01310, 1.7,  for the requirements of all utility service interruptions

5.	What will be the process for getting above ceiling work approved by the A/E, GSA, or other agencies with authority to inspect and approve of above ceiling work? Will ceilings be permitted to be left open during occupied hours?
Response:
The work will be approved and inspected per phase.  Ceilings will be permitted to be left open as long as proper HVAC and lighting levels can be maintained per the specifications.

6.	Option 16 for Inclusion of Additional LEED Requirements: The wording of this option is vague and does not clearly identify the scope of this option. The language included in Addendum # 1 does not clarify the scope of Option 16. It is unclear what LEED Requirements are Base Bid and what requirements are to be priced with Option 16. How do you determine what are the "Additional LEED Requirements"? For example, we interpret that all requirements listed in Spec Section 01524 Construction Waste Management are to be included in pricing for Option 16 and not the base bid. Is this correct? It would be helpful to be very specific about exactly what are the "Additional LEED Requirements".
Response:
This option shall include the requirements of the three referenced specification sections only.  The intention of labeling this as “additional” requirements refers to the fact that some submittals, testing or documentation is required in the base bid standard product specifications.  This work shall remain in the base bid, even though it is also mentioned as a requirement of the LEED specification. The Option price should only include the “additional” testing, or submittals required.  Section 01524 is not listed in the description of this option and therefore shall be part of the base bid. As full documentation of the waste management plan is required to be submitted for LEED and Section 01352 any “additional” documentation / copy requirements would become part of the Option.

7.	Is it a requirement that the comparable projects were under a general construction vs. other delivery system
Response: No, other delivery systems are acceptable as long as the intended level of responsibility is demonstrated and the process and specific roles are explained.

8.	The count of more than 1 but maximum 5 comparable projects—is this count for each of the offeror and each key subcontractor or a total for all combined?
Response: The requirement is for each key subcontractor

9.	Section 01810 Part 1.11 - A.: Please clarify if the CxA meetings shall be conducted weekly, biweekly or monthly. All three of these options currently appear in the specifications.
Response:  the meetings will probably average biweekly.  It is anticipated that there will be less meetings required during the early phases of the project and weekly meetings required during the commissioning phases.

1.2	PROJECT MANUAL

A.	Section 01100, Summary
1.	Per Addendum 1 the dates for the anticipated date for Notice of Award and Notice to Proceed were inverted and should read as follows
a.	July 16, 2004  -   Notice of Award

(A.1) The outreach plan would include suggestions as per the Contractor's expertise, but does not include producing or distributing of such things as VNRs, PSAs, flyers, etc.  Outreach implementation will be handled under an  existing order. (Q2.) In Task 1, are we correct in our assumption that preliminary label designs will be provided by EPA for testing, or will we be required to develop initial designs? (A2.) EPA will provide initial designs. (Q3.) In Task 2, are we required to design/redesign labels per the  indications from the research? (A3.) Yes. (Q4.) In Task 3, could you please clarify the scope of this task?  Does this include only recommendations for implementation or some implementation as well?  (Q4.) Services are already in place for leading the general outreach plan, which includes more than  just labeling.  This Purchase Order will provide assistance by providing recommendations and help with the green label portion of the general plan. (Q5.) The combined synopsis/solicitation refers to NESCAUM's interviews and Oak Ridge's focus groups.  Are these available?  (A5.) Oak Ridge's study is  available at: http://www-cta.ornl.gov/cta/Publications/pdf/ORNL_TM_2003_166.pdf  Since NESCAUM's research is not finalized, a public document is currently not available electronically. (Q6.) Is the work called for in the synopsis/solicitation new and separate from the earlier work referenced above,  or is it a continuation of that work? (A6.)  This is a continuation of existing work.  Basically, current research (Oakridge, NESCAUM, etc.) indicate that providing consumers with additional vehicle environmental information is a benefit to the public.  The purpose of this Purchase Order is to  determine how to disseminate this information. (Q7.) If this work is a continuation, is there an incumbent firm that has conducted the previous work, and if so, can you identify that firm? (A7.)  No. The purpose of this Purchase Order is to implement a green labeling program. (Q8.) Is there anyway  you could standardize the scope and parameters of research you are requiring so that you are comparing apples to apples? For example, the Government will often require Offerors to complete a sample task that allows it to better calibrate costs between competing bids. (A8.) Given that this is a  discrete project, and not a mission contract, it is not necessary to complete a sample task.  (Q9.) What components, exactly, do you consider the ODCs (Other Direct Costs) to cover? (A9.) The ODCs cover focus grouping testing, travel, printing, postage and other costs not allocable to direct labor  categories. (Q10.) Task 3 states that EPA will provide an outreach plan to the Contractor to assist in implementation. Without having the plan in hand, how can we make recommendations or cost out the tactical plan? (A10.) The successful Offeror's role under this Purchase Order is to provide  recommendations to the outreach plan for the green vehicle label portion of a more general plan that is already in place.

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to replace the previous RFI Description in its entirety with the following:

This is a request for information (RFI), part of the Bureau of Engraving and Printing's market research to support acquisition planning, as described in FAR 15.201(e). FAR 52.215-3 applies: The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this solicitation or to otherwise pay for the information solicited except as an allowable cost under other contracts as provided in FAR 31.205-18, Bid and proposal costs. Although "proposal" and "offeror" may be used in this Request for Information, your response will be treated as information only. It shall not be used as a proposal. This solicitation is issued for the following purpose: The Bureau?s Office of Procurement is trying to determine whether or not there are currently available Automated Purchasing Systems (APSs) that would meet its needs, but which it currently does not have. (If there are such APSs, and the Office decides to purchase one, then the Office would proceed with an acquisition appropriate to the circumstances, in conformance with the FAR.) To meet the Office?s needs, an APS would have to: (a) be a commercial, off-the-shelf, and Web-based system, operating in a Windows environment; (b) provide a completely seamless and paperless procurement process; (c) handle all types of procurements, at any dollar level, from acquisition planning, through receipt of requisition and award of contract or order, to contract closeout; (d) produce all the necessary documents, allow for coordination and approval among participants in the procurement, and provide the capability of reminding the contract administrator when a new action must be taken; (e) contain continuously updated electronic versions of the FAR, the Department of the Treasury Acquisition Regulation (DTAR) and all the forms needed in the procurement process; (f) provide flexible search capability for the FAR and DTAR databases; (g) be capable of direct interface with external systems such as the Treasury Acquisition Data System (TADS), the Contractor Performance System (CPS), Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) and the Central Contractor Registry (CCR); (h) include the capability to query the system?s database and produce reports as needed; (i) be ready to accept XML tagging and be digital certificate ready; and (j) conform to Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 per 36 CFR, Part 1194. The system would be accessible by web interface by approximately 45 users in the Bureau?s Washington DC and Fort Worth TX facilities. Initially, it would operate with no direct interface to other internal systems, although the potential for interface is desirable. The Office is seeking a vendor whose strategic vision for product development is consistent with Federal E-Government strategies, especially as relates to the Integrated Acquisition Environment of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP).  Interested vendors and other Government agencies are invited to submit information on the system they offer. Such information should include: (a) the technical capabilities of the system offered: (b) a statement as to whether or not the system can accommodate specific needs, and, if so, a description of which functions(s) of the system can be configured and the relative degree of difficulty in configuration; (c) the approximate timeframe for installation of the system and training of user personnel; (d) the price for installation, training, and maintenance/update/support of the system for one year; (e) whether or not there is an existing Federal user group for the system; and (f) a list of Federal procurement office locations currently using the system, including the names and addresses for Agency points of contact. Interested vendors should also indicate whether or not they have GSA Federal Supply Schedule contracts, and, if so, provide the schedule and contract number. Information should be submitted by the date, and to the contact point, specified below. E-mail is preferred, but fax and mail are acceptable. E-mail and fax numbers are shown below. The mailing address is the Contracting Office Address shown above, marked to the attention of George Leininger, Room 705-A.*****

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to provide answers to questions received in response to a Request for Information (RFI), Reference Number RFI-APS for an Automated Purchasing System:

Request For Information
Automated Purchasing System
Amendment 1

Responses to Vendor Questions Received Through May 20, 2002

1.	Q:	I realize that an RFI is a request for information and not for a quote or proposal. However, when an RFI, such as this one, is released, do you use this information to award a contract? Or is it simply used to decide whether or not the organization needs such a service? Or for some other reasons?
A:	As indicated by our reference to FAR 52.215-3, we do not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI; your response will be treated as information only, and will not be used as a proposal. What we are trying to do is find out if there are existing systems that will meet our needs. If there are, and we decide to buy one, we would proceed with an acquisition appropriate to the circumstances, in conformance with the FAR. For example, if companies with systems that meet our needs have GSA Federal Supply Schedule contracts, then we would use the procedures in FAR 8.4.

2.	Q.	This is a new opportunity, correct? And thus, there is no incumbent contractor?
A.	Yes, this is a new opportunity. There is no incumbent contractor.

3.	Q.	Also, what is the competition type? I noticed there was a mention of GSA schedule; is this open to only GSA schedule holders or is this full and open competition?
A.	This is not a competition. This is a Request for Information as part of our market research. The acquisition strategy will be determined when the Office of Procurement completes its market research and decides to proceed with the procurement process.  

4.	Q.	Was there outside assistance in defining the requirements for this procurement? 
A.	No.

5.	Q.	If so, what is the name of the company involved? 
A.	N/A.

6.	Q.	Is there an expected timeframe for award on this procurement? 
A.	No. This is not a procurement, just a request for information (RFI).

7.	Q.	Will this be a Small Business Set-Aside?
A.	This is an RFI, issued as part of the Bureau's market research to support our acquisition planning.

8.	Q.	Is it possible to get the list of the vendors who participate in this RFI?  
A.	This is a request for information, and not a request for proposals. We're doing market research.

9.	Q.	Are there any similar systems which this RFI is based on? If so which systems?
A.	The "system" we describe in the RFI is in reality just a list of the electronic capabilities and functions we are looking for. We don't know whether such a system actually exists. That's why we issued the RFI.

10.	Q.	Do you require the system to directly connect with CCR?
A.	A web link in the APS to CCR would be sufficient. 

11.	Q.	The RFI requires procurement functions, but some or all these procurements will result in vendor term contracts, I assume the system needs to manage the contracts established.
A.	Yes, contract administration needs to be part of the APS.

12.	Q.	What is the estimated number of vendors?  
A.	As this is an RFI issued as part of the Bureau's market research effort, this information is not presently available. However, if we proceed with an actual procurement, the information you requested would be included in the resulting solicitation. What we can tell you now is that, as of April 15, 2002, the Contract Administration Division of the Office of Procurement was managing a total of 62 contracts.

13.	Q.	What is the estimated dollar value per annum of all purchases?
A.	Again, this information is not presently available, but would be included in the resulting solicitation if we proceed with an actual procurement. What we can tell you now is that, as of April 15, 2002, the Contract Administration Division of the Office of Procurement was managing contracts with a total value of about $763 million. These contracts varied widely in type, length, and dollar amount.

14.	Q.	Instead of buying a system why not contact DOD, suggest the Air Force and use their system. Will save the taxpayers some money and get you a Purchasing System.
A.	Thank you for your suggestion. The RFI, in fact, invites such an arrangement. It reads ?Interested vendors and other Government agencies are invited to submit information on the system they offer.? At this point in the process, however, we do not know all the systems used by other Government agencies, let alone which systems are available commercially. We're trying to obtain information from both communities.

15.	Q.	I had read your solicitation on the Automated Purchasing System and was thinking this described the types of web based systems we develop. We are a software company that builds commercial, custom web applications ... [that are] very stable and give the clients exactly what they need for an affordable price. ... I was curious if the requirement for off the shelf means literally "off the shelf."
A.	By ?off the shelf? we mean a system that fits the description of ?off the shelf item? in paragraph 46.101 of the FAR: ?an item produced and placed in stock by a contractor ? before receiving orders or contracts for its sale.? In other words, we are looking for a system that is already functionally complete and currently in use by commercial firms or Government agencies, that we could use with only ?minor modifications?, as described in paragraph (3)(ii) of ?commercial item? definition in FAR 2.101. The RFI specifies commercial, off-the-shelf systems, because we believe that such systems already used by Federal agencies are available from the marketplace. Additionally, such systems are likely to have achieved commercial market acceptance and thus be less expensive, faster to implement, more stable through proven reliability, and less costly to maintain than custom-built systems.  However, the purpose of this RFI is to allow the Government to obtain as much information as possible to determine the availability of automated purchasing systems. We will not categorically reject any information we receive, particularly if the information indicates that custom-built systems may be preferable to commercial off the shelf systems.

Previous Provided information:

The Defense Distribution Depot Jacksonville, Florida (DDJF) provides materiel distribution services including the receipt, storage and issuance of materiel. 

The Contractor shall provide the materiel distribution services performed at DDJF.  This includes all management, personnel and supervision in addition to materiel, tools, equipment and transportation, and any other items and services not government-furnished.  The DDJF depot consists of two sites, one located at Naval Air Station (NAS) Jacksonville and one at Naval Station (NS) Mayport.  These sites are approximately 40 miles apart. At NAS Jacksonville, DDJF has warehouses and operations in the North area, South area, and inside NAVAIR Jacksonville satellites.  The North and South areas are approximately 3 miles apart.

The major commodities are airframe structural components for gas turbine and jet engines, bearings, fittings and specialties, non-powered valves, electronic assemblies, boards, cards, radioactive materiel, industrial/general supplies, repairables, aircraft engine fuel systems components, replacement parts for military equipment and aircraft engines. 

The Contractor shall be responsible for managing and operating the Materiel Processing Center (MPC) Operation for all assigned ships home-ported at Naval Station Mayport, FL and any additional assigned visiting ships to the local geographical area.  The MPC Operation is a customer focused distribution support operation that specializes in receiving and processing materiel that is to be stowed aboard ships.  This operation views each ship as containing floating warehouse(s) and work center(s) that requires the materiel to be moved from the MPC to shipside in a manner and configuration that reduces to the greatest extent possible the level of effort needed by the shipboard personnel to finish the stow action.  Materiel being delivered to a ship or diverted from one ship to another may be destined for the ship or a unit or squadron being deployed with the ship.  

The Defense Distribution Center is seeking offeror’s to perform the above functions on a best value basis. The resultant contract will be awarded on an all or none basis as a Firm Fixed Price, indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract. The term of the contract consists of a two-year base period and three one-year option periods.

<DESC>This is a request for information (RFI) solicited from the  Defense Information Systems Agency’s (DISA), Procurement and Logistics Directorate with its subordinate Defense Information Technology Contracting Organizations (PL/DITCO).  PL/DITCO is in the process of modernizing the processes and automated tools used to accomplish the PL/DITCO mission under the project name of Enterprise Business Modernization (EBM).  PL/DITCO serves as the procurement arm of DISA and has a world-wide operational presence with offices at DITCO-Scott, Scott Air Force Base, Illinois; DITCO-NCR, Falls Church, Virginia; DITCO-EUR, Sembach Air Base, Germany; DITCO-PAC, Pearl Harbor, Hawaii; DITCO-SWA, Bahrain in Southwest Asia; and DITCO-AK, Elmendorf Air Force Base, Alaska.  All DITCO offices except DITCO-NCR are defense working capital funded.  NCR is funded by annual appropriations.  All DITCO offices acquire and account for information technology (IT) supplies and services required by the warfighter, military departments, DISA, and other DoD and Federal agencies.  IT services and equipment procured includes telecommunications services, networks, systems, point-to-point circuits, equipment and facilities, as well as computer technology requirements such as: hardware, software, maintenance, and support services.  In Fiscal Year (FY) 2003, the organization processed over 35,000 new contracting actions while administering over 1 million on-going contracting actions and 2.4 million financial transactions.  PL/DITCO had revenues exceeding $2.7 billion.

In order to accomplish this large volume of transactions, PL/DITCO manages, operates, and in many cases, has developed, a group of complex software applications across a wide range of computing environments including mainframe, client/server and web. The current list of systems applications includes 11 mainframe applications, 47 client server applications and seven web applications.  These applications have evolved independently over time and do not adhere to a consistent architecture.   This inconsistency adversely impacts the cost of operations and maintenance, the ability for end-users to track requirements through the entire process, and the ability of the technical staff to accommodate changes in requirements.

The goal of the EBM project is to create a single integrated solution that is accessible worldwide, shares consistent data and processes, and provides accurate and easily retrievable information for all PL/DITCO contracting functions.   The solution will incorporate the mandated Federal/DoD e-Business applications and it will solve the data exchange interoperability gap between these applications.  The objective is an application tool suite that uses “business workflow” and net-centric movement of data between applications in order to eliminate manual data entry thereby increasing data accuracy and integrity of procurement and financial information.  Additionally, this solution will replace legacy applications that are no longer required or mandated by DoD for use across the Department or within specific domains associated with OSD’s Business Management Modernization Program.  The optimal solution will reduce the number of unique applications by 75% or more, thus reducing reconciliation problems between systems and reducing applications and recurring infrastructure operations and maintenance costs.  PL/DITCO plans to operate and maintain the proposed systems solutions by acquiring commercial support as an integrated performance package, utilizing current, internal IT support resources, or a combination of both that focuses on systems readiness, availability, and minimized training, personnel, and infrastructure support requirements.  Any candidate solutions shall include a total life cycle management program that capitalizes on available commercial support and an available service delivery environment that will best meet our requirements given a total life cycle management approach from design to decommissioning.

THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT INTEND TO AWARD A CONTRACT ON THE BASIS OF THIS RFI OR TO OTHERWISE PAY FOR INFORMATION RECEIVED IN RESPONSE TO THIS RFI.  This RFI is issued for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation.

<DESC>The Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002 (the “2002 Farm Bill”), Public Law 107-171, expanded the availability of financial and technical assistance funds for implementation of conservation programs.  The current staffing levels of the United States Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), are insufficient to meet the increased need for technical assistance under the conservation programs.  Section 1242 of the Act expands the availability of technical assistance to producers by encouraging other potential providers of technical assistance to assist in the delivery of technical assistance.  To ensure that high quality assistance is available to all producers, Section 1242 requires the Secretary of Agriculture to establish by regulation, a system for “approving individuals and entities to provide technical assistance to carry out programs under the Farm Bill, and establish amounts for payments for assistance.” 

NRCS is seeking sources of technical services and pricing data for past technical services provided.  NRCS intends to use this pricing data submitted by prospective sources to evaluate payment rates for technical service providers.

This is a request for information announcement—A market survey for information only.  This is not a solicitation announcement for offers and no contract will be awarded from this announcement.

The Bureau of Engraving and Printing?s Office of Procurement is trying to determine the availability of Automated Purchasing System (APS). To meet the Office?s needs, an APS would have to: (a) be a commercial, off-the-shelf, and Web-based system, operating in a Windows environment; (b) provide a completely seamless and paperless procurement process; (c) handle all types of procurements, at any dollar level, from acquisition planning, through receipt of requisition and award of contract or order, to contract closeout; (d) produce all the necessary documents, allow for coordination and approval among participants in the procurement, and provide the capability of reminding the contract administrator when a new action must be taken; (e) contain continuously updated electronic versions of the FAR, the Department of the Treasury Acquisition Regulation (DTAR) and all the forms needed in the procurement process; (f) provide flexible search capability for the FAR and DTAR databases; (g) be capable of direct interface with external systems such as the Treasury Acquisition Data System (TADS), Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) and the Central Contractor Registry (CCR); and (h) include the capability to query the system?s database and produce reports as needed. The system would be accessible by web interface by approximately 45 users in the Bureau?s Washington DC and Fort Worth TX facilities. Initially, it would operate with no direct interface to other internal systems, although the potential for interface is desirable. Interested vendors and other Government agencies are invited to submit information on the system they offer. Such information should include: (a) the technical capabilities of the system offered: (b) a statement as to whether or not the system can accommodate specific needs, and, if so, a description of which functions(s) of the system can be configured and the relative degree of difficulty in configuration; (c) the approximate timeframe for installation of the system and training of user personnel; and (d) the price for installation, training, and maintenance/update/support of the system for one year Interested vendors should also indicate whether or not they have GSA Federal Supply Schedule contracts, and, if so, provide the schedule and contract number.

<DESC>The Range Instrumentation Systems Office, Air Combat Support, Air Armament Center, Eglin AFB, Florida (AAC/YBR), in concert with Air Combat Command (ACC), is requesting information and interested sources for participation in the Next Generation Range Instrumentation (NexRI) Program.  NexRI is intended to address inherent interoperability constraints in the current Range Instrumentation acquisition and fielding process.  The current product-based acquisition approach is not conducive to being coordinated with aircraft acquisition or weapon system upgrades.  The result is forever playing a “catch up” game to support training of new tactical capabilities.  NexRI is a program to: (1) Develop a set of open standards to allow acquisition/integration of interoperable air combat training range instrumentation from multiple sources, (2) Develop and operate a conformance testing suite to certify compliance of a candidate range instrumentation with NexRI standards, and (3) Validate completeness and accuracy of the standards by developing a reference model and testing the standards for compliance.  ACC tasked Standard Research Institute (SRI) International to lead a study to definitize the NexRI Program approach and create a plan for NexRI standards development.  This study clarifies the scope of the NexRI Program and develops the foundation for further NexRI development.  The NexRI Scope Definition and Phase 0 Study Results reports are available through the Aerial Targets Information Management System (ATIMS).  ATIMS access is subject to export control laws and regulations.  Only contractors who are registered and certified with the Defense Logistics Services Center (DLSC) shall be granted access to ATIMS.  Contact the Defense Logistics Services Center, 74 Washington Avenue N., Battle Creek, Michigan 40917-3084 (1-800-353-3572) for further information on the certification process.  Requests for an ATIMS account for this procurement can be made via internet at http://atims.hill.af.mil.;  Rregister for NexRI Program.  You must submit a copy of your approved DD Form 2345, Military Critical Technical Data Agreement, concurrent with your request for ATIMS access to: Erik Urban, Contract Specialist, AAC/YBRK, 102 West D Avenue, Bldg 11, Suite 373, Eglin AFB FL 32542-6808; Fax 850-882-3226; erik.urban@eglin.af.mil.   The Government plans to stimulate industry involvement by providing industry the NexRI vision, soliciting industry suggestions on how to implement NexRI development, and defining and evaluating NexRI standards through an Industry consortium.  The Government is in the very early stages of this acquisition and is soliciting membership from qualified organizations to establish a consortium including all interested training community and producer parties as a potential next step.  The consortium would be the working level group developing and disseminating open standards for NexRI to ensure inter- and intra-range interoperability among air combat training instrumentation systems, combat aircraft and weapon systems.  The future of NexRI is likely to include joint, international, and testing aspects.  AAC/YBR anticipates conducting an Industry Day in August 2004 to facilitate information exchange between the Air Force and interested industry partners.  To initiate exchange of information the Government requests interested parties submit any or both of the following: (1) expression of interest in participating in a NexRI consortium, or (2) alternative concepts for improving the Range Instrumentation acquisition process.  This request for information (RFI) is for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a request for proposal or as an obligation on the part of the Government to conduct any follow-on acquisitions.  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or otherwise pay for information solicited.  No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of submission of responses to this RFI and Government use of such information.  The Government reserves the right to reject in whole or in part any industry input as a result of this RFI.  The Government recognizes proprietary data may be part of this effort.  If so, clearly mark such restricted or proprietary data and present it as an addendum to the non-restricted/non-proprietary information.  For further information concerning technical aspects contact Mr. Walt Schmidt at (850) 882-9514 x2064.  Responses to this RFI should be sent to AAC/YBR, 102 West D Avenue, Bldg 11, Suite 373, Eglin AFB FL 32542-5000, Attn:  Mr. Bruce Melusen, bruce.melusen2@eglin.af.mil, Commercial 850-882-9391 x2228 , or faxed to 850-882-3130226 no later than 15 days after publication of this notice.

<SUBJECT>R -- USZA22-02-D-0014 AND USZA22-02-D-0015 CEILING INCREASE
<DESC>The purpose of this announcement is to modify the original Special Notice published on 7 June 04 to allow for the full 15 day requirement for announcement as stated in FAR 5.203. See below for repeat of the announcement:

The purpose of this synopsis is to announce the revision of the contract ceilings on the Acquisition Logistics Management and Business Operations Support (ALMBOS) contracts supporting the United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM). These contracts are two multiple-award Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contracts awarded on 5 December 2001. Accordingly, this action will increase the current contract ceilings by $180M from $120M to $300M on each of these contracts. These contracts contain a base period and four ordering periods (5 years) plus three award term incentive periods?each one year in duration. Final expiration date of the last ordering period is 30 April 2007 and if earned the final incentive period would end on 30 April 2010. It is necessary to increase the ceiling due to (1) unanticipated high level of support for the war-onterrorism as a result of the events of September 11, 2001 (9/11); and (2) the USSOCOM mission change based on the events of 9/11. All work to be performed under the contract is considered to be in accordance with the original statement of work; however, the war-onterrorism increased the amount of work to be accomplished to an amount not contemplated in the original ceiling price. As a result of the requirements placed against these contracts supporting the war-on-terrorism and due to USSOCOM mission change, the original established contract ceiling of $120M is expected to be reached in contract year four. An increase in the ceiling will provide for continued critical support of various projects for the USSOCOM. The increase will ensure sufficient contract ceiling is available for any award term incentives earned by the industry partners and for new tasks supporting the USSOCOM mission. A competitive follow-on acquisition is planned to replace these contracts when they expire on 30 April 2007, unless the award term incentive periods are earned, in which case 30 April 2008, 30 April 2009, or 30 April 2010 will be the expiration date. All task orders processed under the ALMBOS contracts are and will continue to be competed using fair opportunity procedures between the two ALMBOS contractors unless a fair opportunity exception in accordance with FAR 16.505(b)(2) applies (logical follow-on). The two ALMBOS contractors and numbers are: Sverdrup Technology, Inc. under USZA22-02-D-0014 and Gemini Industries, Inc. under USZA22-02-D-0015. The expected date of executing this action is 21 June 2004. See numbered note 22.

<SUBJECT>Y -- Northwest PPV Results
<DESC>NORTHWEST REGION, WASHINGTON - The development team of American Eagle Communities, LLC, has been selected by the Department of the Navy (DoN) to participate in exclusive negotiations for an important public/private venture that will provide affordable and quality housing for Navy and Marine Corps families in the state of Washington. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1996, Section 2801, provides a series of powerful authorities that allows the DoN and other military services to enter into long-term agreements with private industry to design, finance, construct, own, operate, maintain, and professionally manage public/private housing ventures. The American Eagle Communities, LLC team was selected on May 26. The Naval Facilities Engineering Command, Southwest Division, San Diego, is managing the exclusive negotiations for this project in partnership with Commander, Navy Region Northwest. The project will include the privatization of 3,098 existing units of DoN-owned family housing, including related improvements and land for the construction of new units. The initial development scope will include the demolition, replacement, and renovation of existing units and support facilities located in the state of Washington. These include Submarine Base, Bangor; Naval Undersea Warfare Center, Keyport; Naval Magazine, Indian Island; Naval Station, Bremerton; Magnolia (Quarters A); Brier; Naval Radio Station, Jim Creek; and Naval Air Station, Whidbey Island. Also included in the project is the potential divestiture of properties no longer viable for continued Navy use.  These properties, which consist of the land and facilities at Olalla, Kingston, Bainbridge Island, and Fort Lawton, may be marketed and sold to facilitate and extend repair work and recapitalization of homes for the Northwest military families.  

Construction is expected to commence in late 2004 after Congressional notification and execution of the project partnership documents. 

For information regarding this project, please contact Lisa Young at (619) 532-1181 or Todd Czarnecki at (619) 532-2231 of the Southwest Division, Naval Facilities Engineering Command.

<SUBJECT>J -- Informational Meeting
<DESC>This FEDBIZOPPS announcement serves as a Request For Information pertaining to the above referenced number.  The Fleet & Industrial Supply Center is soliciting for contractors interest in attending an informational meeting on 22 June 2004 regarding the feasibility of replacing crane hoist drum gear and pinion sets with modified gear-sets.  The intent of the meeting is to provide an engineering feasibility discussion of the Government’s proposed gear replacement plan.  The modification is being considered for two cranes currently located at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard.  The Government wishes to determine the feasibility of procuring and installing replacement gear-sets that will have increased gear ratio from existing, allowing an increase of the main hoist hook capacity (60-tons to 85-tons).  The replacement drum gear is desired to be a split (2-piece) design, to allow field installation without removal of the hoist assembly from the crane.  Crane drawings depicting the existing gear-set installation and clearance envelope will be available at the meeting.  Topics of discussion will include:·	Engineering feasibility of providing large “split” design gears·	Fit and mounting configuration/requirements of the drum gear and pinion·	Clearance limitations for new gear-sets·	Feasibility of machining/truing of drum mounting surfaces in place, if requiredPlease be advised that this meeting is for information gathering only and attendance will be at contractor’s expense.Failure to attend or provide information at this meeting will not preclude any contractor from proposing on any subsequent solicitation.The meeting will be held at the Jackson Park Community Center (Chapel) on Tuesday 22 June 2004 at 10:00 AM.All interested parties must RSVP by 17 June 2004 to Josh Carter, FISC Contracting Specialist, via email at joshua.c.carter@navy.mil.

STATEMENT OF WORK


Transportation Inspector General Reporting (TIGR) System Oracle RDBMS, Oracle Forms and Reports Migration Conversion

Introduction

The Department of Transportation (DOT), Office of Inspector General (OIG), Office of Technical Resource Management (OTRM) is responsible for developing, operating, maintaining and updating the Transportation Inspector General Reporting (TIGR) System.  DOT/OIG would like to upgrade the current TIGR client server based system into a web based system, using Oracle RDBMS 9i and Oracle Forms and Reports.  This change is needed to improve performance, capacity, and increasing operational requirements.

Background and Understanding

The system was developed in the 1990’s, the TIGR system and associated software was developed using Oracle RDBMS 7.3.4, Oracle Forms 4.5, and Oracle Reports 2.5.  Since then the system has been upgraded to Oracle RDBMS 8.1.7.4.1, Oracle Forms 6i and Oracle Report 6i. 

There are approximately 30-50 Forms and 200-300 Reports, with associated Oracle database procedures that need to be migrated from the client server environment to a web-based environment. The Oracle 8.1.7.4.1 Database has approximately 120 tables running on IBM e server under Microsoft NT 4.0. There are approximately 450 users, 40 of which are concurrent. 

This effort addresses the migration of the current Oracle 8.1.7.4.1 Database to an Oracle 9i Database and the migration of the current client-server Oracle Forms and Reports 6.0 applications to Oracle 9i Forms and Reports. It also addresses the installation of the Oracle 9iAS Application Server and associated hardware and software.

Scope of Work

1.  PROVIDE FUNCTIONAL AND TECHNICAL SERVICES TO MIGRATE THE TIGR ORACLE 8.1.7.4.1 DATABASE TO AN ORACLE 9i DATABASE

Approximately 120 tables exist in the current Oracle 8.1.7.4.1 Database. The Oracle 8.1.7.4.1 Database is running on a Microsoft NT 4.0 operating system on IBM server. There are approximately 450 users, 40 of which are concurrent. This task involves migrating this Oracle 8.1.7.4.1 Database to an Oracle 9i Database. Included with the migration of the database tables themselves, is the migration of all procedures, triggers, etc associated with the Oracle 8.1.7.4.1 Database. 

2.  PROVIDE FUNCTIONAL AND TECHNICAL SERVICES TO MIGRATE TIGR ORACLE FORMS 6i TO ORACLE FORMS 9i

Approximately 30 to 50 Oracle Forms exist in the current TIGR system in a client-server environment. This task involves migrating the client-server based Oracle Forms 6i objects to web-based Oracle 9i Forms objects using JDeveloper. Included with the migration of the forms themselves, is the migration of all procedures, triggers, etc associated with the Oracle Forms 6i objects.

3.  PROVIDE FUNCTIONAL AND TECHNICAL SERVICES TO MIGRATE TIGR ORACLE REPORTS 6i TO ORACLE REPORTS 9i

Approximately 200 to 300 Oracle Reports exist in the current TIGR system in a client-server environment. This task involves migrating all client-server based Oracle Reports 6i objects to web-based Oracle 9i Reports objects using JDeveloper. Included with the migration of the reports themselves, is the migration of all procedures, triggers, parameters, etc associated with the Oracle Reports 6i client server objects, and upgrading them to a web based environment.



4.  PROVIDE FUNCTIONAL AND TECHNICAL SERVICES TO TEST AND INTEGRATE MIGRATED TIGR SYSTEM INTO A DOT/OIG PORTAL 

Once the TIGR system is migrated to an Oracle 9i Database using Oracle Forms and Reports, the migrated system must be tested for functionality and integrated into a specified DOT OIG Web Portal in order to be used by DOT/OIG employee. This task includes all aspects of testing and integration of the TIGR system to a specified DOT OIG Web Portal, installation of required Oracle 9iAS components, and configuration of required Oracle 9iAS components for Oracle Forms and Oracle Reports. 

5.  PROVIDE END USER AND TECHNICAL DOCUMENTATION FOR THE ORACLE DATABASE AND THE TIGR SYSTEM 

Once the TIGR system is migrated to an Oracle 9i Database using Oracle Forms and Reports, the migrated system must be fully documented for DOT/OIG End user and Technical Personnel according to NIST standards.


6.  HARDWARE/SOFTWARE PLATFORM.

The target hardware platform for the TIGR system will be two IBM AIX 5L servers.  One AIX 5L server will host the Oracle 9i Database and one AIX 5L server will host the Oracle 9i Application Server.  The contractor will install and configure the Oracle 9i software on both servers.  After the TIGR application has been migrated to the new AIX servers the contractor will tune the TIGR application for optimum performance.

Section 508 Compliant.

All screens, forms, and reports for the converted TIGR system must be Section 508 compliant.

DOT/OIG Participation.

All work processes needed to reach the final products will include the participation of DOT/OIG technical staff.

Security Requirements:
Before any work is to begin, the contractor must submit a Standard From 85P, Questionnaire for Public Trust Positions, to the contracting officer.  The top portion of the form (blocks 1-4) will need to be filled in with full name, date of birth, place of birth, and social security number.  This information will determine if the contractor has a clearance of record.  The remaining blocks will need to be filled in if the contractor does not have an existing clearance.  If the contractor does not have an existing clearance, and the period of performance on the contract is over 90 days, the contractor will be subject to a full background investigation.  If the period of performance is under 90 days, the contractor will be subject to a name and fingerprint check (NACI).

STATEMENT OF WORK
for
MILITARY FAMILY HOUSING POWER LINE CLEARANCE 

I. DESCRIPTION OF SERVICES
1. 	SCOPE OF WORK: The Contractor shall provide all personnel, equipment, tools, materials, supervision, and transportation necessary to complete all vegetation trimming, tree trimming and/or tree removal for Power Line Runs located in the Military Family Housing (MFH) area, McChord AFB, Washington. Vegetation Trimming and Tree Trimming or Removal shall be accomplished in a manner that meets both the environmental and line clearance needs while heeding all applicable safety precautions. The contractor shall ensure compliance with all Federal, State and local laws and regulations while providing vegetation trimming, tree trimming or tree removal infringing into the Power Line area. Vegetation, tree branch trimming or tree removal distances shall comply with distances referenced in "NATIONAL ELECTRICAL SAFETY CODE,"  "NATIONAL ELECTRICAL CODE," and AFJMAN 32-1082 Facilities Engineering Electrical Exterior Facilities, Section XIV. Project completion shall be 90 days from the award contract. 
II. SERVICE DELIVERY SUMMARY
2.0 	Magnitude of Trimming. Complete tree and vegetation trimming for high-voltage (13.8 kV) electrical distribution line right of ways having an estimated total length of approximately six (6) miles and Secondary lines to Housing Units. See Appendix 1 – “Tree Survey 2004 with Removals” for approximate number and location of trees for trimming/removal. Trees shall be trimmed to have a maximum clearance as measured from the outermost conductor, on each side, to the edge of vegetation. All power line tree trimming occurring within 15 feet of energized power lines must be supervised by a journeyman lineman or a person who has successfully completed an OSHA certified line clear training program. 

2.1	Tree Condition. Trees must be left in as sound of a condition and appearance as possible. If leaving the tree in reasonable condition and appearance is incompatible with necessary clearance, the tree may need to be removed. One exception to the referenced AFJMAN will be to omit the requirement to treat the tree trimming wounds (found in paragraph 4-58 of the AFJMAN). If trimming will be so severe that it is likely the trimming will result in a dead tree, the tree should be removed, after receiving approval from the designated government official. 

2.2	Tree Removal. Prior to removal of any tree, the Contractor shall contact the designated government official for approval. The Government is specifically interested in retaining Garry Oaks / Oregon White Oaks at McChord AFB. Should an entire tree located in an undeveloped area (i.e. when electrical lines are routed through wooded areas) needs to be removed; the stump of the removed tree shall be cut no higher than 2 inches above the adjacent natural grade. Should an entire tree that is located in any other area need to be removed, the stump shall be ground 4 inches below grade with the resulting wood chips transported to an approved disposal area of the contractor’s choice. Rock free top soil shall be applied to fill the ground stump hole and certified weed free rye grass seed applied.

2.3	Salvageable Wood Disposal.  Salvageable wood is defined as all trees and limbs with a diameter of six (6) inches or more. The Contractor shall cut all salvageable wood into lengths of eight (8) feet or less and haul to designated location on McChord Air Force Base identified by the Quality Assurance Person (QAP).  The Contractor will remove all salvageable wood the same day that it is cut in developed areas (housing areas or within 75 feet of base facilities).

2.3.1 	Tree Debris Disposal. Tree debris is defined as all trees and limbs less than six (6) inches in diameter. The Contractor will remove all tree  debris  the same day that it is cut in developed areas.

Every person (contractor/subcontractor) must obtain a pass, long term or short term, (AF Form 75) to gain entry to base.  Short- term passes (24 hours or less) may be obtained at the Main Gate Visitors Center.  All passes for longer than 24 hours are issued at Pass and Registration, Building P-7.  Duty hours are 0730-1630 hours, Monday through Friday.   Large vehicles (pickup trucks or larger) that carry tools, tool boxes, equipment, supplies, etc. shall use the Large Vehicle Search Gate (North Gate) for base access.

All contractor / subcontractor employees shall exit via the Main Gate.  .  Contractors / subcontractors will not have access to base facilities other than work location, except for on-base eating facilities located in the Base Exchange, Burger King, and Co-Located Clubs (BLDGS 700 & 1146).  Contract work hours will be as stated in the Statement of Work.  Contractors / subcontractors will not have access to the base on nights and weekends unless the contract requires work to be done at those times.  Any vehicle entering the base is subject to inspection at any time.  Refusal may result in the individual being temporarily or permanently barred from the base.
(b)  All contractors / subcontractors are subject to criminal background checks prior to being allowed on base to work.  Contractors / subcontractors will not be issued passes prior to submitting to background checks and being cleared by SFS (approximately a two week period).

If contractor / subcontractor employees are added after initiation of work, the base entry list, in its entirety, indicating additions / deletions, shall be resubmitted not later than seven (7) days prior to the individual(s) starting work on McChord AFB.

Upon completion or termination of the contract or expiration of the identification passes, the prime contractor shall ensure that all base identification passes issued to employees and subcontractor employees are returned to the issuing office.

<DESC>The Naval Facilities Engineering Command Southern Division (Navy) is seeking interest from 8(a) firms in the Small Business Administrations (SBA) Regions 4, 5, 6 (except New Mexico), 7 and 8 (except Montana & Utah) and those 8(a) firms with bona-fide places of business in these SBA districts (See http://www.sba.gov/regions/map/ to view Region Map).  The Navy is targeting the issuance of an indeterminate number of Basic Ordering Agreements (BOAs) to be selected from 8(a) firms, within specified SBA districts, that meet the qualification requirements as set forth in this announcement.  Those firms that can demonstrate that they meet the qualification requirements will be awarded a BOA.  The estimated period of performance for the BOAs will be one year (1) with the Navy reserving the right to exercise options for up to four years, with no single option exceeding one year in accordance with DFARS 216.703 (c).  BOAs are designed to provide enhanced contracting opportunities to qualified firms under the 8(a) program serviced by the specified SBA District Offices.  The BOA is not a contract, but a written instrument of understanding negotiated between the Navy and the 8(a) firm to facilitate the expeditious acquisition of covered services, if and when ordered.  The Navy will compete task orders issued under the BOAs among the BOA holders.  Each task order that is issued shall constitute a separate contract. Each task order may contain pre-priced options for the continued performance of environmental work under the task order.  The BOA firm will be required to furnish all labor, materials, tools, management, supervision, laboratory testing, engineering and equipment required of the task order.  If adequate competition cannot be obtained from the BOA firms within the designated SBA District, the Navy reserves the right to open the area of competition to include BOA holders in adjacent Districts.  There is no guaranteed minimum dollar amount or volume of work that will be ordered under the agreement, however there is a maximum dollar amount of $3,000,000 for each task order that can be awarded to an 8(a) firm. There is no assurance of a steady stream of work under this program.  Nothing in the BOA is intended to state or imply any agreement by the Navy to place future orders with the Contractor or to require the Navy to solicit and acquire covered services from the Contractor only. See also N62467-04-R-0600A, Supplemental Information uploaded separately to the FedBizOpps and titled “Frequently Asked Questions” to help answer previous questions and concerns.

The types of personnel who should be certified are:  QA/QC personnel, Health & Safety personnel, Project Managers, and any other personnel proposed by the contractor. An Acceptable rating will result from the offeror submitting documentation on the above listed personnel who have received the required OSHA Safety training and have presented the necessary current & up-to-date certification for these personnel. The certification shall also reflect that the training has been renewed on an as needed basis. An Unacceptable rating will result from the offeror providing little or no accreditation or certification information or outdated certifications for its proposed cadre of personnel.  
	Technical Factor 6: Key Personnel Resumes (education, background, experience, type reports written, to whom).

An Acceptable rating will result from the preponderance of personnel resumes disclosing that education, work background, experience demonstrate relevant, comprehensive and cogent experience with environmental RAO/LTM type work as set forth in the Scope of Work. An offeror that provides little or no information or provides resumes of proposed personnel that have little or no qualifying education or experience will receive an Unacceptable rating.
Team Disclosure
		a.  Please disclose in your proposal any subcontractor teaming arrangements.  The name of the company, point of contact, address and telephone number should be included.
		b.  In order to establish your bona fide place of business, only the information concerning the Prime 8(a) firm will be taken into account.  Although the non-8(a) firm teaming party may have many offices in multiple states, it is the Prime 8(a) firm who is responsible for establishing the bona fide place of business with the SBA for purposes of this solicitation.  The Prime 8(a) firm should provide its bona fide office information (addresses, points of contact, telephone/fax, email addresses) for each office location.
BOA Task Order Competition- Orders issued under the BOAs will be competed among BOA holders. Each solicitation for an order will indicate the degree of detail of pricing and technical information to be provided by the offeror. Each order will be considered a separate binding contract. The contractor will be required to submit a brief technical proposal or work plan and a list of proposed subcontractors as well as a price proposal.   LIMITATION OF ORDERS:  The average range will be from $5,000 to a maximum of $3,000,000.   However, the Navy has no obligation to issue any orders under any BOA.
Competing for BOA Task Orders shall be restricted to those BOA holders in a given SBA District where the work will be performed. If sufficient competition or interest is not found in the given SBA District, the Navy will seek competition from adjacent districts by allowing those BOA holders to participate in the Task Order competition.
The proposals will be reviewed using either Trade-Off or Low Price Technically Acceptable best value criteria. The best value process may consider such factors as Key Personnel, Past Performance, Technical Qualifications, Management Approach and Price.   Best Value is a method of evaluation, which allows the combination of technical considerations in combination with price to provide the greatest overall value to the Navy.  The RFP will inform the BOA holders the best value method of evaluation, either Trade-Off or Low Price Technically Acceptable.

A2.	Low price technically acceptable implies technical qualifications that low price does not.  See FAR Subpart 15.3 for best value methods. We anticipate using only low-price technically acceptable or trade-off methods of best value.

Q3.	Please explain, “BOAs up to $3M is not competitive”?
A3.	In the 8(a) program, projects under the $3M threshold are not competitive; but must be sole sourced.  SouthDiv received a waiver from SBA to compete projects under the $3M threshold.

Q4.	Please identify the SBA Districts applicable to the program?
A4.	http://www.sba.gov/regions/map/ SBA region map shows the Regions in SouthDiv's AOR. There are approx. 30 SBA Districts within our AOR.

Q5.	If you have, say 10 BOA firms for a given SBA District, are you accepting 10 proposals from them or will you request proposals from only a selected number of firms?
A5.	We would be soliciting those firms holding BOAs within the SBA district where the work is to be accomplished.

Q6.	Once you have a BOA are you required to compete or are some task orders sole source?
A6.	The Navy plans to compete each requirement.

Q7.	In landfill remediations where there are lots of unknown contaminants, will tasks be based on fixed price and what will be the procedure for non-scope work encountered?
A7.	The Task Orders will be fixed priced and contain the "changes" clause.

Q8.	Do you see the BOAs being used earlier in the CERILA/RCRA process than O&M or LTM (example, asbestos abatement)?
A8.	No, strictly RAO/LTM work, not R/A type work.

Q9.	Do you expect any Conflict of Interest between RAO and LTM?
A9.	No.

Q10.	Can 2 or more 8A firms join to go after a BOA, if so how will they be credited?
A10.	Yes, however they must still meet the size standard for the NAICS Code applicable. They will be evaluated under a “teaming arrangement” and only one BOA will be issued to the 8(a) firm identified as the Prime. 

Q11.	Service contracts (Remedial Actions) do not require (by 13CFR or FAR) offices to be located in the SBA District or geographic area of the work.
a.	Therefore, is it simply a condition of the contract that an office be in each respective district and or has there been a change to 13CFR or the FAR for this requirement?
b.	In a teaming or mentor protégé arrangement do the offices of the MP or team member counts toward this requirement? How about a subcontractor address?

A11a.	 There has been no change to the regulations. Although SBA can only impose geographical restrictions in construction, SBA and the Navy agreed to this requirement for the BOAs.
A11b.  No, the Prime 8(a) firm’s location will always be the indicator.	

Q12.	If an 8(a) small business graduates from the 8(a) program during the BOA performance period, how would NAVFAC SOUTHDIV respond?
A12.	Once an 8(a) firm graduates from the program, they can no longer participate in future solicitations under the BOA.  They must still complete any existing contract task orders that were awarded to them prior to their graduation.   

Q13.	We would like to propose but not for all SOUTHDIV SBA regions.  In our proposal, how should we identify which SOUTHDIV SBA regions we are including in our proposal?
A13.	Once you are issued a BOA, you will only be able to participate in projects that are located in the areas you have a bona-fide place of business.

Q14.	On submitting a proposal for multiple SOUTHDIV SBA regions, do we need to submit a separate proposal for each region or will one proposal satisfy the multiple region requirement?
A14.	You do not need to submit separate proposals; however, you must provide all of the information required under each factor for the various laboratories, key personnel, safety requirements, etc. if you will be using different participants in each of the regions where you have a bona-fide place of business.  
Q15.	 In regards to Technical Factor 3, can you elaborate on what you are looking for in terms of internal communication?
A15.	 For this factor - we are evaluating how the firm communicates internally.  How does information flow between the head of the organization, down through to the project manager or whomever the firms designates to oversee or run this task order on the contract.  How are subcontractors, laboratories, materials, etc. notified and coordinated?  How are the safety of employees and the safety plan integrated into the communications?  How is progress on a given task orders monitored?  Overall, once the task order is placed with the firm, how is it assigned, resourced, monitored, and tracked from home office to the individuals in the field accomplishing the work.  If problems occur in executing the work, how are these communicated and the Contracting Officer notified?  We are not trying to dictate a process; however, we need to evaluate how the firm's internal staff, suppliers, subcontractors, other firms and teaming arrangements are coordinated in receiving, processing, and executing the task order.

Q16.	Should the resumes of laboratory personnel be provided as proof to the "credentials of the laboratory personnel" in Technical Factor #4?  It was unclear as to how much information is needed for their credentials. 
A16.	An indication of the credentials of the laboratory personnel with resumes is one method to provide this information.  It certainly would be a good indicator of the type of individuals, their qualifications, and experience levels.  We wouldn't expect all of the laboratory personnel resumes to be included. Firms in the past have included some or all resumes.  Others have included education and experience of key laboratory or department level individuals.  

Q17.	Can you explain what the solicitation means when it states the business size standard for this contract is 500 employees?
A17.	This is the size standard in the NAICS Code 562910.  The 8(a) firm shall not employ over 500 employees, and this figure includes the employees of any teaming firm.

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL
ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6-STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION
FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE
ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN
SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED.   THIS SOLICITATION IS BEING ISSUED USING SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION PROCEDURES.

This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 01-23.

The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334516 with a small business size standard of 500 employees.  This acquisition is unrestricted and all interested offerors may submit a quote.

This requirement is for a multi-channel analyzer (MCA).  NIST is developing a set of spectrometers for in-house and field use. Among these is a Tissue-Equivalent Proportional Counter (TEPC) system. In the future, it is anticipated, that NIST will acquire simultaneous spectral data from He-3, BF3, LiI, and BGO detectors. For some of these detectors, data is acquired from up to 4 channels simultaneously. For example, a TEPC system may have the same pulse amplified by four amplifiers and then analyzed in four separate spectra. Additional channels are required to operate more than one detector simultaneously. It is essential that the MCA system be able to acquire data without any channel interfering with any other channel. 

***All interested quoters shall provide a quote for the following line item:  

LINE ITEM 0001:  Quantity one (1) each MULTI-CHANNEL ANALYZER (MCA); The instrument shall meet all of the following required specifications: 

(1) Able to acquire pulse-height data simultaneously on at least six non-interfering channels into six spectra. Any given pulse may be simultaneously input onto all input channels without interference;

(2) Each MCA channel must accept pulses from 0 to 8-10 Volts, digitize them, and analyze each pulse into at least 4000 channels.  If separate Analog-to-Digital converters are required, the Contractor’s technical and price quotations must include them; 

(3) Compact. The analyzer system must be stand-alone (operating on AC power) or NIM compatible. Total weight must be less than 
20 lbs. System shall operate at temperatures from 32 to 100 degrees F, and non-condensing humidity from 0 to 80%;

(4) The system must be capable of being operated from a laptop computer. Interface must be either USB and/or Ethernet. If system is integrated into a computer (such as with a PCI 
bus), the quoted system must include the computer. Laptop control must allow start, stop, data transfer and display, and storage of data on the laptop disk drive. These functions 
shall be operable without interference with data acquisition.  A laptop, if needed, to control the system must use Windows XP as an operating system.  It must have at least a Mobile Intel Pentium 4 Processor, 2.8 GHz, 512 kb L2 cache, 512 MB memory, 60 GB hard disk, 15” display and DVD-ROM with CDRW.  All software for data acquisition and storage must be included;
			
(5) MCA shall have the ability to operate in multichannel scaling mode, where the number of pulses in a given time period is recorded, and each channel of the MCA represents a successive time period.  Dwell time must cover at least the range from 1 microsec to 60 sec.  List mode (each acquired pulse having a time stamp) data acquisition is acceptable so long as the multichannel scaling mode data may be derived with the supplied software;

(6) Integral nonlinearity must be less than 0.03% over the top 99.5% of input range. Differential nonlinearity must be less than 1% of full scale over the top 99.5% of range, including effects of differential nonlinearity.  Gain drift must be less than 0.005% of full scale per degree C.  Zero drift must be less than 0.005% of full scale per degree C;

(7) System must have a minimum one year warranty.  Warranty must, at a minimum, cover all parts, and labor; 
			
System as supplied must be complete with all hardware and software needed to acquire data. The system is not required to include a laptop, provided that the only connection between the laptop and the system is through a USB and/or ethernet port.

*** CENTRAL CONTRACTOR REGISTRATION (CCR)
Effective October 1, 2003, all vendors that do business with the U.S. Department of Commerce and the Federal Government must be registered in CCR.  Contractors are strongly encouraged to register with CCR now to avoid payment delays.  

Changes to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) require, among other things, that contractors be registered in the CCR before award of any contract, basic agreement, blanket purchase agreements, or basic ordering agreement can be made, and that contract payments and/or new awards will be conditioned on CCR registration.  The FAR change will also require that contractors with existing contracts that require performance after September 30, 2003, register in the CCR.  There are 5 exceptions to the CCR registration requirement, including purchases that use the government-wide purchase cards as the purchasing mechanism, certain emergency operations and urgent procurements, certain purchases where CCR registration could jeopardize national security, and awards to foreign vendors for work performed outside the United States. 

The preferred method for completing a registration is via the World Wide Web at http://www.ccr.gov.  There, a CCR Handbook is available to provide detailed information on data you will need prior to beginning the on-line registration, as well as steps to walk you through the registration process.  You must have a DUNS number in order to begin your registration.  If you do not already have a DUNS number, please call Dun & Bradstreet, Inc., at 1-866-705-5711 or  610-882-7000. There is no cost to obtain a DUNS number.

FIRST ARTICLE APPROVAL: FAR 52.209-4 FIRST ARTICLE APPROVAL - GOVERNMENT TESTING (SEP 1989)--ALTERNATE I (JAN 1997) is hereby incorporated by reference.  Paragraph  (a) shall read - The Contractor shall deliver three (3) rolls within 10 calendar days from the date of the award to the Government at the delivery address specified above (under “Delivery”) for first article testing. The shipping documentation shall contain this order number and all Lot/Item identifications. The characteristics that the first article must meet and the testing requirements are specified elsewhere in this order.  Paragraph (b) shall read - Within 30 calendar days after the Government receives the first article, the Contracting Officer shall notify the Contractor, in writing, of the conditional approval, approval, or disapproval of the first article.

A notice of conditional approval shall state any further action required of the Contractor. A notice of disapproval shall cite reasons for the disapproval. TESTING REQUIREMENTS:  Test rolls will be inspected to ensure compliance with specifications. Test rolls will be inspected upon receipt at the Middle River Warehouse to ensure that the rolls have been received without obvious defects (e.g. if the paper is wet, torn, or wrinkled, it will not be accepted). Test rolls will be held in SSA's printer area for a minimum of three calendar days to allow for proper acclimatizing. The rolls will then be used on the appropriate machinery to ensure that the paper meets all requirements for surface stability, vapor emissions, print quality maintenance and fusing quality. The core must function properly without shifting of the paper or jamming. More than one non-compliant roll in the test group constitutes failure. If the test rolls pass these requirements, SSA will give conditional approval of the test rolls. The Government will have an additional 30 days to ensure that the paper has no detrimental effects on the printing equipment. Additional criteria that may be assessed during this period are: (1) the continued use of the paper must not result in the emission of odor-causing compounds such as sulfur compounds, chlorides, rein-based aerosols or organics; 2) any coatings on the paper must not cause fusing failures; 3) the paper must not cause fusing failures due to the inclusion of synthetic resins synthetic sizing agents or plastics; 4) the paper must not create excessive dust. The amount of paper dust generated must not exceed 75-260 micrograms per cubic meter (SSA Health code standard) or cause printer malfunctions and operator interventions; and 5) paper must not have additives or other conditions that reduce print quality.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION

The Government of Uzbekistan has recently increased efforts targeted at developing Uzbekistan’s solar energy sector.  Uzbekistan, with its sunny, dry climate, is considered to be a particularly good candidate for solar energy development.  In July of 2003, the Government of Uzbekistan sent a small delegation to the U.S. to meet with the National Renewable Energy Laboratories in Florida, as well as with Unisolar, a private company in Michigan that produces components for manufacturing photovoltaic equipment.  Uzbekistan currently has one photovoltaic factory, Foton, and the Government of Uzbekistan would like to develop its capacity, as well as the potential for the use of photovoltaics in smaller towns and villages around Uzbekistan.  

Concurrently, the Government of Azerbaijan has requested assistance in developing its wind, solar and biomass resources.  The capital city of Azerbaijan, Baku, originally meant “city of wind”, and the government would like to employ this resource to diversify Azerbaijan’s energy supply, as well as promote more environmentally friendly technologies.  The Government of Azerbaijan has been in contact with the Tennessee Valley Authority and the Joint Institute for Energy and Environment regarding how best to use wind energy, but it is agreed that closer study of the issues is warranted, especially from the standpoint of commercial viability.  The Government of Azerbaijan has also requested assistance in evaluating potential biomass projects.

CNMPs will contain actions that address water quality criteria for the feedlot, production area, and land on which the manure and organic by-products will be applied (i.e., as a minimum the plan would address CNMP elements a, b, c, and d listed in item 8 above).  This includes addressing soil erosion to reduce the transport of nutrients within or off of a field to which manure is applied.  For AFO owners and/or operators who do not land apply any manure or organic by-products, the CNMP would address only the feedlot and production areas (i.e., address CNMP elements a, d, and f listed in item 8 above). 

10.	Document that the CNMP meets all applicable local, Tribal, State, and Federal laws and regulations.  Ensure that State of Arizona permit requirements (i.e., minimum standards and special conditions) are addressed. 

11.	Certify that the CNMP meets requirements of the NRCS Field Office Technical Guide (FOTG) conservation practice standards for all practices contained within it.
