PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT (PWS)

I.  Background Information
The U. S. Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Information Technology Laboratory (ITL) is working with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security National Cyber Security Division to improve the state of the practice in software assurance. SAMATE (Software Assurance Metrics and Tool Evaluation) project is dedicated to improving software assurance by developing methods to enable software tools evaluations, measuring the effectiveness of tools and techniques, and identifying gaps in tools and methods. 
One methodology for evaluating software assurance tools is to develop tool specifications, test plans, and test sets. NIST has completed a specification for a class of tool, called Source Code Security Analyzers. This specification is published as NIST Specification 500-268. A draft test plan for source code security analyzers is published as NIST Special Publication 500-270. For additional background information, see https://samate.nist.gov/

II. Objective of the Procurement
The objective of this procurement is to determine which weaknesses identified in the Source Code Security Analyzer specification might occur in the SPARK subset of the ADA programming language, which might occur but can be proven to be absent, and which cannot possibly occur.  The weaknesses are identified by its Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) number and currently appear in the MITRE web site http://cwe.mitre.org/. The deliverable will be the addition in Annex A – Source Code Weaknesses, in the Language(s) column, of “SPARK/ADA” as appropriate and report explaining why each weakness might or might not occur. If a weakness might occur but can be proven not to be present, that should be noted. 

III. Contractor Tasks
The contractor shall provide all labor, supervision, materials, equipment, and facilities (unless otherwise stated herein) to complete the following tasks.  
The contractor shall:

BASE PERIOD – CONTRACTOR TASKS

-Review and become knowledgeable of the SAMATE source code security analyzer specification particularly the associated weaknesses listed in Annex A.
-Review and become knowledgeable with the current SPARK subset of the ADA programming language.
-Determine if the following weaknesses occur in the SPARK subset of the ADA programming language.
-  CWE 89: SQL injection
-  CWE 121: Stack-based buffer overflow

Task 2: Determine if the following weaknesses occur in the SPARK subset of the ADA programming language for the following:
