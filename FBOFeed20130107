<DESC>Hill AFB is contemplating a contract for CATV services at Hill AFB to be awarded to Comcast of Wasatch Inc. The contemplated contract will be FFP for 1 base year with 4 option years beginning 1 April 2013 and ending 31 March 2018. The contract action will be negotiated on a sole source basis with Comcast of Wasatch Inc. because Comcast currently owns all the infrastructure needed to meet this requirement. Through market research and a previously held industry day with several interested vendors it was determined that the duplication of cost required to reinstall infrastructure made the project cost prohibitive to all interested vendors. <br /><br />In order to provide for future competition for this requirement the government will be negotiating ownership of all in building infrastructure used in this requirement at expiration or termination of this contract. <br /><br />The attached documents contain a listing of all buildings at Hill AFB as well as the level of service required for each building. <br /><br />Contemplated CLINs:<br />0001-Fitness Center and Lodging <br />0002-75 OSS/CSS; 388 FW/FM <br />0003-No Cost Basic Cable <br />Option 0101-Fitness Center and Lodging <br />Option 0102-75 OSS/CSS; 388 FW/FM <br />Option 0103-No Cost Basic Cable <br />Option 0201-Fitness Center and Lodging <br />Option 0202-75 OSS/CSS; 388 FW/FM <br />Option 0203-No Cost Basic Cable <br />Option 0301-Fitness Center and Lodging <br />Option 0302-75 OSS/CSS; 388 FW/FM <br />Option 0303-No Cost Basic Cable <br />Option 0401-Fitness Center and Lodging <br />Option 0402-75 OSS/CSS; 388 FW/FM <br />Option 0403-No Cost Basic Cable <br /><br />A formal solicitation will be posted at a later date.

Authority:  10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1).   Supplies or services required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source(s) and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. Therefore, the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.
In accordance with FAR 52.225-3, Buy American Act - Free Trade Agreements, one or more of these items under this acquisition is subject to the Free Trade Agreement. 	 Based upon market research the Government is not using the policies contained in FAR 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items in its solicitation for the described supplies or services.  However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Governments requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.
Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made.  No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer.
Electronic procedures will be used for this solicitation.  Hard copies of the solicitation will not be sent from this office.  The solicitation will be available for download only at www.fbo.gov.  
It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement  make contact with the firm(s) listed.
This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application.  The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined.  Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small business set-aside).  Foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could if otherwise eligible participate as subcontractor(s).

<DESC>The National Science Foundation (NSF) intends to issue a purchase order to the National Science and Technology Medal Foundation (NSTMF) to provide for the production of video profiles for an event to be held on February 1, 2013. The profiles are for use in the 2012 National Medal of Science and National Medal of Technology and Innovation Awards ceremony. The scope of work includes research and recording of laureate interviews, collection of all production elements-video, stills, graphics, and music. The order is issued noncompetitively to the NSTMF as NSF's contribution towards sponsoring a multi-agency effort. Further, the NSF could not manage nor fund the event on its own; the NSTMF utilizes funds from private sources to help subsidize the event. This is the only source reasonably available that can be utilized and it provides for continuity in the program. <br /><br />The proposed contract action is for services for which the government intends to sponsor with only one source. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. This synopsis is for information purposes only.

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT AND NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATION. The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS), Research Triangle Park, NC intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Dr. Diane Forsythe, Cary, NC 27518, for a modification to existing Order #HHSN273201200003I pursuant to 41 U.S.C.253(c)(1)--Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The modification will add an additional 540 hours and extend the performance period through April 30, 2013. This request is for Dr. Forsythe to provide consulting services to the Comparative Medicine Branch regarding special animal projects and maintaining and resolving issues concerning AAALAC accreditation. The services requested require an in-depth knowledge of existing animal protocols and on-going research projects currently existing at NIEHS. Specifically, Dr. Forsythe will provide the following services per the Statement of Work: Scope: Under this order, the contractor will provide support services to satisfy the overall operational objectives of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, Comparative Medicine Branch. Provide guidance to the Acting Chief on animal program issues; Assisting with oversight to the CMB budget; Assist with oversight of the animal space requirements; Assist with projects requested by the SD such as review of animal resources and cost accounting; Assisting with review of animal study proposals and service to the NIEHS Animal Care and Use Committee (ACUC); Assisting with oversight of ongoing improvements being made to the Mouse Information Management System (MIMMS); Assisting with improvements and implementation of the E Sirius cost accounting and protocol management software; Serving as an alternate to the Acting Chief on various NIEHS and NIH committees (DIR Council, ARAC, APD, AFPAB, COOP); Assisting with animal program related training (CMB contract staff, investigators, lab animal residents/externs); and Assisting with orientation of new Branch Chief if necessary. The justification for selection of Dr. Forsythe is as follows: Dr. Forsythe has served as the Chief of the Comparative Medicine Branch (CMB) since 1988 in addition to serving as the NIEHS Animal Program Director. Dr. Forsythe has an in-depth understanding of the NIEHS animal program and the requirements for maintaining AAALAC accreditation. The NIEHS has a continuing need for her services on an interim basis until a replacement is hired. The recruitment process for a replacement is already underway; however, a national search is required and the entire process can take up to an additional six months under the Title 42 guidelines. The NIEHS Scientific Director has named Dr. Mary Grant as the Acting Chief of the CMB until a replacement for Dr. Forsythe is hired; however, the availability of Dr. Forsythe for consultation to the CMB is critical during this interim period prior to the arrival of a permanent Branch Chief. It is necessary for the Division of Intramural Research to retain the ability to consult and seek advice and guidance from Dr. Forsythe. Dr. Forsythe will continue to provide assistance and guidance to Dr. Grant on animal program issues. Due to the experience Dr. Forsythe possesses from her many years of experience at the NIEHS in the capacity of CMB Branch Chief, she is the only person who is able to provide the services required by this order. As a retiree, Dr. Forsythe is able to bring experience and knowledge of the animal program without any bias or conflict. Interested parties may identify their interest and capability. Respond to this requirement by submitting written capabilities/specifications to the Contracting Specialist at the address provided. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however, all responses received within 8 days from the date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract action based upon responses to this notice is solely with the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. If no affirmative responses are received within 8 days of this notice to determine whether a qualified source is more advantageous to the Government, the order will be issued to Dr. Forsythe. The NAICS Code/Size is 541690/$14.0 Million. This procurement is to be processed using Simplified Acquisition Procedures in conjunction with FAR Part 12 Commercial Item Acquisition of Commercial Items. There is no solicitation package available. For any questions regarding this announcement, please contact Dee Lunney via email lunney@niehs.nih.gov.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City, Florida intends to issue a sole source firm fixed price Indefinite Delivery / Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contract to QinetiQ, Inc. (the U.S. branch of QinetiQ, Ltd.), 1215 Jefferson Davis Highway, Suite 1102, Arlington, VA 22202-4344 for the purchase of up to five (5) new Advanced Reconnaissance System (ARS) Electro-Optic (EO) Sensors (part number 10010319) to include repair of the sensors that are or will be deployed to the fleet. The contract period of performance will be five years and will provide for firm fixed price delivery orders.  

This acquisition is unsuitable for full and open competition for the following reasons: The ARS Electro-Optic sensors, along with its interface to the system it is installed on are based upon proprietary information developed by QinetiQ.
 Sole proprietorship restrictions are specific to the problem of producing an image sensor that meets the required environmental and size constraints imposed by the system integration. As the sole developer and original equipment manufacturer (OEM), QinetiQ Inc. is the only source with sufficient in-depth knowledge of the EO sensor that could fabricate the parts, conduct repairs and deliver on schedule.  Currently, no other source meets the form, fit, and function requirements for the ARS Electro-Optic Sensor.  Alternative known Sensors would require development and extensive engineering and environmental testing efforts, which would not meet the known deliverable dates for procurement.  

Delivery will be made to the Receiving Officer, Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City Division (NSWC PCD), 110 Vernon Avenue, Panama City FL 32407.
  Delivery will be made to the Naval Support Activity - Panama City, 101 Vernon Avenue, Panama City, FL 32407-7018. 

Interested Offerors may submit request(s) for qualification on future requirements via e-mail to Contract Specialist  Tim Reed at tim.e.reed1@navy.mil by 11 January 2013.  Requests must be marked with the synopsis designation number and should include the offerors name, address, telephone number, commercial and government entity (CAGE) code, point of contact, and clearly identify the offerors capabilities.

The Government will evaluate and select, for contract award, two (2) or more qualified Offerors, whose proposals are determined to be the most beneficial to the Government, with consideration given to both the technical evaluation factors and price. <br>  <br> Task orders will primarily address new construction, general building renovation, road and pavement repair, and general environmental work including, but not limited to, incidental minor construction, excavation, plumbing, demolition, electrical, structural, mechanical, concrete, and environmental remedial work.

Specific evaluation criteria will be provided in the solicitation documents.   <br>  <br> The maximum contract value shall not exceed US $10,000,000.00 (estimated to be US $2,000,000.00 per year) for the life of the contract, which consists of one (1) base and four (4) option year periods.  The contract will end upon completion of the five (5), one (1) year periods or upon attainment of the US $10,000,000.00 capacity.  Individual projects issued under the MATOC will contain their own estimated values.  There will be no limits on the number of task orders awarded/issued in any year; however, the minimum amount per task order is anticipated to be US $50,000.00 and the maximum is anticipated not to exceed US $5,000,000.00.  The minimum guarantee shall be US $5,000.00.  This amount shall cover the duration of the entire contract (all base and option periods).  The North American Industrial Classification System Code (NAICS) is 236220. <br>  <br> The Government will post this synopsis, the solicitation, and all subsequent amendments through the Army Single Face to Industry (ASFI) Acquisition Business website to the government-wide point of entry (GPE) Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website at http://www.fbo.gov.  It is the Offeror's sole responsibility to obtain this solicitation and any subsequent amendments through this website.

<DESC>This is a Request for Information (RFI) only and does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)/Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC)/Wallops Flight Facility (WFF) will take procurement action in this matter.  Further, neither NASA nor the Government will be responsible for any cost incurred in furnishing this information. NASA recognizes the interest by educational institutions, science museums, and other appropriate organizations in the Manufacturing of the Wallops 6U CubeSat Deployer, Manufacturing of the Wallops 6U CubeSat Satellite Structure, Flying the Wallops 6U CubeSat Deployer, Marketing the Wallops 6U CubeSat Deployer and 6U CubeSat Satellite Structure, and Investing in Deployer Technologies. NASA intends to enter into multiple agreements for technical transfer. Please see attached Wallops 6U CubeSat Deployer Fact Sheet. The Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC)/Wallops Flight Facility (WFF) has a long history of suborbital class missions such as sounding rockets, balloons and aircraft, and experience with orbital payload development such as CubeSat and International Space Station.  For decades the NASA suborbital programs have, and continue to be, indispensable platforms for developing and nurturing the next generation of scientists and engineers, for testing and validating new technologies and instrumentation, and for offering low-cost rapid access to space for cutting-edge science experiments.  The Wallops 6U CubeSat Deployer and Satellite Structure continue in the tradition of enabling low-cost rapid access to space for the nation. The Wallops 6U Deployer development had been funded by NASA.  It has been ground tested for flight.  GSFC/WFF is developing improvements to the Deployer funded under GSFC Center IR&D, ground testing the improvements, flying the improved version on a sounding rocket in July 2013, and planning on flying on the Antares launch vehicle in December, 2013. The Wallops 6U CubeSat Deployer is unique in a number of respects.  It has an elegant pin and socket lateral restraint system that provides a highly reliable ride experience.  It offers the greatest volume flexibility for a 6U CubeSat and the most space between the deployer and the CubeSat sides for Solar panels, deployables and other devices.  It has been tested to very high safety factors with a 12 kg load allowing for greater than 12 kg in lower vibration environments and 12 kg in a high vibration environment. RFI responses must include: . Name of the primary point of contract for the response . Academic faculty or business title . Institution or organization affiliation . Email Address . Phone Number . Identification of other key individuals who collaborated on   the RFI response . A brief summary (300 word limit) description of previous   relevant experience You may submit your interest via the internet, and solicit responses from interested parties.

The Center Ombudsman for this acquisition can be found at http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/pub/pub_library/Omb.html	    .	 Although all comments received will be carefully reviewed and considered for inclusion in any possible later action, the initiators of this request make no commitment to include any particular recommendations.  Respondents will not be notified of the results of the review. No solicitation exists, therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation.

<DESC>Description: The Corps of Engineers Louisville District is soliciting comments from the construction community addressing the potential use of Project Labor Agreements (PLAs) from large scale construction projects (exceeding $25 million) for the following project:  <br>  <br> Construction of a two-story elementary school composed of shallow foundations, and insulated concrete forms with brick veneers. Interior construction will consist of but not be limited to CMU for halls, classrooms, restrooms, mechanical rooms; suspended acoustic ceiling tile with appropriate energy efficient light fixtures such as florescent, pendant hung, and recessed; terrazzo flooring for entries, halls, restrooms; VCT for classrooms and offices; and SVT for food service areas. Interior spaces include a minimum of learning neighborhoods, a special education area for the moderate to severe program, flex labs, information center, gymnasium, auxiliary gymnasium, food service area, art room, music room, performance theater, commons area for dining and social networking, and other required areas for a fully functioning elementary school. Cafeteria, food service and information center areas were sized for the future ES School population. The project includes site work such as signage, fencing, paving, landscaping, canopies, exterior lighting, utilities, and playground areas. The project includes related infrastructure such as water, sewer, electrical, staff and visitor parking areas, mechanical rooms, emergency access lanes and delivery areas. <br>  <br>  <br> A PLA is defined as a pre-hire collective bargaining agreement with one or more labor organizations that establishes the terms and conditions of employment for a specific construction project and is an agreement described in 29 U.S.C. 158(f). Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Policy:  <br>  <br> (a) Project Labor Agreement (PLA) is a tool that agencies may use to promote economy and efficiency in Federal procurement. Pursuant to Executive Order 13502, agencies are encouraged to consider requiring the use of project labor agreements in connection with large-scale construction projects.  <br>  <br> (b) An agency may, if appropriate, require that every contractor and subcontractor engaged in construction on the project agree, for that project, to negotiate or become a party to a project labor agreement with one or more labor organizations if the agency decides that the use of project labor agreements will <br>  <br>  (1) Advance the Federal Governments interest in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement, producing labor-management stability, and ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other matters; and  <br> (2) Be consistent with law. <br>  <br> Reference: Provision: 52.222-33 Notice of Requirement for Project Labor Agreement Clause 52.222-34 Project Labor Agreement. <br>  <br> In consideration of the above factors, and any others which may be deemed appropriate, the construction community is invited to comment on the use of PLAs. Of particular interest to the Government are responses to the following questions: <br>  <br> a. Should PLAs be executed on selected large dollar contracts within the above referenced location by the Fort Worth District? What other factors should the Corps consider before deciding to include PLA provisions in a Fort Worth District contract? What type of project should or should not be considered for PLA? <br>  <br> b. Is the use of PLAs effective in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement? What is the estimated relative cost impact, or any other economies or efficiencies derived by the Federal Government, if using PLAs? Will a PLA impact the cost of submitting an offer? <br>  <br> c. Is the use of PLAs effective in producing labor-management stability?  Have labor disputes or other labor issues contributed to project delays in the local area? <br>  <br> d. Is the use of PLAs conducive to ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other relevant matters? Are there instances where these standards have not been met on Federal contracts in the local area?  Were PLAs used for those specific contracts? <br>  <br> e. Projects will require multiple construction contractors and/or subcontractors employing workers in multiple crafts or trades. Do you foresee any work on projects that may result in both the prime contractor and at least one subcontractor, or two or more subcontractors, employing the same trade? <br>  <br> f. Are there concerns by prime contractors on the availability of skilled construction labor? Information may reference current apprenticeship statistics and workforce age demographics. <br>  <br> g. Completion of anticipated projects will require an extensive performance periods. Will a PLA impact the completion time? What is the anticipated volatility in the labor market for the trades required for the execution of the project? Would a PLA benefit a project which contains a unique and compelling mission-critical schedule? <br>  <br> h. Where have PLAs been used on comparable projects undertaken by Federal, State, municipal, or private entities in the geographic area of this project? <br>  <br> i. Will the use of PLAs impact the ability of potential Offerors and subcontractors to meet small-business utilization goals? <br>  <br> Please provide your comments via e-mail to Christopher.t.brackett@usace.army.mil no later than by 1:00 PM EST on 17 January 2013. <br>

No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this synopsis or any follow up information requests.  Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation. <br>  <br> The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Memphis District has been tasked to solicit for and award Multiple Award Task Order Contract (MATOC) For Mississippi River Structures at Various Locations in the Memphis and Vicksburg Districts.  Proposed project will be a competitive, firm-fixed price, Multiple Award Task Order contract(s) procured in accordance with FAR 15, Negotiated Procurement using  quote mark Lowest Price, Technically Acceptable quote mark  process.  The type of set-aside decision(s) to be issued will depend upon the capabilities of the responses to this synopsis. <br>   <br> The purpose of this synopsis is to gain knowledge of interest, capabilities and qualifications of various members of industry, to include the Small Business Community: Small Business, Section 8(a), Historically Underutilized Business Zones (HUB-Zone), Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB). The Government must ensure there is adequate competition among the potential pool of responsible contractors.  Small business, Section 8(a), HUBZone, SDVOSB businesses are highly encouraged to participate. <br>  <br> The Government is seeking qualified, experienced sources capable of performing the construction of various types of stone navigation structures to include all types of dikes, chevrons, bendway weirs, hardpoints, and other river training structures in the Mississippi River between River Miles 954.0 to 320.0 AHP within the boundaries of the Memphis and Vicksburg Districts.  Additional work may include placement of stone fill and longitudinal peaked stone toe protection in specified areas such as dike fields, revetments, and other locations along top bank of the river and riprap bank paving to include bank clearing, grading and excavation. Individual Task Orders will be issued throughout the life of the contract designating the locations and types of work that will be performed.   <br>  <br>  <br> In accordance with FAR 36/DFARs 236, the estimated construction price range for this project is:  Over $500,000,000. <br>  <br> Estimated duration of the project will be determined per task order. <br>  <br> The required daily production rates will vary based on the size, scope, and complexity of the individual task orders issued as well as the method of stone placement.  Generally the production rates used to determine the various methods of stone placement will be approximately as follows: 8,000 tons per day for  quote mark drag-off quote mark  placement; 3,000 tons per day for  quote mark bailing quote mark  placement; and 1,000 tons per day for placement involving hauling stone with trucks.  Additionally, the average required daily production for bank paving placement will be approximately 2,000 tons per day.  The contract work is performed during variable river stages and additional equipment may be needed to meet the required production rates.  In addition, a sufficient number of towboats and supply barges will be required to meet daily production rates at any location between River Miles 954.0 to 320.0 AHP.   <br>  <br>  <br> The general types of equipment that will be required to complete the majority of stone placement work may include but are not limited to mechanical draglines mounted on floating plant similar to Bucyrus Erie 88B model, larger hydraulic excavators such as Caterpillar 385 or Liebherr 994 models, spud barges with adequate spud lengths for various placement depths, smaller hydraulic excavators for land-based work, off-road trucks, or other equipment as may be required for accomplishing the work.   <br>  <br> The contract period of performance is for a base and three (3) option years.

<DESC>PROJECT LABOR AGREEMENTS (PLAs), SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS W912ES-13-SS-0002
<p>St. Paul District Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the construction community addressing the potential use of Project Labor Agreements (PLAs) on large scale construction contracts (exceeding $25 million) for upcoming work on the Fargo-Moorhead Metropolitan Area Flood Risk Management Project. The overall Project description is as follows:</p>
<p>The Project consists of a Diversion Channel with Low Flow Channel, a Connecting Channel that diverts water from the Red and Wild Rice Rivers to the Diversion Channel, an upstream staging area for floodwaters, associated structures, non&#8208;structural features, recreation features and environmental mitigation. The Connecting Channel starts on the Red River approximately four miles south of the confluence of the Red and Wild Rice Rivers and extends west and north, crossing the Wild Rice River, to the Diversion inlet structure that is located just south of Horace. The Diversion Channel extends from its Inlet Structure, around the cities of Horace, Fargo, West Fargo and Harwood. It ultimately will re&#8208;enter the Red River north of the confluence of the Red and Sheyenne rivers near the city of Georgetown, MN. The 35&#8208;mile path of the Connecting Channel and Diversion Channel will cross the Wild Rice, Sheyenne, Maple, Lower Rush and Rush rivers. Two hydraulic structures will control the flows passing into the protected area during larger flood events; one on the Red River and the other on the Wild Rice River. The gated Diversion Inlet Structure is located at Cass County Highway 17 south of Horace, ND. At the Sheyenne and Maple rivers, aqueduct structures will allow base flows to follow the natural river channels to maintain habitat in the natural channels. The Lower Rush and Rush rivers will have drop structures that will drop the entire flow of those rivers into the Diversion Channel. The main line of flood risk management at the south end of the Project includes the embankments adjacent to the Diversion Channel and a tie&#8208;back embankment from the Red River control structure to high ground in Minnesota. In order to reduce downstream impacts, upstream water staging of approximately 200,000 acre&#8208;feet immediately upstream of the Diversion Channel inlet will be required. A wide variety of mitigation features are required to offset the impacts associated with construction and operation of the Project. Measures required for aquatic habitat and connectivity mitigation include stream restoration, riparian corridor restoration, a meandering Low&#8208;Flow Channel in the Diversion Channel and providing fish passage at the Diversion Outlet, control structures and several existing dams. Floodplain forest mitigation will be provided by reestablishing floodplain forest on 239 acres of floodplain agricultural land or pastured land. Wetland mitigation will be provided in the Diversion Channel by planting the bottom and fringe of the side slopes with native wetland species. The meandering Low&#8208;Flow Channel and attendant grade control structures will facilitate the development of wetland habitat in the Diversion Channel.</p>
<p>Construction of various features is expected to occur in a series over time and has not yet been authorized or funded by Congress. Construction reaches have not yet been fully defined. Approximately 13 of the reaches are expected to exceed $25,000,000 and may vary in estimated magnitude from approximately $25,000,000 to $75,000,000 and may include but would not be limited to excavation, small inlets, levee construction, channel construction, structure work, and aqueducts, or any combination thereof. The Corps will not be accepting questions regarding construction of the Fargo-Moorhead Metropolitan Area Flood Risk Management Project at this time. Previously published information regarding the Project can be found at http://www.internationalwaterinstitute.org/ and http://www.fmDiversion.com/ . U.S. Army Corps of Engineers construction solicitations are posted to www.fbo.gov.</p>
<p>A PLA is defined as a pre-hire collective bargaining agreement with one or more labor organizations that establishes the terms and conditions of employment for a specific construction Project and is an agreement described in 29 U.S.C. 158(f). Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Policy:</p>
<p>(a) Project Labor Agreement (PLA) is a tool that agencies may use to promote economy and efficiency in Federal procurement. Pursuant to Executive Order 13502, agencies are encouraged to consider requiring the use of Project labor agreements in connection with large-scale construction Projects.</p>
<p>(b) An agency may, if appropriate, require that every contractor and subcontractor engaged in construction on the Project agree, for that Project, to negotiate or become a party to a Project labor agreement with one or more labor organizations if the agency decides that the use of Project labor agreements will</p>
<p>(1) Advance the Federal Governments interest in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement, producing labor-management stability, and ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other matters; and <br />(2) Be consistent with law.</p>
<p>Reference: Provision: 52.222-33 Notice of Requirement for Project Labor Agreement Clause 52.222-34 Project Labor Agreement.</p>
<p>In consideration of the above factors, and any others which may be deemed appropriate, the construction community is invited to comment on the use of PLAs. Of particular interest to the Government are responses to the following questions:</p>
<p>1. Describe the degree to which the Fargo-Moorhead area construction labor force is represented by unions.</p>
<p>2. Is there currently a shortage of skilled construction labor in the area? Is a labor shortage projected?</p>
<p>3. What investments have been made in the area to support registered apprenticeship programs?</p>
<p>4. Have PLAs been used on other construction projects undertaken by public or private entities in the region? Please explain.</p>
<p>5. Describe the degree to which labor disputes or other labor issues have contributed to project delays in the local area.</p>
<p>6. The contract performance periods for the various construction reaches are anticipated to last between one and four years. Are relevant Collective Bargaining Agreements likely to expire during the course of the Project under consideration?</p>
<p>7. How do open shop and union wage rates influence prevailing wage rates in the local market and compare to the Davis Bacon rates?</p>
<p>8. Describe whether a PLA might contribute to cost savings in any of the following ways:</p>
<p>&bull; Harmonization of shifts and holidays between the trades to cut labor costs<br />&bull; Minimizing disruptions that may arise due to expiration of a CBA<br />&bull; Availability of trained, registered apprentices, efficient for highly skilled workforce<br />&bull; Serving as a management tool that ensures highly skilled workers from multiple trades are coordinated in the most efficient way<br />&bull; Other</p>
<p>9. Describe whether a PLA might minimize risk and contribute to greater efficiency in any of the following ways?</p>
<p>&bull; Mechanisms to avoid delays<br />&bull; Complying with Davis Bacon and other labor standards, safety rules and EEO and OFCCP laws<br />&bull; Ensuring a steady supply of skilled labor in markets with low supply or high competition for workers<br />&bull; Other</p>
<p>10. Are there ways in which a PLA might increase costs on this particular Project?</p>
<p>11. Based on consideration of the factors above, please provide a short summary explaining why you would recommend or would not recommend the use of a PLA for this Project.</p>
<p>A questionnaire containing the above questions has been provided with this announcement for your convenience. Please use the questionnaire to supply your feedback via e-mail attachment, citing "PLA COMMENTS" in the subject line, to Patricia Simon, Contract Specialist, at patricia.m.simon@usace.army.mil no later than 22 January 2013.</p>

<a href="mailto:Ty.Senour@va.gov">Contract Specialist</a>
<DESC>Technology Acquisition Center (TAC)-Austin is seeking information concerning the availability of capable contractors to provide software, maintenance, and technical support for the VA Fee Basis Claims System (FBCS).  FBCS is in use within 134 VA Fee offices.  FBCS allows Fee Claims processing departments to manage and process Fee claims in an electronic environment, which improves the ability to keep track of claims in process and to identify duplicate and non-compliant claims. In addition, this product improves the ability to report on Fee expenditures and improves accuracy and consistency of Fee authorizations. FBCS provides the ability to monitor individual and department productivity. It allows VA to communicate efficiently with the vendors and veterans about the adjudication status of their claims by providing a complete audit trail for each claim.

The existing VA FBCS is provided by Document Storage Systems, Inc.  VA is seeking sources capable of renewing the existing annual licenses OR implementing, training, testing, and deploying a software system with identical capabilities of the existing software system by October 1, 2013 in a way that is economically feasible to VA.  The objective of this procurement will be to procure the FBCS or equivalent solution for VHA sites that are currently using claims processing software.  This is a continuation of production of a major system.  This procurement will be an interim solution until the planned, centralized VA-wide long term solution begins deployment in 2014 and is fully implemented by 2017.  If proposing a competitive software capability, the contractor must demonstrate that its proposed system would not result in substantial duplication of system upstart costs, including, training, testing, installation, and deployment, which would not be recovered.  

This Request for Information (RFI) is issued for informational and planning purposes only. This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP). It is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract. Responses will not be considered as proposals, nor will any award be made as a result of this RFI. VA will NOT be responsible for any costs incurred by interested parties in responding to this RFI. Contact with Government personnel other than those specified in this RFI by potential offerors or their employees' regarding this project is prohibited. This is an announcement seeking market information on vendors capable of providing the services as described herein. TAC-Austin is currently conducting market research to locate interested potential sources. The information requested by this RFI will be used within the VA to facilitate decision-making and will not be disclosed outside the agency. Should a future requirement(s) evolve from this preliminary planning process, it is anticipated the period of performance will be for 5 years.

If interested, please provide a capabilities statement (max 20 pages) by Wednesday, Jan 23, 2013.  If additional information is required by VA to determine a contractor's capability to provide the full requirement and the economic feasibility of the information provided, additional information, to include a possible vendor demonstration, may be requested later.  Do not provide any proprietary information, as any contractor questions and corresponding Government answers will be made available to all interested parties.  Please note questions may not be directly answered at this time, but may be addressed in any future correspondence.  A draft version of the required tasks and deliverables is below. These tasks and deliverables are based on a renewal of the current software provided by DSS.  Any proposed new software must meet all of the capabilities of the existing software.   The contract for the current software expires on September 30, 2013, so new software must be deployed on October 1, 2013 to avoid any break in service.  In addition to describing the capability of meeting the requirement by October 1, 2013, the capabilities statement should provide the following information.

1. Please provide no more than five (5) contracts that your company has performed within the last three (3) years that are of comparable size, complexity, and scope to this requirement.

<DESC>Description:
<p>The Intelligence, Program Development and Integration Directorate (XZ) intends to solicit white papers/proposals for concepts that address modernization or replacement of the ground based leg of the nuclear triad. For purposes of this BAA, "concept" is defined as a prospective system materiel solution addressing identified and validated gaps or shortfalls based on conditions in which a future system will need to operate. These gaps and shortfalls were identified during the Ground Based Strategic Deterrence (GBSD) capabilities-based assessment (CBA) and validated in the Initial Capabilities Document. Each concept should provide adequate technical, schedule and cost information to allow feasibility analysis of the concept.</p>
<p>This BAA initiates a request for analysis, refinement, and technical amplification of concepts designed to satisfy the GBSD capabilities with an operational life of 2025-2075 timeframe. The USAF is seeking a range of materiel solution concepts including: incremental modernization of Minuteman III weapon system to address capability gaps; a new ballistic missile system (either silo-based or in alternative basing); and advanced concepts other than the traditional booster and reentry vehicle. Concepts are requested to address the GBSD weapon system-of-systems, to include the payload delivery vehicle, warhead integration, basing, and nuclear command, control and communications starting at message receipt. Underlying considerations should be a modular, open systems architecture ("Plug and Play") and commonality with ICBMs, submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBM), Prompt Global Strike/Conventional Strike Missile, and space launch vehicles.</p>
<p>Background:</p>
<p>In November, 2011, AFNWC issued a request for information (RFI) to industry to solicit inputs to close the gaps. Inputs were requested in six mission focus areas: propulsion, guidance, basing, nuclear command control and communications (NC3), warhead and re-entry vehicle (RV) and "Plug and Play" Technology. Responses were received in March 2012, and AFNWC personnel visited responding industry offices in May and June 2012 to obtain further information on the responses. Based on the responses and subject matter expert (SME) input, AFNWC created five concept characterization and technical descriptions (CCTD): continued use of the current baseline until 2075 with no deliberate attempt to close identified gaps; a Current Fixed that incorporates incremental changes to the current baseline to close the gaps; and three new concepts. These new CCTDs are: new fixed basing, mobile, and a tunnel based concept. All five concepts will be evaluated as part of the Material Development Decision (MDD) and those judged adequate will be included in the analysis of alternatives (AoA) study. AFNWC will not award contracts for concepts not approved at the MDD.</p>
<p>Instructions for Submission:</p>
<p>This Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) will remain open through 31 December 2013, or until amended or superseded. It may be reissued and/or amended periodically, as needed. White papers/ Proposals may be requested at any time during the open period by the appropriate point of contacts (POCs) identified in this BAA. However, prior to submitting a proposal, offerors are required to submit a white paper on their proposed concepts to the technical POC. The purpose of the white paper is to preclude unwarranted effort on the part of an offeror whose proposed work is not of current interest under this BAA. Those offerors submitting white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may subsequently be invited to submit a proposal. If invited by the Government, the proposal shall be in accordance with the instructions in Part II. Such invitation does not assure that a contract will be awarded. See attached BAA for complete instructions.</p>

The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) intends to negotiate a one-time sole source contract with Applied Biosystems, 850 Lincoln Centre Drive, Foster City, CA 94404. The Government intends to negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.
<p>This notice will be distributed solely through the General Services Administration's Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) Website (www.fedbizopps.gov).

The North American Classification System Code is 334516, Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing; the size standard is 750 employees.</p>
<p>The FBI has received large numbers of samples for DNA analysis. After the extraction process, it is necessary to quantify the total amount of amplifiable human DNA that is present in the sample before it is possible to proceed with genotyping. A system is needed for this process. The system must validated for use with Quantifiler<sup>TM</sup> kits, uses Quantifiler<sup>TM</sup> kits to determine amount of amplifiable human DNA present in a sample, produces Quantifiler<sup>TM</sup> kit results in less than 2 hours, includes computer workstation and monitor, includes data collection software for instrument control, data collection, and autoanalysis of sample files, real-time PCR capability using TaqMan&reg; technology, able to provide an indicator of the potential presence of PCR inhibitors, and Assays developed and validated in accordance with SGWDAM Guidelines.</p>
<p>Applied Biosystems is the sole provider of the 7500 Real-time PCR System. The 7500 Real-time PRC System meets all the specifications/technical requirements of the FBI. The Applied Biosystems 7500 Real-time PCR System has been validated by the FBI for use with Quantifiler Human DNA quantitation kit that the FBI will be using. Using any other system would require one to two years validation, delaying the FBI ability to begin processing evidence.<br /><br />Based on market research conducted and contacts made with knowledgeable individuals within the government and related industry, it has been determined the FBI's requirement for the 7500 Real-time PCR System can only be provided by Applied Biosystems, as no other vendor is capable of providing the required System with the validation needed that meets all the technical requirements to support the mission of the FBI.</p>

<CONTACT>
<DESC>The Naval Facilities Engineering Command, Northwest is in the process of awarding a Sole Source, Firm Fixed-Price (FFP) modification to Contract N44255-12-C-3003.  The contract was solicited under full and open competition as a Small Business Set Aside and was awarded to the highest technically rated, lowest priced offeror, USA Environmental, Inc.  on July 12, 2012 to provide munitions clearance to Remedial Action Areas (RAA) RAA-02, RAA-03, and RAA-04 in Operable Unit B-2 (OU B-2)at the Former Naval Complex, Adak, Alaska. This modification is to provide the same munitions clearance services for RAA-01 and RAA-05 concurrent with RAA-02, RAA-03 and RAA-04 as required under the base contract.  RAA-01 and RAA-05 are co-located to the other RAAs within the OU B-2 boundary making it a safety concern to have more than one contractor performing munitions clearance in the area at the same time.
  Transportation of all tools, material, equipment and supplies to Adak is also part of this requirement as well as updates to the work plans.  This sole source requirement is pursuant to FAR 6.302-1. This Notice of Intent is not a request for Expressions of Interest (EOIs), competitive proposals or proposals.  The Justification and Approval will be posted within 14 days of modification award. Point of contact for this notice is Ms. Kimberly Gillette at kimberly.gillette@navy.mil.

<DESC>The VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System intends to negotiate on a Sole Source basis with 
DIRTT Environmental Solutions, Inc., 155 Knowlton Way, Savannah, GA 31407-3036, to purchase their Modular Walls, for the following reasons: 

"	DIRTT's horizontal reveal called "the antler" means that their wall will support any furniture now or in the future, at any point along the horizontal, with no additional blocking required.  Each frame can support 700lbs per side, 1400lbs total.  Flat screen TVs, worksurfaces, overheads, custom millwork, artwork, etc...from any manufacturer can be accommodated.  This feature was one of the reasons DIRTT was awarded GSA's Excellence in Partnership Award: Industry Green Contractor.  This will allow all future component purchases to easily attach to the wall without the need to replace hardware or support for the item.  This will save budget funds and allow maximum reuse.
"	DIRTT's wall offers the unique additional benefit of addressing various ceiling heights and aesthetics with it's removable skin and stack-on frame.  This allows the stocking of "generic" wall panel frames in a standard height.  A stack-on unit can then be added, along with the appropriate skin finish options to meet the needs of specific locations.  
"	DIRTT walls are 99% reusable and 96% recyclable at end-of-life, depending on finishes chosen.
o	As Per the VA GEMS program - this holds great value.
"	DIRTT modular wall product provides the ability to use the same modular wall product in the administrative areas as in clinical and patient care areas.  The DIRTT product offers the ability to order and/or to add to existing product medical gas lines, plumbing and to provide face tiles that have infection prevention options for gaskets, solid surface and fully encapsulated tiles.  Additionally, the integration of imbedded technology including racking, fans, integrated screens into the standard modular wall product is unique to DIRTT.
"	DIRTT's parametric design permits manufacturing of unlimited width and heights to meet any specific condition that the VA building may require.
"	DIRTT has the fastest lead time in the industry:  3-5 weeks from placing the order to delivery onsite.  This will ensure our project stays on schedule, and if supplemental product is required in the future, we are not incurring long delays which could impact the functionality of the space.

It is also essential to purchase the DIRTT Environmental Solutions, Inc. Modular Walls, since the VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System, has multiple installations of DIRTT modular walls, at both Heinz and University Drive, thus is an extension of an informal standards program, further increasing and allowing for the flexibility and reuse of  existing DIRTT modular wall product.

In addition, it is essential to purchase the above DIRTT Environmental Solutions Modular Walls, from DIRTT Environmental Solutions, Inc./Workscape, Inc., since they are the sole exclusive seller of the DIRTT Environmental Solutions, Inc.  Modular Walls. It is also essential to have DIRTT Environmental Solutions, Inc., use their authorized dealer Wokscape, Inc. to install these items, since they are the Sole Exclusive Installer of the DIRTT Environmental Modular Walls in the Pittsburgh, PA area, and since this requirement represents the minimum need of the government and requires a turnkey job.

<p>(e) Multiple offers. If more than one solution to the services is available, Offeror may submit multiple offers for consideration, subject to same page limitations. Multiple offers may not be considered if they alter the Government's requirement. Should the Offeror claim exceptions to any requirement in the solicitation, these exceptions shall be listed and rationale provided. Failure to include exceptions will be deemed as acceptance of all terms and conditions of the solicitation and resulting contract.</p>
<p>(h) Multiple awards. This award shall be made on an all or none basis.<br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-1)</p>
<p>(ix) Provision 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition along with the following addenda to the provision.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum:<br />Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection in which competing Offerors' past performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent Local Exchange Carrier (LEC) or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. Award will be made to the responsible Offeror proposing the combination most advantageous to the Government based upon an integrated assessment of the evaluation factors described below. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:</p>
<p>(a) FACTOR 1 - TECHNICAL. The Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of acceptable or unacceptable. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following technical subfactors:<br /><br />Subfactor 1 - Provider Capability. This factor is met when the Offeror provides evidence they are a telecommunications company having the capability to provide Basic Rate Interfaces (BRI), Commercial Subscriber Lines (CSL), and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>(b) FACTOR 2 -- PRICE. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent LEC or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) FACTOR 3 -- PAST PERFORMANCE. In evaluating PPI, the government will employ several approaches including: reviewing contract references provided by the offeror; seeking PPI through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. Only recent (within the last three years) and relevant PPI (similar or greater in scope, magnitude of effort, and complexity than effort described in this solicitation) will be evaluated. When reviewing PPI, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform the services described in this solicitation. The performance confidence assessment will result in an overall performance confidence rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B) Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).</p>
<p>The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower. If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer. <br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-2)</p>

<DESC>When making sense of intelligence data, analysts rely on rich repertoires of conceptual knowledge to resolve ambiguities, make inferences, and draw conclusions. Conceptual knowledge refers to knowledge about the properties of an entity (e.g., an apple is edible) as well as its relationships to other entities (e.g., an apple is associated with orchards, grocery stores, etc.). Understanding how the human brain represents conceptual knowledge is a step toward building new analysis tools that acquire, organize and wield knowledge with unprecedented proficiency. Moreover, such understanding may lead to the development of novel techniques for training intelligence analysts and linguists. <br />
<p>Although decades of neuroscience research have shed light on how the brain represents various types of sensory and motor information, far less is known about the neural basis of conceptual knowledge. Studies to date have focused on a limited number of coarsely defined concept classes (e.g., faces and places), but a general predictive theory of the neural basis of conceptual knowledge remains elusive.</p>
<p><br />The KRNS Program seeks to develop and rigorously assess novel theories that explain how the human brain represents diverse types of conceptual knowledge within spatial and temporal (dynamic) patterns of neural activity. To demonstrate the power of their theories, KRNS performers will develop systems that aim to predict patterns of neural activity associated with particular concepts and that can interpret which concepts are represented within measured patterns of neural activity. All neural activity data in KRNS will be obtained using non-invasive methods such as (but not limited to) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and magnetoencephalography (MEG).</p>
<p><br />The KRNS Program consists of two phases. Phase 1 seeks to understand how the brain's representation of an individual concept varies as a function of semantic context (e.g., how does the neural representation of "apple" differ depending on whether the subject is contemplating "the apple was delicious" versus "the boy threw the apple"?). Phase 2 will explore how combinations of multiple individual concepts are represented in the brain (e.g., how is the neural representation of a composite concept such as "the doctor drove the car" related to the neural representation of the individual concepts, "doctor," "drove," "car"?).</p>

In addition, the following NAVSUP FLCN clauses apply;

5252.204-9400 CONTRACTOR ACCESS TO FEDERALLY CONTROLLED FACILITIES AND/OR UNCLASSIFIED SENSITIVE INFORMATION OR UNCLASSIFIED IT SYSTEMS (May 2010)

Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD)-12, requires government agencies to develop and implement Federal security standards for Federal employees and contractors.
  The Deputy Secretary of Defense Directive-Type Memorandum (DTM) 08-006  DoD Implementation of Homeland Security Presidential Directive  12 (HSPD-12) dated November 26, 2008 (or its subsequent DoD instruction) directs implementation of HSPD-12.  This clause is in accordance with HSPD-12 and its implementing directives.  This clause applies to contractor employees requiring physical access to any area of a federally controlled base, facility or activity and/or requiring access to a DoD computer/network, to perform certain unclassified both non-sensitive and sensitive duties.  It is the responsibility of the command/facility where the work is performed to ensure compliance.  
  
The requirement to control access to sensitive information applies to all US government IT systems and/or areas where unclassified but sensitive information may be discussed, displayed or maintained.
  DON policy prescribes that all unclassified data that has not been approved for public release and is stored on mobile computing devises must be treated as sensitive data and encrypted using commercially available encryption technology. Whenever granted access to sensitive information, contractor employees shall follow applicable DoD/DoN instructions, regulations, policies and procedures when reviewing, processing, producing, protecting, destroying and/or storing that information.  Operational Security (OPSEC) procedures and practices must be implemented by both the contractor and contract employee to protect the product, information, services, operations and missions related to the contract.
 The contractor shall designate an employee to serve as the Contractors Security Representative.  Within three work days after contract award, the contractor shall provide to the Navy Commands Security Manager and the Contracting Officer, in writing, the name, title, address and phone number for the Contractors Security Representative.  The Contractors Security Representative shall be the primary point of contact on any security matter.  The Contractors Security Representative shall not be replaced or removed without prior notice to the Contracting Officer.  

Non-Sensitive Positions
Contractor employee whose work is unclassified and non-sensitive (e.g., performing certain duties such as lawn maintenance, vendor services, etc ...) and who require physical access to publicly accessible areas to perform those duties shall meet the following minimum requirements: 

Must be either a US citizen or a US permanent resident with a minimum of 3 years legal residency in the US (as required by The Deputy Secretary of Defense DTM 08-006 or its subsequent DoD instruction) and 
Must have a favorably completed National Agency Check with Written Inquiries (NACI) including a Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) fingerprint check prior to installation access.
  

To be considered for a favorable trustworthiness determination, the Contractors Security Representative must submit for all employees each of the following: 

* SF-85 Questionnaire for Non-Sensitive Positions
* Two FD-258 Applicant Fingerprint Cards
* Original Signed Release Statements

The contractor shall ensure each individual employee has a current favorably completed NACI.  

The Contractors Security Representative shall be responsible for initiating reinvestigations as required.  Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individuals start date shall result in delaying the individuals start date.  
 
Sensitive Positions 
Contractor employee whose duties require accessing a DoD unclassified computer/network, working with sensitive unclassified information (either at a Government or contractor facility), or physical access to a DoD facility must be a US citizen and possess a favorable trustworthiness determination prior to installation access.
  To obtain a favorable trustworthiness determination, each contractor employee must have a favorably completed National Agency Check with Local Credit Checks (NACLC) which consists of a NACI including a FBI fingerprint check plus credit and law enforcement checks. Each contractor employee applying for a trustworthiness determination is required to complete:

* SF-85P Questionnaire for Public Trust Positions
* Two FD-258 Applicant Fingerprint Cards
* Original Signed Release Statements 

Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individuals start date shall result in delaying the individuals start date.  To maintain continuing authorization for an employee to access a DoD unclassified computer/network, and/or have access to sensitive unclassified information, the contractor shall ensure that the individual employee has a current requisite background investigation.
  The Contractors Security Representative shall be responsible for initiating reinvestigations as required and ensuring that background investigations remain current (not older than 10 years) throughout the contract performance period.

IT Systems Access
When access to IT systems is required for performance of the contractor employees duties, such employees shall in-process with the Navy Commands Security Manager and Information Assurance Manager upon arrival to the Navy command and shall out-process prior to their departure at the completion of the individuals performance under the contract.  Completion and approval of a System Authorization Access Request Navy (SAAR-N) form is required for all individuals accessing Navy Information Technology resources.
  The SAAR-N shall be forwarded to the Navy Commands Security Manager at least 30 days prior to the individuals start date.  Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individuals start date shall result in delaying the individuals start date. 
     
When required to maintain access to required IT systems or networks, the contractor shall ensure that all employees requiring access complete annual Information Assurance (IA) training, and maintain a current requisite background investigation.  The Contractors Security Representative shall contact the Command Security Manager for guidance when reinvestigations are required.  


Security Approval Process
The Contractors Security Representative shall ensure that each individual employee pending assignment shall accurately complete the required forms for submission to the Navy Commands Security Manager.
  The Contractors Security Representative shall screen the investigative questionnaires for completeness and accuracy and for potential suitability/security issues prior to submitting the request to the Navy Commands Security Manager.  Forms and fingerprint cards may be obtained from the Navy Commands Security Manager.  These required items, shall be forwarded to the Navy Command's Security Manager for processing at least 30 days prior to the individual employees anticipated date for reporting for duty.  The Navy Commands Security Manager will review the submitted documentation for completeness prior to submitting it to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM).  Suitability/security issues identified by the Navy Commands Security Manager may render the contract employee ineligible for the assignment.
  A favorable review of the questionnaire and advance fingerprint results are required as an interim measure prior to the contract employee start date.  An unfavorable determination made by the Navy Commands Security Manager is final and such a determination does not relieve the contractor from meeting any contractual obligation under the contract.

If contractor employees already possess a current favorably adjudicated investigation, the Navy Commands Security Manager will use the Visit Authorization Request (VAR) via the Joint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS).  The contractor shall include the IT Position Category per SECNAV M-5510.30 for each employee designated on a VAR.  The VAR requires annual renewal for the duration of the employees performance under the contract.
 

The Navy Commands Security Manager will forward the required forms to OPM for processing.  Once the investigation is complete, the results will be forwarded by OPM to the DON Central Adjudication Facility (CAF) for a position of trust determination.  When a favorable determination is not made, contractor employees shall not be permitted to work on this contract effort and if already working on the contract shall be removed immediately.  

The potential consequences of any requirements under this clause including denial of access for a proposed contractor employee who fails to obtain a favorable trustworthiness determination in no way relieves the contractor from the requirement to execute performance under the contract within the timeframes specified in the contract.
  Contractors shall plan ahead in processing their employees and subcontractor employees for working in non-sensitive positions, with sensitive information, and/or on Government IT systems.  The contractor shall insert this clause in all subcontracts when the subcontractor is permitted to have physical access to a federally controlled facility and/or access to a federally-controlled information system/network and/or access to government information.

(End of Clause)

5252.243-9400  Authorized Changes Only by the Contracting Officer (JAN 1992)
(a) Except as specified in paragraph (b) below, no order, statement, or conduct of Government personnel who visit the Contractor's facilities or in any other manner communicate with Contractor personnel during the performance of this contract shall constitute a change under the "Changes" clause of this contract.
(b) The Contractor shall not comply with any order, direction or request of Government personnel unless it is issued in writing and signed by the Contracting Officer, or is pursuant to specific authority otherwise included as a part of this contract.
(c) The Contracting Officer is the only person authorized to approve changes in any of the requirements of this contract and notwithstanding provisions contained elsewhere in this contract, the said authority remains solely with the Contracting Officer.
 In the event the Contractor effects any change at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract price to cover any increase in charges incurred as a result thereof. The address and telephone number of the Contracting Officer is:

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.369</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) ( ) Are, ( ) are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) ( ) Are, ( ) are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p><br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.</p>

The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:<br />1. Past performance<br />The technical evaluation factors other than price, when combined, are approximately equal to price. Price will not be a numerically weighted factor in the evaluation of proposals. If the two or more highest rated technical proposals are considered to be essentially equal in terms of technical competence, price may become the determinative factor in making an award. <br />Ratings: All technical factors will be rated using an adjectival approach uitilizing the following adjectival ratings: Excellent, Good, Satisfactory, Marginal or Unsatisfactory. An Unsatisfactory proposal will not be considered for award. <br />2. PRICE <br />(a) Award, if made, will be made to the responsible offeror whose proposal, conforming to the solicitation, is determined to be the best value to the Government, technical, performance risk, price and other factors considered. In selecting the best overall offer, the Government will consider the value of each offer in terms of the evaluated technical quality offered for the price. The relative quality of offerors will be based upon their ability to meet or exceed the minimum performance requirements of this solicitation resulting in less risk of nonperformance, defective performance, and late performance under the resulting <br />Contract. The quality in technical offers will be compared with differences in the overall price to the Government.<br />(b) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<br />(c) The Government reserves the right to award a contract on the basis of evaluation of the original submission without discussions or call for Final Proposal/Quote Revisions.</p>

<p>8.  STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) was created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID to help local partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries.  Seizing critical windows of opportunity, OTI works on the ground to provide fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief.  Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition.  OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations.  OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high-level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs).  These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the organization's programmatic goals and objectives.  USPSCs are considered employees of USAID for all purposes except programs administered by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) - such as federally sponsored health insurance, life insurance, and retirement benefits.  However, there are several other similar benefits that USPSCs may participate in, such as partial reimbursement for health and life insurance costs, as well as full coverage of workers' compensation, among other benefits.  For more complete information on USPSC benefits, please see page 15 of this solicitation.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: <br />http://www.usaid.gov/what-we-do/working-crises-and-conflict/promoting-peaceful-political-transitions</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The Deputy Country Representative is a member of the Bureau of Democracy, Conflict and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA)/OTI Afghanistan/Pakistan (Af/Pak) Regional Team, reports to the OTI Country Representative, and is based in Islamabad, Pakistan.</p>
<p>The Deputy Country Representative's principal responsibility is to support the OTI Country Representative in the development, oversight, and management of the OTI country program.</p>
<p>In November 2007, USAID/OTI launched a program in Pakistan's Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) that expanded in September 2009 into priority areas of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (KP). The USAID/OTI program is an initial step in support of the Government of Pakistan's (GOP) renewed efforts to better deliver services to communities. The GOP is focusing efforts to bring security and development to FATA in particular, demonstrating a renewed commitment toward the region by enhancing the role of the FATA Secretariat (FS) and attracting investment to the area through the FATA Development Authority.</p>
<p>The Pakistan Transition Initiative (PTI) program supports the GOP's development efforts to better integrate FATA/KP into the political and economic mainstream of Pakistan.  PTI also supports the GOP in identifying community priorities and addressing some of the region's most immediate needs, which requires close coordination with ongoing USAID, State Department, and Department of Defense activities in the region.</p>
<p><br />OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>The objective of this position is to ensure that OTI has a highly-qualified Deputy Country Representative in the field that will represent OTI and fulfill the duties and responsibilities of the position.</p>
<p>9.  CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>

S/he places a premium on the building positive relationships with his/her respective team, with the rest of OTI and with key stakeholders both in and outside of USAID. The Deputy Country Representative is a team player, able to prioritize and follow up on their own actions without prompting, while also assisting a busy supervisor and fellow colleagues to track and respond to incoming requests and routine tasks, filling in gaps as needed to ensure the responsiveness of the team.

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<a href="mailto:alison.landin@us.army.mil">ACC-APG - Washington</a>
<DESC>The U.S. Army Product Manager for Countermine and Explosive Ordnance Disposal (PM-CM&EOD) is seeking a qualified source to provide a Deep Buried Detection (DBD) capability for the Husky Mounted Detection System (HMDS) acquisition program.  The Army requires this capability to support Army route clearance and area detection operations by detecting surface laid and buried explosive threats, including Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) with pressure activated trigger mechanisms, unexploded ordnance (UXO), landmines, and weapons caches.   <br>     <br>  The DBD capability is required to detect deep buried metallic Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) and metallic encased caches.  The probability of detection is required to be not less than 85% of metallic IEDs and not less than 85% of metallic encased caches buried down to 48 inches (1.2 meters) of soil overburden.  The False Alarm Rate is required to be 10 or fewer false alarms per linear kilometer of road scanned and 10 or fewer false alarms per 3,500 square meters of area scanned for cache detection.   <br>    <br>  The DBD capability is required to be installed on the front of the Husky vehicle, and be radio-frequency (RF) interoperable/compatible with the HMDS Program of Record ground penetrating radar (GPR), which is anticipated to be the NIITEK GEN II Enhanced HMDS currently fielded to Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF).  The DBD capability is required to scan a path width of at least 3.2 meters.  While seated inside the Husky, the operator must be able to raise and lower the DBD sensor to avoid impacting the road surface, to configure the DBD sensor for fording, and to move the DBD sensor to a secure position on the Husky for rapid administrative movement.  The DBD capability is also required to be interoperable with Blue force electronic warfare devices, and should not degrade the performance of the GPR. The DBD and GPR capabilities are not required to operate simultaneously, but simultaneous operation and fused detection capability (which minimizes operator workload) is desirable.  Future efforts may include the remote operation of the DBD capability on the Husky.    <br>    <br>  Please note this is NOT a Request for Proposal.  Offerors shall be responsible for any costs associated with preparing responses to this market research. Interested Offerors are requested to submit a White Paper that describes the Offeror's specific technologies and devices which meet the required capabilities described above. Offerors should detail their previous knowledge and experience demonstrating the performance of an integrated DBD and GPR in their white papers.  The White Papers should also discuss the Offeror's development and production capabilities.  Details and unclassified results of detection testing conducted to date, to include detection performance tradeoffs of DBD and GPR performance within proximity of each other, environmental testing, etc, should be included.  Company experience, personnel, facilities (R&D and production), and other relevant capabilities should also be identified.  The White Paper shall be no more than 15 pages and be prepared in Microsoft Word, Times New Roman font, size 12.   <br>    <br>  Responses should also include a cover letter (not included in the page count) providing:  <br>  1.  A point of contact for your Company which will include: the contact's name, address, website (if available), phone number, and email address.  In addition, please provide a Cage Code and Duns Number.   <br>  2.  Is your company currently providing similar products to another government agency or other non-government customer?  If so, please identify the agency or non-government customer.  If you are unwilling to share your customer's identity, please address whether your company offers the same or similar products commercially (outside the federal Government.)  <br>  a.  If you elect to identify your past and current customers to which you provided similar products, include the customers/company name and point of contact, phone number and address/e-mail where they can be contacted.  <br>  3.  Please identify your company's small business size standard based on the applicable NAICS code of 334511.  The Small Business Size Standard for this NAICS code is 750 employees.

<DESC>U. S. Forest Service located on the Savannah River Site has a requirement for the application of herbicide on approxximately 325 arcres.&nbsp; The Savannah River Site is located 10 miles east of Aiken, SC.&nbsp; The Savanah River Site is a restricted area.&nbsp; All Contractor personnel must receive a Site Access Photo Badge and wear it at all times while on the Savannah River Site. U.S. citizens must complete a Personnel Data sheet and submit it to the Forest Service at least 10 days in advance to allow time to approve it and schedule General Employee Training. The applicants must be capable of satisfactorily completing a training session (General Employee Training) followed by a test. U.S. citizens will need at least two forms of approved identification, such as a state driver's license and social security card, to receive the badge. The Contractor will provide transportation contingencies for any personnel that fail the test or do not possess sufficient proof of identification and who therefore will not be allowed on to the site. Foreign nationals may work on-Site (with exception of pilots); however the required badge materials must be submitted at least three weeks in advance if from non-sensitive countries. Individuals must have valid passport, visa or green card, and I-9 form, and must provide sufficient information for the Forest Service to prepare a security plan. Depending upon the security plan, a U.S. citizen may be required to function as an escort. The latter person must be provided by the Contractor and must be photo badged and take a brief on-line escort training class.<br /><br />The Solicitation should be posted to this site on or about 7 January 2013.&nbsp; A site visit will be held, date and time will be addressed in the solicitation.

<DESC><p style="text-align: center;"><br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Questions and Answers<br /></span></strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br /><em><strong>Question 1:</strong></em></span> Apart from NRO, are SSAE 16 or equivalent reports received from service providers to provide confidence over the operating effectiveness of controls?</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong>Answer 1:</strong></em></span> Please see the Classified ARC for the response to this question.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br /><em><strong>Question 2:</strong></em></span> The Government is requesting a 10 page executive summary. How will this section be evaluated and scored? Or does the Government intend to provide the executive summary to each review team as background information to assist them in understanding the proposal?</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong>Answer 2:</strong></em></span> The Executive Summary will not have its own evaluation factor. It will be provided to each evaluator to provide background and company information that may be considered in the evaluation of the factors as applicable. It is important to note that although information in the Executive Summary MAY BE considered in the evaluation of the factors, Offerors shall ensure that all information that they wish to be considered in the evaluation of a particular factor be included in that factor's volume.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br /><em><strong>Question 3:</strong></em></span> The draft RFP references an NDA to be signed by contractor personnel. Can the Government confirm that this will be a POST-AWARD requirement?</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong>Answer 3:</strong></em></span> Yes, this is a Post- Award requirement that MUST be completed before the Contractor's Employees are able to begin work on the contract.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br /><em><strong>Question 4:</strong></em></span> The initial period of performance begins at contract award and ends January 14, 2014. When do you anticipate awarding the contract?</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong>Answer 4:</strong></em></span> The Government does not know the anticipated award date at this time.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br /><em><strong>Question 5:</strong></em></span> Can offerors submit proposals to complete the work on just one (either FSA or FISMA) of the tasks detailed in the SOW? <br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong>Answer 5:</strong></em></span> The proposal that will offer the best value to the Government will contain a comprehensive approach on completing ALL (both FSA and FISMA) of the tasks as detailed in the requirement. The offeror's proposal may contain a teaming approach (subcontracting) if they so choose. However, it is important to note that only one contract will be awarded for this effort to one Prime contractor submitting the proposal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><br /><br />*******************************************************************<br /><br /><br /><strong>INTRODUCTION </strong></p>
<p>This Request for Information (RFI) lists the National Geospatial - Intelligence Agency's (NGA) requirements for Financial Statement Audit and Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) evaluation services&nbsp;in conjunction with&nbsp;the NGA Office of the Inspector General (OIG). OIG is seeking information concerning industry capabilities and best practices concerning obtaining Financial Audit and FISMA evaluation services.</p>
<p>This RFI is being issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute an Invitation for Bids (IFB), a Request for Proposals (RFP), a Request for Quotations (RFQ) or an indication that the Government will contract for any of the items and/or services contained in this notice (FAR 15.201(e)). This RFI does not commit the Government to award a contract. No determination as to the viability of this requirement has been made at this point and there is currently no solicitation for this effort. Any solicitation resulting from this RFI will be announced separately. Based on your response to this RFI, the Government may contact you for follow-up questions and/or a one-on-one session.

It is the responsibility of the potential offerors to monitor these sites for additional information pertaining to this requirement. Based on the information received in response to this RFI, NGA may build a RFP or RFQ.

The draft version of the Statement of Work (SOW), Sections L&amp;M and other documentation notes the current state of the government's requirement for these services.

No Classified information may be included anywhere in the response. This information will be used by the government program manager to refine the approach for the final RFP or RFQ.<br /><br />c.

(1) Technical Acceptability - The technical proposal shall consist of descriptive information regarding the items identified in the solicitation. This information may include product literature or other narrative describing the products to be provided. The information provided should be presented in such a manner as to enable the Government to make a thorough and complete evaluation and arrive at a sound determination as to whether or not the products proposed and described will satisfy the requirements of the Government as stated in the solicitation. In the event an offeror proposes products that are other than the Brand Name specified, the offeror shall submit with its proposal information sufficient to comply with the requirements of FAR 52.211-6 Brand Name or Equal as follows: (a) If an item in this solicitation is identified as "brand name or equal," the purchase description reflects the characteristics and level of quality that will satisfy the Government's needs. The salient physical, functional, or performance characteristics that "equal" products must meet are specified in the solicitation. (b) To be considered for award, offers of "equal" products, including "equal" products of the brand name manufacturer, must- (1)	Meet the salient physical, functional, or performance characteristic specified in this solicitation; (2) Clearly identify the item by- (i) Brand name, if any; and (ii) Make or model number; (3) Include descriptive literature such as illustrations, drawings, or a clear reference to previously furnished descriptive data or information available to the Contracting Officer; and (4) Clearly describe any modification the offeror plans to make in a product to make it conform to the solicitation requirements. Mark any descriptive material to clearly show the modification. c) The Contracting Officer will evaluate "equal" products on the basis of information furnished by the offeror or identified in the offer and reasonably available to the Contracting Officer. The Contracting Officer is not responsible for locating or obtaining any information not identified in the offer. (d) Unless the offeror clearly indicates in its offer that the product being offered is an "equal" product, the offeror shall provide the brand name product referenced in the solicitation. (2) Price - The prices offered shall be submitted in accordance with the Schedule of Supplies and Services contained in the solicitation. Vendors responding to this solicitation are advised that, prior to award, the government may request vendors to submit information/data to support price reasonableness such as copies of paid invoices for the same or similar items, sales history for the same or similar items, price list with effective date and/or copies of catalog pages along with any applicable discounts. Failure to submit the requested information may result in disqualification of the submitted quote. (End of Text) <BR> <BR>Selection of a vendor for award will be based on two parts, as follows: (1) Technical Acceptability: The technical information submitted by each offeror will be evaluated against the specifications provided in the CLIN descriptions, Submission of Quotes, and Evaluation of Quotes and determined to either pass or fail. If the technical proposal is determined "fail", it renders the entire proposal technically unacceptable. If a technical rating of "fail" is assigned, the vendor may no longer be considered for award. The Contracting Officer will evaluate "equal" products on the basis of information furnished by the offeror or identified in the offer and reasonably available to the Contracting Officer. The Contracting Officer is not responsible for locating or obtaining any information not identified in the offer. (2) Price - The vendor's proposed prices will be evaluated on the basis of price reasonableness. (b) The PCO will review all of the proposals. Upon completion of the above, a single award for all items will be made to the offeror whose quotation, conforming to the solicitation, is considered technically acceptable, i.e. received a "pass" evaluation for Technical Acceptability and whose offer is considered to be the lowest price. (c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

<AWARDEE>University of North Texas HSC at Fort Worth, 3500 Camp Bowie Boulevard, Fort Worth, TX 78107 US
<DESC>The abuse of, and dependence on, a variety of substances remains a significant public health concern. Currently no approved pharmacotherapies exist to treat individuals dependent on cocaine, methamphetamine, or Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). Thus, the preclinical evaluation of potential pharmacotherapies for substance abuse is a critical component in NIDA's effort at addressing this public health problem.
<p>One of the best-established approaches for identifying and developing a potential treatment for drug abuse is to evaluate the compound for its pharmacological activities alone and its ability to alter the effects of the abused drug. Such an approach allows one to understand the potential utility of a compound, allowing rational selection of lead candidate compounds that warrant further testing and development, from among a wide variety of drugs. This approach has been employed routinely and successfully by the pharmaceutical industry as a means of identifying and evaluating compounds for potential therapeutic utility in treating other diseases, including central nervous system indications. The NIDA/Division of Pharmacotherapies and Medical Consequences of Drug Abuse (DPMCDA)/Addiction Treatment Discovery Program (ATDP) utilizes preclinical (animal) models to predict clinical efficacy of test compounds. The in vivo assays include mouse locomotor activity, rat drug discrimination, rat standard conditioned place preference, mouse stress-induced potentiation of conditioned place preference, and rat self-administration (all to be supported by this contract), rat relapse model, and primate drug discrimination and self-administration.</p>

LIMITED SOURCE JUSTIFICATION

1. Contracting Activity: 		Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Veterans Health Administration Strategic Acquisition Center
10300 Spotsylvania Avenue
Suite 400
Fredericksburg, VA 22408

2. Description of Action:  The proposed action is for an award of a new General Services Administration (GSA) task order for the procurement of actuarial and modeling services from Milliman, Inc.  This effort is proposed to be awarded under a GSA Mission Oriented Business Integrated Services (MOBIS) Schedule 874-1 GS-10F-0224K.  In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 8.405-6(a)(1)(i)(B) only one source is capable of providing the supplies or services required at the level of quality required because the supplies or services are unique or highly specialized.  Milliman, Inc. is the only source capable of providing benchmarking tools to support the 2013 VA Enrollee Health Care Projection Model (ECHPM) and support for previous EHCPMs as necessary.  This task order will also include a transition plan in the event that Milliman is not awarded the follow-on competed procurement.

3.  Description of the Supplies or Services:  The office of the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) Assistant Deputy Under Secretary for Health for Policy and Planning (ADUSH/PP) develops and maintains the VA Enrollee Health Care Projection Model (EHCPM).  EHCPM is an actuarial-based model for projecting Veteran demand for VA health care.  The EHCPM produces twenty-year projections of Veteran enrollment, utilization, and expenditures at a very detailed level for each fiscal year.  The resulting projections are central in the development of the VA medical care budget, strategic and capital planning, and policy analysis.   VA is dependent on the EHCPM projections to support the development of approximately 92 percent of the VA medical care budget on an annual basis.  In addition, the EHCPM is used to analyze the impact of proposed policies, legislation including the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, regulations and external events (economic recession)  on the VA health care system.

The EHCPM has been developed with the contracted support of Milliman, Inc. and currently utilizes the Milliman Health Cost Guidelines.  The current model is structured around a proprietary set of utilization benchmarking tools based on private sector data and adjusted to reflect demand by an enrolled Veteran population for comprehensive set of services offered by the VA.  The utilization benchmarking tools are a component of the Milliman Health Cost Guidelines.  The Milliman Health Cost Guidelines come from a variety of sources and are developed through a combination of statistical analysis, actuarial modeling, and the expert judgments of actuaries.
 

The function of the Milliman Health Cost Guidelines benchmarking tools in the EHCPM is to project Veteran enrollees' total health care needs.  Veteran enrollees have many other options for health care coverage (private insurance, TRICARE, Medicare, Medicaid, etc.). As a result, enrollees only receive a portion of the total health care they need through the VA health care system. For example, enrollees only choose to receive approximately 20 percent of all of the inpatient care they need from VA.  As a result, VA's internal data sources cannot be used exclusively to project total health care needs of the enrolled Veteran population.  The health care utilization benchmarking tools from the Milliman Health Cost Guidelines enable VA to project the total health care needs of the enrolled Veteran population.

The 2013 EHCPM has been under development since June of 2012 and will support the
2015 VA Health Care Budget. The enrollment, utilization, and expenditure projections from the 2013 EHCPM must be delivered to the VHA Office of Finance by April2013. VHA begins the development of the 2015 VA Medical Care Budget in April2013.  The
2013 EHCPM is required to support the budget process for fiscal year 2015 and ad hoc
follow up requests possibly  continuing after June 2013.

ADUSH/PP requests a limited source procurement of actuarial and modeling services from Milliman, Inc., from January 1, 2013, to June 30, 2013, with a six (6) month option period to provide additional consultation support for the 2013 EHCPM and previous EHCPMs as necessary along with possible transition services.

The estimated total value of this procurement including the option period is $4.75 million.  The period of performance is January 1, 2013, to June 30, 2013, with a six (6) month option period until December 30, 2013.

4. Authority:  The acquisition is conducted under the authority of the GSA MOBIS Schedule 874-1.  The authority permitting this limited source action is Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 8.405-6 (a)(1)(i)(B) Only one source is capable of providing the supplies or services required at the level of quality required because  the supplies or services are unique or highly specialized.

5. Rationale for Authority:  Milliman, Inc., 501 N Broadway Ste 550, Saint Louis, MO
63102-2126, GSA contract number GS-10F-0224K, is the only company with the technical expertise to perform the required services.  The 2013 EHCPM was developed and designed to use proprietary health care utilization benchmarking tools from the Milliman Health Cost Guidelines as the starting point for modeling VA health care services for the 2015 VA Medical Care Budget.  Further, all analyses supporting the 2013 EHCPM are aligned with the Milliman Health Cost Guidelines  health care service
utilization categories. Milliman, Inc. is the only company with expertise to complete the
2013 EHCPM because of the proprietary Milliman Health Cost Guidelines used to create the 2013 EHCPM.  There is no other company that could meet the deadlines of the VA to complete the EHCPM by April 2013.  Additionally, due to the proprietary nature of the benchmarking tools, only Milliman, Inc. can support the 2013 EHCPM after its development and support previous EHCPMs as necessary.
 




While VA owns the EHCPM and its software, VA cannot acquire rights to the Milliman Health Cost Guidelines benchmarking tools for its own use.  The EHCPM, as currently designed, cannot be used to produce projection scenarios without the proprietary benchmarking tools from the Milliman Health Cost Guidelines.  Although
the Milliman Health Cost Guidelines may be leased, its leasing policy is premised on
a number of principles, one of which is that non-Milliman users must be nongovernmental clients with experienced  health actuaries on staff. Therefore, Milliman, Inc. has precluded leasing to VA.

Market research, which is detailed in Section 8, has not identified any other actuarial firms with the customized health care utilization benchmarking tools that could be quickly and seamlessly integrated into 2013 EHCPM.  A new contractor without access
to the proprietary benchmarking tools from the Milliman Health Cost Guidelines would
have to (1) fundamentally restructure the EHCPM to integrate alternative  health care utilization benchmarks  or (2) develop a new model to estimate the health care that enrollees receive outside of VA without a benchmarking tool.

Based on the technical complexity of the EHCPM, VA's technical experts estimate that a new contractor would need a minimum of 10 months of development time to produce
a new EHCPM.  The EHCPM has evolved over time into a very complex health actuarial
model in order to account for all of the known drivers of Veteran demand for VA health care.  Projections are developed at a very detailed level: 13 enrollment priorities (1a,
1b, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7a, c, 8a, b, c, d); two genders, 14 five-year age bands, and 501 geographic areas.  In addition, projections are developed separately for enrollees who used VA prior to Eligibility Reform and for the Operation Enduring Freedom, Operation Iraqi Freedom, and Operation New Dawn Veteran population.  Further, the EHCPM is supported by in-depth analyses of Veteran enrollment rate; enrollee mortality; morbidity; geographic migration; transition among enrollment priorities; reliance on VA versus
other health care providers; and the impact of drive time, unemployment rates, income, initiatives, policies, regulations, and legislation on demand for VA health care.  As an example of the complexity of the EHCPM, over 150,000 reliance factors that vary by demographic and geographic detail are used each of the 20 projection years, and these factors vary by projection year.

Further, the EHCPM must produce projections for 20 years to support strategic and capital planning in VA.  Most health actuarial models project out three years or less. Also, stakeholders require that the EHCPM separately quantify the impact on enrollment, utilization, and expenditures of all of the key drivers of demand for VA health care.  Furthermore stakeholders require that the EHCPM can produce scenarios assuming any or all of those drivers change over the 20-year projection period.  As a result, all the drivers of VA health care demand must be analyzed and input into the EHCPM separately. Therefore, based on the technical complexity of the EHCPM, a new contractor cannot begin work on January 1, 2013, and deliver enrollment, utilization, and expenditure projections to the VHA Office of Finance by the mission critical date of April1, 2013.
 


6. Efforts to Obtain Competition:  VA conducted market research; however, market research did not identify any other actuarial firms with comparable health care benchmarking tools that could be quickly and seamlessly integrated into the 2013
EHCPM.

7. Actions to Increase Competition: The Government is currently in the process of developing a competitive acquisition strategy for future actuarial services.   It is anticipated that a future contract vehicle will be in place in the third quarter of 2013 timeframe which will allow for a transition of actuarial services and development of the
2014 EHCPM.

8. Market Research:  The VHA ADUSH/PP is continuously monitoring the current market for actuarial services, specifically health care related actuarial services.   VA technical experts conducted specific market research from November 8 through 28,
2012 to identify actuarial and modeling services capable of meeting the needs of VA relative to the 2013 EHCPM.  VA technical experts utilized GSA search engines to gather information on potential actuarial services companies and compared them to those found on the website for the Society of Actuaries.

Based on the market research, VA technical experts and contracting personnel reviewed the capability of the following actuarial contractors:  United Health Actuarial Service, Mercer, The Lewin Group, Actuarial Research Corporation, and Towers Watson Delaware, Inc.  All companies were contacted by phone.   Market research did not identify any actuarial firms with comparable health care utilization benchmarking tools that could be quickly and seamlessly integrated into the 2013 EHCPM.   The other actuarial firms do have benchmark data, but without benchmark tools comparable to Milliman Health Cost Guidelines, the 2013 EHCPM would require restructuring or the development of a new model. Actuarial Research Corporation and Towers Watson Delaware indicated that their companies do not have a benchmarking tool comparable to the Milliman Health Cost Guidelines.  Therefore, they are not capable of meeting VA requirements. Mercer indicated that they may have a benchmarking tool, but when asked did not provide VA technical experts with specific details to allow an assessment of their capabilities.  United Health Actuarial Service, Mercer and The Lewin Group all stated that it will take three to four months to develop a new tool plus an additional two months to make adjustments/changes.  Actuarial Research Corp stated that development of a new tool could take a total of 15 months to complete. VA's technical experts believe that the lower estimates derived from the market research reflect the level of effort required to develop a less complex model than the current EHCPM.  VA historical experience from developing  previous models indicate that the longer estimate of 10 months better reflects the level of effort required to (1) fundamentally restructure the EHCPM to integrate alternative health care utilization benchmarks or (2) develop a new model to estimate the health care that enrollees receive outside of VA without a benchmarking  tool. Based on the technical complexity of the EHCPM, a new contractor cannot begin work on January 1, 2013, and deliver enrollment, utilization, and expenditure projections to the VHA Office of Finance by the mission critical date of April
1, 2013.

LIMITED SOURCE JUSTIFICATION

1. Contracting Activity: 		Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Veterans Health Administration Strategic Acquisition Center
10300 Spotsylvania Avenue
Suite 400
Fredericksburg, VA 22408

2. Description of Action:  The proposed action is for an award of a new General Services Administration (GSA) task order for the procurement of actuarial and modeling services from Milliman, Inc.  This effort is proposed to be awarded under a GSA Mission Oriented Business Integrated Services (MOBIS) Schedule 874-1 GS-10F-0224K.  In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 8.405-6(a)(1)(i)(B) only one source is capable of providing the supplies or services required at the level of quality required because the supplies or services are unique or highly specialized.  Milliman, Inc. is the only source capable of providing benchmarking tools to support the 2013 VA Enrollee Health Care Projection Model (ECHPM) and support for previous EHCPMs as necessary.  This task order will also include a transition plan in the event that Milliman is not awarded the follow-on competed procurement.

3.  Description of the Supplies or Services:  The office of the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) Assistant Deputy Under Secretary for Health for Policy and Planning (ADUSH/PP) develops and maintains the VA Enrollee Health Care Projection Model (EHCPM).  EHCPM is an actuarial-based model for projecting Veteran demand for VA health care.  The EHCPM produces twenty-year projections of Veteran enrollment, utilization, and expenditures at a very detailed level for each fiscal year.  The resulting projections are central in the development of the VA medical care budget, strategic and capital planning, and policy analysis.   VA is dependent on the EHCPM projections to support the development of approximately 92 percent of the VA medical care budget on an annual basis.  In addition, the EHCPM is used to analyze the impact of proposed policies, legislation including the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, regulations and external events (economic recession)  on the VA health care system.

The EHCPM has been developed with the contracted support of Milliman, Inc. and currently utilizes the Milliman Health Cost Guidelines.  The current model is structured around a proprietary set of utilization benchmarking tools based on private sector data and adjusted to reflect demand by an enrolled Veteran population for comprehensive set of services offered by the VA.  The utilization benchmarking tools are a component of the Milliman Health Cost Guidelines.  The Milliman Health Cost Guidelines come from a variety of sources and are developed through a combination of statistical analysis, actuarial modeling, and the expert judgments of actuaries.
 

The function of the Milliman Health Cost Guidelines benchmarking tools in the EHCPM is to project Veteran enrollees' total health care needs.  Veteran enrollees have many other options for health care coverage (private insurance, TRICARE, Medicare, Medicaid, etc.). As a result, enrollees only receive a portion of the total health care they need through the VA health care system. For example, enrollees only choose to receive approximately 20 percent of all of the inpatient care they need from VA.  As a result, VA's internal data sources cannot be used exclusively to project total health care needs of the enrolled Veteran population.  The health care utilization benchmarking tools from the Milliman Health Cost Guidelines enable VA to project the total health care needs of the enrolled Veteran population.

The 2013 EHCPM has been under development since June of 2012 and will support the
2015 VA Health Care Budget. The enrollment, utilization, and expenditure projections from the 2013 EHCPM must be delivered to the VHA Office of Finance by April2013. VHA begins the development of the 2015 VA Medical Care Budget in April2013.  The
2013 EHCPM is required to support the budget process for fiscal year 2015 and ad hoc
follow up requests possibly  continuing after June 2013.

ADUSH/PP requests a limited source procurement of actuarial and modeling services from Milliman, Inc., from January 1, 2013, to June 30, 2013, with a six (6) month option period to provide additional consultation support for the 2013 EHCPM and previous EHCPMs as necessary along with possible transition services.

The estimated total value of this procurement including the option period is $4.75 million.  The period of performance is January 1, 2013, to June 30, 2013, with a six (6) month option period until December 30, 2013.

4. Authority:  The acquisition is conducted under the authority of the GSA MOBIS Schedule 874-1.  The authority permitting this limited source action is Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 8.405-6 (a)(1)(i)(B) Only one source is capable of providing the supplies or services required at the level of quality required because  the supplies or services are unique or highly specialized.

5. Rationale for Authority:  Milliman, Inc., 501 N Broadway Ste 550, Saint Louis, MO
63102-2126, GSA contract number GS-10F-0224K, is the only company with the technical expertise to perform the required services.  The 2013 EHCPM was developed and designed to use proprietary health care utilization benchmarking tools from the Milliman Health Cost Guidelines as the starting point for modeling VA health care services for the 2015 VA Medical Care Budget.  Further, all analyses supporting the 2013 EHCPM are aligned with the Milliman Health Cost Guidelines  health care service
utilization categories. Milliman, Inc. is the only company with expertise to complete the
2013 EHCPM because of the proprietary Milliman Health Cost Guidelines used to create the 2013 EHCPM.  There is no other company that could meet the deadlines of the VA to complete the EHCPM by April 2013.  Additionally, due to the proprietary nature of the benchmarking tools, only Milliman, Inc. can support the 2013 EHCPM after its development and support previous EHCPMs as necessary.
 




While VA owns the EHCPM and its software, VA cannot acquire rights to the Milliman Health Cost Guidelines benchmarking tools for its own use.  The EHCPM, as currently designed, cannot be used to produce projection scenarios without the proprietary benchmarking tools from the Milliman Health Cost Guidelines.  Although
the Milliman Health Cost Guidelines may be leased, its leasing policy is premised on
a number of principles, one of which is that non-Milliman users must be nongovernmental clients with experienced  health actuaries on staff. Therefore, Milliman, Inc. has precluded leasing to VA.

Market research, which is detailed in Section 8, has not identified any other actuarial firms with the customized health care utilization benchmarking tools that could be quickly and seamlessly integrated into 2013 EHCPM.  A new contractor without access
to the proprietary benchmarking tools from the Milliman Health Cost Guidelines would
have to (1) fundamentally restructure the EHCPM to integrate alternative  health care utilization benchmarks  or (2) develop a new model to estimate the health care that enrollees receive outside of VA without a benchmarking tool.

Based on the technical complexity of the EHCPM, VA's technical experts estimate that a new contractor would need a minimum of 10 months of development time to produce
a new EHCPM.  The EHCPM has evolved over time into a very complex health actuarial
model in order to account for all of the known drivers of Veteran demand for VA health care.  Projections are developed at a very detailed level: 13 enrollment priorities (1a,
1b, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7a, c, 8a, b, c, d); two genders, 14 five-year age bands, and 501 geographic areas.  In addition, projections are developed separately for enrollees who used VA prior to Eligibility Reform and for the Operation Enduring Freedom, Operation Iraqi Freedom, and Operation New Dawn Veteran population.  Further, the EHCPM is supported by in-depth analyses of Veteran enrollment rate; enrollee mortality; morbidity; geographic migration; transition among enrollment priorities; reliance on VA versus
other health care providers; and the impact of drive time, unemployment rates, income, initiatives, policies, regulations, and legislation on demand for VA health care.  As an example of the complexity of the EHCPM, over 150,000 reliance factors that vary by demographic and geographic detail are used each of the 20 projection years, and these factors vary by projection year.

Further, the EHCPM must produce projections for 20 years to support strategic and capital planning in VA.  Most health actuarial models project out three years or less. Also, stakeholders require that the EHCPM separately quantify the impact on enrollment, utilization, and expenditures of all of the key drivers of demand for VA health care.  Furthermore stakeholders require that the EHCPM can produce scenarios assuming any or all of those drivers change over the 20-year projection period.  As a result, all the drivers of VA health care demand must be analyzed and input into the EHCPM separately. Therefore, based on the technical complexity of the EHCPM, a new contractor cannot begin work on January 1, 2013, and deliver enrollment, utilization, and expenditure projections to the VHA Office of Finance by the mission critical date of April1, 2013.
 


6. Efforts to Obtain Competition:  VA conducted market research; however, market research did not identify any other actuarial firms with comparable health care benchmarking tools that could be quickly and seamlessly integrated into the 2013
EHCPM.

7. Actions to Increase Competition: The Government is currently in the process of developing a competitive acquisition strategy for future actuarial services.   It is anticipated that a future contract vehicle will be in place in the third quarter of 2013 timeframe which will allow for a transition of actuarial services and development of the
2014 EHCPM.

8. Market Research:  The VHA ADUSH/PP is continuously monitoring the current market for actuarial services, specifically health care related actuarial services.   VA technical experts conducted specific market research from November 8 through 28,
2012 to identify actuarial and modeling services capable of meeting the needs of VA relative to the 2013 EHCPM.  VA technical experts utilized GSA search engines to gather information on potential actuarial services companies and compared them to those found on the website for the Society of Actuaries.

Based on the market research, VA technical experts and contracting personnel reviewed the capability of the following actuarial contractors:  United Health Actuarial Service, Mercer, The Lewin Group, Actuarial Research Corporation, and Towers Watson Delaware, Inc.  All companies were contacted by phone.   Market research did not identify any actuarial firms with comparable health care utilization benchmarking tools that could be quickly and seamlessly integrated into the 2013 EHCPM.   The other actuarial firms do have benchmark data, but without benchmark tools comparable to Milliman Health Cost Guidelines, the 2013 EHCPM would require restructuring or the development of a new model. Actuarial Research Corporation and Towers Watson Delaware indicated that their companies do not have a benchmarking tool comparable to the Milliman Health Cost Guidelines.  Therefore, they are not capable of meeting VA requirements. Mercer indicated that they may have a benchmarking tool, but when asked did not provide VA technical experts with specific details to allow an assessment of their capabilities.  United Health Actuarial Service, Mercer and The Lewin Group all stated that it will take three to four months to develop a new tool plus an additional two months to make adjustments/changes.  Actuarial Research Corp stated that development of a new tool could take a total of 15 months to complete. VA's technical experts believe that the lower estimates derived from the market research reflect the level of effort required to develop a less complex model than the current EHCPM.  VA historical experience from developing  previous models indicate that the longer estimate of 10 months better reflects the level of effort required to (1) fundamentally restructure the EHCPM to integrate alternative health care utilization benchmarks or (2) develop a new model to estimate the health care that enrollees receive outside of VA without a benchmarking  tool. Based on the technical complexity of the EHCPM, a new contractor cannot begin work on January 1, 2013, and deliver enrollment, utilization, and expenditure projections to the VHA Office of Finance by the mission critical date of April
1, 2013.
