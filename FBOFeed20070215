<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has a requirement for the acquisition of Enhanced Automated Graphical Logistics Environment (EAGLE) software, associated Maintenance Management Information System (MMIS) module, and EAGLE/MMIS Training in support of the Standard Terminal Automation Replacement System (STARS). The FAA intends to solicit and negotiate only with Raytheon Technical Services Company LLC (Raytheon), Long Beach, California, in accordance with Acquisition Management System (AMS) Policy 3.2.2.4, Single Source Selection.  Raytheon, under competitive acquisition procedures, was awarded Contract DTFA01-96-D-03008 to provide the deployment of STARS equipment, configuration management, and logistics support by using their software application known as EAGLE, including its MMIS associated module.  The FAA has determined that the logistics support services currently provided by Raytheon under contract DTFA01-96-D-03008 will be transferred to the FAA Logistics Center (FAALC).  FAALC will assume and provide logistics support services beginning July 2007.   In order for the FAALC to provide logistics support services, Raytheon's proprietary EAGLE/MMIS software must be procured and installed on FAALC's information system hardware.   Services other than logistics support will continue to be provided by Raytheon under contract DTFA01-96-D-03008. The FAA conducted a market survey and the results of this survey support our determination to solicit and negotiate with only one firm.  This announcement is for informational purposes only, not a request for proposals.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), Office of Headquarters Procurement Services, intends to issue a modification under contract Number DE-AC01-06EE11187, and extend the period of performance for an additional twelve months, consisting of four 3-month option periods. This is not a request for competitive proposals. Reference FedBizOpps announcement on February 21, 2006, the DOE issued a Notice of Intent to negotiate and award a sole-source bridge contract to Energetics, Inc. on a non-competitive basis for management and professional support services, and technical, market, and economic analysis to the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) Industrial Technologies program (ITP). A bridge contract was awarded to Energetics, Inc. on March 29, 2006, and will expire effective March 28, 2007. An extension of the bridge contract is necessary due to unanticipated delays for a successful award of a follow-on competitive contract and insures continued support to assist ITP meet their mission to improve industrial energy efficiency and environmental performance. The statutory authority for permitting other than full and open competition for this contract is Section 303[c][1] of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended by the Competition in Contracting Act, 41 USC 253(c)(1),  and implemented by FAR 6.302-1[a][2][ii][B], which authorizes other than full and open competition when there is only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements; and when it is likely that an award to any other source may result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agencyâ€™s requirements. Energetics has been supporting ITP for more than 20 years and has the technical expertise in the energy-intensive industries and processes that are the focus of ITP R&D. The incumbent is currently assisting ITP with benchmarking and analyzing energy use for a number of technologies and a variety of industrial applications that will enable them to provide uninterrupted support effective March 28, 2007. As such, this unique strategic knowledge to assist ITP with program planning, implementation, and evaluation necessitates a continuance of work already in process by the incumbent contractor. Firms who want to challenge the modification to extend the sole-source contract must submit an interest letter that demonstrates the firm's ability to provide the services, as described above Interested parties may submit a proposal and rationale as to why they should be considered within ten (10) days of this notice to: Ms. Linda Sapp, MA-642.1, 1000 Independence Ave, SW, Washington, DC 20505, email linda.sapp@hq.doe.gov. A determination by the Government not to extend the current contract to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct a competitive acquisition. The North American Industry Classification System (NAIC) Code for this requirement is 541330.

<DESC>The Department of Energy (DOE) is developing a Transportation, Aging and Disposal (TAD) canister-based system to simplify and standardize operations throughout the Civilian Radioactive Waste Management System.  The TAD canister will be the key interface component that facilitates the various TAD system functions envisioned for temporary storage of commercial spent nuclear fuel (CSNF) at utility sites, (as necessary), transport to the repository, aging at the repository and ultimate disposal when placed into a waste package.  As such, components of a TAD canister-based system will comply with applicable regulatory requirements of 10 CFR Part 71, 10 CFR Part 72 and 10 CFR Part 63. As part of the design and certification process, each vendor will prepare and submit safety analysis reports (SARs) to NRC for docketing and evaluation. These SARs shall be of sufficient detail such that the vendor can obtain 10 CFR Part 71 and 10 CFR Part 72 certificates of compliance (CoC). The development and demonstration strategy for the TAD canister-based system requires the vendor to work with one or more nuclear utility entity(ies). The vendor and its utility entity must demonstrate the operation of the TAD canister-based system after the vendor obtains the 10 CFR Part 72 CoC at the utility site.  Performance specifications needed to integrate the TAD canister-based system with the system components will be specified by the user utility.  All components, hardware and software needed to operate the TAD canister-based system at a commercial nuclear independent spent fuel storage installation (ISFSI) facility will be provided by others. To facilitate DOE preparation of a 10 CFR Part 63 license application (LA), the vendor shall prepare a design report, analogous to the 10 CFR Part 72 SAR, for the aging configuration at the repository.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Carderock Division has a requirement for services intended to support the implementation of a unique data processing capability in support of NSWC Carderock's core capability of acoustic signature assessment of full-scale submarines.  In support of this effort, NSWCCD intends to negotiate a non-competitive procurement using Simplified Acquisition Procedures and award a firm fixed price purchase order to Arion Systems Incorporated (ASI).  The services involve proprietary techniques for which ASI has initiated the patenting process.  A provisional patent has been issued with serial number US60/682,426 entitled “Recursively Field-Optimized Compensation Using Spherical Decomposition”.  This is a follow-on effort designed to allow for a more substantial processing of data collected on previous acoustical trial, a reconfiguration of the existing prototype to work at NSWC, and the preparation of a second system of more capability for use on u!  pcoming trials.  Award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received by 3 March 2007 will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Interested parties may forward their capabilities statements to Heather Valiga by e-mail at heather.valiga@navy.mil or by fax at (301) 227-5822 on or before 03/02/2007.

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.
The National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) Office of Acquisitions (OA), intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive sole source basis to:  Harlan Teklad, Po Box 44220, 2826 Latham Drive, Madison WI 53713.   The item?s to be purchase are: Item (1)  sani chip bedding qty of 5,422 bags; Item (2) bed o cob qty of 1,140 bags; Item (3) rodent chow 14,175 bags; Item (4) rat and mouse chow qty of 76 bags; Item (5) guinea pig feed qty of 524 bags; Item (6) diamond soft bedding qty of  594 bags; Item (7) high fat feed qty of 185 bags; Item (7) guinea pig chow qty of 228 bags; Item (8) rodent diet sterilizable qty of 3,800 bags; Item (9) corn cob bedding qty of 114; & Item (10) tek fresh qty of 76 bags.    
The sole source determination is based on:   All diets must be manufactured using FIXED Formulations (All Harlan Teklad diets are manufactured using fixed formulas just like the NIH open formula diets? eliminates PMI diets since they use constant nutrition).  Due to the sensitive nature of research, modifications or changes to diet formulas (even minor) can have serious impacts on research results and as well as breeding and therefore are not allowed.  Rodent diets shall be completely vegetarian to eliminate the presence of nitrosamines (found in animal and fish by-products) which have been shown to be potential cancer causing compounds.  Fish meal can contain mercury.  Fish meal, meat and bone meal, animal fat, poultry meal and porcine meal cannot be contained in our rodent diets.  (2018SX is completely vegetarian (as is the entire Global diet line) ? some of the NIH open formula diets and most of the PMI diets all contain some or all of the above listed ingredients) 
Rodent diets shall be formulated with no alfalfa meal and low or no soybean meal to minimize the presence of naturally occurring phytoestrogens (endogenous hormones found in soy and alfalfa that have been shown to affect a wide variety of research).   (2018SX has no alfalfa meal and low soy content).  All bedding items must be screened semi-annually for contaminants (pesticides and heavy metals) and the results of these tests must be available upon request thereafter. All standard diet and bedding products must be stored in a climate controlled warehouse not to exceed 70F year round and humidity maintained at or below 55%.  Records of temp/humidity must be maintained on a 24 hour basis and made available upon request. (The Harlan warehouse, in Frederick MD where all of the requested diets/bedding comes from meets these specifications.  Single use, disposable pallets shall be used for delivery of products to help reduce/eliminate any bio-security issues that could be involved with re-usable ones.  (Harlan delivers on the Inca pallets)    Delivery vehicles used to deliver all diet and bedding products shall not have any surfaces inside the truck which cannot be properly sanitized - for example, wood floors are not acceptable (most competitor?s trucks have wood floors) and all trucks used to make deliveries shall be sanitized daily.  
The acquisition is being conducted under simplified acquisition, procedures, and is exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) is 424990 and the Standard Size is 500. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this requirement. Responses to this announcement, referencing synopsis number NOI7043 may be submitted to the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Office Acquisitions, 10401 Fernwood Rd Suite 2NE70F, Bethesda, MD 20892-7902, Attention: Iris Johnson.

<DESC>The Meteorological Satellite (METSAT) Data Exploitation Capability (MDEC) project is comprised of design, development, test, and implementation in support of the Air Force Weather Agency (AFWA).  A Service Oriented Architecture is recommended for Air Force Weather Strategic Centers to allow exploitation of increased data from NPOESS-era satellites.  This architecture will be built in layers to allow the science models and functional components to be added, removed, or upgraded independently as needed to exploit the NPOESS-era data.  As a result, each capability (service) can be upgraded or replaced with minimal impact to the other capabilities.  Additionally, the MDEC contractor has integration challenges due to interdependencies with the Weather Data Analysis (WDA) program as well as other concurrent activities at the Air Force Weather Strategic Centers.

<DESC>DESCRIPTION

CMS is in the process of issuing a Competitive 8(a) RFP with the anticipation of a multiple award Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity contract with a base period and four one year option periods.

BACKGROUND:

The Office of Information Services (OIS) is charged with the support and management of information systems architecture, assets (hardware, software and resources), enterprise databases, accesses to data, and operational systems for the Centers for Medicare & Medicare Services (CMS). CMS is responsible for, and retains stewardship of, a vast quantity of Medicare and Medicaid data assets. This data contains detailed information on Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries, and their associated claims, diagnostic, and treatment information. The current amount of data under management is approximately 90 Terabytes, with an anticipated growth rate of 10% to 20% per year.  

This amount of data places CMS as one of the larger data repositories in the United States, and brings with it the complexities of managing repositories of this size. Additionally, CMS has the often conflicting responsibility of making this valuable information available to the public, research organizations, universities, and congressional members and committees, while protecting the privacy of the recipient beneficiaries. To support these requirements, CMS must develop a progressive and modern database architecture that enables management and access to the data, while providing the capability to protect beneficiary privacy.

DESCRIPTION OF THE REQUIREMENT:
The  Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) intends to issue a solicitation for highly skilled data and database administrators to assist in the development, implementation, maintenance, and ongoing support of the agency?s operational and enterprise relational database management systems. 

CMS requires Data Administrator (DA) and Database Administrator (DBA) and Business Intelligence Administrator (BI) support for applications targeted for a variety of RDBMS platforms, including IBM DB2 on the mainframe, Oracle on Solaris; and Microsoft SQL and UDB administration Server on WIN2K. The databases for these systems are ranging in complexity and size. Some databases have more than 300 tables; others employ less than a dozen. Some databases are as small as a few dozen megabytes in size; others span up to 10 terabytes. CMS has databases locally, at data hosting facilities and are deployed on mainframes, mid tier servers, and at Internet Service Providers.  The Middleware/Messaging Administrators shall provide Message Queuing (MQ) support services for the CMS Data Management Program.


A Prime Contractor under the DA/DBA IDIQ Contract shall demonstrate it possesses independently prepared appraisal results based on a Software Engineering Institute? (SEI?) Software Standard CMMI Appraisal Method for Process Improvement (SCAMPISM), Class A (Versions 1.1 or 1.2), of Level 2, at a minimum, no later than 6 months after contract award date, with a process improvement plan and schedule to provide steps toward achieving Level 3 within twenty-four (24) months of award of the DA/DBA IDIQ Contract. The SCAMPI appraisal must have been led by an SEI-Authorized Lead Appraiser for SCAMPI, and the Authorized Lead Appraiser must be on the current SEI List of Authorized Lead Appraisers.  Should an offeror not possess the SCAMPI appraisal result required above at proposal submission, the offeror shall provide a SCAMPI Class C appraisal and a detailed plan and schedule for attainment of the required CMMI level within 6 months after contract  award.


This announcement is not a request for proposal (RFP).  Offerors are advised that questions regarding this pre-solicitation notice should be held until after the solicitation is posted.  CMS anticipates release of the Request for Proposal in March 2007 and it will be available on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website at http://www.fedbizopps.gov for all interested parties.  The anticipated award date for this effort is May 2007.  The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code 
identified for this requirement is 541513 with a size standard of $23 Million.

<DESC>The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) is planning to award up to 20 contracts to organizations having the ability to serve as Study Centers for the National Childrens Study (Study).   This announcement is intended to inform interested organizations of a planned Request for Proposals (RFP), of important background information, and of some key requirements essential for responding to the RFP.

Background information on the Study is available at www.nationalchildrensstudy.gov.  The Study is a large, long-term longitudinal study of environmental influences on childrens health and development.  This Study will explore a broad range of environmental factors, both helpful and harmful, that influence the health and development of children.  For this Study, environment is broadly defined to include biological, chemical, physical, social and behavioral influences on children.  The range of outcomes includes, for example, obesity, diabetes and physical development; injuries; asthma; pregnancy-related outcomes; and mental health issues.  Likewise, a wide range of environmental influences will be examined for their impact on childrens health and development.   These include, but are not limited to air pollutants, drinking water contaminants, soil and dust contaminants, dietary nutrients, dietary contaminants, parental occupational exposures, infectious and allergic agents, genetics and social and behavioral characteristics.   The Studys goal is to better understand the role of how these factors, alone and in combination, affect or are associated with childrens health, disease and development.   The Study will include a sample of approximately 100,000 children born in the U.S.   Enrolled women and, when possible, their partners will be assessed for a wide range of exposures and personal characteristics early in pregnancy or upon pre-pregnancy enrollment.  Monitoring of the mothers exposures will continue throughout pregnancy to birth, and possibly beyond.  The child will then be followed for a wide range of health and developmental outcomes and environmental exposures throughout childhood until at least 21 years of age.  

Information will be collected from participants in the Study who reside in one of the 105 locations (counties selected as primary sampling units for the first stage of a multi-stage sampling process). The Study locations are identified on the map and list of Study Locations at http://www.nationalchildrensstudy.gov/about/locations/.   The information will be collected by Study Centers that perform the data collection activities in the locations or counties.   It is important to distinguish the Study Centers (organizations or institutions engaged in conducting the study) from the Locations (geographic areas, counties) where eligible participants reside. 

In the initial phase of this Study, which was awarded in September of 2005, data will be collected in seven geographic areas in the United States.  Data collection in each of these seven geographic locations is being conducted by a single Study Center, referred to as a Vanguard Center.  Thus, there are a total of seven Vanguard Centers. The Vanguard Centers will begin enrollment of Study participants up to one year prior to initiation of enrollment in the wave 1 Study Locations. 

Additional contracts are needed to establish Study Centers to conduct the data collections in the remaining 98 Study Locations from the original sample of 105 locations (See study locations at http://www.nationalchildrensstudy.gov/about/locations/) and to engage in developing the protocol for subsequent phases of the Study.  It is anticipated that approximately 15 to 20 contracts will be awarded as a result of this solicitation for data collections in up to 30 additional Study Locations.  Future solicitations for additional Study Centers to cover the remaining locations will be dependent upon availability of funds. 

Offerors responding to this solicitation must demonstrate the ability to conduct the Study in one or more of the 98 remaining Study Locations .  (Contracts have already been awarded for collection of data in the seven Vanguard Locations.) Specifically, offerors must document in their technical proposal, the following:  

1.	Offerors proposing to become a Study Center must propose to carry out the Study at one or more of the 98 previously designated Study locations (see http://www.nationalchildrensstudy.gov/about/locations/).   
2.	Study Locations (Counties) where a proposing Study Center offers to conduct the study must be located either: a) in the state where the proposing Study Center is located; or b) in a state that is contiguous with the state of the proposing Study Center. The location of the Study Center is considered to be that of the location of the primary institution in the proposal. 
3.	Demonstrate a clear understanding of the complexity of this Study, including the use of complex multi-level sampling strategies for selection of Study locations and neighborhoods within locations from which participants will be recruited; the longitudinal nature of the data collection; the need to collect, process, and ship environmental samples and biologic specimens from multiple sites; and the need to collect interview data from multiple participants including pregnant women, fathers, and other primary caregivers, and children;
4.	Demonstrate an ability to gain community support and input to optimize subject recruitment, retention, and dissemination of Study findings; 
5.	Provide an understanding of the household sampling approach being used in the study and an ability to identify, recruit, and enroll a sufficiently large population of women, both prior to pregnancy and during early pregnancy, such that 1000 live births are enrolled in the study over a 4-year enrollment period in each Study Location; 
6.	Provide evidence of the ability to enroll participants prior to conception and early in pregnancy;
7.	Demonstrate the ability to retain and follow Study participants from all socioeconomic groups, including the medically underserved.  [It is anticipated that measurements that require in-person contact will occur at least once in a subset of participants enrolled prior to pregnancy, two times during pregnancy, around the time of delivery, at 6 months, one year, 3 years, 5 years and every 3-5 years until the age of 21 years.  Other remote contacts (e.g. telephone interviews) will occur at more frequent intervals];
8.	Provide evidence of the ability to collect Study specimens and information (biologic specimens and interview data) from mothers, fathers, and offspring; and environmental specimens from the household and neighborhood environment;
9.	Provide evidence of the ability to collect cord blood and placental tissue at the time of delivery;
10.	Provide evidence of understanding and experience in packaging and transporting biological and non-biological samples to a laboratory(ies) and repository(ies) from the Study Center.  (Note: The National Childrens Study, Coordinating Center (CC) will develop standard operating procedures in collaboration with the Study Centers.);
11.	Provide evidence of the ability to perform a standardized examination of the newborn as well as other clinical and neurodevelopmental exams throughout childhood;
12.	Provide evidence of the ability (equipment and expertise available) to perform fetal ultrasounds; Dual-energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA); detailed developmental and psychometric assessments; placement, calibration and use of instruments to collect environmental samples, and other measures as selected in the development of the Study Protocol;
13.	Demonstrate previous experience in the implementation of Quality Assurance/Quality Control activities covering the collection of interview data; collection, storage, and shipping of biologic and environmental specimens; and collection of field observational data;
14.	Provide evidence of qualified personnel to oversee and conduct data collections and other aspects of the Study, as outlined above; and
15.	Provide evidence of previous work with a centralized coordination center in the development of protocols and procedures.


Other instructions to offerors include:

1.	Where feasible, offerors are strongly encouraged to propose to be a Study Center for data collection in multiple locations.  There is no limit to the maximum number of locations that an offeror may include in the proposal. However, proposals will be evaluated based on technical merit of which one aspect includes ability to engage relevant community entities within each location.  
2.	The Study anticipates accruing study locations in three waves or stages separated by one to two years depending on availability of funding.   It is desirable to maintain a representative sample as much as possible with each wave of location accrual.   Therefore, in addition to the technical merit of the proposals, geographic distribution and maintaining sample representativeness will be a factor in selection of centers.  
3.	Only one center will conduct the Study at any single location.  Locations or counties may not be shared or split between more than one Study Center; however, organizations and institutions are encouraged to establish partnerships and teams with other entities where appropriate or necessary to establish the strongest capability to perform the Study.
4.	Each newly established Study Center awarded through this procurement will operate on an equal level with the already established Vanguard Centers.  Both the Vanguard Centers and the newly established Study Centers will operate under federal contract guidelines and will be equally accountable to the Program and Contracting Offices of NICHD. 
5.	A pre-proposal conference to answer questions and provide clarification about this solicitation will be conducted on March 7, 2007 at 1:00pm EST.  It will be held in the Washington, D.C. area. The pre-proposal conference will also be a live webcast. The specific location for the conference will be announced with the RFP and on the Study website www.nationalchildrensstudy.gov.
6.	Current Vanguard Centers are eligible to submit proposals to serve as Study Centers for additional locations as outlined above.

The Request for Proposals is anticipated to be issued in approximately two weeks. Information in the anticipated RFP supersedes any information in this pre-solicitation announcement.  The due date for proposals in response to this solicitation is anticipated to be on or about  April 16, 2007.  Any questions concerning this announcement must be submitted in writing to Elizabeth J.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

The Joint Program Executive Office for Chemical and Biological Defense (JPEOCBD), Joint Project Manager Guardian (JPMG), located in Falls Church, Virginia, is seeking sources to support execution of the Installation Protection Program (IPP) design, fielding and sustainment requirements.  The IPP is envisioned to encompass an integrated and tiered family of chemical, biological and radiological systems that includes detection, identification, warning, information management, decision support, incident management, medical surveillance, individual and collective protection, and emergency response capabilities.  The Baseline Tier consists of non-material solutions to include training materials, military and civilian Concept of Operations (CONOPS) and Mutual Aid Agreement (MAA) templates, and exercise plans and scenarios.  Tier 1 adds to the Baseline Tier by providing material solutions to include chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear (CBRN) portable and handheld detection, mass casualty response capability, individual protective equipment, incident management systems, and first responder pharmaceuticals.  Tier 2 consists of the Baseline Tier and Tier 1 capabilities, and adds collective protection, decision support systems, and fixed chemical and biological sensors.  This approach is flexible enough to accommodate the needs of specific installations, while standardizing major system elements to provide cost effective solutions.  The contract will be required to execute simultaneous CONUS and OCONUS program requirements.  The program will procure a common suite of equipment that will be tailored for each installation utilizing both commercial sources and readily available Government Furnished Equipment (GFE).  The goal and mission of the IPP is to:
?	protect critical missions ensuring uninterrupted operations during a CBRN event;
?	protect mission essential personnel; and,
?	support the rapid restoration of critical operations if impacted by the event

The effort encompasses conduct of all analysis, system engineering and design, fielding, assembly, testing, installation qualification, new equipment training, documentation, planning, and management required to support this effort.  It also includes all materials, software, and services necessary to ensure the successful performance of the responsibilities entailed in executing this program.  During program execution the Contractor will be responsible for the following major efforts:
?	installation survey and design 
?	system fielding, installment and qualification testing
?	development of all required training materials to include operator and maintenance training, web based training, table top exercises (TTX), and field exercises and full installation exercises
?	support of developmental testing
?	technical documentation
?	logistics support planning
?	long term storage and accountability of COTS/GOTS equipment for execution and sustainment to include inventory management

The Government released a draft solicitation for industry comments during December 2006 (see JPEOCBD Website Listing at http://www.jpeocbd.osd.mil/page_manager.asp?pg=3).  On 02 February 2007, the Government sponsored an Industry Day.  All briefing information, to include questions and answers are available for review at the aforementioned website.  The date for the submittal of capability statements has been extended to March 2, 2007.

<DESC>The Office of the Federal Detention Trustee (OFDT) has a requirement for a secured bed detention facility to house up to 1,000 detainees (male only) in the custody of the U.S Department of Justice, United States Marshals Services (USMS) and the Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The successful offeror will provide a Contractor-owned and operated facility capable of housing up to 900 USMS detainees charged with federal offenses, detained while awaiting trial or sentencing, and 100 ICE detainees awaiting a hearing on their immigration status or deportation. The facility shall be located within 75 miles of the Lloyd D. George - U.S. Federal Courthouse, 333 Las Vegas Boulevard South, Suite 2058, Las Vegas, NV 89101.  The successful offeror will be required to provide all personnel, services, equipment, material, supplies (to include full medical services and all transportation services within 250 miles of the facility) required for management and operation of a secure detention facility. 

Offeror will be required to provide information to the Government to ensure compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969, 42 U.S.C. 4321, et seq., and the implementing regulations at 40 C.F.R. Part 1500. To qualify for participation in this procurement, all potential offerors shall submit the following information for each site for which the offeror plans to provide a proposal. Not later than 
March 30, 2007, the offeror shall submit a Phase I Survey conducted in accordance with the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM), E-1527-05, "Standard Practice for Environmental Site Assessment: Phase I Environmental Site Assessment Process." The Phase I Survey shall include, as a "Non-Scope Consideration" under Chapter 12 of the Standard Practice, a delineation or identification of on-site wetlands, and an analysis of potential impacts to threaten or endangered species or species of special status. The identification of on-site wetlands should include and on-site reconnaissance level survey/report by a qualified wetlands specialist, the National Wetlands Inventory map for the project area, and an identification of hydric soils on the proposed property. The analysis of potential impacts to threatened and endangered species of special status should include a site reconnaissance report identifying potential habitat or presence of protected species (plant and animal) lists. Failure to submit the Phase I Survey by March 30, 2007 shall preclude that site from being considered for this procurement. The Government will only accept offers for which a Phase I Survey has been timely submitted. All other offers will be rejected.  All information submitted as a part of the Phase I Survey shall be considered non-proprietary and, at the discretion of the Government, be made public during the Scoping process under NEPA or at any other appropriate time. 

To be considered, the offeror submitting the proposal must clearly demonstrate at the time of proposal submission it has corporate experience operating secure detention facilities over a continuous three-year period as of the date the RFP was issued. Note, point ventures will be considered as long as one partner meets the corporate experience requirement. Multiple proposals from one offeror will not be accepted.  OFDT intends to award a firm-fixed price contract for an estimated term of 20 years (base period of five years and three (3) five year option years). The Government reserves its right to negotiate the terms of the contract. Interested parties are advised that Past Performance and Experience will be significant factors in the evaluation of offers and award selection shall be made on a Best Value basis.   Consideration will be given for new construction, expansion, renovation or use of an existing facility.

OFDT estimates issuing the solicitation on or about May 1, 2007.  All interested parties requiring further information should send an email to Lori.Ray@usdoj.gov.  Telephone calls will not be accepted.

Description
CASS Performance Based Logistics (PBL) Request for Comment.  THIS IS A REQUEST FOR COMMENT.  THERE IS NO SOLICITATION PACKAGE AVAILABLE.  NAVAIR Lakehurst is seeking potential sources and industry comments / feedback for the potential acquisition of Performance Based Logistics (PBL) services to include maintenance and support services necessary to ensure system component availability and/or system performance of Consolidated Automated Support System (CASS) stations, which includes the High Power Device Test Subsystem (HPDTS).  This acquisition also shall include PBL services for the CASS system Electro Optics (EO3).  These systems and components are located in the Fleet as well as land based sites in CONUS (Continental US) and OCONUS (Outside Continental US) locations.  The Navy intends to procure these support services on an FFP basis.  The proposed single solicitation vehicle would also allow the PBL services for the CASS system and the EO3 system to be awarded on separate IDIQ contracts.  This also allows each to be potentially awarded to separate contractors or all to one contractor.  Therefore, any potential awardee may bid on the support for both systems or on one system as listed separately on each CLIN.  The period of performance for each system's base award shall be five years, with five one-year option periods, potentially totaling ten years for the entire contract performance. 
  
All attachments enclosed are based on the government's currently available data and are subject to change prior to the solicitation being released and prior to award.  Attached is a notional Schedule B that includes the CLINs and pricing structure.  Also attached is a draft Statement of Objectives (SOO) as well as CDRLS, a list of available drawings, a list of the likely Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) / Government Furnished Material (GFM) to be provided, a schedule of the units that are currently fielded, and lists of part numbers / items that illustrate what potentially needs to be supported for each system along with the available demand data.  The attachments included are listed as follows:

Attachment 1     	Draft Statement of Objectives (Including CDRLS)   	90 Pages

Attachment 2	  	CASS Item Support List 				11 Pages

Attachment 3		High Power Item Support List			  9 Pages

Attachment 4		CASS Ancillary Item Support List                               7 Pages

Attachment 5		MAC Kit Item Support List				  4 Pages

Attachment 6		Electro Optic (EO3) Item Support List                        1  Page	

Attachment 7		Government Furnished Property List			 27 Pages

Attachment 8  		Available Drawings List				 85 Pages

Attachment 9		CLIN / Pricing Structure				 58 Pages

Attachment 10		Current Fielding Schedule				   1 Page

The draft attachments will appear on the NAVAIR homepage located at http://www.navair.navy.mil.  Select "Doing Business With Us" and then "Open Solicitations", under document number N68335-07-RFC-0037.

Please provide written feedback on this proposed solicitation including all of the attachments enclosed.  All comments or discussions pertaining to improving or enhancing the procurement that industry feels to be necessary should be submitted.  Possible topics that are of interest to the Government are: 

a.	Innovative ideas for handling technology refresh and obsolescence issues.
b.	Ideas on handling residual spares that may be remaining at the end of this contract. 
c.	Ideas on handling transition from previous contract to the this contract.

<DESC>MARKET RESEARCH AND SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS.  The Government is issuing the sources sought announcement as part of a market research effort to obtain information on companies who can provide the expertise  needed for engineering and test support for multiple Joint Tactical Common Operational Picture (COP) Workstation (JTCW) Developmental Test (DT) events at Marine Corps Tactical Systems Support Activity (MCTSSA), Camp Pendleton, CA from April to October 2007, in support of a fielding decision for the Joint Tactical Common Operational Picture (COP) Workstation (JTCW) Developmental Test (DT) 1.0 in Sep 07.  MCTSSA is the lead agency for the DT events.  This is a short-fuse effort with a large scope.  The types of support required are as follows:  Subject Matter Expertise (SME) on participating systems, system engineers to participate in requirements analysis and translate test objectives to test cases, test documentation writers (test plan, procedures, report), and system oper!  ators.  It is possible that these test events could be run in parallel as a risk mitigation to schedule slippages with the exception that the last DT is an overarching test event and can not be run until the first three DTs are completed.  The last test event will require SME support from the previous DTs.  The expertise is needed in the area of Common Aviation Command and Control Systems (CAC2S), Link-16, Advanced Field Artillery Tactical Data Systems (AFATDS), Command and Control Personal Computer Program (C2PC), Effects Management Tool (EMT), The Data Handler (DH)/Army’s Publish and Subscribe Server (PASS).

<DESC>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), on behalf of the National Institute of National Center for Research Resources (NCRR), is conducting a market survey to determine the availability and potential technical capability of small business organizations interested in this requirement.  This acquisition may be solicited as full and open or as small business set-aside including 8(a), HubZone, and Service Disabled Veterans as defined by the Small Business Act.  The applicable NAICS code is 541710 and the size standard is 500 employees.  Small Business sources are sought that possess the capability to provide support services described below for the NCRR.  The new contract is anticipated to be awarded on September 30, 2007 for a period of five years. 

As part of the NIH Roadmap for Medical Research process to Reengineer the Clinical Research Enterprise, NIH issued an RFA for institutional Clinical and Translational Science Awards (CTSA).  The purpose of the CTSA initiative, which is a joint NCRR and NIH Roadmap activity, is to assist institutions to forge a uniquely transformative, novel, and integrative academic home for Clinical and Translational Science.  These new Clinical and Translational Science entities are expected to serve as a magnet that concentrates basic, translational, and clinical investigators, community clinicians, clinical practices, networks, professional societies, and industry to facilitate the development of new professional interactions, programs, and research projects. It is anticipated that these new institutional arrangements, coupled with innovative advanced degree programs, will foster the development of a new discipline of Clinical and Translational Science that will be both broader and more pervasive than the classical and separate domains of translational research and clinical investigation.  When fully implemented in 2012, about 60 CTSA programs will be supported.

As part of this cooperative initiative, CTSA awardees will participate in trans-CTSA Steering Committees in areas of broad interest to discuss and address national issues through sharing and cooperation.  Although NIH anticipates that awardees will differ in their internal structures and emphasis, informatics, human protection, training, and clinical service are envisioned to be areas of shared interest with national level Steering Committees for each area.  Project management and technical support of these Steering Committees in their cooperative activities will be necessary for accomplishment of shared projects.
The purpose of this acquisition is to seek small business organizations capable of providing project management and technical support for the institutional CTSA program.  The Contractor shall provide technical support to the NCRR Division of Clinical Research for CTSA activities where the current staffing and research management resources are limited.  Contractor activities shall include: 1) project management/executive secretary staffing for CTSA Steering Committees, NIH CTSA Subcommittees, and Working groups; 2) establish, maintain, and manage a web based password protected collaborative workspace for above groups; 3) establish, maintain, and manage a public CTSA web site for dissemination of activities and products; 4) logistics and meeting support services for CTSA Steering Committees, NIH CTSA Subcommittees, and Working Group meetings; 5) provision of qualified subcontracted or consultant technical expertise in a timely fashion; 6) administrative management and oversight for the review process of informatics pilot projects; and 7) provision of contract closeout and orderly transition.  

Interested firms that are classified under NAICS code 541710 should furnish capability information addressing the following:  

(a)	the experience of the organization in performing other similar contract programs

(b)	ability to prepare Annual Performance and Operating Plans 

(c)	the ability of the organization to effectively and quickly obtain and manage subcontracts, for highly specialized technical services not performed in-house, and maintain complete and effective labor, technical, and management control of the program

(d)	the ability of the organization to provide high level project management staffing  for CTSA Steering Committees, NIH CTSA Subcommittees, and Working Groups; the personnel must provide careful attention to detail, organizational skill, excellent oral and written skills, ability to work independently, and working knowledge of a variety of technical areas related to clinical and translational research

(e)	the ability of the organization to provide appropriate project management and planning processes, including staffing, scheduling, reporting, and cost control; ability and experience of the organization to effectively transition at the start and end of similar contracts and to adapt quickly to different workload levels over time

(f)	experience and competence in managing the independent review and evaluation of scientific and technical proposals in a timely fashion, including the provision of evaluation reports

(g)	the ability of the organization to develop and revise technical documents, in the most efficient and cost-effective manner

(h)	the ability of the organization to provide IT support services, including programming, website development and hosting and database development; the ability to provide password protected web based collaborative work space for collaborative groups with appropriate attention to IT security issues.

(i)	the ability of the organization to arrange and support professional meetings in the most efficient and cost-effective manner, including consideration of travel and other meeting-related tasks and expenses; ability to provide access to and management of various mechanisms for virtual meetings, including but not limited to, telephone and video conferencing

(j)	the ability of the organization to meet with NCRR staff at the NIH in Bethesda, Maryland with as little as two hours advance notice


This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) and none is available.  An original and two copies of the capability statement should be submitted to:

<DESC>Bagram Air Field, in Afghanistan, is interested in contracting with a company to provide assistance to Afghanistan Companies working on construction projects. Currently we are looking for master craftsmen, in their field, to provide oversight and training to apprentices (Afghan workers). We would require that you provide us with your employee's proper documentation as to their skill and a simple resume, if we post a formal solicitation.

The basic concept of the contract would include, but definitely not limited to; an electrician, a plumber, a HVAC trainer, horizontal flatwork (paving) trainer, and a structural (carpentry, welding, steel framing) instructor. The trainers would not be performing the building, they would be on site assisting and advising the Afghanistan workers. Translators and security can be provided.

The idea behind this posting is to see if there is a market for this type of work. Please send me an email at david.j.ely@afghan.swa.army.mil if your company would be interested in bidding on a contract of this type. Please don't send emails with a lot of questions about the work just yet. If we find that there is adequate competition, then we will post a formal request for quote.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)

This is a Request for Information (RFI) and not a Request for Proposal (RFP).  The purpose of this RFI is to request information from interested parties supporting the acquisition of services to provide individualized information and technical assistance on job accommodations and other employment issues to individuals with disabilities, employers, and employment service providers.  This is a request for written information only.  This is not a solicitation announcement for proposals and no contract will be awarded from this announcement.

Background:  The Job Accommodation Network (JAN), established originally in 1983, is a free, national service of the U.S. Department of Labor??s Office of Disability Employment Policy (ODEP).  JAN supplies publications, online resources, and technical assistance, at no cost, to employers, people with disabilities, employment service providers, educational institutions and others, regarding individualized job accommodations and workplace strategies for job applicants and employees with disabilities, and on a broad range of issues related to the employment of people with disabilities, including self-employment and entrepreneurship. JAN is staffed by experts, at least 80% of whom have masters level or higher degrees in the areas of law, economics, safety and environment, rehabilitation, and psychology.

NO SOLICITATION PACKAGE IS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME AND REQUESTS FOR SOLICITATION PACKAGES WILL NOT RECEIVE A RESPONSE.  The applicable NAICS code is 485999 and the Size Standard is $6,500,000.  NIH is in the process creating an acquisition strategy for NIH Shuttle Services and needs information on how commercial entities address fuel prices.  NIH contemplates making the solicitation for shuttle services either Firm Fixed Price with no adjustment for fuel, Firm Fixed Price with an Economic Price Adjustment for fuel, or allowing a type of fuel surcharge.  To assist NIH in choosing the most suitable means of soliciting shuttle services from commercial entities, NIH is asking information from potential vendors on how their current contracts are structured in response to escalating fuel prices since fuel is a major cost for shuttle services.  It is in the best interest of companies interested in this requirement to respond to this RFI as it may affect the contract type for this future requirement.

Contractors may respond to this RFI by commenting on how their current (or past) contracts with both Commercial and Governmental Customers address fuel costs or offer suggestions on how this cost can be addressed in any future solicitation for shuttle services.  Responses on current or past contracts should include contact information of the Contracting Officer administering the contract (include name, email address, and phone number). To assist vendors in understanding this future requirement, the current Statement of Work for Shuttle Services is attached.  Because this RFI is for fueling information only, responses only containing marketing information on your company will not be accepted. 

This RFI relates to market research conducted under Sources Sought 263-2007-M(GO)-0045 which can be found at http://www.fbo.gov/servlet/Solicitation/R/HHS/NIH/OoA/263-2007-M(GO)-0045.  
  
 NO REIMBURSEMENT WILL BE MADE FOR ANY COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH PROVIDING INFORMATION IN RESPONSE TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT AND ANY FOLLOW-UP INFORMATION REQUESTS.  RESPONDENTS WILL NOT BE NOTIFIED OF THE RESULTS OF THE REVIEWS.  ALL INFORMATION SUBMITTED IN RESPONSE TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT MUST BE RECEIVED ON OR BEFORE THE CLOSING DATE.

<SUBJECT>R -- Workers? Compensation Claims Management
<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION:  Workers? Compensation Claims Management 

Please read this Request for Information (RFI) notice carefully.

INTRODUCTION

The U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC) is developing requirements for a contract to provide Department-wide and centralized submission and management of workers? compensation claims in compliance with the Federal Employees? Compensation Act (FECA).  The contract will provide a mechanism to manage work-related injuries and illnesses sustained by Department employees from initial claim submission to the Department of Labor (DOL), Office of Workers? Compensation Programs (OWCP), through return-to-work or disability retirement. The anticipated contract will also provide a mechanism to electronically record and manage data related to workers? compensation case management and occupational illnesses and injuries data as required by OSHA as stated in 29 CFR 1904, Recording and Reporting Occupational Injuries and Illnesses and the Presidential Safety, Health and Return to Employment (SHARE) initiative.  

BACKGROUND

The Department?s workers? compensation program is centralized and routinely services approximately 30,000 employees from the principal organizational components and offices of the Department.  The United States Patent and Trademark Office is excluded from this centralized program.  During fiscal year 2006, the Department experienced approximately 450 total work-related injuries and illnesses with approximately 230 resulting in lost time. 

This service level undergoes major changes due to the activities of the Bureau of the Census.  Each decennial cycle generates a dramatic increase in workers? compensation cases. The Federal workers? compensation program covers decennial employees and the Department?s workers? compensation program services approximately 900,000
short-term employees for this several month period. This requires scalability in the DOC program to meet the increased cyclical demand.  In addition, the short employment duration necessitates rapid and efficient claims management to ensure employees are returned to work as quickly as medically possible. 
  
Purpose

The purpose of this request for information (RFI) is to gather information to assist the U.S. Department of Commerce in formulating its requirements and identify businesses, which have the ability to fulfill all of the U.S. Department of Commerce workers? compensation program requirements.  

 
DESCRIPTION OF INFORMATION REQUESTED

All vendors are invited to submit a capability statement related to Federal employee workers? compensation claims management.  The capabilities must leverage and partner with the DOC professional workers? compensation specialists as well as OWCP staff to address each requirement of the FECA process.  This includes, but is not limited to: 

1.	Primary contact for information and customer service to injured employees and their managers
2.	Receipt and review of new claims
3.	Timely submission of new claims to OWCP
4.	Case management of new claims
5.	Case management of long-term or periodic roll cases
6.	Provide claims management recommendations (e.g. additional medical review, referral to fraud investigation)
7.	Perform program advisory function to include training of supervisors
8.	Supply claims data management
9.	Report preparation for both DOC and DOL
10.	Contribute to return-to-work activities
11.	Scalability for increased and decreased demand related to decennial census

DISCLAIMER

This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a solicitation.  In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  Respondents are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI.  Responses to this RFI will not be returned.  Respondents will not be notified of the results of this request.

<SUBJECT>A -- SN07-20- Cognitive Technology Threat Warning System
<DESC>Special Notice SN07-20
Cognitive Technology Threat Warning System 
Proposer's Day Workshop 
DATE: March 13, 2007 
REGISTRATION DEADLINE:  March 7, 2007 
TECHNICAL POCs: Dr. Douglas Kirkpatrick, DARPA/STO and Dr. Amy A. Kruse, DARPA/DSO 
Email: douglas.kirkpatrick@darpa.mil; amy.kruse@darpa.mil 
URL: www.darpa.mil/dso/solicitations/solicit.htm.

In anticipation of a potential program on the topic of Cognitive Technology Threat Warning System (CT2WS), DARPA is hosting a Proposer's Day Workshop that will provide information on the program vision, program milestones and opportunities associated with the development of an interdisciplinary team to respond to a planned upcoming solicitation; BAA07-25.  BAA07-25 is anticipated for release in March 2007, not concurrent with the release of this Special Announcement, although nothing herein obligates the government to release the subject Broad Agency Announcement (BAA).  The Proposer's Day Workshop, however, will be held on March 13, 2007, in Arlington, Virginia. 

The objective of the DARPA CT2WS program is to drive a breakthrough in soldier-portable visual threat warning devices. Recent developments and discoveries in the disparate technology areas of flat field wide angle optics, large pixel count digital imagers, cognitive visual processing algorithms, neurally-based target detection signatures and ultra-low power analog-digital hybrid signal processing electronics have led DARPA to believe that focused technology development, system design, and system integration efforts may produce revolutionary capabilities for the warfighter. The specific goals and milestones of the DARPA CT2WS program will be detailed in the Broad Agency Announcement, BAA07-25, if released at a future date. DARPA is not aware of any single company or institution capable of spanning the requisite technical breadth and anticipates that a highly interdisciplinary team will be required to perform the effort and deliver several prototype soldier-portable units. The Proposer's Day will facilitate the formation of teams with the necessary expertise to respond to the upcoming Broad Agency Announcement, but attendance at the Proposer's Day Workshop is not required in order to respond to any upcoming solicitation that may be issued. 

The teaming and information session will be held at The Executive Conference Center, 3601 Wilson Blvd Suite 600, Arlington, VA, on March 13, 2007. The goals of the teaming and information session are: (a) introduce the research community (industry, academia, and Government) to the Cognitive Technology Threat Warning System (CT2WS) program vision and goals; (b) to explain the mechanics of a DARPA Program and the milestones and metrics of this particular effort, and (c) encourage and promote teaming arrangements among potential  organizations that have the relevant expertise, facilities, and capabilities for executing a research and development program responsive to the CT2WS program goals.

	                           					  Enclosure (1) to COMDTINST 4200.14A

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.

CONTRACT/AGREEMENT TYPE - NAVAIR is willing to consider various types of acquisition strategies including, but not limited to, traditional contracts using FAR/DFARS and/or non-procurement agreements e.g. Cooperative Agreements under 10 U.S.C. 2358 and Technology Incentive Awards under 10 U.S.C. 2371 or U.S.C. 2358 (Congressional direction requires that at least 50 percent of the cost of a project under this initiative be provided by industry) and Section 845, Authority to Carry Out Certain Prototype Projects. Acquisition type (contract/agreement) is ultimately determined by the Government. NOTE: Typically, research findings result in the need for additional services/supplies, which are not possible to anticipate or project. Contract/agreement modifications may be executed to satisfy these requirements, thereby providing for flexibility in technology assessment (with technology transition the ultimate goal). In the event that this is required, it shall be considered to be within the scope of this BAA and the resulting contract/agreement, and therefore will have met the requirements of the FAR/DFARS and the Competition in Contracting Act. AWARDS - Contract award will be based on the proposal?s technical merit, cost, and availability of appropriations. The Government reserves the right to select all, some, or none of the proposals received in response to this announcement. There is no commitment by the Navy to be responsible for any monies expended by the offeror prior to award of a contract/agreement. For awards made as contracts, the socio-economic merits of each proposal will be evaluated based on the commitment to provide meaningful subcontracting opportunities with small business, small disadvantaged business, woman-owned small business concerns, and HBCU/MIS. Offerors are cautioned that only a Contracting Officer is legally authorized to commit the Government. POINTS OF CONTACT - The technical point of contact is Dr. James Sheehy, AIR 4.6T (301) 342-8480, e-mail: mailto:James.Sheehy@navy.mil, while Ms. Roberta Nethercutt (301) 757-8939, email: mailto:roberta.nethercutt@navy.mil is the point of contact for all contractual matters.

Request for Proposal VA-777-07-RP-0005 is in accordance with FAR Subpart 12.6-Streamlined Procedures for Evaluation and Solicitation for Commercial Items.   This is not a solicitation for Event Planning Services.  For a proposal submitted by an offeror that is not a hotel, the offeror, not the hotel, is to be considered the prime contractor.  Therefore, that offeror must describe in its proposal the technical approach for the offeror's services as a prime contractor and must also include a copy of all insurance(s) (standard business, liability, extraordinary insurances) in order to submit a complete technical proposal for evaluation purposes. (Again, this is not a solicitation for Event Planning Services.  An offer which requires the Government to execute a separate agreement with a third party hotel shall be deemed technically unacceptable.)   This announcement incorporates FAR provisions and clauses in effect through  FAR FAC 2005-14, Effective November 22, 2006 and VAAR 97-10.

A separate written solicitation document will not be issued.

A Hotel Contract shall be submitted with your technical and price proposal, along with descriptive literature to include sleeping rooms, meeting room space, diagrams and square footage, information (availability/cost) on amenities of hotel i.e., parking, shuttle services; transportation to/from airport, menus.  The hotel facility must be FEMA approved and listed on the U.S. Fire Administration Hotel and Motel National Master List found at http://www.usfa.fema.gov/hotel/search.cfm.  In accordance with FAR 52.204.7 - Central Contractor Registration (Oct 2003); contractors are Required To Register in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database http://www.ccr.gov,  PRIOR to award of any contract.  In addition, the offeror's facility must be compliant with the requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act (Public Law 101-336) (42 U.S.C. 12101 et. Seq.). The hotel facility must accommodate an estimated 250 attendees with the following needs:   Part A: Hotel Lodging- (1a) 5 sleeping rooms on Sunday; 225 sleeping rooms on Monday through Wednesday and 15 sleeping rooms on Thursday.

<DESC>This amendment extends the closing date of this announcement to 4:00 PM EST on February 23, 2007.

In accordance with FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition procedures, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) intends to procure a technical expert that would work with the Office of Behavioral and Social Sciences Research (OBSSR) to develop programs and initiatives involving interdisciplinary collaborative research across the full range of disciplines and stakeholders necessary to fully elucidate the complex determinants of health and health systems challenges.  This acquisition is a 100% small business set-aside and the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541690 with a small business standard of $6.5 million.  


The period of performance is from the date of award to September 29, 2008 with one option year from September 30, 2008 to September 29, 2009.  The place of performance will include NIH and offsite (including contractor facility).


Background:

OBSSR furthers the mission of NIH by emphasizing the critical role that behavioral and social factors play in health, health care and well-being. OBSSR serves as the focal point for coordination and development of NIH policies, goals, and objectives in the behavioral and social sciences at NIH. OBSSR is also a liaison between the NIH intramural and extramural communities, other Federal agencies, academic and scientific societies, national voluntary health agencies, the biomedical research community, the media, and the general public on matters pertaining to behavioral and social sciences research.  

Based on its Strategic Prospectus, OBSSR?s vision is to bring together the biomedical, behavioral, and social science communities to work more collaboratively to solve the pressing health challenges facing our nation. OBSSR?s plan includes facilitating: (a) the next generation of basic behavioral and social science research; (b) transdisciplinary ?team science? that integrates biomedical, behavioral and social-ecological perspectives; (c) research that integrates the systems and multiple levels of analysis ? from cells to society ? required to understand and model how individual, group, societal and contextual factors interact; and (d) the translation, implementation, dissemination and maintenance of best practices to strengthen the science of dissemination, put what is known into widespread practice, reduce the burden of chronic disease and help eliminate inequities in health and health care.

Project Objectives:

The objective of this project is to develop an implementation plan for the OBSSR Strategic Prospectus.  Specifically, this contract is intended to procure a technical expert that would work with OBSSR to develop programs and initiatives involving interdisciplinary collaborative research across the full range of disciplines and stakeholders necessary to fully elucidate the complex determinants of health and health systems challenges.  Such collaborations will yield new conceptual frameworks, methods, measures, and technologies that will speed the improvement of population health.

Scope of Work:

Despite the growing enthusiasm for interdisciplinary approaches and recent models of success, broad acceptance of interdisciplinary research remains a goal for the future.  In consultation with the Project Officer, OBSSR?s Director and Staff, the Contractor shall develop programs and initiatives to facilitate an interdisciplinary, team-based approach to population health research by fostering collaborations among the broad base of stakeholders (e.g., policy makers, employers, practitioners, patients, and the general public) needed to ensure the implementation and adoption of scientific findings.

The contractor shall participate in planning and advising on implementation of the key issues and foci of the Strategic Prospectus involving interdisciplinary research. Specifically, the Contractor shall develop a detailed implementation plan in consultation with the Project Officer to achieve each of the following seven key OBSSR goals:

<DESC>This amendment extends the closing date of this announcement to 4PM EST on February 23, 2007.

In accordance with FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition procedures, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) intends to procure a technical expert that would work with the Office of Behavioral and Social Sciences Research (OBSSR) to develop research programs and initiatives in dissemination science and communications.  This acquisition is a 100% small business set-aside and the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541690 with a small business standard of $6.5 million.  

The period of performance is from the date of award to September 29, 2008 with one option year from September 30, 2008 to September 29, 2009.  The place of performance will include NIH and offsite (including contractor facility). 

Background:

OBSSR furthers the mission of NIH by emphasizing the critical role that behavioral and social factors play in health, health care and well-being. OBSSR serves as the focal point for coordination and development of NIH policies, goals, and objectives in the behavioral and social sciences at NIH. OBSSR is also a liaison between the NIH intramural and extramural communities, other Federal agencies, academic and scientific societies, national voluntary health agencies, the biomedical research community, the media, and the general public on matters pertaining to behavioral and social sciences research.  

Based on its Strategic Prospectus, OBSSR?s vision is to bring together the biomedical, behavioral, and social science communities to work more collaboratively to solve the pressing health challenges facing our nation. OBSSR?s plan includes facilitating: (a) the next generation of basic behavioral and social science research; (b) transdisciplinary ?team science? that integrates biomedical, behavioral and social-ecological perspectives; (c) research that integrates the systems and multiple levels of analysis ? from cells to society ? required to understand and model how individual, group, societal and contextual factors interact; and (d) the translation, implementation, dissemination and maintenance of best practices to strengthen the science of dissemination, put what is known into widespread practice, reduce the burden of chronic disease and help eliminate inequities in health and health care.

Project Objectives:

The objective of this project is to develop an implementation plan for the OBSSR Strategic Prospectus.  Specifically, this contract is intended to procure a technical expert that would work with OBSSR to develop research programs and initiatives in dissemination science and communications.
 
Scope of Work:

In today?s digitally connected environment, an infrastructure for better communications and dissemination represents a key part of OBSSR?s communications strategy.  Improving the nation?s health requires knowledge of behavior change and interactive technologies (e.g., e-health, internet-based interactive technology to change behavior).  Communications is a multi-directional process that links communities of research and practice.  Public health interventions cannot save lives if they are not implemented, and research cannot improve health if it is not informed by the needs and experiences of practitioners.  Building communication channels that link all of the stakeholders of public health into a living, participatory community will form a critical backbone for the way we approach health, disease, and wellness in the future.

The contractor shall participate in planning and advising on implementation of the key issues and foci of the Strategic Prospectus involving the science of dissemination and communication strategies and goals. Specifically, the Contractor shall develop a detailed implementation plan in consultation with the Project Officer to achieve each of the following three key OBSSR strategic goals:

1.	Identifying what is known and where the gaps are in the general public?s understanding of evidence-based behavior, change tools and technology, especially e-health and interactive web, telephone and other electronic media.  

2.	Identifying or creating dissemination channels for sharing social and behavioral science perspectives, constructs, and measures in health research.

3.	Working with other expert consultants, coordinate a workgroup to identify social marketing strategies, understanding of consumer demand and direct to consumer advertising approaches to educating the public about behavioral science tools.  .  

4.	Identifying key audiences and tailoring strategic communications strategies to those audiences to increase awareness of behavioral tools.

5.	Developing a method to gather and identify the best evidence-based practices and policies for behavior change.

6.	Developing plans to improve the health literacy of the public and their ability to identify and use evidence-based behavior change tools.

Further, for each of the specific objectives developed to address the goals listed above, the Contractor shall develop performance measures that may be utilized to assess OBSSR?s performance in achieving these goals and objectives.  

All objectives should meet the SMART criteria (i.e., Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, and Timed).

?	Specific ? Be precise about what OBSSR is going to achieve in the area of problem based research. 
?	Measurable ? Quantify the objectives. 
?	Achievable ? Is OBSSR attempting too much? 
?	Realistic ? Does OBSSR have the resources to achieve the objective?
?	Timed ? State when OBSSR will achieve the objective?

The expected tasks to be completed during the period of performance are as follows:

1)	Convene a series of face-to-face meetings with the Project Officer, OBSSR?s Director and Staff members to consider the six goals listed above
2)	Using the information gathered in task 1, develop an implementation plan to refine the goals with specific objectives and performance indicators of progress and success
3)	Prepare the draft strategic implementation plan for the refined goals listed above
4)	Circulate the draft plan to stakeholders and NIH Behavioral and Social Sciences Coordinating Committee for review and comments
5)	Revise the plan based on the comments received
6)	Finalize the plan for publication

The Contractor shall assist in developing an evaluation plan and indicators for the implementation of the strategic priorities and specific objectives.  The Assessment Plan is critical to the ongoing progress and success of the Office?s efforts.  The Contractor shall develop indicators of progress and success.

OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington, D. C. 20593, Telephone (202) 267-2285, Fax: (202) 267-4011. Potential sources having the expertise and required capabilities are invited to submit quotations that will be considered by the agency.

Response:  Section H is limited to the two criterions for a total number of 17 pages.

31.       Question:	The 34 specified disciplines do not include program management and logistical support.  Since these are critical functions, especially in first responder tasks, where within the SF330 are these professional qualifications to be detailed?

Will the construction be done by local/indigenous businesses (as opposed to US contractors)?  Is the intention to build local capability?  How will the construction contracts be competed?
 
Response:	Yes, it is envisioned that the construction will be done by local organizations.  Yes, its USAID?s intention is to build local capacity; and the construction contract will be full and open competitions amongst local organizations.

23.	Question:  Does the individual proposed to perform Engineering Economics and Institutional and Policy Reform need to have a Bachelor of Science in Engineering?

Response:  No, a Bachelor of Science in Engineering is not required; just a Bachelor of Science degree or whatever is appropriate for that field.

24.	Question:  These positions must have a minimum requirement of a Bachelor of Science degree, a minimum of five (5) years relevant experience in the proposed discipline, and the applicable licensing requirements.  Based on the amendment listing the positions for which resumes are required, is a BS required for all positions or would a BA also be applicable?   

		Response:  A Bachelor of Arts is also applicable.

25.	Question: The offerors must provide resumes (Section E of the SF330) for these disciplines including consultants. For this section, the resumes must be no more than one page per discipline, for a maximum of 34 pages. Does the Offeror need to provide a resume for all of the listed disciplines to have their bid considered?

Response:  The technical instruction for this criterion now requires 35 resumes based on the listed disciplines.  If the offeror does not provide 35 resumes then the offeor will be deemed non-responsive to the requirement.  These 34 resumes can be personnel/consultants from the prime contractor and/or the proposed subcontractors.
 
26.	Question:  Can a resume be used for multiple disciplines? For example, an Environmental Engineer with sufficient experience and a degree that also satisfies the Sanitary Engineer requirements?

Response:  No, one resume cannot be used for multiple disciplines.   The Agency is looking to assess the firm?s broad capabilities.  However, there may be some occasions where a specialist will be required to perform multiple disciplines.   

27.	Question:  The combined synopsis/solicitation for solicitation number M-OAA-EGAT-PEP-07-274 states that A-E firms will be evaluated in accordance with criteria including the following: 1) professional qualifications?....(weight 25 points); and 2) past performance on contracts??..(weight 30 points).  For professional qualifications, bidders are limited to 34 pages (i.e., 34 resumes).  For past performance on contracts, bidders are limited to 10 projects.

Given the depth and breath of the overall architecture and engineering disciplines (water, environment, transport, power, etc.) that will be required to carry out the types of work envisaged under this contract (the transport sector alone, for example, can be disaggregated into more than two dozen sub-disciplines), the evaluation committee would be better informed regarding the capabilities of each bidder if the number of resumes AND projects were expanded to comprehensively demonstrate each bidder?s capabilities in each of the specified disciplines.  Will USAID consider expanding the number of resumes and projects to be submitted in the proposal?

Response: No, USAID will not expand the number of resumes and projects.  As indicated in the combined synopsis/solicitation, 35 resumes (Please see question number 2 where the Program Manager position was added) and 10 projects are required.

The Original Response Date is revised from March 9, 2007 to March 15, 2007.
QUESTIONS AND RESPONSES:
1.  	Question:  We understand that the font size is 12.  Can the tables, graphics and figures be 9 point? Can you also please clarify does size 12"refer to 12 Point or 12 Pitch?
Response:  The requirement for the font size has changed for the SF330 from 12 to 10 or larger.  For graphs, tables, and charts the font size can be 9 or higher.
2.	Question:  In Section E-the wording in the solicitations says, The offeror must have, either in-house or through consultants,  the following disciplines that are licensed, registered or certified where applicable.  However no list follows.  Are we to decide, or will you send a list so bidders will be using the same categories?
Response:  Below please find the List of Disciplines that were inadvertently left out of the Combined Synopsis/Solicitation.  Please notice that the Program Manager discipline, number 35 has been added to this listing.

3.	Question:  Will all selected firms be required to prepare a proposal for every task order? 
Response:  Yes, the firms that are awarded an Indefinite Quantity Contract will be required to submit technical proposals at the task order stage.  These firms will be evaluated based on the firm?s technical capacity, including proposed personnel as it relates to the statement of work and other additional information as required. 
4.	Question:  Would you consider increasing the 17 page limit for Section "H" to 25 pages? 
Response:  The page limit for these two sections is 17 pages.
5.	Question:  As stated under ?Submission Requirements, our SF 330 submittal must be prepared using a font size of Times Roman 12 point. This font size is very limiting, especially considering the template of the 330 form, and is not consistent with the 10 characters per inch requirement. Is it acceptable to change this font size requirement to a proportional spacing Times Roman 10-point font to help us to provide enough information to address all of the requirements of our submittal, especially for the resumes in Section E and project descriptions in Section F? Also, if we provide any summary tables and figures as part of the Section H information, can we use a smaller font size?
Response:  It is acceptable for the SF330 to be prepared using the font size 10 or larger.   However, offerors can use font size 9 or larger for charts, graphs, and tables.
6.	Question:  The 1-inch margin specified is not consistent with the SF 330 template downloaded from the GSA website. Is it acceptable to prepare our submittal using the same margins as this template, which is approximately 1/2 inch on all sides?
Response:  Yes, the offerors can use the same margins as the template on the GSA website which is ? on the right and left hand margins.
7.	Question:  The instructions for professional qualifications are unclear. The anncted firm(s)? 	

Response:  A date has not been established at this time.

42.	Question:  Page 1 of the solicitation indicates that "USAID encourages subcontracting opportunities with eligible US or Non-US organizations under Geographic Code 935 countries". We currently have strategic alliances with organizations in a few of these countries. Should we include information on these firms in our response to this solicitation?

Response: Yes, if your organization is considering these organizations to be included as a part of your team.   

43.	Question:  In the Selection Process section, the solicitation states that at least 3 of the most qualified firms will be given 3 weeks to respond "regarding concepts relevant to scope of work." Is this for the Global IQC selection? Or is this for a specific project once the firm has been selected to be on the Global IQC?

Response:  Yes, it?s a part of the evaluation process for the Global IQC.

44.	Question:  In the same Selection Process section, the solicitation states that 3 weeks will be given to provide a cost submission. Is this at the same time as the aforementioned response to the scope of work? Or after the scope of work response has been reviewed?

Response:  After the scope of work response has been reviewed (after the SF330 submittal).  	
45.	Question:  "Pursuant to the negotiation process, USAID will issue cost related instructions pertaining to the cost submission to the short-listed firms and those firms will be given approximately three (3) weeks to provide a cost submission. After two (2) weeks from receipt of the initial cost submission, if USAID and the A-E firm(s) are not able to reach an agreement, USAID reserves the right to terminate cost negotiations and to begin negotiations with the next most highly rated A-E firm. Upon USAID and the selected A-E firms reaching an agreement, USAID will distribute a DRAFT contract for their review." 

In terms of the general sequence/timing of the evaluation of costs submissions, shouldn?t USAID provide the selected, short-listed A-E firms with a DRAFT contract for review as a part of USAID's request for cost submissions, rather than after reaching an agreement with the firm(s)?  Please clarify USAID's thinking in this area.

Response:  As stated in the combined synopsis/solicitation USAID will reach an agreement with the firms on the cost proposal prior to distributing the contracts for the firm?s review. 

46.	Question:  Are letters of association permitted/required?

Response:  Yes, letters of commitment are required for subcontractors on your team.

47.	Question:  Are we allowed to include appendices for supplemental information?

Response:  Supplemental information can consist of letters of commitment, graphs, charts, and tables.

48.	Question:  Assuming that USAID awards multiple contracts under this solicitation, please explain how individual task orders will be assigned. Will each task order be subject to competition based on cost or technical capability? Or will USAID use some other process for awarding task orders?

Response:  See the response to question number 3.

49.	Question:  Can USAID provide any more specific position requirements for key personnel under this contract? In particular, one of the 34 disciplines listed in Amendment number2 is ?project manager.? Is this intended to be our contract manager key person, and if so, what specific requirements must that manager have, besides the minimum requirements listed in the original solicitation notice, if any?

Response:  No, the project manager is not the contract manager.  The project manager is considered the task order manager and their requirements would vary with the assignment and nature of the task order.  The program manager (discipline number 35) is considered the contract manger.
50.	Question:  In the Amendment to Combined Synopsis/Solicitation 01 ? Posted on January 24, 2007, under the section entitled ?Type of Contract/Period of Performance/Estimated Cost:?; the award of 3 IQC contracts is anticipated with a 5 year ceiling of $500 million, and the ceiling will not be divided amongst the contract holders. 

How will the selection process work for award of a single task order under the contract? Will each task order or assignment be competed for between the three firms based on fixed daily rates, or some other criteria?

Response:  See the response to question number 3.

51.	Question: Will all Rate Schedules quoted for the work be based on $US dollars and daily rates for each individual category of engineer, architect, and support staff? 

Response:  Yes.  There will be a fixed daily rate schedule in the contract that will be in US dollars for each of the 35 disciplines.

52.	Question: Where can we see a copy of the USAID Contract Document, terms and conditions related to Indemnification language and the Limitation of Liabilities associated with Architect-Engineer professional services work? 

Response:  FAR Subpart 36.6 provides information regarding contractor liability/responsibility for design errors or deficiencies.  No limitation of liability clauses are envisioned for this contract.  In accordance with FAR Subpart 50.403, the USG provides indemnification to contractors only in situations where ?unusually hazardous or nuclear risks? are present.  USAID does not intend to provide indemnification to contractors under this contract.  

53.	Question:  The contract mentions that the contractor may be required to perform work may in disaster/conflict areas. Question: Putting disaster areas aside for the moment, does a conflict area include hostile and war-torn areas where the personal safety of our employees is an issue? Question: And if so, would the contractor have the option to turn down an assignment where the company feared for the safety of employees in that kind of situation. 

Response:  The offerors should recognize that working in conflict/disaster prone areas is a major part of this statement of work.

54.	Question: To receive credit for the 15% small and disadvantaged business concerns that perform work under the team, would that only apply to those who meet that criteria in the US, or could a company in a foreign country who was a team member count if they met the equivalent criteria in their country (thinking of South Africa or similar governments)? 

55.	Response:  No.  Non-U.S. team members can not count equivalent criteria in a foreign country.  Foreign countries are not qualified as small businesses as defined by the Small Business Administration.

<DESC>1.	Amendment 0002 is hereby incorporated into Request for Proposal (RFP) number SP3100-07-R-0008 and shall become a part of any resultant contract.

2.	The following is a response to contractor submitted questions:

Question:  One of the answers given in regards to the rubbing strips stipulates to make holes on the skid sides for fork truck access.  It goes on to stipulate that the holes are off center "because the weight is off center ? refer to drawing".  The drawing in MIL-C-3774B stipulates where to place the fork lift openings based on the Center Point of the ?BALANCE?.  Need to know where the center point will be located on these skids based on the unit being loaded onto the skids in order to properly place the fork lift openings.  Or, should the fork openings be placed based on the Balance Center for the Crate Only?

Answer:  The drawing that has been supplied as an attachment provides the necessary measurements to put the fork openings where they need to be.

Question:  The question was raised about the MAX load for these crates and the response was: "Use Type I Classification, per MIL-C-3774B" ? The original solicitation stipulated that these crates were to be of Type II.  Are these crates to be TYPE II in design with the weight limitations based on TYPE I or is this a complete change from the original solicitation to make these crates completely adhere to TYPE I design?

Answer:  Use the Type II in design but with the weight limitation of 10,000#s.

Question:  Are there any specific locations that this unit, being shipped on the skids, needs to have the "Load Bearing Floorboards" located? Is there a preferred size of the "Load Bearing Floorboards" in regards to height & width, and how many "Load Bearing Floorboards" would be more than adequate in order to ensure safe shipment?

Answer:  Refer to the hand drawn picture and Figure 2 in the MIL-DTL-55507F(CR) for placement of the Load Bearing Floorboards).  Refer to the MIL specs as to the correct size to use.

3.  The closing date for submission of offers will remain as February 20, 2007 at 3:30 PM.

CDT 5 March 2007 to 10:00 A.M. CDT 7 March 2007. 3. The following is a response to contractors submitted questions: Question: Is there any details on the cutout for programming of cuts is a plasma cut acceptable?  Answer: Does not matter how the material is cut as long as it is smoothed to ease installation and to prevent injury to personnel installing the units.  Question: We have another concern with this solicitation after discussion with the engineers and fabrication group.  Abrasion resistant AR500 plate in 1/4 inch is does not lend itself to being bent for the tab required for the front plate configuration on Line Item 0001.  This will lead to fracture and breaking problems as this plate is too brittle for this operation.  We felt that this was something that needed to be brought up and we have made the switch to a welded on tab to serve the same purpose.  Plea se confirm if this is acceptable. Answer: Does not matter how it is done as long as it allows for the sections to be easily and securely connected.  Question: We need a little clarification on Item number 0001: Where it states two tapered sides at 48 inches high, is this referring to the length of the sides of the front plate or something else?  Answer: It will be 33in high when erected. After consideration of the 22deg angle then the plate itself will have a height of approximately 48in. 3. Further clarification on Line 0002 and 0003. The provided diagrams provided for Lines 0002 and 0003 are correct.  However, supports will need to be approximately 2 inches from the outside edge to allow overlap.
