Due to the complexity and criticality of this part, only manufacturers that have successfully completed all testing required by the original company responsible for the design, or manufacturers that have successfully completed all testing on items determined by the Government to be similar in complexity and criticality, can be considered approved sources for this item.  
Current qualified sources are:  Goodrich (Cage: 3CPE0), Authority: 10 U.S.C. 2304(C)(1), Justification: Supplies (or Services) required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source(s) and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The proposed contract action is for supplies in which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one, or a limited number of sources under authority of FAR 6.302.  
All proposals received within 45 days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A Determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.
Based on market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services.  However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.
Note: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from Offerors or potential Offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Interested parties are invited to call the Ombudsman at (405) 736-8253.  DO NOT CALL THIS NUMBER FOR SOLICITATION REQUESTS.

Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. 
Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made.

This is a pre-solicitation notice and not an RFP. <br>  <br> The Government anticipates a 100% small business set-aside RFP.  It is anticipated that a final Fedbizopps Announcement and solicitation will be released in late December 2012 with proposals due an estimated 15 days after release of the solicitation. <br>  <br> The Government anticipates awarding a Firm Fixed Price Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract with five (5), twelve (12) month ordering periods.

<DESC>****ATTENTION****ALL FORMAL COMMUNICATION RELATED TO THIS ACQUISITION MUST BE DIRECTED TO: Darryl Wright, Contract Specialist, email: darryl.wright2@us.army.mil.  No telephone calls will be accepted. The Army Contracting Command-Redstone proposes to award a contract for tactical and non-tactical, Integrated Family of Test Equipment (IFTE) Base Shop Test Facility (BSTF)/Commercial Equivalent Equipment (CEE)/Electro-Optics Test Station (EOTS)/Electro-Optics Test Facility (EOTF)/Next Generation Automated Test System (NGATS) Repair and Calibration of Secondary Items for Fiscal Year 2012 through FY 2016, by other than full and open competition to Northrop Grumman Corporation, 600 Hicks Road, Rolling Meadows, IL  60008-1098, (Cage Code: 26916).  The new contract will be a five-year contract consisting of the repair and calibration items which are planned to be Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF) requirements type contract.  The repair of tactical and non-tactical Contract Line Item Number (CLIN) will have a maximum ceiling for number of repairs.  The repair and calibration portion of this contract cannot be adequately defined to develop a fixed price as there are various levels of repair required.  The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source, Northrop Grumman Corp.  The Government suggest that small business firms, or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with this procurement, make contact with the firm(s) listed.  This acquisition covers potential future requirements for five (5) years; however, this does not preclude the Government from ordering the maximum quantity at any time during the requirements period.  Orders will be issued one or more times as repair and return materialize.<br>Below is the complete listing of Repair and Calibration items:<br> <br>#	NSN	Part

<DESC>NASA/JSC has a requirement for post machining of twelve 48 tank hemispheres. These hemispheres make up the propellant tanks for the Morpheus vehicle, which supports the Advanced Exploration Systems Program. These hemispheres for the propellant tanks are critical components to the vehicle and its qualification testing.    NASA/JSC intends to purchase the items from Granite State Manufacturing (GSM). GSM developed a customized fixture in approximately 2 months to machine the jagged hemispheres into the required complex dimensions.  It would severely impact the schedule for the government to have another manufacturer develop the tooling, processes, and for NASA to certify another process to produce similar finished products, and then to perform additional qualification testing.   Additionally, NASA/JSC requires that these twelve tank hemispheres be similar to the initial ten hemispheres originally machined. This factor is important, as it is integral to the assembly, function and performance of the final assembled tanks. It is critical for all these tank hemispheres to follow the same manufacturing process and be made on the same tooling, as any changes can add variability to the finished product and potentially result in the need for additional repairs in the future. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to Rochelle Overstreet not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on December 17, 2012.

<DESC>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures with Life Technologies Corporation, Grand Island, NY, for providing human hepatocytes for conducting experiments.  This requirement is for the contractor to provide the human hepatocytes from the same donors that were used to calibrate the experimental toxicity assays for a period of 13 months on an as-needed basis.  Life Technologies Corporation is considered a unique source in that the firm supplied the hepatocytes used to calibrate the experimental toxicity assay.  It is critical that the planned experiments be conducted and data collected in cells from the same donors to maintain the metabolic capability of the experimental results. Using cells from different vendors will increase the metabolic capability variability due to the change in donors and the change in cell processing, handling, and
maintenance.  Therefore, Life Technologies is the only known source that has supplied the human hepatocytes for the experiments and can provide human hepatocytes from the same donors.  EPA believes Life Technologies Corporation is the only source capable of reasonably satisfying the requirements stated above.  The circumstance permitting "other than full and open competition is FAR 13.106-1(b), only one source reasonably available and no other supplies or service will satisfy Agency requirements.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 541712, with a small business size standard of 500 employees, is applicable.  The intent of this notice is to determine if any other source(s) exist, and therefore, no solicitation (RFQ) is available.  Consequently, any response failing to provide evidence of the aforementioned data and instead choosing to merely submit a routine letter requesting a copy of 
the RFQ will not be honored.  Interested parties who can meet the above requirements may submit written qualifications fully explaining their capability no later than 15 days after the date of this publication.  Submit response to US EPA, Attn: Jennifer Hill (E105-02), RTP Procurement Operations Division, Research Triangle Park, NC 27711 via US Postal Service or via email to hill.jennifer@epa.gov.  No telephonic or faxed request will be honored.

<DESC>Up to four (4) Unrestricted AE IDIQ Contracts for Architect/Engineer services for Army, Air Force, other military, and Civil Works projects primarily within the Great Lakes and Ohio River Division Mission Boundaries. <br> 1.)	SYNOPSIS:  This announcement is open to all businesses regardless of size.  The proposed services, which will be obtained by negotiated firm fixed price contracts, are for a variety of architect/engineer (A/E) services primarily for Army, Air Force, other military, and Civil Works projects at various locations within the Great Lakes and Ohio River Division mission boundaries.  Projects outside the primary mission area may be added at the government's discretion upon agreement of the A/E firm.   <br>  <br> Projects will be awarded by individual task orders. The maximum cumulative contract value for the total contract is $9,500,000.  This is a five year contract, with no option years.  The estimated construction cost per project is between approximately $3,000,000 and $50,000,000.   <br>  <br> Up to four firms will be selected, the top ranked firm will be awarded the first contract, the second ranked firm will be awarded the second, and so on. Award of all contracts will be made within nine (9) months after award of the first contract provided there is sufficient workload.  If necessary, secondary selection criteria will be used as a tiebreaker between firms considered as technically equal.  The following factors will be used in deciding which offeror will be selected to negotiate task orders: performance and quality of deliverables, current capacity to accomplish the work in the required time, and uniquely specialized experience.  Significant emphasis will be placed on the A/E's quality control procedures, as the District will perform the quality assurance role only.  Estimated start date is March 2013.   <br>  <br> If a large business is selected to negotiate a contract, the firm will be required to present an acceptable Small Business and Small Disadvantaged Business Subcontracting Plan in accordance with Public Law 95-507 prior to award of the contract.  The current subcontracting goals are 50.0 percent to small business, 18.0 percent to woman owned small business (WOSB), 17.0 percent to small disadvantaged business, 4.0 percent to service disabled veteran owned small business (SDVOSB), and 10.0 percent to HUB Zone small business.  These percentages are applied to the total amount of subcontracted dollars. Significant emphasis will be placed on the A/E's quality control procedures, as the district will perform the quality assurance role only. <br>  <br>  <br> In accordance with FAR 36.604 and supplements thereto, and upon final acceptance or termination, all task orders above $30,000 will receive a performance evaluation.  A performance evaluation may be prepared for lesser task orders and interim performance evaluations may be prepared at any time.  Performance evaluations will be maintained for use in future source selections for architect-engineer services.   <br>  <br> 2.)

<p><br />This announcement constitutes a Sources Sought Synopsis. It is intended as a method of informing potential contractors of the existence of a Bid Qualification Plan for an Age Identification Study of the AGM-65 SR109 Maverick Missile Rocket Motor, including a formal report to the Government.</p>
<p>This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an Invitation for Bid (IFB), nor is it to be construed as a commitment by the government. The USAF is seeking potential contractors to support an AGM-65 Maverick Missile Aging Identification Study for SR109 (NSN: 1337-00-232-4187) Rocket Motors. The purpose of this contract is to support a Service Life Evaluation of the AGM-65 SR109 Maverick Rocket Motor. The AGM-65 Maverick Missile is a unique and aging weapon system requiring periodic testing to preclude catastrophic failure. The energetic missile components require periodic testing to identify aging trends and possible deterioration or instability of energetic materials. In completing this study, mechanical and chemical testing techniques will be applied to dissected rocket motors with predetermined age factors to predict probability of rocket motor failure. Results will be analyzed, service life quantified, updated, and a written report will be provided to the Government for analysis in establishing/verifying SR109 Service Life Estimate (SLE).<br />A Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract for the SR109 Rocket Motor Age Identification Study is being contemplated.</p>

<a href="mailto:joseph.e.determan@us.army.mil">Joseph Determan</a>
<DESC>The US Army Contracting Command (ACC)-New Jersey located at Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07806-5000, in support of the Office of the Project Manager Combat Ammunition Systems (OPM-CAS) is conducting a market survey to identify qualified sources to produce the M739A1 Point Detonating (PD) Fuze along with the Safe and Arm (S&A) Module Assembly utilized in the M825A1 WP Smoke (Obscurant) Projectile. The M739A1 PD Fuze is the Armys preferred, primary fuze for 105mm and 155mm projectiles to address point detonating/delay artillery functions. The M739A1 fuze contains an Impact Delay Module (IDM) assembly. The IDM provides fuze initiation delay based upon the completion of mechanical actions caused by projectile deceleration and will function immediately after passing through the target. On the M825A1 WP Smoke (Obscurant) Projectile, the S&A Module Assembly utilized is similar to the S&A Module Assembly used in the M739A1 fuze. The S&A Module Assembly that is used in the M825A1 is also dual safe, requiring two unique environments to align the explosive train.  A rotor acts as an escapement to prevent the M55 detonator from aligning with the explosive firing train until a safe arming distance is achieved.  Both setback (environment #1) and spin (environment #2) locks preventing accidental arming prior to firing.  During projectile flight, the explosive lead in the S&A, when initiated, will detonate the M825A1 Projectile Burster, which will rupture a Canister Loading Assembly and disseminate 116 felt wedges saturated with White Phosphorous.  As the wedges are exposed to the atmosphere, a smoke cloud is generated which acts as an obscurant.
The Government anticipates soliciting for offerors located within the National Technology and Industrial Base (NTIB) for a single award of a Firm Fixed Price (FFP), Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ), contract including a basic award of five (5) ordering periods and an option for two (2) additional ordering periods. The estimated quantity to be purchased over the seven (7) ordering periods for the M739A1 Fuze is 850,000 each and for the S&A in the M825A1 projectile is 80,000 each. Both the M739A1 fuze and the M825A1 projectile S&A shall be manufactured to a Government owned Technical Data Package, drawings, and specifications, which are coded as Distribution Statement D (authorized distribution of technical documents to Department of Defense components and their contractors).
Interested contractors should submit a summary that includes a brief description of the contractor's capabilities to include: parent organizations, name/address/point of contact identification/email address, capabilities, past experience as a manufacturer of fuzes or similar items, monthly production capacity and/or potential capacity, possible partnering/teaming arrangements, or if the company is a large or small business and CAGE Code. This market survey is for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a Request for Proposal or as an obligation on the part of the US Government. All information submitted will be held in a confidential status. Interested firms should provide this requested information to Joseph Determan at joseph.e.determan@us.army.mil within 15 calendar days of this publication by electronic mail. Telephone inquiries will not be accepted. The Government will accept written questions by email. All information is to be submitted at no cost or obligation to the Government. If a formal solicitation is generated at a later date, a solicitation notice will be published. No award will be made as a result of this market survey.

<a href="mailto:jonathan.wood.1@ang.af.mil">USPFO for Arizona</a>
<DESC>RFI for NVIS Compatible Lighting Improvement forC-130H2 Aircraft Fuel Quantity Gauges <br>  <br> As prescribed in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.209 (c), the following provision is inserted:  <br>  <br> IAW FAR 52.215-3 --Request for Information (Oct 1997)  <br>  <br> (a) The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this solicitation or to otherwise pay for the information solicited except as an allowable cost under other contracts as provided in subsection 31.205-18, bid and proposal costs, of the FAR.   <br>  <br> (b) Although proposal and offers are used in this request for information, your response will be treated as information only.  It shall not be used as a proposal.  <br>  <br> (c) This solicitation is issued for the purpose of identifying information on aircraft cockpit lighting technologies that have already been developed or may be modified from other Aerospace Industry solutions to meet the agency requirement as listed below: <br>  <br> The Air National Guard Air Force Reserve Command Test Center (AATC) is conducting an effort to determine potential sources for improving the night vision goggle compatible lighting for fuel gauges used in Air National Guard (ANG) and Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC)  C-130H2 or earlier aircraft.  This announcement is for market research and does not constitute a request for proposal. This is not an R&D request. <br>  <br> AATC is seeking contractors interested in providing affordable, readily available NVIS compatible light system for the C-130H2 fuel gauges NSN 6680-012204091 (Fuel Gauge-Totalizer); and NSN 6680 01 220 4090, 6680 01 290 5920; 6680-013508049 (Fuel Gauge-Primary Quantity).  The system must provide a fully NVIS compatible solution by adding backlighting or an improved secondary lighting source.  This modification must use the latest military and/or commercial off-the shelf (COTS) technology that can be used as part of an Operational Assessment (OA).   <br>  <br> System Requirements:  <br>  <br>  	NVIS compatible <br>  	Solutions must ensure smooth and predictable dimming, equal or better than the legacy incandescent dimming design.  <br>  	Provide daylight readability.   <br>  	System should be form, fit and function using the existing wiring or with minor modification. <br>  	System must be physically robust. <br>  	LED technology preferred. <br>  	System must allow instruments to maintain cooling characteristics. <br>  	System should provide improvement over existing post lights/secondary lighting. <br>  	System should prevent any glow or light leakage which may cause non-NVIS compatibility.  <br>  <br> Objective of OA is to demonstrate and validate potential solutions for recommendation for fielding options within the next 1-3 years.  Proposed start dates for testing is 1 Mar 2013.  Actual fielding decision is beyond the scope, intent, or authority of this RFI or OA.  Potential for follow-on procurement is dependent on results of tests and availability of funding.  The government is looking for a system that offers the best value to the government, not necessarily the lowest procurement cost.

<SUBJECT>A--BAA entitled "Energy Conservation Applications for the U.S. Navy"
<SOLNBR>N0016713BAA01
<RESPDATE>113014
<ARCHDATE>12152014
<CONTACT>All contractual questions shall be addressed to Ms. Kathy Bonturi at kathleen.bonturi@navy.mil.
<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Carderock Division (NSWCCD) is seeking innovative concepts from industry and academia to enable energy conservation and carbon footprint reduction on U.S. Navy ships. The primary focus is on concepts with the potential for rapid transition to Fleet operations. All Military Sealift Command (MSC) ship classes and Navy combatants have opportunities for energy conservation, and all classes are of interest under this BAA. NSWCCD is soliciting short white papers (abstracts) each describing an enabling energy conservation concept, within the requirements identified in this BAA. 
The Navy will consider approaches that modify systems, operations or both to affect quantifiable energy conservation and/or carbon footprint reduction in the Fleet.
 Each proposed solution should be capable of an operational prototype demonstration in a shipboard or other relevant environment by the conclusion of Phase 2. Emphasis is placed on solutions with an identified transition path capable of making near-term, measurable improvements towards the Navys shipboard energy conservation and carbon footprint reduction needs. Solutions at all levels of development will be considered, ranging from near-term strategies applicable to existing ship classes to those suitable for new construction and future design. Technical maturity of each solution, however, will be considered during evaluations with preference for solutions with more immediate impact. 
To minimize risk, energy conservation efforts are typically executed in three distinct phases: 
Phase 1: Conceptual Design & Business Case Analysis 
Phase 2: Detailed Design, Prototype Development and Demonstration 
Phase 3: Multi-ship Implementation 
An offeror with a highly rated white paper may be invited to submit a full proposal for a Phase 1 contract only.
 Based on the results of the Phase 1 effort, a follow-on Phase 2 contract may be awarded under this BAA or, depending on the maturity of the proposed solution and the existence of alternative suppliers, a Phase 2 contract may be open to competition to meet FAR requirements. All Phase 3 contracts for multi-ship implementation will be competitively awarded outside of this BAA. 
FAR Section 35.016 prescribes procedures for the use of a broad agency announcement (BAA) with Peer or Scientific Review for the acquisition of basic and applied research and that part of development not related to the development of a specific system or hardware procurement. BAAs may be used by agencies to fulfill their requirements for scientific study and experimentation directed toward advancing the state-of-the-art or increasing knowledge or understanding rather than focusing on a specific system or hardware solution.
 The BAA technique shall only be used when meaningful proposals with varying technical/scientific approaches can be reasonably anticipated.3 
FAR Section 35.016 (d) states: Proposals received as a result of the BAA shall be evaluated in accordance with evaluation criteria specified therein through a peer or scientific review process. Written evaluation reports on individual proposals will be necessary but proposals need not be evaluated against each other since they are not submitted in accordance with a common work statement. 
FAR Section 35.016 (e) states: The primary basis for selecting proposals for acceptance shall be technical, importance to agency programs, and fund availability.
 Cost realism and reasonableness shall also be considered to the extent appropriate. 
This BAA is active when posted on FedBizOps and will be open for approximately two years, closing on 30 November 2014. White papers on any relevant topic may be submitted any time throughout the two year period. White papers will generally be reviewed as soon after receipt as workloads allow. Review of white papers submitted in response to a specified focus areas may be delayed until the focus area due date (as described in the Focus Area section of this BAA). Based on evaluation of the white papers, some offerors may receive an email inviting them to submit a full proposal. A Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) section is provided below, listing all questions received and their respective answers.
 The BAA can be accessed at the FedBizOps website https://www.fbo.gov/ (search for N0016713BAA01) and also at the NSWCCD Broad Agency Announcement website: 
http://www.navsea.navy.mil/nswc/carderock/docs/N00167-13-BAA-01.pdf. 
NSWCCD will not issue paper copies of this announcement. NSWCCD reserves the right to fund all, some or none of the proposals received as a result of this BAA. NSWCCD provides no funding for direct reimbursement of proposal development costs. White papers, proposals or any other material submitted in response to this BAA become the property of the Navy and will not be returned. It is the policy of NSWCCD to treat all proposals as sensitive, competitive information and to disclose their contents only for the purposes of evaluation or potential sponsorship of the concept.
 All work under this BAA shall be unclassified. The Government does not commit to providing a response to any comments or questions. 
This BAA shall not be viewed as an invitation or request for proposal. Offerors are advised that only the Contracting Officer is legally authorized to commit the Government to a contract. The BAA is an expression of interest only and does not commit the Government to pay any costs for responses submitted. 
NAVSEA Carderock may disclose offerors information to authorized personnel. Submitting a white paper constitutes the offerors written consent to such disclosure. All parties with access to white paper information will be required to sign a Conflict of Interest & Non-Disclosure Agreement prior to gaining access to any white papers or related information.
 
The selection of one or more white papers for full proposals and potential contract award will be based on responses to the BAA and the results of a peer review process. The type of award anticipated for the Phase 1 Conceptual Design is Firm Fixed Price. Contract types for follow-on phases shall be determined on a case basis. 4 
All technical questions regarding this BAA should be submitted via email to NSWCCD_OPLOG@navy.mil, and all contractual questions should be addressed to Ms. Kathy Bonturi at kathleen.bonturi@navy.mil.

<DESC>Sources Sought Questionnaire<br />W912DY-13-R-MDM1<br />December 6, 2012<br />Army Meter Data Management System Administration,<br />Maintenance and Upgrade Services
<p>Classification Code: R<br /><br />NAICS: <br />541511, Custom Computer Programming Services<br />541512, Computer Systems Design Services<br />541513, Computer Facilities Management Services<br />541519, Other Computer Related Services<br />518210, Data Processing Hosting and Related Services</p>
<p>1. The U.S. Army Engineering and Support Center (CEHNC) in Huntsville, Alabama, is planning a Best Value acquisition for the procurement of system administration and related services for the existing Army Meter Data Management System (MDMS). Also under consideration is award of one or more contracts to consolidate or incorporate various existing data base systems used to track and report energy consumption and energy conservation efforts within the Army thereby reducing overall system sustainment cost and eliminate need for redundant data input. Desired output includes, but not limited to geospatial display of data. Services may include development of new data automation sub systems or automated data transfer capability where necessary to achieve this objective. Specific requirements include the following initiatives, and services:</p>
<p>a. Continue MDMS development/deployment (become the replacement contract). The MDMS was developed pursuant to the Energy Policy Act of 2005 and the Energy Independence and Security Act 2007 which requires Federal facilities to be metered for purposes of managing energy consumption including water. At the time of the posting of this sources sought announcement, there are approximately 1,500 Army facilities electronically reporting their meter data to the MDMS. The planned end state is approximately 20,000 active Army, Army Reserves and Army National Guard facilities electronically reporting meter data at least hourly across cyber secure networks. The MDMS provides automated analysis of the vast amount of data received to help installation energy managers to prioritize their actions to reduce energy waste.</p>
<p>b. Facilitate Army facility energy data collection and reporting utilizing both new and existing automated information systems. The Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) has identified energy data reporting requirements for each Armed Service (accessible by link below). NOTE: This acquisition will contribute to this OSD objective, but this sources sought announcement should NOT be construed as being the only planned DOD or Army contracting source for implementing the requirements described therein.</p>
<p>http://www.acq.osd.mil/ie/download/Public%20Release%20FINAL%20EEIM%20CRD%2018%20July%202012.pdf</p>
<p>c. Obtain/maintain DIACAP network security accreditation and provide secure server when required for work performed under the contract.</p>
<p>d. Integrate legacy data systems to streamline information flow, increase system response and display of information. This may include merging of data system functionality, sun-setting of systems, and development of integrated information systems.</p>
<p>e. Perform meter and other energy data analyses with emphasis on producing reports that identify action priorities, probable causes and recommended diagnostic or corrective actions.</p>
<p>f. Develop/maintain web site portal interface for software application access, user communications, help desk and webinar training.</p>
<p>g. Perform other related data automation services as may be required to support programs assigned to CEHNC for management.</p>
<p>2. The Government is performing market research primarily in order to determine if there are firms that possess the capability to execute the requirements of this anticipated Request For Proposal (RFP). The purpose of this synopsis is market research only and IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS. It does not restrict the Government to an ultimate acquisition approach. Therefore, we further invite all business concerns to provide a capability statement in response to this requirement. Prospective contractors shall be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) prior to award of a contract. Contractors are encouraged to obtain further information on SAM registration at the following website: https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM/. This announcement does not obligate the Government to award a contract or task order nor does it obligate the Government to pay for any bid/proposal preparation costs.</p>
<p>3. If your firm would be interested in such work, you are strongly encouraged to submit a capability statement that addresses as a minimum, the questions presented within this announcement to assist the Government's market research.

It is expected that the performance period will not begin until fall of 2014. The actual type of vehicle to be utilized to execute this requirement has not yet been finalized; however, it is estimated that the capacity ceiling will not exceed $40M.</p>
<p>4. It is the Government's intent to consider awarding a portion of this acquisition under the authority of the Small Business set aside program per FAR Part 19. As a result, the Government is performing market research in order to determine if small businesses possess the capability to execute some or all of the requirements of this anticipated RFP. Based upon small business responses received, consideration will be given to defining what part of the acquisition if any will be set-aside for small business competition. Interested large businesses are also encouraged to respond to this sources sought announcement.<br />5. The applicable NAICS codes for this acquisition are 541511, Custom Computer Programming Services; 541512, Computer Systems Design Services; 541513 Computer Facilities Management Services; and 541519, Other Computer Related Services.

a.	Provide a Class "C" Certified Operator licensed in the state of Florida to service, operate and maintain a category three (III) water treatment plant.  
b.	Make necessary adjustments to equipment and perform testing to maintain required chlorine dosing level (residual), system pressures and overall performance requirements per applicable permits, laws and regulations.  The operator shall test chlorine residual at most distant location in the water system during every site visit and record results in the maintenance logs.  
c.	Preventative maintenance shall be conducted in strict compliance with Chapter 62-555.305 Florida Administrative Code and the water treatment system Operation & Maintenance Manual. (1) One copy of the plant's manufacturer data and O&M manual will be provided at South Florida VA National Cemetery for the contractor's reference.  The manual shall remain Government property and shall not be removed from the site without written authorization from the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR).  The contractor may make copies of the manual at the contractor's expense.
d.	Provide and deliver all required water treatment chemicals to the site and check/fill the chemical feed tanks to appropriate operation levels.  All chemicals used on this system shall be NSF certified.  
e.	If the system must be temporarily shutdown to complete preventative maintenance service, the contractor shall provide the COR a minimum 24-hour notice.  Upon completion of maintenance service, the operator shall immediately return the system to full operation then notify the COR that the system is available for use.	
f.	The operator shall make (1) one site visit each month to perform preventative maintenance.
g.	Preventative maintenance shall be in accordance with the following:

2.	How the system works:
a.	Water is pumped from the well via a multi-stage water pump to the pressurized water storage tank. The pump is turned on/off by a pressure switch that operates between 30-50 psi ("cut on" pressure) and 50-70 psi ("cut-off" pressure). A 20 psi differential is recommended by the manufacturer to be between "cut-on" and "cut-off".
b.	Water travels from the pressure tank to the "untreated water meter", and then to the 300 gallon contact tank.
c.	Before the water enters into the contact tank, a chemical feed pump (CFP #1) injects a pre-mixed solution of chlorine/water into the line entering the tank (injection point fitting-IPF#1)) allowing the chlorine to mix with the water for a period of time to achieve proper disinfection. A switch (Flow-Switch #1) on the outlet piping of the contact tank senses water flow exiting the tank and activates the chemical feed pump, turning it "on or off" depending on water flow through the tank.
d.	Upon leaving the contact tank, the water enters the first automatic backwashing filter (Filter AG Filter) where suspended solids & any oxidized iron/hydrogen sulfide is removed.
e.	Next, the filtered water passes through the second automatic backwashing filter (Centaur Carbon Filter) where any residual hydrogen sulfide and/or chlorine is removed.
f.	The "de-chlorinated/filtered" water then passes through a second switch (Flow Switch #2) which activates a second chemical feed pump (CFP #2) that injects a chlorine solution into the treated water (injection point fitting-IPF#2) for "final" disinfection before distribution and use.
g.	The treated water passes through a "finished water meter" and is ready for final use.

3.	Required Water Treatment System Preventative Maintenance:
a.	Test well water before the water treatment equipment to see if water quality has changed from previous month's test results. Variations in water quality might require adjustments with water treatment chemical feed pumps, chlorine solution mixtures, or filter backwashing frequencies.
b.	Inspect chemical solution tanks at each chemical feed pump (CFP#1 & CFP #2) and fill with proper mixture of chlorine (sodium hypochlorite) & clean filtered water when solution level is low. This will need to be done on a monthly basis. Proper mixing ratios have been posted on top of each solution tank by installer at time of installation and start-up. Please refer to these for correct mixture ratio.
c.	Check operation of flow switch (Flow-Switch #1) to be certain it is operating properly. Clean switch if it fails to operate chemical feed pump (CFP #1) properly. Foreign matter will cause switch to stick and not operate properly. Check monthly and keep clean at all times.
d.	Remove and clean injection point fitting (IPF#1). Iron & calcium deposits will build up on fitting over time. Clean monthly, and notify the COR when replacement of injection fitting with new fitting is necessary.
e.	Check operation of flow switch (Flow-Switch #2) to be certain it is operating properly. Clean switch if it fails to operate chemical feed pump (CFP #2) properly. Check monthly and keep clean at all times.
f.	Remove and clean injection point fitting (IPF#2). Calcium deposits will build up on fitting over time. Clean monthly, and notify the COR when replacement of the injection fitting with new fitting is necessary.
g.	Open blow-down valve at bottom of 300 gallon contact tank each month for 2-5 minutes to flush contact tank of any sediment/ iron buildup that has accumulated at bottom tank. Failure to do this will allow excess iron to bleed into the system causing iron staining and possible filtration equipment failure. 
h.	Test treated water at required intervals and document per requirements stated in this contract. Maintain proper chlorine residual in finished water at all times as required by Department of Health regulations.
i.	Check and Clean sediment filter at well head each month.
j.	Carbon Filter Replacement: Each Carbon Filter will need to have media replacement every 2-3 years.   Notify the COR when Carbon media must be replaced.  Actual replacement of carbon media is outside the limits of this contract.

4.	Provide Water Monitoring and Analysis:
a.	Water sampling shall be performed by the certified operator.
b.	Measurements and field testing shall be in accordance with procedures identified in the Department of Environmental Protection Standard Operating Procedures for Field Activities, DEP - SOP 001/01, Rule 62-160.800 and 62-550.550(1), F.A.C.
c.	Water samples shall be analyzed by a laboratory certified by the Department of Health to perform drinking water analyses.  
d.	Water samples may be taken at anytime during the respective quarterly or annual time periods however samples shall not be taken less than (30) thirty days apart.   
e.	If analysis results show that the system has exceeded maximum contaminant levels (MCL) for Nitrates, Nitrites or received a positive result for the bacteriological test the contractor shall notify the Contracting officer and COR immediately, verbally and in writing.
f.	Required Analyses:
i.	(1) Sample Nitrates & Nitrites - Annually
ii.	(2) Samples Microbiological (Finished Water) - Quarterly
iii.	(1) Sample Microbiological (Raw Water at Source) - Quarterly

5.	Provide Documentation & Recordkeeping: 
a.	Operations and Maintenance (O&M) logs shall be maintained at the water treatment plant site at all times.  O&M Logs and laboratory result forms shall be maintained in a bound condition; three ring binder, spiral binder or other method approved by the COR.
b.	O&M logs shall contain the date of site visit, noted deficiencies, list of maintenance items inspected or performed and the license number and printed name of the operator conducting the maintenance/sampling.  The logs shall also contain the date and results of all sampling and water analyses performed.  If results are reported on a laboratory form, the logs shall reference the corresponding laboratory form.  Copies of all Laboratory forms shall be maintained with the O&M logs in an approved binding.
c.	DOH-certified laboratory reporting format shall be per 62-550.730(1) (b) F.A.C.
d.	Monthly and within (10) ten days after each month of system operation, the contractor shall complete a monthly report in addition to the maintenance log entries using Florida Department of Environmental Protection form 62-555.900(3), "Monthly Operation Report for PWS's Treating Raw Ground Water or Purchased Finished Water" and add it to the bound maintenance log book.

<DESC>This Notice DOES NOT constitute a request for a quote, or proposal for the  procurement of products or services.  This Notice concerns an action which may affect the ability of commercial industry to sell the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government. <br /> <br />The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled (now operating as the U.S. AbilityOne Commission) is an independent agency of the Federal Government.  The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, and through the administration of its AbilityOne&reg; Program, provides employment opportunities for people who are blind or have other significant disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals.  Products or services which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the authority of the AbilityOne&reg; Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (PL).  The PL can viewed on  the agency's website at www.abilityone.gov.  Once a product or service is added to the PL to be provided by a nonprofit agency, no other product determined to be essentially the same can be sold to the Federal government.
<p>By regulation (41 CFR 51-2.4(a)(4) the Committee has been asked to  conduct an impact analysis toward the potential addition of the following product(s) to the PL:</p>
<p>NSN:		7510-01-389-2262<br />Name:	Self-Stick Rectangular Flag, "Sign Here", 1.0" X 1.75", Yellow, 100 Flags per pack<br />Description:	Self-stick rectangular flag with "Sign Here." 1.0" X 1.75", Yellow, 100 Flags per pack. UOI is PG. PG = 100 Flags.</p>
<p>Should these items be added to the PL, the contracting agency who will be authorized by the Committee to order the products on behalf of the Federal Government under the authority of the AbilityOne Program&reg; will be the General Services Administration, New York, NY.<br /> <br />Before adding a product to the PL, the Committee considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as products determined to be essentially the same (ETS) (41CFR 51-5.3(a), would have on the sales of firms that are currently providing the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government and the extent to which the potentially affected  firms are dependent on the income.   Once added to the PL, the products determined to be ETS to the product(s) added to the PL will be blocked from being sold to Federal Government agencies.  The products that have been determined to be essentially the same are:</p>
<p>NSN:			7510-01-389-2262<br />ETS Stock Numbers: 	MMM680SH2; SPR19257; MMM680HVSHR; MMM680SH12; UNV99005</p>
<p>The items listed above will potentially be added to the PL for the Total (A-List), or Broad (B-List) Government Requirement.  That is, should any Federal Government agency determine a need for the product, the procurement of the item will be mandatory by that agency through the AbilityOne&reg; Program.</p>
<p>These products will also be offered through the AbilityOne Distributor Program.  If your firm is currently selling these products to the Federal Government through commercial means, your firm will continue to sell these products through your AbilityOne Distributor status and there would be no impact against your firm.  If your firm is not an AbilityOne Distributor but would like to become a Distributor, please contact the AbilityOne Program for guidance.  At a minimum, your firm must have a GSA Schedule 75 contract with at least 10,000 items on the schedule contract to be eligible.  Firms can become AbilityOne Distributors for limited items such as toner cartridges or janitorial/sanitation items but must contact the AbilityOne Program for more details.</p>
<p>If your firm is selling either the item(s) listed above, or the items that have been determined to be ETS, it is important that your firm report the following information to the Committee:</p>
<p>1.	Total Company Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period.  When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations.  If your company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporation to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporation's total revenue data.  Please define the 12-month period reported.</p>
<p>2.	Revenues accrued by providing the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government for the same most recent 12-month period.  If reporting on more than one item listed above, please report the revenue per each item, whether the NSNs or ETS items, and identify the item.</p>
<p>3.	Identify the contract number that your firm holds to sell the item(s) to the Federal Government, the government agency, and period of performance (contract end date) for the item(s) your firm is reporting on.  Identify the specific items per contract.</p>
<p>4.	If your firm is selling the product through purchases by Government Purchase Cards (GPC), please identify that and the amount made through GPC purchases.</p>
<p>5.	Identify whether or not the deliveries under the contract have been completed.</p>
<p>6.	The length of time your firm has been providing these products to the Federal Government.</p>
<p>7.	Identify any small business statuses your firm has qualified for, such as 8(a), woman-owned, service disabled veteran-owned, etc.</p>
<p>8.	Provide your firm's DUNS number.  The number is needed to confirm your company's small business statuses with the Small Business Administration (SBA).</p>
<p>9.	Include your firm's mailing address.  Do not use post office boxes, as all replies are sent via means that will not be delivered to a post office box.  The address should be for the person who has signed the letter containing the information submitted.</p>
<p>All information requested above must be included in the response.  Responses that do not include the information requested will be determined to be non-responsive and will not be included in the impact analysis.</p>
<p>All responses will be held as confidential and will not be released to any outside party.</p>
<p>The information prescribed above must reach the Committee no later than December 28, 2012 and can be submitted in letter format.  If information is not received by the date requested, the Committee will conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed products be added to the PL.</p>
<p>Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to&nbsp;(703) 603-0655.  You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate.</p>
<p>General information concerning the Committee and its authority can be found in Title 41 United States Code, Sections 8501-8506, or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51.  Both of these references can be found on the Committee's website at www.abilityone.gov.  If you have specific questions or require further explanation concerning this Notice or the addition of the above-referenced product to the PL, please contact Mike Jurkowski at (703) 603-2117.</p>

<p>Sole Source:<br />The NDBC is implementing a technology refresh of existing TAO Tropical Atmosphere Ocean Array program stations. In the program development, NDBC led a sources sought effort to acquire a vendor to supply various sensors that use serial and inductive modem communications. Sea-Bird Electronics was the only responder and thus was selected to supply serial and inductively coupled salinity, temperature, and pressure sensors for the profiled array on climate quality platforms and the TAO project. The new TAO refresh system was designed around these sensors. This includes the hardware and software interfaces including shoreside processing. The TAO refresh system was commissioned by the NDBC in 2010 and the NDBC is implementing the conversion. <br />Consistency I n the behavior of these ocean monitoring sensors over time is critical to the long term study of the parameters being monitored. The temperature/pressure sensor must be able to maintain the same accuracy and resolution as the previous sensors used on these projects. As the manufacturer of the previous sensor used in the TAO array, Sea-Bird Electronics is the only known source of supply to meet this requirement.</p>

<DESC><p align="left">Notice of intent to award a firm fixed-price sole source contract to LGS Innovations LLC, the original equipment manufacturer, is tasked to provide extended software warranty for maintenance support coverage of the JHITS swtiching network to include "bug" fixes for customer found Severity Level 1 and 2 problems requiring software code changes for customer unique requirements. LGS Innvoations LLC is the only supplier that can provide the required software warranty support for the updates to the JHITS 5ESS switches, as the software updates will require certification by JITC for information assurance and interoperability compliance. No other vendor is licensed to provide maintenance support and sofware updates for the 5ESS switching network that meets JITC compliance.</p>
<p align="left">Without the extended software maintenance coverage, the JHITS 5ESS switch software will lapse and maintenance services will not be available causing significant risks affecting operational conditions that could lead to failures and network outages. This would negatively impact telephony connectivity throughout the Pacific, to include global DSN connectivity. The 5ESS extended software warranty is critical to prevent isolation of various military installations throughout Hawaii as well as the global networks supporting the Pacific Warfighter.</p>

<DESC><strong>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION<br />312 N. Spring Street<br />Los Angeles, CA<br /><br /><br />THE OPPORTUNITY</strong>
<p>To commemorate its role in Latino American civil rights, the U.S. Courthouse, located at 312 N. Spring Street, Los Angeles, California (the "Property"), was recently designated a National Historic Landmark. In 2012, the U.S. Courthouse celebrated its Diamond Jubilee, representing the Federal Government's presence in the Civic Center area for 75 years.</p>
<p>For decades, the Federal Government has invested in downtown Los Angeles to develop facilities that serve the public, including the federal building at 300 N. Los Angeles Street and the adjacent Roybal Federal Courthouse. It will soon break ground on a new federal courthouse at 107 South Broadway.</p>
<p>As the government's real estate expert, the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) is considering new approaches to leverage existing assets and to engage the private sector to strengthen the portfolio of public buildings.</p>
<p>Through this Request for Information (RFI), GSA is exploring potential strategies that may foster the private-sector adaptive use of 312 N. Spring Street in exchange for the construction of a new federal building on federal property at 107 S. Broadway in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>GSA's key strategic objectives are to:</p>
<p>&middot; Leverage the expertise of the real estate industry to reposition 312 N. Spring Street for new market-driven use(s);</p>
<p>&middot; Maximize financial return to the government and taxpayers;</p>
<p>&middot; Provide additional rentable square feet of newly constructed space to assist customer agencies' mission objectives;</p>
<p>&middot; Preserve and maintain the historic integrity of the building; and</p>
<p>&middot; Contribute to the vitality of the Civic Center area of Los Angeles.</p>
<p>GSA invites development teams and other parties (Respondents) to submit ideas that could assist GSA to attain these objectives. With GSA's commitment to enhance its real estate portfolio and the support of the local community, a vibrant reuse of 312 N. Spring Street can truly take shape with your input and vision. <br /><br /><strong>Responses to this RFI are requested to be submitted by Monday, February 11, 2013. Please see attached RFI document for additional information.</strong></p>
<p><em>GSA intends to use the information provided for planning purposes and to help it make strategic decisions regarding this Property. GSA will not enter into a conveyance agreement as a result of this RFI. GSA will not reimburse RFI Respondents for any expenses associated with responding to this RFI, although GSA sincerely appreciates Respondents' efforts and input. GSA may issue a Request for Qualifications (RFQ) or a Request for Proposals (RFP), or both, at some point in the future, if GSA determines that redevelopment or repositioning of this Property would provide value to the Federal Government. </em></p>

This system provides for the observation of electron diffraction patterns from both rear and front sides. The optics of this system consists of a phosphor coated glass screen and a series of four non-magnetic gold coated molybdenum grids integrated with a miniature electron gun, all magnetically shielded with the use of a mu-metal cylinder. Two types of gun filaments should be available, a thoria coated iridium hairpin and a LaB6 single crystal, all replaceable in the user's laboratory. The entire system should be approx. 145 mm in diameter and mounted on an 8"inch Conflat DN150CF flange for mounting in a UHV chamber. The LEED/AES optics configuration must provide maximum viewing angle and high transmission with a flange to sample distance of approx. 254 mm. In addition, a z-retraction mechanism must be available which allows the optics to be moved into or out of a restricted working area with z-travel of 50 mm or 100mm with the optics protected by an integral multi-segment shutter mounted in front of all grids. The available gun energy range must be 0-3000 eV and the beam spot size &lt; 1mm at 1 &#61549;a and 100 eV. All LEED optics should be tested under UHV conditions (1 x !0 -10 torr) before delivery.<br />The LEED four grid analyzer should be configured so that it can also be used as a retarding field analyzer offering the possibility of recording Auger electron spectra (AES) or electron energy loss spectra (EELS) to a resolution of a few eV.<br />The LEED analyzer should be powered by a digital power supply providing all necessary voltages and containing an integrated lock-in amplifier. The unit should allow measurement of true beam current. All significant voltages should be displayed on an LED or LC display panel.

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

<DESC>This part requires engineering source approval by the design control activity
in order to maintain the quality of the part. Existing unique design
capability, engineering skills, and manufacturing knowledge by the qualified
source(s) require acquisition of the part from the approved source(s). The
approved source(s) retain data rights, manufacturing knowledge, or technical
data that are not economically available to the Government, and the data or
knowledge is essential to maintaining the quality of the part. An alternate
source must qualify in accordance with the design control activity's
procedures, as approved by the cognizant Government engineering activity. The
qualification procedures must be approved by the Government engineering
activity having jurisdiction over the part in the intended application.
The subject item requires Government source approval prior to contract award,
as the item is flight critical and/or the technical data available has not
been determined adequate to support acquisition via full and open competition.Only the source(s) previously approved by the Government for this item have
been solicited.
  The time required for approval of a new source is normally
such that an award cannot be delayed pending approval of a new source.  If you
are not an approved source you must submit, together with your proposal, the
information detailed in one of the NAVSUP Weapon Systems Support (NAVSUP WSS)
Source Approval Information Brochures listed below.

Spares: www.neco.navy.mil/sar.aspx
Repair: www.neco.navy.mil/sarr.aspx

These brochures identify the technical data required to be submitted based on
your company's experience in production of the same or similar item, or if
this is an item you have never made.
If your request for source approval is currently being evaluated at NAVSUP WSS
submit with your offer a copy of the cover letter which forwarded your request
for source approval.
  Offers received which fail to provide all data required
by the Source Approval Brochure or document previous submission of all data
required by the Source Approval Brochure will not be considered for award
under this solicitation.  Please note, if evaluation of a source approval
request submitted hereunder cannot be processed in time and/or approval
requirements preclude the ability to obtain subject items in time to meet
Government requirements, award of the subject requirement may continue based
on Fleet support needs.  The NAVSUP WSS Commercial Item Identification
Brochureis now available at: "https://www.neco.navy.mil/cib.aspx".

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester shall file a formal agency protest to both the contracting officer and the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.</p>
<p>The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p><br />Department of Homeland Security<br />Commandant, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131) <br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />2100 2nd St SW Stop 7112<br />Washington, DC 20593-7112<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202-372-3695.<br />Closing date and time for receipt of offers is 26 Dec 2012 3:00 p.m., EST.

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D.

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<DESC>1. Attachment 1 to the Solicitation announcement mentions SF 1449 in<br />several places in the Instructions to Offerors. We are unable to find the SF<br />1449 in either attachment to the announcement. We assume the Government<br />will post an amendment to the Solicitation to provide the SF 1449. Is our<br />assumption correct?
<p>ANSWER: SF1449 is the solicitation form (itself).</p>
<p>2. The Solicitation announcement indicates the Offerors shall allocate<br />15% of their total price into Line Item 0001 - Design, and 85% into Line<br />Item 0002 - Satellite Hardware Development Facility. The DESIGN Section of<br />Attachment 2 indicates the customer/end user can define any changes by<br />mark-ups on the drawings, and the detailed list of items and functions. As<br />a Firm Fixed Price contract, this places considerable risk on the success<br />of program, the customer, and the contractor. Until the customer/end user<br />signs off on a final design, the complete list of components required to<br />deliver the Satellite Hardware Development Facility and their associated<br />costs will be unknown. Would the Government consider a two phased proposal<br />with a T&amp;M or Cost Plus component for the Design effort and a FFP component<br />for the build and delivery component of the contract?</p>
<p>ANSWER: FFP only. Drawings will be based on initial requirements.</p>
<p><br />3. The General section of Attachment 2 to the Solicitation<br />announcement describes an "engineering effort for redesign of AFIT's<br />existing chassis system." Is it possible to provide drawings and<br />specifications for the existing chassis system?</p>
<p><br />ANSWER: Yes -- the expected design will look like Figure 1 in the attached<br />file named "2002367- Payload Spec for 3U 6U 12U 27U.pdf." Additionally,<br />PSC's CSD spec is provided. AFIT's current design is shown in figures:<br />"AFIT_6U_chassis_no_components.pdf" and<br />"AFIT_6U_chassis_with_components.pdf"</p>
<p><br />4. We have not seen any questions and answers or amendments posted on<br />FedBizOps for this solicitation. We assume the Government will post<br />questions and answers. Is our assumption correct?</p>
<p><br />ANSWER: Yes</p>

DELIVERY/PICKUP AND REFUELING COST MUST BE INCLUDED IN THE QUOTE. <BR> <BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ?have?, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>Contractor SHALL provide the approved water distributor's name, address, and inspection responsibility code (IRC) with the bid. The water source must be approved and listed on the U.S. Army Medical Department/U.S. Army Veterinary Command Approved Sources list. This list is a comprehensive list of sanitarily approved food establishments and sources that may be utilized to provide services to the U.S. Government. The reference website is located at http://www.veterinaryservice.army.mil/sources.html. <BR> <BR>Delivery must be made within 30 days or less after receipt of order (ARO). The offeror must provide within its offer the number of days - not to exceed 30 - required to make delivery after it receives a purchase order from the buyer. <BR> <BR>As identified in Question Submission, "questions not received in a reasonable time prior to close of the solicitation may not be considered" are defined FOR THIS SOLICITATION as: THE CUTOFF TIME FOR RECEIPT OF QUESTIONS REGARDING THIS SOLICITATION IS 12 Dec 2012. ALL QUESTIONS RECEIVED AFTER THIS DATE AND TIME WILL NOT BE CONSIDERED. All questions submitted within the allotted time will be answered and posted. <BR> <BR>

FACTOR #2: DELIVERY. PRICE AND DELIVERY ARE CONSIDERED EQUAL. <BR> <BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ?have?, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>Delivery must be made within 30 days or less after receipt of order (ARO). The offeror must provide within its offer the number of days - not to exceed 30 - required to make delivery after it receives a purchase order from the buyer. <BR> <BR>As identified in Question Submission, "questions not received in a reasonable time prior to close of the solicitation may not be considered" are defined FOR THIS SOLICITATION as: THE CUTOFF TIME FOR RECEIPT OF QUESTIONS REGARDING THIS SOLICITATION IS 12 Dec 2012. ALL QUESTIONS RECEIVED AFTER THIS DATE AND TIME WILL NOT BE CONSIDERED. All questions submitted within the allotted time will be answered and posted. <BR> <BR>

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.<br />Primary Point of Contact.: <br /><br />Christopher J. Grey, KO <br />Contracting Office Address: <br />2401 Hawkins Point Road<br />Building 31, Mail Stop 26<br />Baltimore, Maryland 21226-5000<br />United States <br />

<DESC>As was stated in the&nbsp;original sources sought the government does not own any infrastructure to support this requirement. Through review of the current franchise agreement and license agreement that the government has with Comcast Inc. it has been determined the government has no legal right of ownership&nbsp;to the infrastructure that is currently being used and cannot allow competing offerors to use said infrastructure. This determination was made by the Hill AFB Staff Judge Advocate's Office. Due to this determination the government will be negotiating a new&nbsp;contract on a sole source basis with Comcast Inc.&nbsp;The justification for the sole source nature of the acquisition will be the duplication of cost involved for competing offerors to install all brand new infrastructure. The government will&nbsp;generate and post all appropriate Sole Source&nbsp;justifications at a later date in a separate annoucement from this Sources Sought.&nbsp;<br /><br />In order to facilitate competition in the future for this requirement&nbsp;the government plans to&nbsp;purchase the rights to all&nbsp;infrastructure from the point&nbsp;the infrastructure enters&nbsp;each building. This requirement will be available for bid at the expiration of the newly negotiated franchise and license agreements with Comcast Inc.

<DESC>This announcement references Sources Sought Notice W15QKN-12-X-A011 which was posted on 2 May 2012 and closed on 17 May 2012. A copy of the original posting can be found at the end of this notice. This notice is NOT a request for additional submittals. <br>  <br> The following question was posed from industry in regards to the referenced Sources Sought Notice: <br>  <br> Question: Can you please indicate whether or not material, components, and/or sub-assemblies of the M739A1 can be sourced from foreign manufacturers? If the answer is yes, please specify which material, components, and/or sub-assemblies? <br>  <br> Government Response: In addition to the M739A1 PD/DLY Fuze and M825A1 WP Projectile S&A, the M99 Stab Detonator, M55 Stab Detonator, Explosive Lead, PBXN-5 Type I explosive and the HMX Grade B explosive are also restricted to the NTIB. <br>  <br> Original Posting: <br>  <br> The US Army Contracting Command (ACC)-New Jersey located at Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07806-5000, in support of the Office of the Project Manager Combat Ammunition Systems (OPM-CAS) is conducting a market survey to identify qualified sources to produce the M739A1 Point Detonating (PD) Fuze along with the Safe and Arm (S&A) Module Assembly utilized in the M825A1 WP Smoke (Obscurant) Projectile. The M739A1 PD Fuze is the Armys preferred, primary fuze for 105mm and 155mm projectiles to address point detonating/delay artillery functions. The M739A1 fuze contains an Impact Delay Module (IDM) assembly. The IDM provides fuze initiation delay based upon the completion of mechanical actions caused by projectile deceleration and will function immediately after passing through the target. On the M825A1 WP Smoke (Obscurant) Projectile, the S&A Module Assembly utilized is similar to the S&A Module Assembly used in the M739A1 fuze. The S&A Module Assembly that is used in the M825A1 is also dual safe, requiring two unique environments to align the explosive train.  A rotor acts as an escapement to prevent the M55 detonator from aligning with the explosive firing train until a safe arming distance is achieved.  Both setback (environment #1) and spin (environment #2) locks preventing accidental arming prior to firing.  During projectile flight, the explosive lead in the S&A, when initiated, will detonate the M825A1 Projectile Burster, which will rupture a Canister Loading Assembly and disseminate 116 felt wedges saturated with White Phosphorous.  As the wedges are exposed to the atmosphere, a smoke cloud is generated which acts as an obscurant. <br>  <br> The Government anticipates soliciting for offerors located within the National Technology and Industrial Base (NTIB) for a single award of a Firm Fixed Price (FFP), Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ), contract including a basic award of five (5) ordering periods and an option for two (2) additional ordering periods. The estimated quantity to be purchased over the seven (7) ordering periods for the M739A1 Fuze is 850,000 each and for the S&A in the M825A1 projectile is 80,000 each. Both the M739A1 fuze and the M825A1 projectile S&A shall be manufactured to a Government owned Technical Data Package, drawings, and specifications, which are coded as Distribution Statement D (authorized distribution of technical documents to Department of Defense components and their contractors). <br> Interested contractors should submit a summary that includes a brief description of the contractor's capabilities to include: parent organizations, name/address/point of contact identification/email address, capabilities, past experience as a manufacturer of fuzes or similar items, monthly production capacity and/or potential capacity, possible partnering/teaming arrangements, or if the company is a large or small business and CAGE Code. This market survey is for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a Request for Proposal or as an obligation on the part of the US Government. All information submitted will be held in a confidential status. Interested firms should provide this requested information to Joseph Determan at joseph.e.determan@us.army.mil within 15 calendar days of this publication by electronic mail. Telephone inquiries will not be accepted. The Government will accept written questions by email. All information is to be submitted at no cost or obligation to the Government. If a formal solicitation is generated at a later date, a solicitation notice will be published. No award will be made as a result of this market survey.

<DESC><p>ANSWERS TO CONTRACTOR'S QUESTIONS:</p>
<p>1. Would this program consider an SR22 as an alternate aircraft?</p>
<p>No, the program is modeled after the U.S. Air Force T-53 aircraft which is a Cirrus SR20 G3 Perspective. (Performance Work Statement para 1.2.3.)</p>
<p>2. Does this bid opportunity have an Estimated Project Value?</p>
<p>No</p>
<p>3. How many aircraft required? What is preferred? Contract mentions upgrade aircraft what might be next?</p>
<p>One aircraft is required. Additional aircraft would make flight scheduling easier in case of unplanned maintenance, but only one is required. (Performance Work Statement para 1.2.1.)</p>
<p>There is no intent to "upgrade" aircraft under this program. The portion of the Performance Work Statement regarding "potential transition" refers, in a generic sense, to the potential for all Air National Guard units to convert to a different, military mission aircraft. (Performance Work Statement para 1.1.1.)</p>
<p>4. Do we have ability to purchase fuel at March AFB at government contract priced rate?</p>
<p>No, fuel purchase would be through Freeman Holdings at March.</p>
<p>5. Can we have ability to hanger plane at March AFB? If so would we have to lease the hangar and for what cost?</p>
<p>We are unable to use military hangars for this program. At the time of the writing of the Performance Work Statement, Freeman Holdings was establishing the beginnings of an FBO at March. They would be able to answer if they have hangar space and the associated cost.</p>
<p>6. What does this mean exactly? Respond with maintenance support, operational support, NTSB/FAA emergency paperwork initiation.</p>
<p>In case of an emergency/incident, the Contractor could potentially respond with maintenance support (Performance Work Statement para 1.2.14.1.), submit to substance abuse testing (Performance Work Statement para 1.2.10.9.), and work with Air Force safety personnel who will examine maintenance logs, safety practices, etc (Performance Work Statement para 1.2.13.4.).</p>
<p>7. Is wet lease hourly rate to be based on the above takeoff power to 5 min/ engine shutdown? Aircraft maintenance based on Hobbs meter so total flight hours Hobbs vs. USAF will not match or be accurate.</p>
<p>The wet lease hourly rate will be based on Hobbs engine time.</p>
<p>8. Will contractor get paid wet lease rate per hour flown on check flights?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>9. Contract personnel: Does the Contracting Officer expect all contractor employee resumes to be included within the RFP?</p>
<p>No, A Brief bio on the individuals we will be working directing with will suffice.</p>
<p>10. How many initial military flight instructors are to receive CSIP training? How many IPs to receive training through attrition during the award period?</p>
<p>Air Force initial flight instructors have already been trained. At this time, the Air Force intends to train all additional pilots internally.</p>
<p>11. What is the purpose of the 406 ELT as required equipment? This is an FAA/ICAO International requirement only?</p>
<p>The purpose of the ELT is two-fold. First, while the government intends this program to fall under public use, the aircraft itself will be registered/maintained under FAA regulations (see Performance Work Statement para 1.1.2. and 1.2.5.). 14 CFR 91.207 requires an operable ELT with few exceptions. Second, the military takes great interest in the location of its personnel and would require an ELT to assist in personnel recovery should an incident occur.</p>
<p>12. Are the aircraft expected to land on grass or dirt fields?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>13. Does the aircraft equipment require transmitting/receiving simultaneously on two separate VHF frequencies?</p>
<p>The aircraft must be able to receive simultaneously on two VHF radios and transmit on one at a time.</p>
<p>14. The registration of the T-53 will be of Public Use?</p>
<p>The overall program will be Public Use; the aircraft itself will hold standard FAA registration.</p>
<p>15. Is the Contractor expected to hold a FAR Part 145 Certificate?</p>
<p>No, there is no requirement to establish a certificated repair center. The intent is for the aircraft to be maintained to FAA standards by A &amp; P and Inspection Authorized personnel (Performance Work Statement para 1.2.5. and 1.2.10.)</p>
<p>16. When is expected contract start date?</p>
<p>To be determined....approx. 1 Feb - 1 Apr, pending on funding.</p>
<p>17. Can contract awardee submit cost to train initial cadre of military instructors? We would like to train military pilots with our CSIPs?</p>
<p>The initial military cadre have already been trained through CSIPs.</p>
<p>18. Is there an incumbent contractor currently providing services for this or similar contract today?</p>
<p>No, there is no incumbent.</p>
<p>19. Is there an opportunity for hangar and or facilities space at KRIV? If facilities are not available at KRIV, will government crew members initiate flight activity from KONT?</p>
<p>Freeman Holdings is the FBO at March ARB, and they will be able to answer if they have hangar facilities. If not, government crew members will initiate flight activity to/from KONT.</p>
<p>20. When the aircraft is unavailable due to "scheduled" maintenance events, is the contractor required to have a replacement aircraft available?</p>
<p>A replacement aircraft would be desired, but not required by the contract.</p>
<p>21. Please confirm the government will guarantee minimum of 600 hours of flight activity for a month period under this contract?</p>
<p>The government guarantees a minimum of 600 hours, for a 12 month period. These hours will be prorated for anything less than 12 months (Performance Work Statement Appendix A-1).</p>
<p>22. Will a fuel "peg rate" be established to ensure contractor will be reimbursed for all actual fuel expenses based on unknown and unexpected fluctuating market conditions?</p>
<p>The contractor will provide a base fuel price in their proposal. If actual fuel prices decline, the balance will be held by the customer as a credit. The contractor will be reimbursed for any fuel costs above the base fuel price. (Performance Work Statement para 1.2.6.1.)</p>
<p><br />23. Can you describe typical daily/weekly operations in more detail relating to flight schedules? Are flights conducted 24 hours day including night time operations?</p>
<p>The government initially intends to fly approximately 2.5 hours per day Mon-Fri, day VFR only. Eventually, the program is expected to mature to IFR and night flights. Occasionally, the government may fly on a weekend if required to catch up on overall flight hours, but would intend to do so in the confines of a 40 hour work week. For example, if a Monday fly day canceled for weather, the government may add a Saturday.</p>

<DESC><br />SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUCEMENT (SYNOPSIS): The purpose of this announcement is a MARKET SURVEY to determine the interest and capability of Small Business, HUBZone, 8(a) or Service Disabled Veteran Owned Business contractors for the following proposed 2-Step Design-Build Project: Convert, Remodel, and bring up to code a currently excess Unaccompanied Personnel Housing facility located at Arctic Avenue and 3rd Street on Fort Greely (Building 660), Alaska. Responsible sources having relevant experience and capabilities to perform the required work will be considered for determining the acquisition strategy for the subject project.
<p>This Sources Sought announcement is part of a market survey for information only to be used for preliminary planning purposes. No proposals are being requested or accepted with this synopsis. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS AND NO CONTRACT WILL BE AWARDED FROM THIS SYNOPSIS. PROJECT IS SUBJECT TO AVAILABILITY OF FUNDS.</p>
<p>PROJECT INFORMATION: Convert, remodel, and bring up to code a currently excess Unaccompanied Personnel Housing facility located at Arctic Avenue and 3rd Street on Fort Greely (Building 660). Facility is to be converted to three category codes: 14183, 14185, and 73016. Specifically, the 1st floor will be designed for 73016 (Emergency Services/Police Station), the 2nd and 3rd floors will be designed for 14183 (Battalion Headquarters) and 14185 (Company Operations Facility). The bottom floor will be used for "common" functions such as arms rooms, supply rooms, and an EST trainer.</p>
<p>Building 660 is a 4-story building constructed in 1961 as an UPH barracks with dormitory rooms, gang latrines, food preparation, dining and administrative functions. The 1995 Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) action caused the majority of the building to become uninhabitable through 15 years of non-use and minimal maintenance. The 51,000 SF of UPH space has been listed as excess since Fort Greely was withdrawn from Army Surplus by Missile Defense Agency (MDA) in 2002. Major components of the facility are failing or have failed resulting in a current ISR-I rating Black. Currently the Network Enterprise Center (NEC) has equipment space for various wireless telecommunication systems and the Armed Forces Network. The installation's 911 Dispatch center is located in the basement and the 49th MDB utilizes space in the basement adjacent to the 911 Call Center for a simulator trainer.</p>
<p>This project repairs a 1960's era, 4-story building, providing adequate Emergency Services/Police Station, Battalion HQ, and COF functions. Most components of the building have failed or are failing and are unusable. Utilities have been shut off to a majority of the building. The project will demolish and remove all remaining exterior and interior finishes, fixtures and mechanical and electrical equipment. Hazardous material will be removed from the building during demolition including, but not limited to, lead based paint and asbestos. The facility's thermal envelope will be repaired through application of an exterior insulation finish system (EIFS), EPDM roof, and energy efficient doors and windows. Interior spaces will be repaired including, but not limited to, failed vinyl composite tile, drywall and wall studs, electrical panels, branch circuits and end devices, HVAC system, plumbing lines and fixtures and suspended ceiling grids. Repairs will also encompass the failing fire alarm system along with voice and data communications infrastructure in accordance to table 2-1 DA Pam 420-11. Repairs on building infrastructure will start at the main, outside the facility. Repairs on the electrical infrastructure will start at the transformer, external to the facility. The completed repair will conform to the ABA "Accessibility Design Guidelines for DoD Facilities" and other applicable codes. AT/FP will be repaired in accordance with UFC 4-010-01. Progressive Collapse cost was determined, included in the cost estimate, and based on the Occupancy Category (OC) in accordance to UFC 4-023-03, Design of Building to Resist Progressive Collapse.</p>
<p><br />INSTRUCTIONS:</p>
<p>Contract duration is 450 days and estimated cost range is between $6,000,000.00 to $15,000,000.00. NAICS is 236220. Size limitation is $33.5M.</p>
<p>&bull; All interested Small Business, HUBZone, 8(a), or Service Disabled Veteran Owned Business contractors should notify this office in writing by mail or email on or before 6 January 2013, 12:00 pm, Alaska Time. <br />&bull;&nbsp;Responses should include <strong>(Sources Sought&nbsp;Request is Not Limited to Small Business)</strong> : <br /><br />(1) If Business is certified by the SBA please provide the following:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (a) Identification and verification that the company is certified by the Small Business Administration as a HUBZone or 8(a) contractor or self-certified as a Service Disabled Veteran Owned Business, as applicable;</p>
<p>(2) The level (dollar amount) of performance and payment bonding capacity that the company could attain for the proposed project;</p>
<p>(3) Past Experience - Provide descriptions of projects substantially complete or completed within the last five years which are similar to this project in size, scope, and dollar value. With each project experience provided, include the date when the project was completed or will be complete, location of the project, contract amount and size of the project, the portion and percentage of work that was self performed, whether the project was design/build or not, and a description of how the experience relates to the proposed project;</p>

<DESC><p>THIS NOTICE IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. This opportunity is available only to The MITRE Corporation, the contractor under IRS Contract #TIRNO-99-D-00005/Task Order # HHSM-500-2009-00021U, which is a competitive task order under an Indefinite-Delivery/Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) contract. CMS intends to award a cost-plus-fixed-fee (CPFF) modification to the aforementioned task order to perform security testing and evaluation of the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH). The period of performance for this requirement will be Date of Award through July 27, 2013.</p>
<p>IRS Contract #TIRNO-99-D-00005 was initially awarded to the MITRE Corporation, a Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC), as a competitive Cost Reimbursement type IDIQ contract. The work to be performed under this task order is part of the CMS Integrated Information Technology (IT) Investment &amp; System Life Cycle Framework. As part of this program, all CMS systems must undergo a Security Test &amp; Evaluation (ST&amp;E) prior to accreditation or reaccreditation, before it is placed into an operational state, when a significant change has been made to an existing system, or at least every three years. Since the ST&amp;E's required for each specific CMS system vary, it is impossible to predict the number, types and specific systems that will require testing during a contract year. Also, due to legislative mandates, such as the National Level Repository and new ST&amp;E requirements, the price of each ST&amp;E performed is subject to adjustments. Per FAR Subpart 16.2, a firm-fixed-price contract type provides for a price that is not subject to adjustment on the basis of the contractor's cost experience in performing the contract. Thus, due to the nature of this requirement, a fixed-price modification would not be appropriate.</p>

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center, Aircraft Division (NAWCAD), Patuxent River, MD, intends to award a modification under task order N00178-05-D-4249 M802 with Compliance Corporation of Lexington Park, MD. This modification will be to support the Ship &amp; Shore Based Electronic Systems (S&amp;SEBS) Team NAWCAD (Code 4.5). The Mechanical Facilities Team (Code 4.5.12) provides assistance and support required by the engineering divisions. A sole source modification is consistent with the terms identified within this announcement upon the basis of the authority provided in 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) and implemented by FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements. Unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements would result given any other action due to current circumstances. This notice is being posted because the option, under FAR 52.217-8, was not previously evaluated as part of the initial contract award. This option exercise will be at the current rates specified in the current contract, as allowed by FAR 52.217-8, and will extend performance for a period of not to exceed six months beginning on 16 December 2012. This option exercise will further allow for solicitation, evaluation, and award of the competitive follow-on procurement. The incumbent contractor is the only responsible offeror for exercise of this option, as the Government would experience unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements if this option were not exercised before the current contract expiration date of 15&nbsp;December 2012. <br /><br />This notice is not a request for proposals. No phone inquiries will be entertained. All responses shall be made in writing by email, U.S. mail, or facsimile to the attention of Terry Miller at terry.miller@navy.mil using the contact information provided in this synopsis.<br />
