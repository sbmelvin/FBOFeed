ORIGIN. This part requires engineering source approval by the design control
activity in order to maintain the quality of the part. Existing unique design
capability, engineering skills, and manufacturing knowledge by the qualified
source(s) require acquisition of the part from the approved source(s). The
approved source(s) retain data rights, manufacturing knowledge, or technical
data that are not economically available to the Government, and the data or
knowledge is essential to maintaining the quality of the part. An alternate
source must qualify in accordance with the design control activity's procedures,
as approved by the cognizant Government engineering activity. The qualification
procedures must be approved by the Government engineering activity having
jurisdiction over the part in the intended application. The subject item
requires Government source approval prior to contract award, as the item is
flight critical and/or the technical data available has not been determined
adequate to support acquisition via full and open competition. Only the
source(s) previously approved by the Government for this item have been
solicited. The time required for approval of a new source is normally such that
an award cannot be delayed pending approval of a new source. If you are not an
approved source you must submit, together with your proposal, the information
detailed in one of the NAVSUP Weapon Systems Support (NAVSUP WSS) Source
Approval Information Brochures listed below. Spares: www.neco.navy.mil/sar.aspx
Repair: www.neco.navy.mil/sarr.aspx These brochures identify the technical data
required to be submitted based on your company's experience in production of the
same or similar item, or if this is an item you have never made. If your request
for source approval is currently being evaluated at NAVSUP WSS submit with your
offer a copy of the cover letter which forwarded your request for source
approval. Offers received which fail to provide all data required by the Source
Approval Brochure or document previous submission of all data required by the
Source Approval Brochure will not be considered for award under this
solicitation. Please note, if evaluation of a source approval request submitted
hereunder cannot be processed in time and/or approval requirements preclude the
ability to obtain subject items in time to meet Government requirements, award

ORIGIN. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes and the
proposed/contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government
intends to negotiate with only one source. Interested persons may identify their
interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit quotes. Quotes
received prior to the award date will be considered by the Government.A
determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon
responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.
Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of
determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. This part requires
engineering source approval by the design control activity in order to maintain
the quality of the part. Existing unique design capability, engineering skills,
and manufacturing knowledge by the qualified source(s) require acquisition of
the part from the approved source(s). The approved source(s) retain data rights,
manufacturing knowledge, or technical data that are not economically available
to the Government, and the data or knowledge is essential to maintaining the
quality of the part. An alternate source must qualify in accordance with the
design control activity's procedures, as approved by the cognizant Government
engineering activity. The qualification procedures must be approved by the
Government engineering activity having jurisdiction over the part in the
intended application.

This part must be acquired from a manufacturing source(s) specified on a source
control or selected item drawing as defined by the current version of
DoD-STD-100. Suitable technical data, Government data rights, or manufacturing
knowledge are not available to permit acquisition from other sources, nor
qualification testing of another part, nor use of a second source part in the
intended application. Although, by DoD-STD-100 definition, altered and selected
items shall have an adequate technical data package, data review discloses that
required data or data rights are not in Government possession and cannot be
