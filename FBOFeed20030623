<DESC>The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) intends to award a service contract for the collection of Health Plan Employer Data and Information Set (HEDIS) data and for providing Federal Employees and retirees' access to accreditation information.

HEDIS is a tool used to measure and assess health plans' performances by looking at their structures and processes.  HEDIS is also part of an integrated system to establish accountability in managed care.

OPM intends to award a service contract to the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) 2000 L Street, NW, Suite 500, Washington, DC 20036, for the collection of HEDIS data.  HEDIS was developed and maintained by NCQA, an organization committed to assessing, reporting on and improving the quality of care provided by organized delivery systems.  NCQA has developed the measures OPM wished to collect and is already receiving the data in an established database from many of the health plans OPM wants to participate.  OPM wants this project to be integrative, as much as possible, with NCQA's current data collection activities and information products.  This approach would take maximum advantage of NCQA's existing systems and processes, resulting in substantial savings to the Government, since NCQA will not charge the Government for work they are already performing.  Any other contractor would have to duplicate the effort and charge accordingly.

Any company which believes they can provide an equivalent service should provide complete information regarding their service and representative pricing to OPM within 15 days of the publication of this notice.  This is not a solicitation for offers but rather a notice of OPM's intent to negotiate a sole source award to NCQA.  If OPM determines that competition is possible, a pre-solicitation notice will be issued.

<RESPDATE>070803
<ARCHDATE>08072003
<CONTACT>Kendra Archbald,
<DESC>The Government is planning a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) acquisition to qualify the production lot performance of an Elvax coated M206 infrared flare. The mositure-resistant Elvax coating formulation and processing technique are the result of a two-year R&D effort performed by the Pyro Systems group at TACOM-ARDEC, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ. This Statement of Work (SOW) proposes the production of approximately four hundred fifty (450) Magnesium-Teflon-Elvax (MTE) formulated M206 flares at an existing M206 infrared flare production contractor facility. The MTE flares produced will be subjected to the standard M206 first article tests by the contractor. The remaining flares will be sent to ARDEC and OO-ALC/WMBA, Hill Air Force Base. ARDEC will confirm static infrared output, velocity performanc and efficacy of ELVAX in reduction of hydrogen outgassing. OO-ALC/WMBA will flight test the MTE flares to confirm performance equivalent to the standard M206. The results of this SOW effort can be applied to similar magnesium based infrared flare formulations. Upon successful completion of this program, a follow on effort will be initiated to incorporate the MTE formulation into the M206 Technical Data Package.  A limited source negotiation is contemplated with Kilgore Flare Company LLC, and BAE Systems Integrated Defense Solutions, Inc, in accordance with FAR 6.302-3(b)(v) because it is necessary to maintain the required domestic capability for production of critical supplies by limiting competition to items manufactured in the United States or the the United States and Canada. The solicitation will be available for downloading from http://procnet.pica.army.mil approximately forty-five days from the  publication of this notice. See numbered notes 13 and 22.

<DESC>NA Point of Contact, Vernon Vann, 817-886-1049 One or two (2) Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ), Cost Plus Award Fee (CPAF) Contracts that will, collectively, provide for performance of the full range of services, primarily in the country of Iraq, including but not be limited to:  extingui shing oil fires; environmental assessments; environmental clean-up at oil sites; assessing the condition of all elements of the infrastructure; engineering design and construction necessary to restore the infrastructure to a safe operating condition; maint enance of oil fields, including technical assistance in the performance of reservoir management, production engineering, in-field drilling, facilities engineering, and maintenance; pipeline maintenance; maintenance of refineries; providing life support res ources and facilities for government and contractor personnel deployed in Iraq; procurement and importation of fuel products; distribution of fuel products within Iraq; technical assistance in marketing and sale/export of Iraqi crude oil and refined produc ts; technical assistance and consulting services to the Iraqi Oil Companies; support continued and additional planning; and mission integration and management. The amount of work available to be done under these contracts depends on a number of factors outside the control of the contracting office.  At the moment, the best projections of the contracting office show that little work will be available for award.  H owever, this projection may be affected by a number of factors outside the control of the Corps of Engineers.  These factors include the possibility of additional intentional damage to the Iraqi oil infrastructure from additional looting or intentional sab otage; potential delays in receiving the funds required to execute work necessary to repair the Iraqi Oil Infrastructure under the current contract; The speed with which the Iraqi Oil Companies are able to assume complete responsibility for their own opera tions; an existing political emphasis on having Iraqi workers and companies perform as much of the work as possible; political decisions which may be made affecting the role of the Corps of Engineers, DOD, or the U.S. in the government of Iraq; and the dat e on which a functioning interim Iraqi government assumes responsibilities for these operations.  Since these contracts will be available to cover any contingencies which may occur and the Corps cannot predict the future with certainty, the proposed duration for the contracts awarded will be an initial base period of 24 months with three (3) one-year o ptions for a total of not-to-exceed 60 months.  Based on current information and the current extent of damages, along with our plan to use Iraq labor force and Iraq capability to the maximum extent possible, there is a possibility that work required under each of these proposed contracts will range a minimum amount of $500,000 up to not more than  $500,000,000 for the life of the contract.  The minimum guaranteed amount for the base period is $500,000.00. It is the governments preference to award two contracts.  However, if there does not appear to be a significant amount of work available to be done under the contract at the time of award, only one contract may be awarded.  If two contracts are awarded, on e will have a unique statement of work supporting the North Oil Company and the other will have a unique statement of work supporting the South Oil Company.  The geographic areas of the two contracts will not overlap.  This project will be advertised as UNRESTRICTED.  Companies from all countries qualifying under the Trade Agreements Act and Balance of Payments Act and companies from countries not qualifying under these Acts but which are members of the Coalition are eli gible to receive an award.   The solicitation requirements will include, but not limited to, the following: (1) An established and approved accounting system that is adequate for determining  costs applicable to a cost-reimbursement type of contract.  This system must include methods for identifying and tracking the contractors indirect cost rates, etc; and all cost elements, including, but not limited to, overhead, general and administrative,  base and award fee. (2)A Management Information System for project planning and execution that provides for: (a) planning and scheduling; (b) cost estimating, budgeting and accounting; (c) quality control; (d) procurement and material management; and, (e) other reports or dat a prescribed by the Government.   (3) Established and approved procurement and purchasing procedures.  (4) An established and approved Contractors Property Control System. (5) Subcontracting Plan that satisfies the requirements of FAR clause 52.219-9.   This is a best value negotiated acquisition.  All contracts will be awarded based upon the Best Value to the Government.  Procurement consideration will be given to cost, technical, schedule, and other salient factors included in the solicitation.  Subcont ractors responsible for any of the identified services must be identified in the proposals and their technical capability will be considered along with the technical capability of the offerors.   The basic form of the contract will be an IDIQ cost plus award fee contract.  However, it is possible that some task orders will be issued on a firm fixed price basis.    Funds are not presently available for this contract.  The award of this contract is contingent upon the availability of funds.  The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code applicable to this project is 928110.   Estimated issue date is 8 July 2003.   Proposals will be due 14 August 2003.   A pre-proposal conference, to present an overview of the requirements of the contracts and to answer questions, will be conducted on 14 July 2003.  The location, time, and registration requirements can be obtained from the following website www.mhli.org. The solicitation and specifications will be placed Internet only.

<DESC>The Ministry of Water and Irrigation/Water Authority of Jordan (MWI/WAJ), the “Contracting Agency,” and the “Employer”, a Jordanian Public Sector Organization in the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, requests expressions of interest and submission of pre-qualification information for the Mafraq Wastewater Treatment Plant Project (“Project”).  The purpose of this Request for Qualifications (RFQ) is to shortlist individual U.S. companies, joint venture organizations or consortium of design firms and contractors (including their Jordanian subcontractors and sub-consultants).  Proposing teams or organizations may qualify based on their eligibility, availability of required resources, financial capacity, technical and operation and maintenance experience with projects of similar scope and magnitude, under a Design/Build/Operate (D/B/O) procurement process.  The qualifications of Jordanian sub-consultants who may be included in the makeup of the tendering team shall be no less than Class “1B” water and wastewater consultants as classified by the Ministry of Public Works and Housing.  Further, the qualifications of the Jordanian construction subcontractors shall include being listed as Class “1” for water and wastewater work or wastewater treatment plant work or Class “1” for electrical/mechanical work as classified by the Ministry of Public Works and Housing. The Project scope includes:  design of a new 6,550 cubic meter (1.3 MGD) average annual daily flow, wastewater treatment plant, construction, start-up and commissioning of the new plant, and the Effluent Reuse System, training involving operations and maintenance training of the Employer’s personnel and operation and maintenance for a one-year period following the Employer’s taking-over of the facilities. Emphasis is on low technology processes for this plant.  The Water Authority of Jordan (WAJ) plans to tender the work using two steps.  The first step, or Phase 1 in the procurement process, consists of this Request for Qualifications (RFQ) and Phase 2 consists of a Request for Proposals (RFP) that will be issued to the pre-qualified Tenderers selected by the Phase 1 process. The Project will be located near Mafraq, Jordan, about 60 Km northeast of the capital city of Amman.  The new wastewater plant and reuse system will be located at the site adjacent to the existing Mafraq WWTP that will be decommissioned after commissioning of the new plant. The successful Tenderer will enter into a direct contract with WAJ and will be the entity contractually responsible for Project design, construction, management, operation, training and maintenance.  Tenders from combinations of companies/firms are acceptable provided that all entities meet the eligibility criteria listed in this RFQ and providing they define their organization as stipulated in the RFQ.  Prospective Tenderers responding to this RFQ must be capable of executing the entire Project managing the scope of work through all of its execution phases.  The responses to the requirements of the RFQ will then be used to qualify prospective Tenderers who will be invited to submit Technical and Financial Proposals for the Project. The anticipated contract value ranges from US $5 million to US $12 million.  The Project is partially funded by a grant received from the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and by the Government of Jordan.

<DESC>Synopsis and Request for Information/Sources Sought Synopsis.  The Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWC) Crane is seeking sources for a life cycle upgrade or replacement on the Australian Defense Industries (ADI) Location of Misses and Hits (LOMAH) system.  The ADI LOMAH upgrade shall be performed on 2 ranges.  (1) 8 Lane Sub-Sonic Range Upgrade: This range has 8 lanes of box targets (connectable at three different distances) and two banks of series 6 mechanisms (with hit switches) at 25 and 50 yards.  It also contains two mover rails with series 10 mechanisms that traverse the full length of the bank.  Range wiring is a straight forward cable per lane, with the first mover connected with lane 1 and the second mover with lane 2.  The movers on this range traverse the full width of the bank.  The control computer is an older Apple Macintosh running a superseded operating system and using obsolete NuBus communication cards. (2) 8 Lane Super-Sonic Range Upgrade: This range has 8 lanes, consisting of four banks of Tbars and Series 6 mechanisms at 70, 80, 100 and 200 yards, 4 movers (with Tbars and Series 10 mechanisms) at 150 yards, and L-Box Targets (2m) also at 200 yards.  There are Individual Video Display Units (IVDUs) with printers at the fixed, covered firing point.  A previous upgrade to the range allows for the use of the smaller (moveable) box targets at any connection point in the lanes.  Due to the nature of the weapons fired and the layout of this range, current software includes options to allow firers to reset shot matching from the IVDU for their lane, and for operators to vary the blanking times on the Point Location Sensor (PLS) equipment.  The movers on this range expose across two lanes. Please provide information on capabilities, corporat e experience, and relevant technical data. Also, availability information along with budgetary pricing information should be provided. Interested vendors should provide information along with technical questions regarding this announcement to Doug McDaniel via email at mcdaniel_d@crane.navy.mil, or mail: NSWC Crane, Attn. Doug McDaniel, Code 1164, Bldg. 64, 300 Highway 361, Crane, IN 47522. All information must be received by 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time on 21 July 2003. Please reference solicitation number N00164-03-Q-6409. This notice does not constitute an Invitation for Bids (IFB) or a Request for Proposal (RFP) and is not a commitment by the U.S. Government to procure subject products. The Government is only seeking possible sources for future needs. No solicitation document exists at this time. THE GOVERNMENT WILL NOT PAY FOR THE INFORMATION SOLICITED.

<DESC>Description:  Naval Air Systems Command, PMA-275, has a requirement to update versions of the CV-22 Concept of Employment (COE) and CV-22 C4I Support Plan (C4ISP) in support of the Milestone III decision meeting.  Updates of the COE and C4ISP are required to educate both internal and external audiences on how the CV-22 will be employed and how it interface with Command, Control, Communications, Computer, and Intelligence (C4I) systems.  Required deliverables include an updated CV-22 COE document, an updated CV-22 C4I support plan, and fully correlated COE and C4ISP final documents in concert with the approved Operational Requirements Document (ORD).  The accuracy, completeness, and timeliness of deliverable items will be the responsibility of the supplier.  The CV-22 C4ISP will require delivery and receipt of classified information at the SECRET classification level.  The expected period of performance for this contract will be one year, starting in July 2003.  It is anticipated that a sole source, Firm Fixed Price contract, using the authority under FAR part 13.5 Test Program for Commercial Items, will be awarded to Whitney, Bradley & Brown, Inc., 1604 Spring Hill Rd., Suite 200, Vienna, Virginia 22182.  Whitney, Bradley, & Brown, Inc., (WBB) is the only known source that can provide the strong operational expertise required for a “turn-key” understanding of operational concepts and warfare architecture, with specific reference to the V-22 acquisition program.  WBB developed the initial Concept of Employment for CV-22, a product that will be updated under this contract.  WBB’s in-depth Marine Corps aviation expertise will be leveraged to ensure that the latest DoD and Service (Navy and Marine Corps) guidance, vision, and doctrine are used in this update. Additionally, WBB led the development of the previous CV-22 C4ISP Support Plan and has the historical expertise and knowledge to ensure accurate updating of the architectures and analysis and can provide guidance of the plan through the cumbersome DoD Interoperability Certification process.  WBB, due to its CV-22 program history, is the only source that can develop and provide the updated C4I and COE documents in a timely manner to meet the Milestone III schedule.  Any questions to this synopsis should be sent via e-mail to NewfieldCE@navair.navy.mil before 1 July 2003.

<DESC>The US Department of Agriculture Agricultural Research in Wapato, WA has a requirement for an image DNA, RNA and protein blots with chemiluminesence, Our laboratory cannot use radioisotopes, our researcher uses green and red fluorescent proteins (the genes which then cause the organism to produce these proteins), allows for imaging of organisms expressing these proteins, quantitate the amount of the protein expressed.  Both the chemiluminescence and the flourescent protein imaging requires a special camera that is cooled (called CCD) needed to quantitate the amount of DNA (or RNA) in a gel.  The system calculates the molecular weight and the amount (down to femptograms) of these macromolecules in the gel.  Our lab does not have fluorescence nucleic acid densitometer and our spectrophotometer is not sensitive enough, this system would serve that purpose.  Our lab does not have a darkroom at the laboratory, therefore, most 'routine' imaging using x-ray film, is not available.  The only known system which can perform the above is the FluorChem IS 8900 from Alpha Innotech with accessories, gray scale thermal printer, reflective epi-uv lights, four rolls of glossy paper, Alphaeasy FC stand lone software.   A solicitation is not available for this requirement, interested firms are encouraged to submit proposals to the attention of Fred Gifford as listed in this notice. See numbered note 22.

<CONTACT>Point of Contact - https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop/Public/ASP/dcop.asp
<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

Interested sources should provide a letter of interest with a capabilities package (no more than 15 pages in length, 12-point font minimum) demonstrating ability to perform the services listed above. Potential Sources may submit resumes/personnel information, which will not be counted in the 15-page limitation cited in the proceeding sentence.

Alternatively, the package may be sent by mail to the following address: Naval Air Systems Command, Contracts Department (Attn: J. D.

The letter of interest should include, at a minimum, the following information: 1) Name and address of the firm; 2) Size of business; 3) Ownership; 4) Year firm established; 5) Names of two principals to contact, including title and telephone number; 6) Company profile to include number of employees, annual revenue history, office locations, DUNs number, if 8(a), date of acceptance into Small Business Administration 8(a) program and anticipated graduation date; 7) Resources available such as corporate management and currently-employed personnel to be assigned to the project to include professional qualifications and specific experience of such personnel; 8) Management approach to staffing this effort with qualified personnel. The staffing plan should address current hires that would be available for assignment to this effort, possible subcontract/teaming arrangements, and strategy for recruiting and retaining qualified personnel; 9) A description of previous experience that demonstrates your firm's ability to effectively manage or perform a contract similar in size and complexity to this requirement. Please include pertinent information for on-going contract or contracts completed within the last five years, and identify any, which were under NAICS code 541330. Pertinent information is: a) Name of Contracting Activity; b) Contract Number; c) Contract Type(FFP, Cost, IDIQ, or combination); d) Period of Performance, Total Contract Value, and Total Dollar Value under the Contract that the firm was actually responsible for under this NAICS Code; e) Summary of contract work; f) Contracting Officer's name and current telephone number; g) Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (name and current telephone number); h) List of major subcontractors including name, address, and telephone number of primary points of contact. While the Government acknowledges that many companies have the capability to perform any one or even several functions, the Government expects to contract with a firm that has the overall capability to manage this effort, including critical services. If sufficient interest is not received, the Government reserves the right to determine the appropriate procurement method, and the resulting solicitation may be issued unrestricted. No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If a solicitation is released it will be synopsized. It is the potential offeror's responsibility to monitor these sites for release of any solicitation or synopsis. Telephone inquires will not be accepted. This synopsis is for informational and planning purposes only, and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government pay for information solicited. All information submitted is at the offeror's own expense. Respondents will not be contacted regarding their submission or information gathered as a result of this notice. Respondents will not be notified about the outcome of the Government's review of the solicited information. Failure to respond to this sources sought synopsis does not mean that a firm cannot respond to a solicitation at a later date.

<DESC>The United States Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) has a requirement for Soil Conservation Technical services.  This is an OMB Circular A-76 Cost Comparison Study.  The purpose of this study is to determine the most cost effective method of providing soil conservation technical services for the listed locations in Vermont. Government personnel are currently performing these services.  In accordance with OMB Circular A-76, commercial offers will be compared with the Government's costs to perform the above services.  The commercial proposals will not result in a contract if Government performance is determined to be more cost advantageous.  Major components of this work include: basic conservation planning services, field investigations and topographic surveys, inventories of soils, livestock, water resources, collection of data for planning, design and construction of soil and water conservation practices; these services include performing designs of conservation practices, and providing construction quality assurance during construction of these conservation practices.  The services provided include explaining applicable USDA NRCS programs and working cooperatively with local Conservation District staff and other partner agencies.  Any contract resulting from this solicitation will have a one-year base period and four one-year options.  The lowest price technically acceptable selection process will be used with any resulting award being a firm-fixed price performance based service contract.  Firms will be evaluated based on the evaluation criteria listed in the request for proposal to determine technical acceptability.  The solicitation will be unrestricted.  The solicitation will be available on or about May 9, 2003, and can be downloaded from this web site.  Hard copies of the solicitation document will not be available.  All questions must be directed to the contracting officer in writing by e-mail at pat.pickett@vt.usda.gov, by facsimile to 802-951-6327, or by mail.  No questions will be accepted by telephone.  The anticipated date for receipt of proposals is on or about June 9, 2003.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which shall be considered by the Agency.  The U. S. Government reserves the right to retain the work in-house and make no contract award.

<DESC>The purpose of this solicitation modification is to extend the response date to 07/24/03 by 3:00pm and to supply Questions & Answers - Part 1 pertaining to the solicitation.
Ref#03-856-3263.  All other information remains the same.
               ****Questions & Answers Part 1******
1)Question:	From the write up received in the solicitation, there is not enough information to determine the envelope that the cryostat is inserted into, and were wondering if there are any drawings that would add clarity to the requirement?

Answer:	The solicitation is for a complete cryogenic system that will mount onto a tilt/translate goniometer with the described bolt pattern.  NIST is not requesting a helium-3 insert to be placed in a helium-4 cryostat or storage dewar (which would not meet the specification forbidding liquid cryogens in the beam line).  
NIST did not provide specifications for the available space above the goniometer mount because typical offerings generally fit without problem on our targeted spectrometers.  However, as a guide the entire cryostat shall not exceed a diameter of 10 inches in the neutron beam path.  Above the neutron beam path, the cryostat shall be less than 24 inches in diameter.  The overall height shall be expected to be less than 6 feet in a running configuration, and NIST has ample overhead clearance for removing cryostat inserts etc.  None of these numbers are meant to be taken as inviolable requirements, but are merely given as guidelines.

2)Question:	I understand that the sample cannot be in He-3 liquid but must be in either vacuum and (static) exchange gas.  Please confirm?

Answer:	Yes, the sample shall be either vacuum or static exchange gas.  This is addressed in the performance specifications and in the neutron scattering requirements.  Liquid helium-3 produces too large a neutron scattering background signature, and is to be kept outside the beam area.

3)Question:	If this is the case, the base temperature of the sample may not be able to reach below 300 mK per our past experience, and we just have quote whatever performance specs we feel comfortable with.  Is that acceptable?

Answer:	Vendors are advised to quote the performance specifications that you are comfortable with.

4) Question:	The solicitation document states that minimum sample space diameter should be 50mm.  Samples for neutron scattering experiments are typically less than this so we just want to make certain of this specification?

Answer:	The specification of 50mm is correct.  Although samples are generally much smaller than this, many of our sample cans, which go between different types of sample environment equipment, require this diameter.  NIST does understand that this increases the required sample well diameter in the case of inserts with vacuum cans.
  
5) Question:	The solicitation does not specify any wiring down to the sample region.  Does NIST have any specific requirements in this regard that the vendor should know about?  Are there any instrumentation wiring requirements to the sample stage?

Answer:	There is no specification or requirement for user wiring down to the sample position.  There are no specific requirements for such user wiring, though provision for or inclusion of such may be seen as an added benefit above and beyond the base specifications.  The only relevant requirement beyond the ordinary cryogenic concerns is that the wiring would not extend into the neutron beam area.

Award shall be made to the offeror whose quote offers the best value to the Government, technical, price, and other factors considered.  The Government will evaluate information based on the following evaluation criteria: 1)Technical Capability factors that adhere to the technical specifications, user-friendly temperature control, cryogen maintenance specification requirements.  User-friendly temperature control and cryogen maintenance requirements are inherently germane to the use of the system by NIST personnel. User-friendly temperature control that is easy to operate, either through simple and objective procedures or a uniform interface, shall be judged more highly. Additionally, Cryogen maintenance requirements refer to both the periodic need to refill liquid cryogens (nitrogen and helium) and the periodic need to recycle closed-loop cryogenic helium-3.  Systems that operate for longer periods between cryogen maintenance shall be judged more highly. 2) Past performance and 3) Price.  Technical and Past Performance, when combined, are more important than price. The selection factors for this RFQ are adherence to the technical specifications, user-friendly temperature control, cryogen maintenance requirements, past performance and price.*** 

Evaluation of Technical Capability shall be based on the information provided in the quotation.  Offerors shall include the make and model of the product, manufacturer sales literature or other product literature which clearly documents that the offered product meets or exceeds the specifications stated above.  Evaluation of Past Performance shall be based on the references provided IAW FAR 52.212-1(b)(10) and/or information provided by NIST and its affiliates.  Offerors shall provide a list of at least THREE (3) REFERENCES to whom the same or similar products have been sold.  The list of references shall include, at a minimum: The name of the reference contact person and the company or organization; the telephone number of the reference contact person; the contract or grant number; the amount of the contract and the address and the telephone number of the Contracting Officer if applicable; and the date of delivery or the date services were completed. Past Performance shall be evaluated to determine the overall quality of the product and service provided by the Contractor.  Offerors with no relevant past performance shall not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably. ***

<DESC>NA The Program Manager for Utility Helicopters (PM-UH) is exploring the feasibility of upgrading the UH-60A/L Utility Seats to increased crashworthiness and functionality.  In support of this effort, industry input is requested on the proposed specification, and on the technical feasibility of integrating an improved non-developmental seat that utilizes existing seating system attachment points. Interested manufactures with demonstrated helicopter utility seat integration and production capabilities are invited to review the draft UH-60 Improved Utility Seat Specification and Acquisition Strategy at http://utility-helicopters.redstone.army.mil/doc s.html.  Said manufactures are further invited to contact Mr. Steve Monaco (256) 955-0629 or Mr. Andy Ksepka (256) 955-9243 to establish a time during the week of 14 thru 18 July 2003 (subject to change) to brief PM-UH on the specification, technical issue s, concerns, and comments as related to satisfying the requirements with a non-developmental seat solution.  U.S. Government employees, government support contractors, and Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation representatives will participate in briefings and revi ew documentation provided in response to this Sources Sought Synopsis.  All material received in response to this Sources Sought Synopsis becomes the property of the U.S Government with no proprietary data rights.  The government is under no obligation to further pursue or award a contract based on this Sources Sought Synopsis. The following table reflects the current yearly demand for replacement seats, the number of UH-60M aircraft to be produced, the number of A-A Recap (Rebuild) aircraft, and the number of seats required if fleet UH-60M and Recap (Rebuild) requirements are co mbined.  There is no guarantee that the quantities reflected below will be procured or that the improved utility seat will be applied to all production or rebuild aircraft.

<DESC>The USDA-Natural Resources Conservation Service-Oklahoma State Office (NRCS), intends to conduct one A-76 cost comparison study in accordance with OMB-approved USDA Express Review Study procedures on clerical support functions in Pauls Valley, Oklahoma. The USDA Express Review process is based on the assumption that the commercial activity under study is regularly performed under contract by commercial activities at firm fixed prices and that existing Federal contracts can be used, with only minor modification, to level and define the scope of the competition and avoid the need to develop a new PWS or a formal solicitation. NRCS is seeking to locate commercial businesses that have experience and also have current government contracts for clerical support services. Major components of this work include: managing incoming and outgoing telephone calls; receiving visitors and responding to them in a professional manner; communicating with employees in a courteous and respectful manner; performing reproduction/duplication services as requested; handling incoming and outgoing mail; utilizing automated communication techniques (fax, email, voice messaging, etc.); prepares a wide range of documents utilizing computer software package, such as Microsoft Word, Excel, and Access; performs typing, proofreading, and filing with minimal errors; and organizes meetings and conferences. All interested and capable parties that have expertise in the services described above should respond VIA E-MAIL to the Contracting Officer luann.lillie@ok.usda.gov with a list of their 1) contract number 2) Federal Agency name and point of contact 3) the firm fixed price of each contract 4) the period of performance covered and 5) the size and business status. NOTE: This is NOT A SOLICITATION or request for proposals; however, depending on the results of the streamlined cost comparison, a solicitation may be issued at a later date. Any questions should be submitted via E-MAIL ONLY (no phone calls please) to the Contracting Officer (Luann Lillie).

<DESC>As a result of the recent Per Diem Advisory Board’s recommendations to consolidate lodging programs, the General Services Administration (GSA) is issuing this Request for Information to explore industry capabilities to create one overall lodging program to better serve the Federal Traveler.  GSA currently manages the Federal Premier Lodging Program (FPLP), which currently focuses on downtown locations in over 70 cities and guarantees lodging rates and room availability.  GSA is interested in expanding the program to the next level to take advantage of board recommendations and industry best practices.  GSA desires to provide a lodging program that provides worldwide coverage; outstanding lodging services; leveraged markets while providing customer choice; lodging data and spend analysis; integration with government-wide travel initiatives; ease of administration; improved travel management; and is attractive to service providers.  GSA is interested in understanding industry capabilities, outsourcing opportunities, acquisition strategies and commercial best practices in developing, implementing, managing and marketing a worldwide lodging program.

You are invited to provide information that will assist GSA in understanding the lodging industry.  The information you provide will be used to ensure that requirements developed for any future solicitation maximizes efficiencies, competition and adopts commercial best practices and will be kept confidential.  Please provide your responses to onthego@gsa.gov by close of business July 17, 2003.  Should you have any questions, please direct them to onthego@gsa.gov.

1.  For fiscal years 2000, 2001 and 2002, the Federal Government spent $1.5 billion, $1.6 billion, and $1.9 billion, respectively, on lodging.  It is, however, unable to guarantee specific volumes to any specific service provider.  The Federal Government is interested in obtaining quality lodging services under per diem rates with providers that can deliver the maximum number of rooms possible on a worldwide basis under a single contract.  What would you recommend the Government do to make any solicitation for lodging services attractive to bid on given the inability to guarantee specific volumes to any specific provider (e.g., automate the bid process, etc.)?

2.  Please identify your company name, point of contact, telephone number, mailing address, email address, and provide a brief summary of the lodging services you provide.

3.  Please identify what type of company you are (e.g., hotel consolidator, outsourcing lodging provider, hotel, association, etc.).

4.  The Federal Government uses the North American Industry Classification System (NAIC) code to determine a company’s business size.  NAICS codes can be found at http://www.census.gov/epcd/naics02/.  What is the NAICS code appropriate to your business and are you classified as a small business or large business?

5.  What types of lodging services do you provide (e.g., transient, extended stay, corporate housing)?  Please define and describe in detail (e.g., corporate housing is usually defined as X+ days and consists of A, B and C).

6.  On average, how many providers/rooms do you have in inventory and where are they located (e.g., domestic, international, major metropolitan areas, downtown areas, suburbs, rural, etc.)?  

7.  Room rates vary by distribution channels (e.g., Internet, travel agent, direct supply, etc.) and affiliate programs (e.g., AAA, AARP, and other membership/loyalty programs).  Describe each of these rate “buckets” and typical terms and conditions associated with their extension.

8.  How are room rates priced for your company (e.g., discount off the list price, based on per diem, flat percent off from list price, discount from the rack rate, negotiated contract, etc.) for corporate and Government clients?  Are these room rates published and if so, where?

9.  How are negotiated contract room rates communicated to the service provider and travel industry providers (e.g., travel agents, automated booking systems, etc.)?

10.  Are negotiated contract room rates loaded into Global Distribution Systems (GDS)?  If so, which one(s)?

11.  Does your company have the ability to offer a direct supplier connection of room inventory?  If so, how does this impact inventory and availability?  How would such a direct supplier connection be developed into a client’s automated travel management system?

12.  Are negotiated room rates commissionable?

13.  What types and/or ranges of discounts do you typically offer clients?  Compare discounts to commercial, corporate and Government clients and explain any differences in selling terms/conditions.  Provide a typical sample agreement.

14.  What drives changes to negotiated contract room rates and how often do they change?

15.  What fees, if any, are associated with date changes and/or cancellations of the room?

16.  What data, if any, is collected on lodging spend for the corporate and Government client?  Please list the data elements captured and reported on and their intended purpose/use.  

17.  Can inventory and spend data be fed into automated travel management systems and if so, how is this normally accomplished and at what estimated cost?

18.  The Federal Government contracts for a travel card program with commercial providers (e.g., Mastercard and Visa), and its account numbering sequences are unique to the Federal Government.  How would your company use the numbering sequence to ensure that the proper negotiated contract rates are displayed and charged?

19.  If a Federal agency negotiates a further reduced contract rate for their employees, how would such a rate be displayed, communicated and subsequently applied?

20.  Payment for lodging services does not occur in advance.  Generally, the Government’s travel card is used to secure the room and payment for the room occurs upon check-out (usually via the Government travel card).  How would your company accommodate this?   

21.  What is the yearly dollar volume of your Federal Government business, if any?  Is the volume concentrated in any one area (e.g., downtown locations, suburbs, etc.)?

22.  Are your domestic properties compliant with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) guidelines and the Americans with Disabilities Act guidelines?  If not, why?

23.  Does per diem impact your ability to participate in a lodging program?  Why?

24.  Do you offer outsourced lodging services and would you be interested in providing such services to the Federal Government?  

25.  If so, please describe what services are provided under an outsourced lodging program; describe terms and conditions of such services; provide a sample agreement/contract; describe what typical fees, if any, are involved in providing such services, both to the corporate client and to the lodging provider?  In addition, please identify what type of information is needed from the client in setting up a lodging program and how such a program is managed?

26.  Is your company capable of receiving electronic request for proposals?

27.  What information do you need from a potential client in order to prepare a bid for providing outsourced lodging program services?

28.  What other information would be important for the Government to understand?

The trailer shall be designed to track behind the HMMWVA2; therefore, the distance from the center of the left tire to the center of the right tire shall be 71.6 inches with the ability to use either the standard 16.5-inch wheel associated with the HMMWVA2 or a 17-inch wheel.  The minimum cargo bed length is 100-inches, with a minimum cargo bed width between wheel fenders at least 36-inches.  The trailer shall have a 30-degree minimum angle of departure and must possess a tongue weight that will not exceed 420 pounds.  The HMMWVA2 has a maximum 4,200 pound towed load capacity.  The trailer will have a minimum (threshold) 2,800 pound payload capacity with a (objective) 3,050 pound payload capacity as a design goal.  All variants of the trailer shall have a 60-inch fording capability and blackout lights.  The braking system can be hydraulically activated or waterproof electrical assist.  The trailer shall have a parking brake, be wheel jack capable and have rear-stabilizing legs.  The trailers shall maintain on-road and cross-country speeds with the HMMWVA2s performance characteristics (pavement – 45mph, improved surface – 25mph, and off road – safety dependent) without jeopardizing trailer or cargo.  One of the trailer variants shall include a capability for easy cargo loading for a military motorcycle and/or ATV.  The chassis variant will have an “on center” rib spacing.
Future scalability design considerations include ability to adapt for a 200 gallon water/fuel pod with pump option for flatbed variant and a rail mounting system for the tactical quiet generator (TQG) family – reference: www.pm-mep.army.mil.  Additionally, the capability for a basically trained automotive mechanic to add on a dual axle, tilt able self-loading & unloading capability, and quick install/removal brackets for motorcycle transport also represent future possible endeavors with the next generation trailer program.
Commercial firms, which have products with the above characteristics, are invited to submit the following: (1) Product brochures or marketing materials outlining specifications, to include a statement of capabilities, (2) current GSA contract information regarding unit; technical, operator, maintenance and parts manuals; warranty; Contract Logistics Support (CLS) and schedule pricing/or commercial catalog pricing based on 500, 1000, 5000, 8,000, and 10,000 units and (3) corporate history.

<SUBJECT>D -- DOLAR$ Replacement Program
<DESC>The Department of Labor (DOL) has decided to acquire a replacement core finan-cial management system for its Department of Labor Accounting and Related Systems (DOLAR$) using performance-based acquisition techniques. It has also decided to use Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 8 procedures to issue task orders against the General Services Administration (GSA) Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) for this initiative.
Using FAR Part 8 procedures, DOL is reviewing and analyzing companies on the GSA FSS that may have the capability to develop and implement an enterprise-wide solution of the size and complexity of the DOLAR$ Replacement Program using innovative approaches and methods in a performance-based environment. Before proceeding further under FAR Part 8, DOL would like all qualified GSA FSS schedule holders to respond to this request for information (RFI) by July 7, 2003. DOL expects to complete our capability assessment and then issue a draft request for quotations (RFQ) in mid July 2003 to those GSA contractors it deter-mines to be the most capable. The final RFQ will be issued approximately 2 weeks after the draft, with an anticipated award date, on or before September 30, 2003.
The RFQ will be issued with a statement of objectives (SOO) for the Financial Management System Implementation Project (FMSIP). The SOO will outline the project’s objectives and the definitions of success for each objective, as well as identify any of the project’s technical and management considerations and con-straints. The GSA contractors will be asked to use the SOO and its related infor-mation to prepare a quotation, including a technical approach, on how DOL’s ob-jectives will be met with the contractor’s unique solution. The participating con-tractors will also be asked to align solutions with the project’s objectives and identify performance measures, incentives, and disincentives for meeting those objectives.
DOL anticipates a comprehensive acquisition for FMSIP, including the software, hardware, and services necessary for the SI to successfully achieve DOL’s objectives. DOL expects the period of performance to be 3 years beginning September 30, 2003.
Your company should only contact the contracting officer issuing this letter if there are questions about any aspect of this acquisition. Interested parties may not contact technical personnel of DOL about this acquisition. The contracting officer may be contacted at 202-693-4570.  ALL ATTACHMENTS PERTAINING TO THIS RFI-TN-03-28 ARE UPLOADED ON THE FED BIZ OPPS FOR YOUR REFERENCE.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation, N00014-03-R-0019, is issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP).  This acquisition is a Total Small Business Set Aside in accordance with FAR 13.003(b)(1). The applicable NAICS Code is 561990 with a size standard of $6M. The resulting award will be done under Simplified Acquisition Procedures as a Firm-Fixed-Price Purchase Order and will have a period of performance of 6 months. This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-14 and DFARS Change Notice 20030603. 

Under this solicitation, the Office of Naval Research requires conference planning and coordination services to support the ONR International Workshop on Bioterrorism and Related Emerging Infectious Disease Conference to be held in Cuernavaca, Mexico, September 29- October 3, 2003 at the Mission del Sol Hotel.  Participants will include 40 third nation attendees, 10 U.S. support staff, 10 Mexican participants and 20 U.S. attendees.  Attendance is expected to be 80 persons for the entire five-day period.  It is expected to be a five-day, four-night event designed to encourage dialogue and collaboration between Latin American Ministries of Health and Defense, academic and military scientists, along with U.S. Government and scientific counterparts on this topic.  Through sharing information on pathogens, diagnosis, surveillance and response to these threats ONR hopes to strengthen public preparedness, disaster management and response, and foster research and collaborative relationships.  

A planning meeting at the Mission del Sol Hotel will be held before the planned conference dates.  The pre-meeting services will include the expenses associated with a one-day on-site meeting at the Mission del Sol Hotel.  The contractor will be responsible for the costs of a meeting room for 6 to 8 people and audiovisual equipment for one day.   

The contractor will arrange for conference facilities at the Mission del Sol Hotel with the following characteristics: conference hall to hold at least 100 people, common area for breaks, two translation booths, and  a separate breakout room for speakers before they make their presentations. All of the facilities requirements should be made available for the entire conference.  Any audiovisual equipment that is not provided by the conference facilities should be provided by the contractor for this effort. This would include two large (>48”) projection screens; two laptop computers; two overhead projectors; laser pointer and public address system.  

Lodging for all attendees will be paid by ONR through a separate award.  However, the contractor shall provide information to attendees on local hotels with reduced rates, if requested.

All other meals during the five-day period will be the responsibility of the individual attendee.  The Contractor will reimburse up to $600 in airfare expenses for the 40 3rd nation participants.  The Contractor should arrange for transportation for all 80 participants from Mexico City to Cuernavaca and the return. 

The contractor will collect registration forms, collect registration fees (at an amount yet to be determined), and issue receipts.  The conference fee will be collected from all U.S. Government/U.S. support staff attendees (30) to reimburse the contractor for those attendee’s share of the food/catering and travel costs between Mexico City to Cuernavaca.  It is expected that this registration fee will be collected for up to five (5) additional attendees (out of the remaining 80 attendees).  As such, the contractor should not include catering/food costs or travel costs between Mexico City to Cuernavaca for 35 of the 80 participants in its proposed price.  All other travel costs for U.S. Government/U.S. support staff attendees will be covered directly by their agency/command or government contracts.
