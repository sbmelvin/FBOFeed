<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

2.	Offer/Quote Evaluation. After initial offers or quotes are evaluated as described in the Evaluation of Offers provisions of this solicitation, the Contracting Officer may proceed with the DPE process. However, the Contracting Officer reserves the right to award upon initial price proposals or quotes and, therefore, may elect not to conduct the DPE. 
3.	Notification and Training. Prior to the DPE, FISC San Diego will notify each qualifying Offeror or Quoter that they have been selected to participate in the DPE. FISC San Diego or Procuri.com will provide training on the Dynamic Pricing Event process and the details pertaining to this solicitations' DPE. Written information not contained or attached to this solicitation that concerns the Dynamic Pricing Event may be provided to each participating offeror or quoter as part of their training.  
4.	Procuri.com and Government Trainer Interaction with Offerors.

Such communication shall not be considered discussions with the Offerors or Quoters within the meaning set forth in FAR Part 15.
C.	DURING THE DPE 
1.	Discussions. The DPE shall be considered the opening of discussions as defined at FAR Part 15.306(d). Offerors or Quoters may, but are not required to, revise their initial pricing proposal or quotation during the DPE. Revised price offers or quotes shall be electronically submitted by Offerors or Quoters during the DPE. Offerors or Quoters shall not submit revised pricing via any other mechanism including (but not limited to) post, courier, fax, e-mail, or orally unless specifically authorized by the Contracting Officer (see paragraph D for further details). 
2.	DPE Connection. The invited Offerors or Quoters shall be provided the opportunity to connect to the Procuri.com website (www.govauctions.procuri.com) via Internet connection. Offerors or Quoters will register for the scheduled event using the Procuri.com software solution. Offerors or Quoters shall be responsible for providing their own computer system and connecting to the telecommunications service used for each DPE via their own Internet Service Provider (ISP).
3.	Time Period. The DPE will be conducted for a period of    30 minutes or . If an offer or quote is submitted within the last  5  minutes of the time period, the DPE period shall be extended for an additional     5   minutes, if the offer/quote is the lowest price received. The time shall be extended for an unlimited number of     5 minutes extension periods, if a lower offer/quote is submitted within the last    5 minutes. The final price revision submitted during the DPE will be considered the Offeror's Final Price Proposal (see D.1 below for additional information). 
4.	Problems. Any offeror having problems during a DPE must notify the Contracting Office at FISC San Diego immediately. A "problem" is an event that interferes with the Offeror's ability to participate in the DPE and includes, but is not limited to, Internet connection and re-connection difficulties, (2) software or hardware failures, and (3) erroneous data entry errors. Offerors will have    5  minutes after the DPE goes into the "Quiet Period" status to notify the Contracting Office of any problems. The names and phone numbers of the FISC San Diego employees who will be available for assistance during the DPE will be provided to each invited offeror prior to the starting time and date of the event. If the Contracting Officer judges that any offeror is disadvantaged by the identified problem, Procuri.com and FISC San Diego may, at the sole discretion of the Contracting Officer, correct the problem, pause and may reopen the DPE, or cancel the DPE. 
D.	AFTER THE DPE 
1.	Closing Price Discussions. Discussions concerning price shall normally conclude at the close of the DPE. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the DPE from any of the participants; unless the Contracting Officer re-opens pricing discussions with all participants and requests final price proposals in accordance with FAR 15.307. 2.	No Automatic Award Determination. The Contracting Officer has determined that price is not the only factor to be considered when determining which Offeror shall receive the contract award. Therefore, the Offeror with the lowest price at the close of the Dynamic Pricing Event may not automatically be awarded the contract or purchase order that results from this solicitation.
3.	Notification of Unsuccessful Offeror(s). The Contracting Officer shall award a contract based on all the factors identified in this solicitation. The unsuccessful DPE participants will be sent a post-award notification, if required by FAR 15.503(b), via e-mail correspondence or the Procuri.com notification system.
