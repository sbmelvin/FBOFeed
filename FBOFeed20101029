<DESC>The 325th Contracting Office announces the issuance of a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) sponsored by the Air Force Research Laboratory.&nbsp; In an effort to minimize proposal preparation cost, this BAA utilizes a two-step process. The first step will be the submission of a white paper (step one). Offerors that submit white papers that are consistent with the intent of the BAA, and are of interest to the government will be invited to submit a proposal (step two). Such an invitation does not assure that the submitting contractor will be awarded a contract.&nbsp; The submission of a white paper is required prior to the submission of a proposal. Failure to follow this two-step process may preclude the chance for award. Proposals submitted in response to the BAA will be evaluated in accordance with the evaluation criteria set forth in the BAA. Technical evaluations will employ a peer or scientific review process. The complete BAA including proposal preparation instructions and evaluation criteria are attached.<br /><br />This BAA is issued under provisions of paragraph 6.102(d)(2) and paragraph 35.016 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) which provides for competitive selection of research and development proposals submitted in response to this announcement. Accordingly, proposals selected for award are considered to be the result of full and open competition and fully compliant with PL 98-369, The Competition in Contracting Act of 1984. <br /><br />Prospective Offerors should note that this BAA is an expression of interest only and does not commit the Government to make an award or pay proposal preparation costs generated in response to this announcement. No contract award will be made unless appropriated funds are available for payment for the effort being acquired. Potential Offerors are reminded that only a duly warranted contracting officer may obligate the government to an agreement involving the expenditure of Government funds.
<p>To be eligible for an award, potential offerors must submit annual Electronic Representations and Certifications and be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) Database. Contractors must have NAICS 541712 in their CCR.</p>

The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Office of Acquisition (OA) intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive sole source basis to Beckman Coulter, 200 South Kraemer Boulevard, M/S W513, Brea, California 92821 for the procurement of SPRIworks Fragment Library Kit I-50.

The sole source determination is based on the fact that National Institute of Health (NIH) is the nations medical research agency and the primary Federal agency conducting and supporting making medical discoveries that improve peoples health and save lives. The National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), NIH Intramural Sequencing Center (NISC) is a centralized research facility for performing high-throughput, large-scale DNA sequencing and sequencing analysis. The Beckman SPRIworks Fragment Library System would enable NISC to reduce the extensive manual labor required in library preparation for the Illumina Genome Analyzers so the personnel can focus on other preparation work.  This equipment has reduced cost in additional personnel, reduce errors from manual processing since the machine is fully automated and the reagents are pre-dispensed, and provide reproducible and consistent library output.

Beckman Coulters SPRIworks Fragment Library Kit I contains all reagents and plastic consumables for use in the Beckman Coulters SPRIworks Fragment Library System, a fully automated instrument for the preparation of library samples for the Illumina Genome Analyzer. The reagents are pre-dispensed in a disposable cartridge. Each cartridge contains all of the reagents required to prepare a single library. In addition to the necessary enzymes and buffers for the preparation of a library, the cartridge reagents include an optimized size selection capability based on SPRI chemistry. SPRI is an acronym for Solid Phase Reversible Immobilization and are covered under US Patents 5,705,628, 5,898,071 and 6,534,262. SPRI chemistry is a novel chemistry in which nucleic acids are immobilized around the surface of the particles by controlling environmental reaction conditions such as pH, salts concentration and hydophobicity and hydrophilicity. 

The SPRIworks Fragment Library System I uses the patented Agencourt SPRI paramagnetic particle-based technology to generate fragment libraries from fragmented or sheared input DNA. The SPRIworks Fragment Library System automated method is performed on the SPRI-TE Nucleic Acid Extractor, using pre-measured reagents in a sealed reagent cartridge, and enables the construction of three library types: no size selection; 200-400 bp size selection; and 300-600 bp size selection. 

Contractor Requirements:

  Library preparation must be completely processed in 4 hours. 
  Able to do at least 20 samples in one working day (8 hours).
  Reagents provided pre-made, pre-dispensed and ready-to-go which reduces/eliminates mistakes and contamination.
  All reagents and plasticware consumables must be contained in the kit.
  Starting material should be no more than 3-5 g.
  Library preparation must be performed using Beckman Coulters SPRIworks Fragment Library System.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<CONTACT>James Jaramillo, Contracting Officer Liaison, Phone 8015863941, Email james.jaramillo@hill.af.mil
<DESC>This announcement constitutes a sources sought synopsis for purposes of conducting market research. Market Research is being conducted to seek qualified contractors other than Moog Incorporated with the skills, knowledge, and resources required to complete this effort. The Government is seeking qualified contractors to support the fabrication and manufacture of sixteen (16) test fixtures. These test fixtures are a component of the Pitch Roll Channel Assembly (PRCA) and Line Repair Unit (LRU) supporting the F-15 war fighter.
<p>The Air Force is in the process of preparing documentation to gain the required approval to issue a sole source Justification &amp; Approval (J&amp;A) for proposal to Moog Incorporated which has supported the Air Force in this capacity in the past. Statutory authority is 10 U.S.C. 2304 (C) (1), Justification: Supplies (or Services) required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source(s) and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The proposed contract action is for supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one, or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. This sources sought synopsis is for information and budget planning only and does not constitute a solicitation, nor is it to be construed as a commitment by the Government.</p>
<p>Moog Incorporated, East Aurora, New York is the only known source that has the requisite expertise of executing required fabrication and manufacturing of these fixtures. Moog is the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) for the F-15 PRCA and owns the proprietary data and drawings used by the F-15 PRCA shop and the 309th Commodities Maintenance Group (CMXG) on Hill Air Force Base. The 309 CMXG is responsible for testing using the F-15 PRCA and Aileron Rudder Interconnect (ARI) testing. This workload is currently done through a General Purpose Test Console (GPC), Pitch Trim Test Console (PTC), and the Auxiliary Test Console (ATC) originally manufactured by Moog.</p>
<p>The PRCA is comprised of unique LRU's that by design are tested separately and must be capable of being removed and replaced without any adjustments or PRCA level testing. There are multiple physical dimensions that control the mechanical interface between the various LRU's. These dimensions typically have tolerances that are within ten-thousandths of an inch (0.0001). Errors on the interface dimensions for the test fixtures would result in various LRU's not being interchangeable on the PRCA and ARI. Some of these issues would result in BIT code failures on the aircraft. Failures are also possible that would not be detectable during BIT checks. It is not practical to reverse engineer these physical interfaces due to the fact that the tolerances are so precise. Add the fact that all fixtures are anywhere from 15 to 35 years old, worn on the critical mechanical interface surfaces, which would prevent any accurate and precise reverse engineering process. First Article testing is also impractical due to the time, process and cost to test each fixture. The following are the test fixtures:</p>

<DESC>This announcement constitutes a Sources Sought Synopsis/RFI for non-personal services. The Government is neither negotiating nor calling for offers at this time. No solicitation is being issued at this time; while a formal solicitation may be issued at a later date, this notice does not commit the government to ultimately award a contract. This announcement is an expression of interest only and does not commit the Government to pay for any response or preparation cost. The Government does not intend to make an award on the basis of this sources sought synopsis. Submission of information will be reproduced and submitted to the 519 SMXS/MXDEB program offices for review and will be used to develop the acquisition strategy and possibly a Request for Quotation.

<DESC>The USGS requests an airborne geophysical survey of Leach Basin, California on the Fort Irwin Army Base in the Northern Mojave Desert using time-domain electromagnetic (TEM) methods.    These data are intended for 1-D and 2-D numerical inversion to determine the 3-D extent of structural geologic features and aquifer zones within the study areas. These data will be used to create a geological framework to be input into a regional assessment of the Leach Basin area.  USGS requires a platform that is well suited for near-surface investigations and has the capability for recording TEM data.  The data shall be well calibrated and corrected for any system response and drift.  The depths of interest are on the order of several hundred meters. Leach Basin is part of an active training area at Fort Irwin.  Therefore, due to the training schedule at Fort Irwin, the area of interest shall be flown between December 11, 2010 and December 31, 2010.  The USGS is in search of small business firms who are able to perform the above mentioned services.  Small business firms who feel they can furnish the required services or its functional equivalent (based on criteria specified herein) are invited to submit in writing an affirmative response to this announcement.

<DESC>This synopsis is being provided for information purposes only.  NASA Goddard SpaceFlight Center (GSFC) proposes to increase the maximum value of the Mechanical SystemsEngineering Services II/A (MSES II/A) contract with Stinger Ghaffarian Technologies(SGT), Inc.  NASAs GSFC proposes an increase in the current maximum value of$520,000,000 of the MSES II/A contract by $230,000,000. The MSES II/A contract NNG07CA21C supports the NASA GSFC Applied Engineering & TechnologyDirectorate (AETD) and Mechanical Systems Division (MSD), and is a five year Cost PlusAward Fee (CPAF) contract with a period of performance from May 15, 2007, through May 14,2012.  The level of effort for the existing scope of work has increased, resulting in theprojected maximum value of the contract no longer being sufficient to sustain taskrequirements.  Based on the actual cost and the projected future cost, the totalestimated value of this contract will reach $750,000,000 by May 2012.  Hence, GSFCproposes to increase the maximum contract value by $230,000,000 to cover this anticipatedcost.The scope of work of the existing contract requires the contractor to provide on/off-siteMechanical Systems Engineering and related multidiscipline services, pursuant to taskorders issued by the Contracting Officer (CO). The engineering areas of emphasis aremultidisciplinary with concentration in the mechanical engineering areas of materials,structural analysis and loads, mechanical design, electromechanical design, thermal,contamination and coatings, and related services.  These services shall include thepersonnel, facilities, and materials (unless otherwise provided by the Government) toaccomplish the tasks.If GSFC attempts to procure these services from any other source for the remainder of theperiod of performance, it would cause unacceptable delays.  The combination of delay dueto the competitive process, the time required to transition a new management team tocoordinate staffing levels and schedules and to become familiar with work requirementsand systems would cause unacceptable delays in fulfilling NASA's mission.  The interimprocurement of these vital services from another source for this period would jeopardizethe critical milestone schedules for numerous ongoing projects that the MSES II/Acontract supports.  Also, because of the time involved in procuring and phasing inanother contractor, SGT is considered the only contractor that can meet NASA GSFCs needsgiven the term of the contract.  This document and any other related documents to thisprocurement will be available over the Internet.  These documents will reside on a WorldWide Web (WWW) server, which may be accessed using a WWW browser application.

<DESC>NATIONAL CLIMATIC DATA CENTER MISSION SUPPORT ACQUISITION<br />INDUSTRY DAY CANCELLATION NOTICE
<p>National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) and Acquisition and Grants Office (AGO) had intended to host an Industry Day on or about November 18, 2010 for an anticipated NCDC Mission Support acquisition. No official notices concerning a NCDC Industry had been issued. However, several companies that contacted NOAA were informed of NOAA's intention to hold an Industry Day on or about November 18, 2010.</p>
<p>NCDC Mission Support Industry Day is indefinitely cancelled.</p>
<p>NOAA has received a high level of interest for the NCDC Mission Support requirements. NOAA does not plan to re-compete the current Mission Support requirements with a follow-on single GSA Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA). The last date to place orders on the current Mission Support BPA (EA133E-06-BR-0019) is February 28, 2011 and the period of performance for orders may extend for one year past this final ordering date, allowing for performance of tasks through February 27, 2012.</p>
<p>The NCDC Mission Support requirements have been re-evaluated. NOAA anticipates sourcing NCDC Mission Support requirements through three separate NOAA strategic sourcing vehicles as follows: <br />1) NCDC Mission Support Information Technology requirements are anticipated to be sourced through NOAA Link multiple award contracts;<br />2) NCDC Mission Support Science and Technical Support requirements are anticipated to be sourced through the NOAA Scientific, Technical Support Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity multiple award contracts;<br />3) At this time, NOAA anticipates establishment of GSA FSS BPAs for NCDC Mission Support Advisory and Assistance services following the procedures at Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 8.405-3, 8.405-2, GSA Ordering Guidelines, and Schedule 874 Mission Oriented Business Integrated Services (MOBIS). The anticipated release for the Advisory and Assistance BPAs Request for Quotations is on or about January 12, 2011. This opportunity will be posted on GSA e-Buy.</p>

<p><br />52.209-5 Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) <br />(a)(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that- <br />(i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals- <br />(A) Are o are not o presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(B) Have o have not o, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks "have", the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); <br />(C) Are o are not o presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; <br />(D) Have o, have not o, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(2) Examples. <br />(i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect; 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect; 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect; 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(ii) The Offeror has o has not o, within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. <br />(2) "Principal," for the purposes of this certification, means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). <br />This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. <br />(b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <br />(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. <br />(d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. <br />(e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.

<p>52.209-5 CERTIFICATION REGARDING RESPONSIBILITY MATTERS. (APR 2010)<br />(a)(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that-(i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals-(A) Are &#10063; are not &#10063; presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have &#10063; have not &#10063;, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks "have", the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); (C) Are &#10063; are not &#10063; presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; (D) Have &#10063;, have not &#10063;, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. (2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect; 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect; 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect; 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has &#10063; has not &#10063;, within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) "Principal," for the purposes of this certification, means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions).This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious,or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. (c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. (End of provision)</p>
<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D.

<p>2. Past Performance: In accordance with FAR 52.212-1(b)(10) and the following, the offeror is required to identify past or current contracts for efforts similar to this requirement. Offerors shall provide the information shown below for at least three (3) and no more than five (5) contracts for the same or similar items.

Award price and final contract price (award plus growth), including the total number of growth work changes and scope of these changes. <br /><br />Past Performance will look at relevant experience, responsiveness, resources, quality and consistency of services, customer satisfaction, and management.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Price: The total price will be the evaluated price.<br /><br />Technical and past performance, when combined, are approximately equal to cost or price. <br />(a) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. <br />EVALUATION APPROACH</p>
<p>1. An evaluation plan has been established to evaluate the factors set forth below and all proposals shall be subject to evaluation by a team of Government personnel in accordance with the plan.</p>
<p>2. The Government will evaluate each proposal strictly in accordance with its content and will not assume that performance will include areas not specified in the offeror's written proposal. The Government reserves the right to contact other government and commercial sources to validate information submitted in a proposal and to assess capability, past performance and responsibility.</p>
<p>3. Proposals, which are unrealistic in terms of price, will be deemed reflective of an inherent lack of technical competence or indicative of a failure to comprehend the complexity and risks of the proposed contract. Such proposals may be rejected as unacceptable without further discussions. In addition, the Government reserves the right to eliminate from consideration those proposals so deficient in information as to require a major re-write or revision in order to become acceptable.</p>
<p>4. The technical evaluation factors and other factors other than price, when combined, are approximately equal to price. Price will not be a numerically weighted factor in the evaluation of proposals. If the two or more highest rated technical proposals are considered to be essentially equal in terms of technical competence, price may become the determinative factor in making an award.</p>
<p>5. The Government reserves the right to award a contract on the basis of evaluation of the original submission without discussions or call for Final Proposal Revisions. The contract will be awarded as a firm fixed price contract using simplified acquisition procedures.</p>

Governing Law  Federal law and regulations, including the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR), shall govern this Contract.  Commercial license agreements may be made a part of this Contract but only if both parties expressly make them an addendum.  If the commercial license agreement is not made an addendum, it shall not apply, govern, be a part of or have any effect whatsoever on the Contract; this includes, but is not limited to, any agreement embedded in the computer software (clickwrap) or any agreement that is otherwise delivered with or provided to the Government with the commercial computer software or documentation (shrinkwrap), or any other license agreement otherwise referred to in any document.  If a commercial license agreement is made an addendum, only those provisions addressing data rights regarding the Governments use, duplication and disclosure of data (e.g., restricted computer software) are included and made a part of this Contract, and only to the extent that those provisions are not duplicative or inconsistent with Federal law, Federal regulation, the incorporated FAR clauses and the provisions of this Contract, including Addendums A & B; those provisions in the commercial license agreement that do not address data rights regarding the Governments use, duplication and disclosure of data shall not be included or made a part of the Contract.  Federal law and regulation, including without limitation, the Contract Disputes Act (41 U.S.C. 601-613), the Anti-Deficiency Act (31 U.S.C. 1341 et seq.), the Competition in Contracting Act (10 U.S.C. 2304), the Prompt Payment Act (31 U.S.C. 3901, et seq.) and FAR clauses 52.212-4, 52.227-14, 52.227-19 shall supersede, control and render ineffective any inconsistent, conflicting or duplicative provision in any commercial license agreement.  In the event of conflict between this clause and any provision in the Contract or the commercial license agreement or elsewhere, the terms of this clause shall prevail.  Claims of patent or copyright infringement brought against the Government as a party shall be defended by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) (28 U.S.C.  516).  At the discretion of DOJ, the Contractor may be allowed reasonable participation in the defense of the litigation.  Any additional changes to the Contract must be made by contract modification (Standard Form 30).  Nothing in this Contract or any commercial license agreement shall be construed as a waiver of sovereign immunity.  

(ii) Indemnification.  The Contractor shall save and hold harmless and indemnify the Government against any and all liability claims, and cost of whatsoever kind and nature for injury to or death of any person or persons and for loss or damage to any Contractor property or property owned by a third party occurring in connection with or in any way incident to or arising out of the occupancy, use service, operation, or performance of work under the terms of the Contract and this Order, resulting in whole or in part from the acts or omissions of the Contractor, any subcontractor, or any employee, agent, or representative of the Contractor or subcontractor.  

(iii)  Governments Liability.  The Government shall not be liable for any injury to the Contractor's personnel or damage to the Contractor's property unless such injury or damage is due to negligence on the part of the Government and is recoverable under the Federal Torts Claims Act, or pursuant to other Federal statutory authority.

(e)	If the Government decides to outsource or contract its services, the Government may allow the outsourcer to use the licensed software solely to provide the services on its behalf.  The outsourcer shall be bound by the provisions of this Contract relating to the use of the software.
(f)	If the software is for use in a networked environment, as may be reflected by the number of servers or users described in the Contract, the license grant provided by the Contractor includes the Governments use of the software in such environment.
(g)	Any dispute regarding the license grant or usage limitations shall be resolved in accordance with the Disputes Clause incorporated in FAR 52.212-4(d).
(h)	If the Government purchases additional licenses, the terms and conditions for those additional licenses (including technical support and upgrades) shall be the same as agreed to in this Contract, unless negotiated otherwise by mutual agreement of the parties.
(i)	If for any reason the contractor is unable to complete performance under this Contract or, if following the completion of this Contract the contractor ceases to provide support for any software described in this Contract, the contractor agrees to provide to Government any proprietary software or documentation that is relevant to the work performed under this Contract.  This provision applies to any data that would be necessary for the maintenance and continued development of any automated information systems, including but not limited to, system source and object codes, supporting system software and all relevant documentation and source listings.  This data shall be provided to the Government at no additional price within thirty (30) calendar days following work stoppage.

(b)	Software technical support and upgrades are included at the agreed upon price.  However, if additional charges are assessed during the license period as a result of negotiated changes in the license (e.g., CPU upgrades), the license fee shall be by mutual agreement of the parties and any dispute thereof shall be resolved in accordance with the Disputes Clause incorporated herein at FAR 52.212-4(g).
(c)	If the Government desires to continue software license beyond the license period identified in this Contract, the Government will issue a separate order or contract to renew annual support and upgrade license.  Conversely, if an order or contract to renew software support and upgrade license is not received, no assumption by the Contractor shall be made that license has been renewed.
(d)	Unless otherwise agreed, for any new additional software that may be licensed, the Contractor shall provide for software license in the first year of the license at no additional price.
(e)	The Contractor shall provide software support services, which includes periodic updates, enhancements and corrections to the software, and reasonable technical support, all of which are customarily provided by the Contractor to its customers so as to cause the software to perform according to its specifications, documentation or demonstrated claims.

(vi)  Disaster Recovery Clause.  Government hereby certifies to Contractor that it has a bona fide disaster plan with respect to the computer software programs used in its operations.  The Contract and this Order authorizes the Government's operation to maintain a second copy of software on tape for use at loading at sites that are not live (e.g. license-based disaster recovery services) for the sole purpose of duplicating or mirroring the software environment of the "primary" licenses at the designated licensed site and as described herein.  Additionally, use of the software at the contingency sites must not include general access or any processing for program development or production.  Contractor shall permit operation and testing of all licensed programs at the contingency sites as designated by the Government without prior approval and at no additional price to the Government solely for the purpose of maintaining or implementing disaster recovery readiness including continuity of business operations.  CPUs, MIPS or MSUs at these contingency sites are excluded from the total CPUs, MIPS or MSUs count included elsewhere in the Contract and this Order and are not separately billable.  Activation of operations at a contingency site shall be at Government's discretion.  Government is authorized to install all software at the contingency sites for testing, problem resolution purposes, and to ensure there will be no operational delays in association with transition of workload from the designated licensed site to the contingency sites.  Use of the software at the contingency sites in the event of a disaster shall continue until such time as normal processing can be resumed at the "primary" site regardless of the duration required.  Nothing in the Contract or this Order diminishes the Government's rights in accordance with the data rights clause(s).  Any license keys, codes, or passwords required by the Contractor in order to use the software at the contingency sites shall be provided to the Government within 10 days of the Governments request.

(vii) Disabling Software Code.  The Government requires delivery of computer software that does not contain any code that will, upon the occurrence or the nonoccurrence of any event, disable the software.  Such code includes but is not limited to a computer virus, restrictive key, node lock, time-out or other function, whether implemented by electronic, mechanical, or other means, which limits or hinders the use or access to any computer software based on residency on a specific hardware configuration, frequency of duration of use, or other limiting criteria.  If any such code is present, the Contractor agrees to indemnify the Government for all damages suffered as a result of a disabling caused by such code, and the Contractor agrees to remove such code upon the Governments request at no extra price to the Government.  Inability of the Contractor to remove the disabling software code will be considered an inexcusable delay and a material breach of the contract, and the Government may exercise its right to terminate for cause.  In addition, the Government is permitted to remove the code as it deems appropriate and charge the Contractor for consideration for the time and effort in removing the code.

(viii) NOTICE OF THE FEDERAL ACCESSIBILITY LAW AFFECTING ALL ELECTRONIC AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PROCUREMENTS (SECTION 508) 
 
On August 7, 1998, Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 was amended to require that when Federal departments or agencies develop, procure, maintain, or use Electronic and Information Technology, that they shall ensure it allows Federal employees with disabilities to have access to and use of information and data that is comparable to the access to and use of information and data by other Federal employees.

The Contractor shall not be paid for any work performed or costs incurred which reasonably could have been avoided.
 
   (m) Termination for cause. The Government may terminate this contract, or any part hereof, for cause in the event of any default by the Contractor, or if the Contractor fails to comply with any contract terms and conditions, or fails to provide the Government, upon request, with adequate assurances of future performance. In the event of termination for cause, the Government shall not be liable to the Contractor for any amount for supplies or services not accepted, and the Contractor shall be liable to the Government for any and all rights and remedies provided by law. If it is determined that the Government improperly terminated this contract for default, such termination shall be deemed a termination for convenience.
 
   (n) Title. Unless specified elsewhere in this contract, title to items furnished under this contract shall pass to the Government upon acceptance, regardless of when or where the Government takes physical possession.
 
   (o) Warranty. The Contractor warrants and implies that the items delivered hereunder are merchantable and fit for use for the particular purpose described in this contract.

   (s) Order of precedence. Any inconsistencies in this solicitation or contract shall be resolved by giving precedence in the following order:

     (3) The clause at 52.212-5.
 
     (4) Addenda to this solicitation or contract, including any license agreements for computer software.

     (8) Other documents, exhibits, and attachments

   (t) Central Contractor Registration (CCR).
 
     (1) Unless exempted by an addendum to this contract, the Contractor is responsible during performance and through final payment of any contract for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.
 
     (2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.
 
       (ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.
 
     (3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor's CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.
 
     (4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423 or 269-961-5757.

(D&B has no affiliation with this 4- character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional CCR records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at Subpart 32.11) for the same concern.
 
   "Registered in the CCR database" means that--
 
     (1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, into the CCR database; and
 
     (2) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and has marked the record "Active". The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the CCR registration process.
 
   (b)(1) By submission of an offer, the offeror acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee shall be registered in the CCR database prior to award, during performance, and through final payment of any contract, basic agreement, basic ordering agreement, or blanket purchasing agreement resulting from this solicitation.
 
     (2) The offeror shall enter, in the block with its name and address on the cover page of its offer, the annotation "DUNS" or "DUNS +4" followed by the DUNS or DUNS +4 number that identifies the offeror's name and address exactly as stated in the offer. The DUNS number will be used by the Contracting Officer to verify that the offeror is registered in the CCR database.
 
   (c) If the offeror does not have a DUNS number, it should contact Dun and Bradstreet directly to obtain one.
 
     (1) An offeror may obtain a DUNS number--
 
       (i) Via the Internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform or if the offeror does not have internet access, it may call Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 if located within the United States; or
 
       (ii) If located outside the United States, by contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office. The offeror should indicate that it is an offeror for a U.S. Government contract when contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office.
 
     (2) The offeror should be prepared to provide the following information:
 
       (i) Company legal business.
 
       (ii) Tradestyle, doing business, or other name by which your entity is commonly recognized.
 
       (iii) Company Physical Street Address, City, State, and Zip Code.

       (vi) Date the company was started.
 
       (vii) Number of employees at your location.
 
       (viii) Chief executive officer/key manager.
 
       (ix) Line of business (industry).

   (f) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.

D. 3 STATEMENT OF COMMITMENT AND UNDERSTANDING FOR VA CONTRACTORS WHO POSSESS OR HANDLE VA SENSITIVE  INFORMATION OR PERSONAL DATA

As a contractor of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), I am committed to safeguarding the personal information that veterans and their families have entrusted to the Department. I am also committed to safeguarding the personal information which VA employees and applicants have provided. 

To ensure that I understand my obligations and responsibilities in handling the personal information of veterans and their families, I have completed both the annual General Privacy Awareness Training (or VHA Privacy Training, as applicable) and the annual VA Cyber Security Training.

I know that I should contact the Contracting Officer whom will then get in touch with the Information Security Officer or Regional or General Counsel, when I am unsure whether or how I may gather or create, maintain, use, disclose or dispose of information about veterans and their families, and VA employees and applicants. 

I further understand that if I fail to comply with applicable confidentiality statutes and regulations, I may be subject to civil and criminal penalties, including fines and imprisonment. I also recognize that VA may impose sanctions, up to and including termination of contract for violation of applicable confidentiality and security statutes, regulations and policies. 

I certify that I have completed the training outlined above and am committed to safeguarding personal information about veterans and their families, and VA employees and applicants.

<p align="left">medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be</p>
<p align="left">an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written</p>
<p align="left">evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p align="left">(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the</p>
<p align="left">contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a</p>
<p align="left">medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS</p>
<p align="left">3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure</p>
<p align="left">admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.</p>
<p align="left">In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by</p>
<p align="left">USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID</p>
<p align="left">directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract,</p>
<p align="left">any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available</p>
<p align="left">debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p align="left">(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for</p>
<p align="left">Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either</p>
<p align="left">by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses</p>
<p align="left">USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the</p>
<p align="left">repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and</p>
<p align="left">procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses,</p>
<p align="left">including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or</p>
<p align="left">an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his</p>
<p align="left">or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual</p>
<p align="left">receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that</p>
<p align="left">USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting</p>
<p align="left">Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by</p>
<p align="left">insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses</p>
<p align="left">and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p align="left">(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments</p>
<p align="left">or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate</p>
<p align="left">action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the</p>
<p align="left">USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p align="left">(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical</p>
<p align="left">expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to</p>
<p align="left">the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance</p>
<p align="left">carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the</p>
<p align="left">insurance carrier(s).</p>

<DESC><p><strong>THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS CANCELLED IN ITS ENTIRETY.<br /></strong><br /><br />The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) intends to award on a sole source basis a contract to Carter2 Systems, Inc., of Beaverton, Oregon for one hundred sixteen (116) non-human primate cages. JKT Development, Inc., is hereby granted authority to act on behalf of CDC for purchase of caging. The authority for this sole source procurement is FAR Part 6.302-1 in that Carter2 Systems, Inc., is the only known source with the knowledge required to provide these services/supplies. A few of the characteristics for the caging is as follows: Caging must be stainless steel; one-over-one compartment socialization caging that can be attached to other one-over-one units to allow primates to be housed in social groups. Small enough grating and other openings to allow the housing of smaller New World Primates without the risk of escape. Socialization panels are self storing with the ability to be locked. Caging has two feed openings, one for a feed box and the other for forage board attachment that comes with this caging unit. Excreta pans can be flush pans, tilt metabolism pans, or pull pans for a wet system. Excreta pans can be easily removable to allow vertical socialization. Caging is legally compliant with both USA and European standards. This is not a request for competitive proposals. This is an all or none requirement. This is not a set-aside. A written solicitation will not be issued. Questions/Inquiries may be sent to Ms. Philippa Butts by facsimile transmission at 770-488-2847 or by email at PButts@cdc.gov.</p>

<DESC>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; National Geospatial Intelligence Agency<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; REQUEST FOR INFORMATION
<p>1. Introduction<br />In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.215-3 Request For Information, The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) for the Human Development Management (HDM), is issuing this Request For Information (RFI) as part of market research, to forge a partnership with industry to provide a comprehensive approach to improve the end-to-end processes involved with managing people resources in the organization. <br />This RFI shall not be construed as a formal solicitation or an obligation on part of NGA to acquire any product or services. Submission of any information in response to this RFI is completely voluntary and any cost associated with submission shall not be reimbursed by the Government. The information requested will be used by NGA to facilitate decision making.</p>
<p>2. Background<br />The NGA Human Development (HD) Directorate was formed in January 2004 with the merger of NGA's Human Resources (HR) and Training and Doctrine (TD) Directorates. This allowed HD to align and integrate its efforts to meet the NGA's Director's Goal to attract, develop and retain a world-class Geospatial-Intelligence (GEOINT) workforce. HD Senior Leadership recognizes the need to align and integrate various services that the new directorate provided. This, would, in turn, allow improved service delivery by introducing more coordinated and efficient business practices, offering more consistent service levels, standardizing processes across the directorate and integrating "people" data. Service integration will also result in resource savings across the board, and assist HD in managing contract services. Currently, HD service functions are provided by the Human Capital Management Contract (HCM).<br />NGA is looking to improve process improvements already in place and working towards integration and optimization through Technology Insertion and Business Process Reengineering for each of the major functional areas: Human Development Management Program Support, Strategic Workforce Planning, Emergency Family Assistance Center (EFAC), Recruitment Services, Personnel Data, Benefits and Retirement Services and Office of Diversity Management and Equal Employment Opportunity. <br />Note: the contractor personnel performing this work at NGA sites must have TS/SCI security clearances and their company must have a TS/SCI facility clearance as per Defense Security Services (DSS) at time of contract award<br />Based on the information received from this RFI, NGA will build a Request for Proposal. At this time NGA is envisioning a single award firm fixed price contract.</p>
<p>3. Responding to this RFI<br />NGA requests that you provide the following information:<br />a. A response no longer than 5 double-sided pages exclusive of existing marketing materials. Only electronic submissions will be accepted. A submission may not be larger than 3MB; if any responsive document is larger than 3 MB, you may send it in more than one submission. Response must contain only UNCLASSIFIED information and be MARKED "UNCLASSIFIED" at least on the first page of the response. No Classified information may be included anywhere in the response. In addition to the response to the RFI (which is a maximum of 5 double-sided pages), you also should provide a 1-2 page response to this acquisition strategy detailing what you see as the strengths and weaknesses of this approach. This information will be used by the government program manager to refine the approach for the final request for proposal.<br />b. Business type (i.e. Woman Owned Small Business, Veteran Owned etc.) and if you will be proposing as prime or subcontractor.<br />c. NAICS code and other suggested NAICS codes<br />d. Proposal interest (would you bid on this requirement?)<br />e. Information that demonstrates you having sufficient staff available to meet these requirements.<br />f. Vendors who provide these services should respond even if they do not provide all the services. If they are unable to provide a particular listed service area, they should describe their niche area.<br />g. Include information that you're aware of FAR Clause 52.219-14, Limitations of Subcontracting.</p>
<p>4. Questions and Comments<br />Respondents may submit questions or comments concerning this RFI, to the World Wide Web site of the Acquisition Research Center (ARC) at https://arc.westfields.net . New users of the ARC must first register (using the "Create New Account" button on the Web page) and obtain a user identifier and password to use for login at the site. Once registered and logged in at the ARC, a user can click and select the "Human Development Management Support" ARC webpage under "Current Efforts".<br />Respondents may submit questions concerning the RFI using the blank website question/answer feature. The Government will entertain questions on a case-by-case basis. Respondents should be advised that all questions submitted to the ARC will be posted for all respondents to view, although the identity of the requesting organization will be withheld.</p>
<p>Questions and comments regarding this RFI will be accepted via only the ARC Web site. Respondents should not directly contact any NGA personnel noted in this RFI. All questions must be submitted by 22 October 2010, 12:00 noon EST. Submissions are due no later than 29 October 29, 2010, 2:00 p.m., EST. Submissions should be sent to Kebra Henderson at kebra.l.henderson@nga.mil and Cassandra Michael at cassandra.l.michael@nga.mil , Lora Mackin at lora.l.mackin@nga.mil</p>

Your DUNS number and MPIN act as your company's ID and password into ORCA. The basic information provided in your CCR record is used to pre-populate a number of fields in ORCA. Once in ORCA you will be asked to review pertinent information pre-populated from CCR, provide a point of contact, and answer a questionnaire that contains up to 26 questions. The questionnaire is to help you gather information that you need for your clauses. The questionnaire is not the official version. Be sure to read the provisions carefully. The answers you provide are then automatically entered into the actual FAR provisions. You are required to review your information, as inserted, in context of the full-text provisions for accuracy; acknowledge three additional read-only provisions; and click a time/date stamp before final submission. You will need to review and/or update your ORCA record when necessary, but at least annually in order to maintain active status.</p>
<p>Any information taken from other publications is used at the sole risk of the offeror. The procuring office cannot guarantee the accuracy of information contained in other publications.</p>
<p>All questions must be submitted in writing to the attention of Mr. Jay Oxenberg either by email: jay.oxenberg@gsa.gov or by fax: 215-873-8428.</p>

<DESC>CMS determined that a cost-reimbursement type contract is most appropriate for this procurement because in addition to conducting general requirements in accordance with the MIDS contract the Contractor shall conduct an ad hoc analysis for which the actual measures are not yet known. The Contractor must develop these measures using clinical data collected by registries and anticipate the use of data elements derived from the Electronic Health Records (EHRs) systems that will be employed by hospitals in the future. The use of existing clinical databases from registries presents a risk to the Contractor because which databases will be used is not known and the databases may not allow tracking using a common identifier. This may require the Contractor to match the patients in a registry with those in the Medicare database and change CMS' desired outcome of developing measures that can be applied to all-payor populations, not just the Medicare population. The contractor must also develop the measures as consistent as applicable with those already developed by CMS. This will require an unknown amount of coordination with CMS contactors responsible for other readmission measures. The Contractor must also submit the measures to the National Quality Forum (NQF) for endorsement and provide technical support during the process. Additional analyses to revise the measure methodology as requested by the NQF may be required. The fact that the clinical data and data elements are not well defined and that it is not possible for the Contractor to accurately define the amount of time it will spend during development, coordinating effort and participating in the endorsement process with NQF increases the Contractor's risk substantially making it unreasonable to expect the Contractor to provide a fair and reasonable firm-fixed price. Thus, it is in the best interest of the Government to award this Task Order as cost plus fixed fee (CPFF).

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL<br />FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION
<p>1. Contracting Agency:</p>
<p>Defense Security Cooperation Agency<br />201 12th Street, Ste 402 West Tower<br />Arlington, VA 22202-5408<br />2. Contracting Activity and Description of Action: The American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) is a non-profit, private corporation, established shortly after the United States Government (USG) changed its diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing on January 1, 1979. The Taiwan Relations Act (PL 96-8), April 10, 1979, authorized the continuation of "commercial, cultural and other relations between the people of the United States and the people of Taiwan." It also provided that "any programs, transactions, or other relations conducted or carried out by the President or any Agency of the USG with respect to Taiwan shall, in the manner and to the extent directed by the President, be conducted and carried out by or through the American Institute in Taiwan." The Department of State, through a contract with the Institute, provides a large part of AIT's funding and guidance in its operations. Other USG agencies (such as DSCA) are required to have separate contracts with AIT to conduct official business in Taiwan. <br />3. Description of Supplies/Services: As stated above, the Taiwan Relations Act (TRA) of 1979 authorizes AIT, a private non-profit corporation, to carry out commercial, cultural, and other relations with Taiwan on an official basis on behalf of the USG. As a result, DSCA (and all other applicable USG agencies) shall contract with AIT to accomplish its core mission in Taiwan: to manage the US Security Assistance/Security Cooperation (SA/SC) programs, whose principal purposes are: (1) to relate friendly and allied defense capabilities to those of the US in a total force concept to meet and counter worldwide and regional security threats; (2) to reduce the reliance of those countries on the US military manpower and material resources by increasing their defense capabilities; and (3) to influence friendly and allied nations to pursue foreign policies and military strategies compatible with the national interests and security of the US. The work under this contract will be performed in Taiwan and Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>4. Authority Cited: The authority for Other than Full and Open Competition are:</p>
<p>a. Public Law 96-8, 96th Congress (The Taiwan Relations Act), " Whenever the President or any agency of the USG is authorized or required by or pursuant to the laws of the U.S. to enter into, perform, enforce, or have in force an agreement or transaction relative to Taiwan, such an agreement or transaction shall be entered into, performed, and enforced, in the manner and to the extent directed by the President, by or through the Institute."<br />b. 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(5) "subject to subsection (k), a statute expressly authorizes or requires that the procurement be made through another agency or from a specified source, or the agency's need is for a brand-name commercial item for authorized resale."</p>
<p>c. FAR 6.302-5 Authorized or Required by Statute. "Full and open competition need not be provided for when (i) A statute expressly authorizes or requires that the acquisition be made through another agency or from a specified source"</p>
<p>5. Reasons for Authority Cited: The TRA mandates that DSCA contract with AIT.</p>
<p>6. Efforts to Obtain Competition: Because of the TRA, there has been no effort to obtain competition since our initial contract with AIT (1 Dec 98). AIT is the only organization that is authorized to conduct official USG business in Taiwan.</p>
<p>7. Actions to Increase Competition: Due to the TRA, the current strategy is to solicit this requirement non-competitively to AIT and make a sole source award no later than<br />1 October 2010.</p>
<p>8. Market Survey: A market survey was not conducted due to the requirement to contract solely with AIT. No benefit is derived from conducting a market survey.</p>
<p>9. Interested Sources: N/A</p>
<p>10. Other Facts: Unless there is a change in the law, there will be no change in contractors. All previous contracts with AIT were awarded sole source: 11th Contracting Squadron, Bolling AFB, for the period 1 Dec 98-30 Nov 03; GSA Federal Technology Service, for the period 1 Dec 03-30 Sep 05; and Contracting Office, DSCA, for the period 1 Oct 05-30 Sep 10.</p>

While this synopsis serves as a pre-solicitation notice of the sole source acquisitions for spare and repair parts from the OEMs listed in Attachment (A), it is not intended to preclude the Government from acquiring spare and repair parts through the training system design/build contractor, as this strategy may serve the Government's best interest. Pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulations 6.302, the proposed contract actions are for supplies for which the Government intends to solicit and only negotiate with Attachment (A) sources. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however, interested parties not identified within Attachment (A) are encouraged to express their interest and capability to respond to the requirements. Responses to this Sources Sought notice shall be received no later than fifteen (15) days from the posting date. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether respondents should be added to Attachment (A). In those situations where the Government determines that identical parts are available from more than one source, it will compete these acquisitions among the identified sources. A determination by the Government not to compete these proposed contract actions based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<STAUTH>FAR 6.302-1
<AWDNBR>A003-113402
<DESC>JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL FOR <br />OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION
<p>1. I recommend that the Department of State use other than full and open competition for the acquisition of 8 Bureau Diplomatic Security (DS) Approved Forced Entry/Ballistic Resistant (FEBR) Housing Containers for use at various locations in Southern Sudan. The estimated cost for fabrication, transportation, installation and furnishing the basic Housing Containers and an optional two (2) Housing Containers plus one (1) Non FEBR Kitchen Unit.</p>
<p>2. Nature and/or description of the action being approved.<br />The U.S. Government (USG) is currently undertaking the Diplomatic Expansion Phase II in South Sudan. This project has USG personnel spending significant amount of time overnight in areas where the USG currently has no presence. Due to insufficient availability of Diplomatic Security (DS) approved accommodations in these locations, the housing demand will need to be met by procuring our own Housing containers. Diplomatic Security requires that these housing containers meet 15 minute FEBR standards.</p>
<p>3. A description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs.<br />The Housing containers must be approved by the Bureau of Diplomatic Security and meet 15-minute FEBR standards. The Housing containers are urgently needed at various locations in Southern Sudan to house USG personnel overnight in areas that the USG has no presence. The containers need to be fabricated, shipped and installed within a very short timeframe. To accomplish this objective of getting the Housing containers up and functioning in an expedited manner, S/CRS requires the contractor to provide services for the quick fabrication, shipment and installation of the containers in the designated areas within Southern Sudan. Southern Sudan in one of the most logistically challenging places in the world.</p>
<p>4. An identification of the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition. 41 USC 253 (c)(1), FAR 6.301-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.</p>
<p>5. A demonstration that the proposed contractor's unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited. <br />Hunter Buildings International LLC is a well-established industry leader in the supply of blast resistant and DOS Certified FEBR modular buildings and worldwide. They can provide turnkey solutions from engineering/design to complete the project on site. Their capacity of blast resistant and FEBR modules is in the hundreds per month. Below are special services that Hunter Building International</p>
<p>&bull; Hunter Buildings International LLC can provide housing containers that have been approved by DS.</p>
<p>&bull; Hunter International has previous experience providing containers in South Sudan, as well relationships with support companies on the ground and provides a unique turnkey solution.</p>
<p>&bull; Hunter Buildings International LLC can produce the needed containers is one week and immediately ship them to Sudan. Hunter Buildings International LLC is a US company that will manufacture the containers in Turkey, significantly reducing shipping time.</p>
<p>6. A description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable. The description should include whether an FedBizOps notice was or will be publicized, as required by FAR 5.2, and if not, which exception under FAR 5.202 applies (e.g., blanket waiver provided in DOSAR 605.202-70).<br />The justification for other than full and open competition will be posted in FedBiz Ops for only one responsible source for the services, which will satisfy the State Department's unique requirements.</p>
<p>7. A determination by the Contracting Officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable. <br />The proposed FEBR 15-minute container falls with the price range of Hunter's 4th Quarter 2010 Retail Price List.</p>
<p>8. A description of the market survey conducted and the results or a statement of the reasons a market survey was not conducted.<br />For budgetary purposes, S/CRS/CRO sent the SOW to three (3) sources from the DS Approved Containers List. Only one (1) responded, Hunter Building International, with a technical and price proposal that were determined to be acceptable.</p>
<p>9. Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition. <br />None</p>
<p>10. A listing of sources, if any that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition. <br />Of the three (3) sources solicited, only one had expressed an interest.</p>
<p>11. A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required. <br />The Department of State will continue to make every effort to compete actions of a similar nature.</p>

<ARCHDATE>11282010
<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Mobile District (CESAM) intends to award a modification to Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contract W91278-09-D-0001 extending the contracts ordering period consistent with this announcement. This contract was awarded on 15 Oct 08 to RCG-Quality Enterprises USA, Joint Venture as a competitive Small Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) Set-Aside. The contract provides for Rental of Construction Equipment with Operators for Storm Damage Reduction Projects along Coastal Mississippi in support of CESAMs Mississippi Coastal Improvements Program Interim Projects (MsCIP). The target projects intended for execution under this program thru this contract met significant delays due to the Governments inability to obtain all required property easements and permits. Also, other ongoing Federal projects have affected the availability of specialized equipment (such as large coastal hydraulic dredges) required for execution of the projects. Further, the occurrence of the Deepwater Horizon Incident in April 2010 resulted in delays of task order awards in order to ensure worker safety and environmental integrity of the project sites.
