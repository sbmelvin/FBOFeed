<CONTACT>Michael W. Hargrove Contract Specialist 7037871367     Michael.Hargrove@mms.gov;
<DESC>PLEASE READ THIS ENTIRE NOTICE CAREFULLY.  Pursuant to this Broad Agency Announcement (FAR 35.016), the U.S. Department of the Interior, Minerals Management Service, seeks White Papers for Research Projects in Support of the Environmental Studies Program (ESP).  Description: This announcement is to solicit White Papers, concerning the northern continental shelf, shelf edge, and continental slope as related to the Gulf of Mexico, of not more than ten (10) pages in length, inclusive of curriculum vitae, addressing analysis of existing oceanographic databases resulting mainly from MMS sponsored research in the Gulf of Mexico.  However, databases from other sources that need to be included will be considered.  MMS will also consider analysis of results from large runs of numerical models in the Gulf of Mexico.  The analysis shall focus on any process or variable(s) (physical, biological, chemical, and geological) that can be addressed by information contained in the existing databases.  This solicitation will not sponsor collection of new data. The proposed work must   go beyond the analyses completed and presented in MMS reports.  Thus, the focus of this solicitation is for in-depth analysis of existing data aimed at extracting advance knowledge.  However, if basic analyses are proposed, these must not have been conducted previously and should be used to validate existing results and to further knowledge.  The end product of this effort shall be a completed scientific manuscript submitted to a respected peer-reviewed journal and MMS.  BACKGROUND:  The MMS has invested millions of dollars to conduct field studies for collecting information that yield extensive and high quality datasets, e.g., LATEX, De Soto Canyon study, SCULP, Chemical Oceanography and Hydrography, Deepwater Reanalysis and Synthesis. These databases were examined according to the objectives specified by the studies, however, time and resources prevented further analyses. We believe these datasets are rich in information on processes occurring in the Gulf of Mexico, which should be analyzed to obtain further insights for advancing knowledge. Some reanalysis has been completed through the Coastal Marine Institute, e.g. Current and Wiseman (2000), but the full potential has not been realized.  HOW TO RESPOND:  ONLY WHITE PAPERS ARE BEING REQUESTED;  DO NOT SUBMIT TECHNICAL OR BUSINESS PROPOSALS AT THIS TIME. This announcement is effective until 07 July 2004 (or 45 days after date of publication) and White Papers may be submitted any time until then.  Submit White Papers of not more than ten (10) pages to: U.S. Department of the Interior, Minerals Management Service, Attn:  Michael W. Hargrove, 381 Elden Street, Mail Stop 2510, Herndon VA  20170-4817, E-mail address Michael.Hargrove@mms.gov, or via Facsimile, 703-787-1041.  The MMS anticipates a $600,000 total budget for these projects and duration of one-two (1-2) years for  each project.  Offerors should bear this in mind when responding to this request for white papers.  Note that cost estimates are not to be included in the papers.  Projects will be selected for funding from all or part of the research topics, depending on the scope of white papers received.  White papers must reference the solicitation number and topic to be considered.  An original and five (5) copies should be submitted to the address provided above.  White papers should define the proposed research effort to include the level of effort without cost.  The MMS will evaluate the responses, and those deemed to have merit will be furnished information to assist in the preparation of a complete proposal.  This synopsis constitutes a Request for Proposals (RFP) but does not constitute commitment by the Government to award, nor does it restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach.  HOW WHITE PAPERS WILL BE EVALUATED:  Responses will be evaluated on the following criteria, listed in order of importance:  (1) the technical merits and originality of the proposed work; (2) the offeror?s experience, and technical expertise demonstrated by a relevant peer reviewed publications; (3) the feasibility of the work and approach proposed; (4) the availability of qualified supporting personnel with the requisite expertise and experience to accomplish the proposed research; and (5) the offeror?s ability to implement the proposed approach as demonstrated by adequate detailed analysis and supported by specific accomplishments.  RESPONDENTS WILL BE NOTIFIED AS TO WHETHER OR NOT A FULL TECHNICAL AND BUSINESS PROPOSAL IS REQUESTED.  DETAILS OF WHITE PAPER EVALUATIONS WILL NOT BE MADE AVAILABLE TO ANY RESPONDENT.  TELEPHONE INQUIRIES WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED.  A separate White Paper shall be submitted for each topic the offeror wishes to propose.  The White Papers shall identify clearly the offeror?s organization, point of contact, and phone numbers as well as addresses.  QUESTIONS SHALL BE IN WRITING OR VIA E-MAIL, REFERENCE RFP NO. 34601, AND BE DIRECTED TO MICHAEL W.

<ARCHDATE>05192005
<CONTACT>Susan Benik Contract Specialist 7037871350     Susan.Benik@mms.gov;
<DESC>This announcement solicits White Papers, of not more than five (5) pages in length, for specific areas of interest to the Minerals Management Service (MMS) Technology Assessment and Research (TA&R) Program, Operational Safety and Engineering Research (OSER). The MMS web site has descriptions of OSER activities, the scope of MMS interests, and past projects.  The web site address is http://www.mms.gov/tarp/safety.htm.  We encourage interested parties to view the information presented on the site when considering submitting White Papers.  BACKGROUND:  Research sponsored by MMS through the TA&R Program is used to acquire basic engineering information needed to oversee the orderly development of  offshore oil and gas operations.  New challenges and informational needs arise as companies use new equipment or procedures based on technological changes or as operations expand into new or different environments such as the deep water areas of the Gulf of Mexico (GOM). The principal objective of this request for White Papers is to address innovative or technological advancements among several general topics of current interest to MMS. As a result of the White Papers submitted in accordance with the terms of this announcement, selected proposals shall be requested. Projects selected for eventual funding by MMS shall receive funding from FY 2004 funds. The MMS anticipates a total of $500,000 to $900,000 may be available for the initiation of new research proposals addressing OSER topics in FY 2005 with projects being identified through this announcement and additional avenues. Typical projects envisioned to address the topics set forth below may require one quarter to one man-year effort and prospective offerors shall bear this in mind when responding to this request.  NOTICE: MMS may share the white papers with other organizations for review.  Potential contractors should let MMS know if they do not want the Papers/proposals shared. OBJECTIVES: The proposed objectives for the FY 2005 OSER activities include (but are not limited to) research related to the following:  1. Technology assessment of available subsea micro-hydrocyclone oil-water separation concepts, for oil-water ratios larger than 10, and the possible miniaturization for deep-sea in-well water re-injection.  A Joint Industrial Project (JIP) is preferred.  2. Technology assessment of Vortex Induced Vibration (VIV) reduction by Boundary Layer Conditions (BLC) for SPAR platforms.  The emphasis is on VIV by applied BLC, using depth conforming hydrodynamic solutions.  3. Study of noise reduction around platforms and gravel islands will focus on the impact of drilling/ production noise on marine mammals living around these objects including a list of technological solutions.  4. Risk analysis of surface vs. subsurface BOPs on MODUs focusing on riser failures and the use of subsea shear rams.  5. Technical assessment of the accuracy of liquid level sensors (LSHL) installed on TLPs, and SPARs impacted by waves, with the emphasis on comments to either improve or replace the MMS required  fluid level measurements 20 seconds apart.  This method could result in false readings.  6. Alternatives to pipeline hydrostatic testing after initial construction (commissioning).  7. Reliability and applicability of composite materials for pipeline repairs, including recommended qualification and techniques for installation personnel.  8. Certification and commissioning procedures for re-use of flexible pipe and umbilicals.  9. Design, technical feasibility/challenges, risk and availability of Subsea High Integrity Pressure Protection Systems (HIPPS).       	 ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:  The MMS is interested in research initiatives relative to safety and pollution practices related to Offshore operations. As a result of the White Papers, selected proposals will be sought and evaluated for funding. Efforts to be considered should be to the above stated issues and/or other related issues to the Offshore operations. Multi-year funding of project is acceptable.   HOW TO RESPOND:   White Papers of not more than five (5) pages in length, an ORGINAL PLUS three (3) copies and one (1) electronic copy in .PDF format, on a CD shall be submitted to the U.S. Department of Interior,  Minerals Management Service, 381 Elden St., Herndon, VA 20170-4817, not later than June 21, 2004 at 04:00 PM, EDT.

<DESC>The Bureau of Reclamation intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Roundtable Associates,2212 Queen Ave N  #265, Seattle WA 98901. The proposed action is for the  re-establishment of Roundtable Associates as the facilitator of the Conservation Advisory Group  (CAG) actions. The purpose of the CAG is to provide technical advice and counsel to Reclamation and the State of Washington on the structure, implementation and oversight of the Yakima River Basin Water Conservation Program authorize under Title XII of Public Law 103-434. Tasks include: Conduct group orientation sessions, facilitate CAG  meetings and sub-committee meetings, develop meeting agendas and mediation agreements, take and prepare meeting notes, provide project management support through the utilization of automated project management tools and techniques, etc.  The proposed contractor's unique qualifications include:Roundtable Associates have been the facilitators for CAG since its'  inception in October 1996 and have gained the knowledge of the mission and have gained the trust of  the Group members.  Many CAG responsibilities have been started and are pending completion.  This service has been  deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of a follow-on contract for the continued development of the CAG program, it is likely that an award to any other source would result in a substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition and  unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements. Because of the nature of the services required to complete tasks already underway, it is imperative to continue with the same facilitator.  It would delay task completion progress significantly for a new facilitator to gain the acceptance of the CAG members and learn the CAG member discussion positions of the past. The government believes that only one responsible source can provide the services listed above that will satisfy the agency needs. Any firm or individual that believes it can furnish the items described are encouraged to give written notification to the Contracting Officer.  Supporting evidence must be furnished, in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to comply with the above requirements. All responses received by close of business May 24, 2004  will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Inquiries will be accepted by Fax at (509) 454-5615, Attention: Connie Morgan or by electronic mail at cmorgan@pn.usbr.gov.

Division resources total approximately $18 million with 31 full-time employees and eight contract employees. The DIDOP serves as a leader for building state programs for injury prevention and control, surveillance of injuries, identifying ways to prevent injuries in acute care settings and preparing for and responding to mass trauma events.  The Division plans and conducts epidemiologic studies to identify ways to reduce injury, improve health outcomes (disabilities of people who get injured, and help injured people get medical care immediately after the injury (acute care) and during the rehabilitation period.  Since 2001, DIDOP has added new programs and staff, has reorganized its structure, and is under new Division leadership. Given the current environment with CDC's Future’s Initiative and new government performance initiatives including PART (Program Assessment Rating Tool), the Division management team has recognized the need to revisit the outcomes of the 2001 strategic plan and to revise a strategy for the future. In particular, questions remain about how to improve cross-branch communication and collaboration, especially in the development of new program areas with complex political and public health implications that cross branch operational boundaries and responsibilities. DIDOP is committed to a quality process but also places great value on a process that can be conducted and concluded swiftly, with maximum staff input but minimal disruption to the Division’s ability to accomplish its work while the process is underway.  The Division will use the strategic planning process to determine additional priorities of the Division.  Should a firm outside of the immediate Atlanta, Georgia area be identified for this project, all travel must be of the most economic means and must be pre-approved by the technical monitor for this project.  The solicitation with statement of work will be available within 48 hours of this notice.  Please note that firms wishing to bid on this solidification are hereby advised of the following; all vendors who wish to bid on this requirement MUST be registered and validated in the CCR prior to award of this Simplified Acquisition.

<CONTACT>Harley Seybold Purchasing Agent 6054335252     Harley_Seybold@nps.gov;
<DESC>Badlands National Park plans to purchase Radio Transmitter collars from Advanced Telemetry Systems, Inc. on a non competive basis. We are selecting Advanced Telemetry Systems, Inc. (ATS) based on experience, past performance, and price. Experience ATS has been producing radio telemetry equipment since 1981.  They manufacture a wide variety of telemetry equipment used by researchers around the world for a wide range of wildlife species.  From our investigation, we have found ATS to have a solid reputation for quality equipment among our peers in the wildlife profession.  Their long experience in working with biologists to adapt their equipment to specific needs, and the fact that they have wildlife biologists on staff to work with their clients, has created a reputation for providing equipment to meet specific project needs. Past Performance We have used ATS radio collars on black-footed ferrets since 1994.  One of our cooperators (Dr. Marsha Sovada, USGS) has utilized ATS equipment for swift fox study projects from 1993 to 1996 in Kansas.  Another cooperator (Dr. Jon Jenks, SDSU) has also had positive experiences with ATS on coyote, deer, and elk studies.  In our evaluation of telemetry equipment for this project, all the professionals we spoke with who have had experience with ATS expressed satisfaction with their products.  We have found the collars to be reliable, of sturdy construction, and adaptable to meet our needs (ATS modified design based on recommendations). Furthermore, utilizing consistent equipment is ideal for wildlife studies conducted over several years. Price Our research into telemetry equipment for the swift fox restoration project has shown that ATS products costs are quite competitive with other manufacturers of similar telemetry equipment.  When we have solicited bids for telemetry equipment in the past, ATS has often been the low bidder.  This was the case with the original purchase of radio collars for the swift fox project, where ATS was the lowest of three bidders. Award will be made O/A June 18, 2004. Contact person for this solicitation will be Harley Seybold, phone no. 605/433-5252. e-mail:harley_seybold@nps.gov.    2004 Quantity                     	Type			Price		Total 46			M1830 swift fox collar	$ 162.00		$ 7,452 11			refurbish M1830 collar	$   90.00		$    990 										$ 8,442 2005 30			M1830 swift fox collars	$ 171.00		$ 5,130 30			refurbish M1830 collars	$   90.00		$ 2,700 										$ 7,830 2006 30			M1830 swift fox collars	$ 171.00		$ 5,130 30			refurbish M1830 collars	$   90.00		$ 2,700 										$ 7,830 2007 30			M1830 swift fox collars	$ 171.00		$ 5,130 30			refurbish M1830 collars	$   90.00		$ 2,700										                                                                $ 7,830 2008 30			M1830 swift fox collars	$ 171.00		$ 5,130 30			refurbish M1830 collars	$   90.00		$ 2,700 										$ 7,830 Grand total (estimated)							$39,762.00 Telemetry Monitoring System for Swift Foxes 2004-2008 Furnish 46 VHF beacon transmitters suitable for use on swift foxes in 2004.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Time and Frequency Division proposes to negotiate on a sole source basis with Koheras A/S, Blokken 84, 3460 Birkrod, Denmark for two Boostik Y10 Fiber Laser Systems.  Each fiber laser plus amplifier system is a distributed feedback (DFB) ytterbium-doped fiber that delivers narrow linewidth radiation to amplifier systems which retain linewidth characteristics (less than 50 kHz) and produce 1 Watt at 1111.6 nm and 1156.84 nm, respectively.  ****  NIST is building an apparatus capable of measuring the frequency of  two very narrow optical transitions at 555.8 nm and 578.42 nm.    The natural linewidths of these transitions are approximately 180 kHz and 10 mHz, respectively.   Therefore, a single-frequency laser light with a very narrow linewidth on the timescale of our measurement (hundreds of ms) must be used in order to have a reasonable resolution to probe such transitions.  Significant power (hundreds of mW) is needed for the probing scheme.  Good spatial beam quality is important to the spectroscopy as well (M-squared less than 1.05).  The best solid-state solution is a narrow linewidth DFB laser system that can deliver infrared (IR) wavelengths of 1111.6 nm and 1156.84 nm which would be subsequently frequency-doubled to 555.8 nm and 578.42 nm using standard nonlinear optical techniques.  The doubling process may be only approximately 50% efficient, so at least 1 W of IR laser power is needed.   ****   Market research has identified only Koheras as a source of COMMERCIALLY manufactured DFB lasers at the necessary wavelengths (approximately 1112 nm and 1157nm).   ****   NO SOLICITATION IS AVAILABLE.   Any responses to this notice will be evaluated solely to determine whether or not a commercial item (FAR Part 12) competitive procurement under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (<$100K) would be in the best interest of the Government.  Any responses must be received in writing no later than June 4, 2004 addressed to the attention of  Doris Turner, Purchasing Agent.  Ms. Turner can be reached via mail (NOAA/MASC/AMD, MC3, 325 Broadway, Boulder, CO  80305), email (Doris.P.Turner@noaa.gov) or fax (303-497-3163).  The anticipated award date is June 8, 2004.   ****   Federal terms and conditions can be accessed online at http://www.arnet.gov/far.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

The Tracer  cartridge should exhibit a visible trace up to 150 meters.  An initial quantity  of 610,000 rounds will be required from the Contractor for the first period of  performance with an approximate additional quantity of 1,000,000 rounds over  the course of the next two (2) option periods.  Delivery of the 1,010,000  rounds is expected 240 calendar days after contract award.  Delivery of the  options is expected 180 calendars days after award of each option.  The  contract award(s) will be a firm fixed price production contract using full and  open competition based on the Best Value to the Government. The Government will  accept proposals from pre-qualified sources.  In order to be eligible for  award, a design must be qualified prior to contract award  (see FAR 9.206-1(c)).  In order to be qualified, each design must undergo an  extensive battery of tests as specified in the Government Performance pecification for the M858.

<DESC>Overhaul of the T63-A-720 (T-63), Turbine Engine, Input/Output NSN: 2840-01-013-1339, Input/Output P/N: 6887191.  The nature of the contract will be a maintenance and overhaul, firm-fixed price (FFP), contract for a quantity of 144 each for fiscal ye ar 2004 and an option quantity of 126 each for fiscal year 2005.  This requirement is restricted to Rolls Royce Corporation (RRC), Indianapolis, IN and its Authorized Maintenance Centers (AMC).  In compliance with the General Accounting Offices recommendat ions in HEROS, Inc., B-292043, the Army completed a cost/benefit analysis on 26 September 2003 that studied the feasibility of procuring the overhauls through full and open competition.  The conclusion of the cost/benefit analysis was that limiting competi tion to Rolls Royce and the AMCs is the most cost-effective alternative for procuring the overhauls.  The delay of this acquisition has severely degraded readiness of the fielded OH-58A/C aircraft fleet.  Interested sources may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement. The contract award will not be withheld pending the completion of a capability assessment.  This requirement is currently unfunded.  Award will be withheld pending receipt of sufficient funds.  No telephone or e-m ail request will be accepted.  Foreign firms are reminded that all request for the solicitation must be processed through their respective embassies.  Request will be accepted by data fax or mail only.  You may data fax your request to ATTN: AMSAM-AC-LM-M,  Constance Jones, Contracting Specialist or Jeanie Clark, Contracting Officer at (256) 955-9237.

<DESC>This is a notice of intent that WR-ALC anticipates issuing a contract for the purchase of Oscillator Subassembly (VCO), NSN:  5955-01-466-2960EW, P/N:  6139-6443-00 and Data IAW DD 1423 applicable to ALQ-172.  WR-ALC has and will provide outline drawings and performance specifications. Production drawings are not available. The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with full and open competition.  However, this acquisition will be processed in accordance with AFMC FAR Sup 5352.217-9006 (Mission Essential Quantity):  If a proven source is not the low offeror, the basic quantity may be split into a First Article quantity, for award to the low unproven offeror, and a Mission Essential Quantity, for award to the proven source, with the balance of the requirement established as options in both contracts.  Authority 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), “Supplies (or services) required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source(s) and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements” may apply.  Numbered Note 22 applies only to the quantity identified as the Mission Essential Quantity in the solicitation.  Estimated MEQ is 151 each, First Article 3 each and Production Quantity 89 each and two out-year options.  Option year 1: 175, Option year 2: 175.  Quantity ranges will be established in solicitation.

This acquisition may/does involve technology that has a military or space application. The only US contractors who may participate are those that are certified and registered with DLSC (1-800-352-3572) and have a legitimate business purpose. US contractors must submit a copy of their current, approved DD Form 2345 with their request for solicitation. To request this certification, write to the Commander, Defense Logistics Services Center, ATTN: DLSC-FEB, Federal Center, Battle Creek MI 49017-3084 and request a copy of Department of Defense Form 2345 or call DLSC at the above number. The solicitation/data package will be mailed to the data custodian identified in block 3 of the DD Form 2345.  The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined. MOU country sources must contact the Contracting Officer within 15 calendar days of the date of this synopsis notice to receive a copy of the solicitation at the time it is initially issued. Issuance of the RFP will not be delayed to review requests from MOU country sources received after 15 days or from non-MOU country sources. Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation, regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small-business set-aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors).

The Data Package for this requirement is posted on FedBizOpps with the solicitation. 

Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.

The proposal due date has been extended to 15 June 2004.

<DESC>***********************UPDATE 5/18/2004*************************************** The following two questions were inadvertently omitted from the  questions/answers in Amendment #2.  They are addressed below: Project #9600822 Bid Questions + Responses For the concrete trench along Monahan Street:  In lieu of a cast-in-place  concrete base and walls, may solid reinforced pre-cast sections be used for the  base and wall configuration with incorporation of the pre-cast slab top?  All  pre-cast sections would meet the same design criteria as the cast-in-place  concrete trench with the exception of continuous horizontal reinforcing steel. RESPONSE Pre-cast concrete trench sections for the base and walls of the trench will not  be allowed.  According to Unified Facilities Criteria publication UFC 3-430- 01 'Design: Heating and Cooling Distribution Systems' paragraph 4-2.3.b.  This  paragraph states 'The concrete trench will be field constructed of reinforced  concrete conforming to current criteria.  Trench walls and floors will be  poured in place-they will not be precast' Grades for top concrete trench:  Sheets C5.03 and C5.04 of the contract  drawings indicate invert elevations which is assumed to be floor elevation, but  give no top of slab elevation at centerline of concrete tunnel.  If a top slab  elevation is available for the concrete tunnel, can the elevations be provided  for estimation purposes or are the elevations to be estimated of the cross- section? RESPONSE The assumption is correct; the invert elevation refers to the floor elevation.   Estimates should be estimated from the cross section as stated with the final  grade as defined in details 'Concrete Trench Detail' and 'Concrete Trench  Section' on drawing 6.01. ************************UPDATE 5/17/2004 Amendment #2 to the solicitation has been posted.

<DESC>The Air Force Security Assistance Center (AFSAC) Information Technology Directorate operates a 24/7 public web site. This web site provides support to  our customer base, which includes CONUS and outside CONUS customers. Our  overseas customers have sometimes experienced problems with connecting to our  site and or experienced problems with the performance of our business  applications, which are hosted on our site. When a customer files a complaint  or provides other feedback we have no way to prove or disprove their complaint.  One reason is they are connecting using various speed connections, various  speed modems, a variety of PC and software configurations and from a great  number of foreign countries. We have no way to duplicate these various settings  in order to test the connections. A web monitoring service will provide this  24/7 monitoring of our site and provide notifications when the site is  unavailable. It will also test connections from various points around the  world, which is vitally important for a public web site. The following  requirements apply:       1.

<SOLNBR>N6133104R0037
<RESPDATE>071604
<CONTACT>Mark Ross at 850-235-5624, or Contracting Officer Margie Dulatt at 850-235-5398.
<DESC>The original synopsis has been modified in its entirety as follows: The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Panama City, FL intends to issue a Request For Proposal (RFP) to Magneto Inductive Systems Limited (MISL) USA of San Bernardino, CA on a sole source basis for an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contract for the Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) and production phases of the Magneto Inductive-Remote Activation Munitions System (MI-RAMS) program. The effort will include LRIP planning, long lead item procurement, and the manufacture, inspection, test and delivery of MI-RAMS. The government anticipates a period of performance for five years under an ID/IQ contract. The first year of the effort will involve LRIP planning such as long lead item identification for the production of the MI-RAMS system currently being developed under a sole source contract to MISL, Nova S cotia. The follow on years will involve procurement of long lead items and the manufacture of the MI-RAMS hardware. The MI-RAMS is a lightweight, compact, man-portable magneto inductive transmitter and receiver system to be used by Special Operation forces (SOF) and combat engineers. MI-RAMS provides the capability to remotely control the detonation of demolition charges or to remotely operate other items of equipment such as beacons, laser markers, weapons, ground marking lights, etc. MI-RAMS will reliably propagate a signal through natural or manmade media such as water, earth or building structures. The MI-RAMS will operate in all environments such as arctic, tropic, temperate, urban, beach zone and the surf zone (littoral) to depths less than 10 feet. The planned start date for this effort will be 4QFY04. The acquisition objective is for up to 5000 each MI transmitters, 10, 000 Auxiliary Power Packs, 25,000 each MI Type A receivers, 50,000 Type B MI  receivers. Detailed tasks will be provided, defining the required efforts, in individual delivery orders issued under the ID/IQ contract. This requirement is unsuitable for full and open competition for the following reasons. The authority of FAR 6.302-1(a)(2), as applied in FAR 6.302-1(b)(1)(ii), is deemed applicable as the agency's minimum needs can only be satisfied by the unique supplies available from Magneto Inductive Systems Ltd, the only known supplier of magneto-inductive (MI) related technologies. NSWC-PC has determined that MISL is only known supplier of MI related technologies that can meet the operational requirements of the MI-RAMS program. This determination was based on the results of 29 market surveys conducted by CSS/ONR since 1993 that resulted in no responses other than MISL. The M I-RAMS cannot be procured competitively utilizing a technical data package. Currently the patents and intellectual property rights to the relevant MI technologies either belong solely to MISL or are Government patents licensed to MISL. Additionally, per the approved MI-RAMS program Acquisition Plan, the LRIP and production quantities will be acquired from the system developer. MISL is the sole developer of MI-RAMS. NAICS Code 541710 applies. SBA Size Standard is 750 employees (based on NAICS Code 334290). FSC is 5895.

This includes performance on all program phases from preliminary assessment through preparation of construction and operation & maintenance documents for remedial action or corrective measure implementation activities related to evaluation of CERCLA sites (both NPL & non&#64979;NPL installations), RCRA corrective action sites and sites on closing or realigning installations.  Firms will be evaluated in terms of their quality of work, customer focus and demonstrated long-term business relationships with Government and private industry.  As appropriate, superior performance evaluations on recently completed Department of Defense contracts will be considered. Provide information regarding previous working relationships with proposed team subcontractors. A name and phone number should be provided for each reference. Demonstrate your cost reimbursable contract experience. (2) Corporate Experience and Professional Qualifications - Firms will be evaluated on their corporate experience on managing contracts with similar scopes and complexity.

Firms will be evaluated in terms of their past experience with regard to the DoD MRP program and their knowledge of principles contained in CERCLA, DERP, DDESB applicable to UXO clearance, site investigations, remediation, and explosives safety.  Firms must demonstrate expertise in a variety of UXO detection technologies, with expert ability to distinguish ordnance from non-ordnance.  Expertise regarding UXO excavation via manual, mechanized, and remote-controlled mechanized methods is required.  Knowledge and ability on remediating UXO and other constituents found in soil and groundwater is required in regard to current techniques common in the field such as blow-in-place and contained detonation chamber, as well as techniques presently more commonly found in industrial settings such as rotary kilns and deactivation furnaces.  Experience with UXO safety requirements, render-safe procedures, and the ability to efficiently coordinate with active duty EOD personnel is needed.
For the type of work required, firms will be evaluated in terms of the staff: (a) experience (with present and other firms) and roles of staff members specifically on projects addressed in evaluation factor number one; (b) demonstrate professional staff depth in task order level project managers and senior level project managers (experience level of a minimum of 8 years in waste site restoration experience); (c) active professional registration(s) in the states of Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, Mississippi, Alabama, the Bahamas Islands, Tennessee, Louisiana, Texas, Oklahoma, Nebraska, Arkansas, Kentucky, Missouri, Kansas, Colorado, Wyoming, North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota, Iowa, Illinois, Wisconsin, Michigan, Indiana, Ohio, North Carolina, New Mexico, Utah and Puerto Rico.

Demonstrate that the firm has the staff available for this contract to accomplish 80 to 100 task orders per year. Demonstrate the available staff ability to complete work in a timely manner, such as ability to complete draft work plans within 30 days after Notice to Proceed and mobilize forces immediately once the work plans are approved. The firm must also demonstrate the ability to handle unexpected surges in the workload with the same efficiency and promptness expected for planned work. Also, the firm must demonstrate the ability to handle separate programs in a timely and efficient manner, (i.e. IR/BRAC/MRP etc.). Firms will be evaluated in terms of their ability to manage a contract of this size and nature. Demonstrate how your staff will manage the workload, addressing the ability to accomplish the IR and BRAC programs, accommodating priorities of both programs. Demonstrate ability to manage your subcontractors. The firm must identify the management staff and demonstrate their ability to manage projects within a negotiated scope, schedule and budget; competently manage/participate in meetings; accelerate overall "clean up" process; act responsively to the requirements; provide innovative solutions/ideas and effectively communicate. If your firm is proposing to team with one or more subcontractors, demonstrate your approach for completing typical IR/BRAC task orders. Explain the structure between firms and how management oversight will be accomplished. If personnel are from different offices within the corporation, describe the interrelationship of the offices and how management will operate. Demonstrate that your firm has an effective cost accounting system, purchasing system, estimating system, and management information system (MIS) that fully integrates on line accumulation of cost expenditures within a week of occurrence.  The awarded contractor will be required to follow the provision – Cost Accounting Standards Notices and Certification, FAR 52.230-1. (4) Location - Firms will be evaluated on their knowledge/experience with respect to the general geographical area of the contract and the firm's knowledge of codes, laws, permits and construction materials and practices of the areas with particular emphasis on the states of Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, Mississippi, Alabama, the Bahamas Islands, Tennessee, Louisiana, Texas, Oklahoma, Nebraska, Arkansas, Kentucky, Missouri, Kansas, Colorado, Wyoming, North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota, Iowa, Illinois, Wisconsin, Michigan, Indiana, Ohio, North Carolina, New Mexico, Utah and Puerto Rico.

The following are the published Naval Facilities Engineering Command goals expressed in terms of percentages of total planned subcontracting dollars for utilization of small businesses as part of the contract performance:  Prime: Small Business (SB) – 73.7%; Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB) – 15.3%; HBCU/MI  – 1.2%; Women-owned Small Business(WOSB) – 13.8%; Service-Disabled Vet SB – 3%; HUBZone SB – 3.1%; Veteran-Owned Small Business – 3.0 %.  Large business firms are required to submit their final SF294s “Subcontracting Report for Individual Contracts” on three most recently completed contracts (not necessarily those projects listed under Factor 1, Past Performance) or any other documentation showing compliance with the utilization of HUBZone, SB, SDB, WOSB, VOSB, SDVOSB firms, and if applicable, HBCU/MI.  Include the dollar value percentage of work (of total contract value) subcontracted to LB, HUBZone, SB, SDB, WOSB, VOSB, SDVOSB firms, and if applicable, HBCU/MI for each. If goals were not met on submitted contracts, provide explanation as to why. The slated firms will be required to provide a preliminary subcontracting plan (support for small business subcontracting) as part of the interview.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION – NOTE: THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL - PROGRAM NAME: B-1 Capability Based Contract- 
This is an RFI intended to get information.  The government may or may not issue a solicitation or contract, nor does the government intend to pay for any information in connection with this RFI. DESCRIPTION: The focus of the Capability Based Contract is to provide a rapid response to unprogrammed B-1 manufacturing requirements presently performed organically at Tinker AFB.  The capabilities sought are sheet metal, tubing, machine shop, and wiring.  Capabilities essential to the fulfillment of these requirements are required for new manufactured items.  Export control certification is required to view applicable drawings and specifications.  As this is not a programmed workload, requirements will be recognized and drawings will be provided as needs occur.  The requirements will be met by issuing an Indefinite Delivery / Requirements type contract.  The Government estimates the dollar value to be $2 million per year, which is inclusive of all capabilities.  A sample list of National Stock Numbers is attached.  A Statement of Objective is also attached, which is generic in nature and explains general manufacturing capabilities. This is a new innovative approach to contracting out these capabilities. The Government is looking for industry review and comment to find the best approach.  We prefer a single contract with one contractor with the ability to subcontract to Small Business for capabilities they do not currently possess.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION – NOTE: THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL - PROGRAM NAME: B-1 Capability Based Contract - This is an RFI intended to get information.  The government may or may not issue a solicitation or contract, nor does the government intend to pay for any information in connection with this RFI.  
DESCRIPTION: The focus of the Capability Based Contract is to provide a rapid response to unprogrammed B-1 manufacturing requirements presently performed organically at Tinker AFB.  The capabilities sought are sheet metal, tubing, machine shop, and wiring.  Capabilities essential to the fulfillment of these requirements are required for new manufactured items.  Export control certification is required to view applicable drawings and specifications.  As this is not a programmed workload, requirements will be recognized and drawings will be provided as needs occur.  The requirements will be met by issuing an Indefinite Delivery / Requirements type contract.  The Government estimates the dollar value to be $2 million per year, which is inclusive of all capabilities.  A sample list of National Stock Numbers is attached.  A Statement of Objective is also attached, which is generic in nature and explains general manufacturing capabilities. This is a new innovative approach to contracting out these capabilities. The Government is looking for industry review and comment to find the best approach.  We prefer a single contract with one contractor with the ability to subcontract to Small Business for capabilities they do not currently possess. Please submit questions/ comments – IN WRITING ONLY (E-MAIL, FAX, REGULAR MAIL)

<DESC>The Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP) intends to enter into a Firm-Fixed Price (with an EPA) Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) long-term contract with Cytyc Corporation for their ThinPrep Pap Test Kit used to support their ThinPrep 2000 and 3000 Systems, through the use of the DSCP Medical Electronic Catalog (ECAT). Currently, Cytyc Corporation’s ThinPrep Systems resides in many of the Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs).  The ThinPrep Pap Test provides the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved option for MTFs to perform Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) testing after receiving an ASCUS (positive) result, out of the ThinPrep vial.  During the life of this procurement, as funds become available, DoD customers have expressed interest in using Cytyc’s automated screening equipment, which read the slides automatically and will be procured under this solicitation. 

Through Market Research it has been determined that Cytyc Corporation is the only FDA approved manufacturer for this bi-modal testing (dual FDA approval for both their ThinPrep Liquid Based Cytology and reflex Human Papilloma Virus testing).  The ThinPrep Pap Test Kits are specifically configured to support Cytyc’s Thin Prep 2000 and 3000 Systems.  No other manufacturer or distributors sells or has access to these products manufactured by Cytyc Corporation.  Also, the automated screener that may be purchased in the future under this solicitation is specifically configured to read the test slides contained in the ThinPrep Pap Test Kits.  No other known manufacturer or dealer is capable of fulfilling this requirement.  Overall, It has been determined that there is only one known manufacturer, Cytyc Corporation, who has the capability of providing the required items.  
  
This procurement applies to Government facilities worldwide.  Cytyc will be asked to provide a Continental United States (CONUS) catalog and an Outside Continental United States (OCONUS) catalog.  The CONUS catalog includes facilities located in the 48 contiguous states and the District of Columbia as well as Alaska and Hawaii.  These catalogs will be loaded in the DSCP Electronic Catalog (ECAT).  The catalog must reflect a total delivered price.  Total delivered price is defined as the total cost of all items inclusive of transportation and distribution costs.

<DESC>The following questions and answers for TIRNO-04-R-00010, were posted on May 17, 2004 at www.procurement.irs.treas.gov:

Question #1: All the components of this security vehicle have undefined performance parameters.  Do you desire bidders to provide offers according to no specific performance requirement?

Answer: The IRS would like to see the vendor’s approach for fulfilling this requirement.  Section C, Statement of Objectives (SOO), outlines the minimum requirements for the conversion of the vehicles.  Vendors are to propose to the IRS, their recommended method of converting the vehicles according to the requirements in the SOO.  Vendors should refer to Section M of the solicitation for further guidance (particularly M.3(b)- Evaluation Criteria- Phase I).

Question #2:  Do you not wish to see quantity pricing?

Answer: The IRS is unable to provide estimates of needed quantities due to varying individual agency needs, economic, and political conditions at the time of individual delivery orders.  However, the IRS would like for vendors to provide line item pricing for items based on your best business practices.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT

This is a Sources Sought Notice only.  This is not a request for proposal, but a survey to locate potential sources.  The United States Section of the International Boundary and Water Commission (USIBWC) is performing a market survey to determine if there are an adequate number of interested and qualified firms, having the capability to provide up-front financing for the design, construction and operation of a 59 MGD (million gallons per day) secondary wastewater treatment plant with supporting facilities.  Construction of the wastewater treatment plant will take place in Tijuana, Mexico.  

We are seeking interested firms that have the ability to provide up-front financing and serve as the contract administrators for this project, which has an estimated cost of between $300 and $600 million.  The firm will only provide up-front financing for this project but is not the responsible party for the design, construction and operations of the project.  The design, construction and operation of the project will be contracted in accordance with competitive bid requirements as prescribed under Mexican law.  Design and construction of the project is expected to take 18 to 24 months.  The USIBWC will request funding for this effort through the U.S. Federal Budget Process and will be diligent in working with members of Congress and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) on an annual basis; however, in the event that funding is not appropriated the USIBWC is not required to make any payment.  In order to successfully enter into a contract with an interested firm, the firm must agree to enter into such contract at its own risk; the contract will also include a provision specifying that no cancellation/ termination fee will be paid.  The firm will be the owner of the facility for the term of the contract or until all fees are fully paid, whichever is sooner.  The contract is expected to be an operating lease or a fee for services contract. The USIBWC is expected to initiate payments to the firm two years after construction has been completed; payments are contingent upon receiving funding appropriations from Congress on an annual basis.

All interested firms must notify this office in writing by mail or fax by May 28, 2004.  Responses shall include:
  
(1)	Identification and verification of the firm’s capabilities to provide up-front financing for an estimated project cost between $300 and $600 million.
(2)	Annual financial report for the last five years. 
(3)	Letter from a financial institution confirming the firm’s capability of obtaining up-front financing.

This Sources Sought Notice is issued for the purpose of market research in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 10.  All businesses capable of providing these services are invited to respond.  Any information provided by industry to the Government as a result of this sources sought synopsis is voluntary.  The Government will not pay for any information submitted in response to this sources sought synopsis.

Send responses to the U. S. International Boundary and Water Commission, 4171 N. Mesa, Suite C-100, El Paso, Texas 79902-1441, ATTN:  Alicia Williams or fax to (915) 832-4192 by COB, 5:00pm (MST).

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) wishes to identify potential sources to provide experimental work services to explore and develop terahertz (THz) spectroscopic and imaging methods for Homeland Security applications.*****The Government anticipates that capable firms/parties will possess the following qualifications: (a) Ph.D level scientists (Physics or Chemistry degrees) with 3 or more years of post-doctoral experience in the area of femtosecond laser spectroscopy and optical design.  (b) Demonstrated prior work with pulsed Terahertz spectroscopic and imaging methods. *****Required Tasks will include, for example, the following: (1) Generate 0.5-3 THz material spectra to evaluate qualifications for material identification purposes (e.g., features vs baseline?); Produce THz spectral database (Excel format) in low frequency region for as many BWA/CWA, hoax and simulant materials available; Use database spectral comparison algorithm(s) to provide unknown “hit” rates under screening test conditions. (2) Evaluation and spectral data of transmission through various glass types (flint, quartz, bottle) and thicknesses in the 1-3 THz spectral region; Provide high quality transmission data of all available plastics previously studied in the 1-3 THz region for reference spectra. (3) Determine whether THz pulse reflection waveforms can be used or modified to assess material layers and/or identification; Assess spatial resolution or interference effects from reflection configuration; Develop reflection waveform analysis or deconvolution algorithm to extract or remove container reflection artifacts for material spectroscopic identification. (4) Generate THz images (without spectral identification) in transmission or reflection mode as close to video rate as possible with sufficient spatial extent to identify possible threat objects inside containers (e.g., glass, plastic, paper); Perform reflection imaging testing and generate THz images in step-scan mode to assess whether phase information can identify threat objects in containers; Generate long step-scans and analyze resultant 2-D hypercubes to determine whether large bandwidth and high resolution temporal data can be transformed to spectral images for threat object identification. (5) Evaluate whether available THz generating/detecting crystals (e.g., ZnTe, GaP, GaSe) can be used to obtain high frequency, narrow-band spectral detection; Determine if high frequency scanning in reflection or transmission mode improves image spatial resolution for rapid object identification inside containers.*****THIS SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE  IS BEING ISSUED FOR INFORMATION AND PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY AND IN NO WAY COMMITS THE GOVERNMENT.** This is not a solicitation for proposals, nor will a contract/order be awarded in response to this notice.** Costs associated with vendors’ providing information in response to this announcement and any additional requests for information and/or materials will NOT be reimbursed.*****Interested, capable vendors/parties shall submit a capability statement in response to this Sources Sought Notice, including, at a minimum, the following: * (a) Technical discussion of vendor’s ability to perform the type of experimentation services described above;  (b) Name of Company-include a contact person's name, telephone number, and email address; (c) Company Address; (d) Company Size (please specify as either-Large, Small, Small Disadvantaged, Woman Owned Small Business, Veteran Owned Small Business, Service-Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business, 8(a), or Hubzone Small Business); (e) Identify whether you are interested in this acquisition as a prime contractor or a subcontractor; (f) Identify whether the services identified in herein are of a type offered and sold competitively in substantial quantities in the commercial marketplace based on established catalog or market prices and whether these services are exclusively provided to the Government; (g) Identify standard commercial terms and conditions typically associated with these services; (h) Describe experience and past performance with similar types of requirements of similar scope and magnitude and whether they were performance-based (with contract number, Government agency name and address and contract funded amount; (i) Identify existing or potential pricing structure in support of this type of work; (j) Identify qualifications of technical and management personnel; and (k) Identify and clearly mark any proprietary processes or data.***Vendors shall submit response, via email, facsimile (FAX: (301) 975-6273), or by mail in duplicate (one original and one copy) to,  National Institute of Standards and Technology, ATTN: TAMARA GRINSPON, Acquisition and Logistics Division/Contracts, 100 Bureau Drive—STOP 3571, Gaithersburg, MD  20899-3571, on or before 3:00PM EST, May 27, 2004.

<DESC>This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP). The purpose of this Request For Information (RFI) is to solicit industry feedback regarding a Mobile CAC PIN Reset System.  The Department of Defense is seeking industry solutions for a hand-held Common Access Card (CAC) Personal Identification Number (PIN) Reset device.  This single purpose device must  provide authentication and secure communication services for users and car dholders to support PIN reset.  In order to prevent CAC holders from re-visiting a Defense Eligibility Enrollment System-Realtime Automated Personnel Identificatin System (DEERS-RAPIDS) workstation every time they forget, lose, or lock their Personal Ident ification Numbers (PIN), the government is exploring the possibility of a portable, hand-held device that would remove the burden of the individual CAC holder from returning to an issuance facility or CAC PIN Reset (CPR) workstation.   The portability aspect of this hand-held device is critical though never been tested in this environment and it may present unique challenges not the least of which deal with information assurance.  It would also save hundreds of thousands of cardholders a  great deal of time, resulting in a significant cost avoidance to the government.  In short, the government is interested in doing a market search with the intent to explore what innovative industry solutions may exist that would allow the card-holders to reset their PIN locally.     The hand-held device must support the following technical interfaces/specifications:    {Send an email to technical poc shown below to be sent a graphical depiction of the technical interfaces/specifications). The interfaces are defined as: DEERS secure wireless interface is required to authenticate the trusted agent, and to download a photograph and fingerprint to authenticate the CAC holder.  The photograph will be displayed on the hand-held device for visual verification by a trusted opera tor. This a mutually authenticated v3 session established at the secure socket layer.  Subsequently the identity certificate of the Trusted Agent is sent to DEERS to corroborate this Trusted Agent is allowed to use the CPR application.  The downloaded data  is passed in a proprietary transfer record format.  The CAC Issuance Portal Ã¢Â€Â“ to request the DMDC CAC management service capable of unlocking the PIN. The session is established at the secure socket layer.  The Identity certificate is of the trusted agent is sent to the Issuance Portal to confirm the t rusted agent has authority to perform this operation.  In turn, the Issuance Portal establishes a Global Platform secure channel session inside the SSL session to interact with the card.  Card Issuer specific keys reside at the CAC issuance portal in order  to be able to communicate securely with the CAC. A biometric reader is required to capture the fingerprint image of the CAC holder to verify identity. The handheld device will match the live scan of the fingerprint to the fingerprint image or template of the CAC holder retrieved from DEERS. A smart card reader - to read/update the CAC that is undergoing a PIN reset (cardholder). A smart card reader - to authenticate the trusted agentÃ¢Â€Â™s CAC (CTA). This is strictly a Request for Information (RFI) and not a formal solicitation.  Proposals should be limited to 2 typed pages in Microsoft Word format and include point of contact information.   Responses will be accepted until 2 July 2004.  Only electronic responses will be accepted. Send responses via email to:  NETCOM-IA CAC/PKI@hqda.army.mil The subject line of responses must have the following title: Ã¢Â€ÂœPortal PIN ResetÃ¢Â€Â

This procurement action is 100% set-aside for small business. The associated North American Industrial Classification System code is 488390.  A firm is a small business for the purpose of this requirement if its size standard is 1,000 employees.  Stock Assessment Improvement Study - Juvenile Fish/Zooplankton Assessment 
General Description of Work - Fishing vessel to conduct 3, 4 day mid-water to near-surface trawl surveys of juvenile fishes off Newport, Oregon starting in June 2004.  This is a pilot study before a full study in 2005.   This is a   1-year contract (2004).  The Government will supply the trawl net, doors, and floats.  See Statement of Work for detailed information.  Exact dates of cruises are still yet to be determined but will be in June and July.  The Government will work with the contractor to identify specific dates. STATEMENT OF WORK - Stock Assessment Improvement Study - Juvenile Fish/Zooplankton Assessment - The Government has a requirement for a fishing vessel to conduct a mid-water to near-surface trawl survey of juvenile fish and zooplankton off Newport, Oregon in 2004. This is a 1-year contract.  The Government will supply the trawl net, doors, and floats.  At the Government's prerogative, the charter will begin in Newport, OR on or about 15 June 2004. The duration of each charter will be 4 days approximately every 15-20 days for a total charter in June/July 2004 of 12 days (3 charters).  Sampling (mid-water trawling) will be conducted primarily at night.  Some zooplankton sampling will also be done during the day and night.  The primary sampling areas occur along two transects, one off Newport, OR, and the other off Cape Perpetua, OR.  All transects sampled begin nearshore and continue out to approximately 60 NM, with sampling approximately every 5 NM (~12 stations/transect).

(3) Government personnel will provide their own bedding, towels, and survival suits. OPERATING PROCEDURES – (1) The Contractor shall provide nutritionally balanced meals each charter day.  Meal times will be coordinated with the Field Party Chief to accommodate both the need to complete sampling work and the time required to prepare meals by the cook.  (2) Workday length and hours will be determined by the Field Party Chief in consultation with the Captain.  Working days may average over 12 hours.  The decision will be based on the type of activity expected (in-port preparations, running, fishing, jogging, etc.) as well as on prevailing weather conditions and the Cruise Plan.  The Field Party Chief has the final authority except in matters relating to safety of the vessel and vessel personnel. (3) The Field Party Chief and Captain will meet a minimum of twice a day to discuss survey operations and resolve any problems that occur.

Proposed substitutes shall have comparable qualifications to those of the persons being replaced.  EVALUATION - Evaluation shall consist of the following technical factors – Safety of vessel, Experience/qualifications of Captain/Crew, and Adequacy of Vessel and Equipment.  The remaining evaluation factors are past performance and price.  The technical factors and past performance are considered substantially more important than price.  PROPOSAL INSTRUCTIONS - The proposal must be done in two parts: A technical proposal and a business (price) proposal.  Each of the parts shall be separate and complete in itself so that the evaluation of one may be accomplished independently from evaluation of the other.  The technical proposal shall include proposed Captain’s work experience, relevant vessel characteristics, a copy of the Stability Letter from the vessel’s Stability Report certified by a licensed naval architect/marine engineer, a description of the deck configuration, and information on any research surveys the vessel and/or Captain have performed in the past, including the date of the research, type of research, and a contact name and phone number for whom the research was performed.

PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES 
[DEC 2003] 
(a) Prohibitions. 
Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. 
The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 

“Expanded Affiliated Group” means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504
of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for `at least 80 percent' each place it appears. 

“Foreign Incorporated Entity” means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 

“Inverted Domestic Corporation.” A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)— 

(1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held— 
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or 
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
“Person”, “domestic”, and “foreign” have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs 
(1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 

(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
(i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or 
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 
(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
(i) warrants; 
(ii) options; 
(iii) contracts to acquire stock; 
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and 
(v) others similar interests. 
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. 

(f) Disclosure. 
By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296 of November 25, 2002. 

(g) If a waiver has been granted, a copy of the approved waiver shall be attached to the bid or proposal.

<DESC>SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION: This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation WILL NOT be issued.  
NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS:  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests(OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office(GAO).
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award or performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3)
				2100 Second Street, SW
				Washington, D.C. 20593
				Telephone:   (202) 267-2285
				 FAX:        (202) 267-4011.
The Request for Proposal number is HSCG89-04-R-6F9007 and incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 01-23.  This acquisition is 100% small business set-aside.  The NAICS is 481212.  The small business sized standard is 1,500 employees.  The contract type will be a firm fixed price contract.  The Government proposes to solicit offers for the following services and quantities:

CONTRACT LINE ITEM NUMBER (CLIN): CLIN 0001 Propane refueling-Two sites; Total Quantity 3,400 gallons.  The locations are: 1) Naked Island, 2,300 gallons; 2) Point Pigot, 1,100 gallons.  CLIN 0002 Propane refueling-Seven sites; Total Quantity 6,800 gallons. The locations are: 1) Robert Barron, 2,200 gallons; 2) Duke Island, 800 gallons; 3) Sukkwan Island, 800 gallons; 4) Cape Fanshaw, 700 gallons; 5) Zarembo Island, 700 gallons; 6) Mt. Mac Arther, 700 gallons; 7) Althorp Peak, 900 gallons.
DESCRIPTION OF SERVICE:  This is a high priority U.S. Coast Guard search and rescue system that must be kept operational at all times to protect property and lives.  The Contractor shall re-fuel two Alaska mountain top high sites with propane in the Valdez area and seven Alaska mountain top high sites with propane in the Juneau area.  The National Voice Distress System Radio sites to be fueled are remote sites that are only accessible by helicopter.  There is no road access to any of these sites and the weather conditions can vary considerably in any season.  Typical transportation of propane to these sites usually includes the use of a barge and/or helicopter.  Normally full pickle barrels are transported by barge to a location near the site and then slung to the mountaintop by a helicopter rated for that load carrying capacity.  A fuel mechanic will then remove the barrel from the sling and transfer the propane to the permanent site-standard (five) 500 Gallon propane tanks.  This process is repeated until all tanks are at maximum capacity.  The contractor shall provide for all services, materials and equipment, personnel, transportation and propane. Contractor shall record and document actual gallons of propane delivered to each site and tank gauge level percentages after filling.  All documentation will be delivered to the Contracting Officer within one week of work completion.
START OF WORK:  Work shall not start before 1 August 2004.
DELIVERY: Services shall be completed for all sites, except Robert Barron, not later than 30 September 2004.  The Robert Barron site shall be refueled no later than 30 August 2004. 
AWARD:  This purchase will be based on the following criteria:  Past performance and technical capability will be evaluated.  All evaluation factors other than price, when combined, are approximately equal to price.  Offerors are cautioned that the government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offeror’s initial offer should contain the best terms from a price and technical standpoint.

<DESC>URBAN TREE INVENTORY.    The following is a Statement of Work and a Request for Quote.    The USDA Forest Service requires services in Charleston, SC. and Charlotte, NC from an individual or firm with knowledge and experience in tree inventory work.    This announcement is a combined synopsis and solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Part 12, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.    All provisions, clauses and statutes or executive orders for the acquisition of commercial items are applicable to this request.    BACKGROUND:    The USDA Forest Service Center for Urban Forest Research (CUFR) is requesting quotes for municipal tree inventory work in two cities to complement our current research on street tree growth, functionality, value, and management needs.  As this inventory data is critical to the Center¡¦s mission, we require a high quality product.    
Over the past four years, the Center has worked in eight different municipalities throughout the Western U.S. to collect data about how municipal trees grow and function in different climes.  The culmination of this work has been published as a series of Community Tree Guides with the intent of describing the benefits and costs of planting trees in a specific climate region to assist community officials and tree managers increase public awareness and support for tree programs.    
In support of STRATUM (Street Tree Analysis Tool for Urban Forest Managers), the scope of this research has been extended to include an additional 12 climate zones throughout the U.S.   Consequently, tree inventory data collection will be commensurate.  We anticipate contracting collection of these data at the rate of 2-4 municipalities per annum for duration of 4-5 years.  This summer (June through September), sample inventories are needed for two municipalities: Charleston, South Carolina and Charlotte, North Carolina.  DATA COLLECTION CONTRACTS FOR BOTH CITIES WILL BE AWARDED THROUGH ONE CONTRACT.    

EVALUATION CRITERIA are in order of descending importance:  

1)  Past experience of the firm:  Provide three recent and relevant examples of contracts for similar services.    

2)  Profession expertise:  Discuss experience of individuals to complete all phases of work outlined above.    

3)  Price:  Provide one lump sum price for all phases of work, inclusive of all travel and expenses.  The total price is to be fully loaded, inclusive of direct costs, indirect costs, overhead or G&A, profit, incidental materials costs, tools of the trade, and travel.      

SUBMISSION of QUOTES and RESPONSES:    Interested firms should submit an electronic quote and response to Evaluation Criteria in MS Word prior to noon, on June 2, 2004 to Dave Allasia.  Email is ( dallasia@fs.fed.us ).  You must reference Solicitation R5-04-20-042 as the subject.  Quotes will be accepted until noon, June 2, 2004.    Also include your Tax Identification Number.    Award will be based on best over all value to the Government, price and other factors considered.  Award may be made without further discussions; therefore, firms are advised to submit their best price quote and response to criteria.  The Forest Service will hire one firm to perform the services identified within the scope of work and protocols, below.  


SCOPE OF WORK:    

Sample Municipal Tree Inventory for Charleston, SC (approximately 910 trees) and Charlotte, NC (approximately 910 trees).  

Deliverables (for each city, respectively):    
1) Tree Data:    
Excel spreadsheet containing data for all trees inventoried and corresponding digital image files are delivered on a weekly basis during active field work, where:  
a.  Data field headings correspond in identity with protocols provided  b.  All records accurately filled for each record and data field using protocols provided.  
c.  Image file folders are dated and individual image files are correctly named in correspondence with data in fields 21 and 23.  
d.  Data has been quality checked for accuracy and inaccuracies remedied  
A final spreadsheet, complete with all data, and image files to be delivered on or before October 15, 2004.    Penalties will accrue for late submittals. 

2)  Fresh foliar samples:    
a.  Following attached protocols, 10 foliar samples, in fresh condition, for each of approximately 22 species (22 trees x 10 samples = 220 total samples [weight = approx. 30 lbs total]), will be sent to CUFR for processing via overnight shipment.    

Provided by Center for Urban Forest Research (CUFR):    
1)  Tree Data:    
An Excel database containing tree ID and location data (fields 1-9 and 11 [see attached]) for 910 municipal trees in each city.  These trees will have been selected at random from the 22 most predominant species in the respective city as recorded in a recent full inventory.  As such, random selection will have been stratified to include 30-70 individual trees, representing all size classes, of each of the 22 species.  Trees will be individually located throughout the city in the public right-of-way or park locations (i.e., no trees on private property will be included); travel time to and from individual trees may be substantial as individual trees; not blocks or street segments will be inventoried.  

Of the 37 data fields to be included in the final deliverable, 10 (1-9, 11)  [see protocols for details])  will be provided by CUFR to aid you in locating and identifying each of the 910 trees:    
1. Zone.  
2. TreeID.  
3. Spcode (species code).  
4. AddressNum.  
5. Street.  
6. Side.  
7. Cell.  
8. Onstreet.  
9. FromTo.  
10. DBHinventory.    

An Excel workbook containing 30 ¡§replacement trees¡¨ for each of the 22 species will be provided with the same data fields as the original 910 tree data base.  These are intended to be used as replacements when desired trees cannot be located due to removal, access, etc.    

Additionally, a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) will be developed between CUFR and the municipality that provides the winning bidder with aid in collecting planting date data (fields 35 and 36 [see attached protocols]).  However, ultimate responsibility for all data lies with the winning bidder.    

Detailed protocols for all 37 data fields to be included in the final deliverable are attached (below).    

2)  Fresh Foliar Sampling:    
A MOU will be developed between CUFR and the municipality that provides the winning bidder with 40 hours of aerial-lift vehicle and operator usage (free of charge) for the sole purpose of collecting fresh foliar samples.  Times of usage will be scheduled by agreement between the winning bidder and the municipality.    
	
3)  Kickoff Meeting and Protocol Training:    
To ensure that protocol clarity and methodology are accurately deciphered prior to data collection, CUFR staff will be available for a single, two-day training of field data collection protocols.  This training will coincide with dates and location of a project kickoff meeting between all cooperating parties (including successful firm) the week of June 21, 2004, in Charleston, SC (meeting time and place to be announced).

THE PROJECT DURATION WILL EXTEND FROM JUNE 21 THROUGH OCTOBER 15, 2004.    Our needs are specific, and may not conform to all aspects of traditional municipal tree inventory data collection; this includes both methods and equipment utilized.  Before replying with a bid, please read the attached bid request details and data collection protocols carefully to make sure your company can provide the data described for each field in the format desired.    

PROTOCOLS FOR TREE DATA AND FOLIAR SAMPLING ARE ATTACHED BELOW.  IF UNREADABLE CONTACT SCOTT MACO ( smaco@fs.fed.us ) FOR FORMATTED COPIES.    

REFERENCE CITY FIELD DATA COLLECTION PROTOCOLS:    

The following data will be recorded for each tree (note: fields 1-9, 11, 35 and 36 are provided by cooperating municipality):    

1)	..Zone   from inventory, the number of the management area or zone that the tree is located in within a city.  

2)	  TreeID   from inventory, unique number assigned to each tree by city in inventory.  

3)	  SpCode   4 to 6 letter code consisting of the first two letters of the genus name and the first two letters of the species name followed by two optional letters to distinguish two species with the same four-letter code.  

4)	  AddressNum   from inventory, street number of building where tree is located.  

5)	  Street   from inventory, the name of the street the tree is located on  from inventory.  

6)	  Side   from inventory, indicates side of building or lot tree is located on (see Figure 1):  
F = Front. 
M = median. 
S= side. 
P = park.  

7)	  Cell   from inventory, the cell number where the tree is located (1,2,3, etc).  Obtain city inventory protocols to determine what order the trees are numbered in (e.g., sometimes they are assigned in driving direction or, alternatively, as street number increases, depending upon city).



  
Figure 1.  Treeloc tree 295 Apple S1 is actually the first tree (in driving direction) on Birch Street side of house  


8)	  Onstreet   from inventory (omit if not included as a field in city¡¦s inventory), for trees at corner addresses when tree is actually on cross street rather than the addressed street (see Figure 1).

9)	  FromTo   from inventory, the names of the cross streets that form boundaries for trees lining un-addressed boulevards.  For example, on boulevards that have no development adjacent to them, therefore no obvious parcel addressing, trees are typically numbered in order.  By including closest cross streets in the inventory, one will not have to begin counting trees from #1 in order to locate #333 which is 10 blocks up the boulevard from #1.

10)	  DBH   measure the diameter at breast height (1.37m) to nearest 0.1 cm (tape).  Where possible for multi-stemmed trees forking below 1.37 m measure above the butt flare and below the point where the stem begins forking.  When this is not possible, measure DRC as described below.  Saplings (DBH/DRC 2.54 - 12.5 cm) will be measured at 1.37 m unless falling under multi-stemmed/unusual stem categories requiring DRC measurements (per FHM Field Methods Guide). 

DIAMETER AT ROOT COLLAR (DRC)   adapted from FHM Field Methods Guide:  
For species requiring diameter at the root collar, measure the diameter at the ground line or at the stem root collar, whichever is higher.  For these trees, treat clumps of stems having a unified crown and common rootstock as a single tree; examples include mesquite, juniper, and mountain mahogany.  For multi-stemmed trees, compute and record a cumulative DRC (see below); record individual stem diameters and a stem status (live or dead) on a separate form or menu as required.    

Measuring DRC:  Before measuring DRC, remove the loose material on the ground (e.g., litter) but not mineral soil. Measure just above any swells present, and in a location so that the diameter measurements are reflective of the volume above the stems (especially when trees are extremely deformed at the base).    

Stems must be at least 1.0 ft in length and 1.0 inch in diameter to qualify for measurement; stems that are missing due to cutting or damage are not included in measurement.    

Additional instructions for DRC measurements are illustrated in Figure 2.    

Computing and Recording DRC:  For all tally trees requiring DRC, with at least one stem 1.0 inch in diameter or larger at the root collar, DRC is computed as the square root of the sum of the squared stem diameters.  For a single-stemmed DRC tree, the computed DRC is equal to the single diameter measured.    

Use the following formula to compute DRC:  
DRC  =  SQRT [SUM (stem diameter2)]
Round the result to the nearest 0.1 in.  For example, a multi-stemmed woodland tree with stems of 12.2, 13.2, 3.8, and 22.1 would be calculated as:    
DRC = SQRT (12.22 + 13.22 + 3.82 + 22.12)    
= SQRT (825.93)    
= 28.74    
= 28.7    


11)	  DBHinv   the DBH from the city inventory, usually expressed as classes from 1 to 9, but class system specific to city. Sometimes expressed as DBH to nearest inch.    

12)	  GroPerp = measurement of planting space perpendicular to street to closest 0.1 m.  Enter NA for unrestricted rooting areas like parks, vacant lots, schools, institutions, and front yards where at least one side of tree crown does not intersect hardscape (see Fig. 4).  

13)	  GroPar = measurement of planting space parallel to street to closest 0.1 m. when growing space is cutout or other location where there is no place for roots to break out into larger rooting area (e.g., lawn area, or large empty lot with soil).  If area under drip line does not intersect hardscape, record as NA (see Fig. 4).    
 
Figure 4.  Grospace 2 for this tree would be recorded as NA because crown width (parallel to road) does not intersect hardscape.    

14)	  CrnDiaPar   (crown diameter) crown diameter measurement taken to the nearest 0.5 m parallel to the street.  The occasional erratic branch should not be included (see Fig 5).    

15)	  CrnDiaPerp   (crown diameter) crown diameter measurement taken to the nearest 0.5 m perpendicular to street.  The occasional erratic branch should not be included (see Fig 5).    

 
Figure 5.  Erratic branch (in box at left) is omitted from crown diameter measurement.  
16)	  Setback   distance from tree to nearest air-conditioned/heated space (be aware that this may not be same address as tree location).    
Evaluate as:  
1 = 0-8 m  
2 = 8.1-12 m  
3 = 12.1-18 m  
4 = >18 m    

17)	  MtncRec   the recommended maintenance for the tree:  
	0 = none  
	1 = young tree (routine)  
	2 = young tree (immediate)  
	3 = mature tree (routine)  
	4 = mature tree (immediate)  
	5 = critical concern (public safety)  

18)	  MtncTask   maintenance task -- the highest priority task to perform on the tree:    
1 = stake/train  
2 = clean  
3 = raise  
4 = reduce  
5 = remove  
6 = treat pest/disease    

19)	  TreeOr   Tree Orientation   taken with compass, as in Figure 7, the coordinate of tree taken from imaginary lines extending from walls of the nearest conditioned space (heated or air-conditioned space, may not be same address as tree location):    
1 = N = North (337.5-22.5¢X)  
2 = NE = Northeast (22.5-67.5¢X)  
3 = E = East (67.5-112.5¢X)  
4 = SE = Southeast (112.5-157.5¢X)  
5 = S = South (157.5-202.5¢X)  
6 = SW = Southwest (202.5-247.5¢X)  
7 = W = West (247.5-292.5¢X)  
8 = NW = Northwest (292.5-337.5¢X)    













Figure 7.  Shows imaginary lines extending from walls and associated tree orientation.    

20)	  CarShade   Number of autos where any portion of any parked automotive vehicle is under the tree¡¦s drip line. Car must be present:    
0 = no autos

32)	  SwDamg   sidewalk damage categories will be determined for each city during study preparation.  City forester will be asked 1)  dimensional measurement at which sidewalk is heaved enough to grind or ramp and 2)  at what degree of damage does city move from temporary to permanent repair.  Example:  
0 = None = heaved <1.90 cm (3/4 inch) = no repair  
1 = Low = heaved 1.90 to 3.8cm (3/4-1.5 inch) = ramp/grind  
2 = Medium = heaved 3.8 to 7.6 cm (1.5 - 3 inch) = replace/permanent repair  
3 = High = Heaved >7.6 cm (3 inch) = removal and replacement  
Note:  Be careful NOT to assess damage adjacent to newly planted trees as damage associated with that tree.    

33)	  CondWood   Structural (woody) health of tree as per adaptation of CTLA tree appraisal:    
4 = No apparent problems = Good

4 = No apparent problems = Good  
3 = Minor problems = Fair  
2 = Major problems = Poor  
1 = Extreme problems = Dead/dying  

35)	  PlantDate   Date tree was planted (for data analysis, assumptions of age at planting will be obtained from city forester for 1.5¡¨ caliper trees).  
a.	 remind city forester to record planting date, not tree age.  Cooperating municipality should provide info on typical age for each species at planting.  
b.	Provide city with list of trees to be aged¡Xlist should be sorted for aging by management area, street, and address (in this order) to simplify locating them  
c.	You should convert DBH (metric) into DBH (inches) for the city¡¦s use    

36)	  Accuracy   accuracy of tree age; when trees are being aged by city:  
a.	Forester should then specify accuracy of estimated planting date using classes:    
1 = within a year  
2 = within 2-3 years  
3 = within 4-5 years  
4 = within 6-10 years  
5 = over 10 years.  

37)	Notes: any pertinent notes that help explain something that is unusual about the tree that may affect growth of the tree.

38)	dbh1, dbh2, dbh 3, etc., are for individual stem diameter entries for multi-stemmed trees being recorded using DRC methods. These cells are linked to the formula in field #10 (DBH) column calculating the final DBH.




REFERENCE CITY FOLIAR SAMPLING PROTOCOLS:

For each of the approximately 22 species selected for inventory in each city, one tree¡Xtypical of species in age, size, and condition¡Xwill be selected for foliar sampling using the following protocols:

1. Take one (1) set of 10 random quadrat (the cube [30 cm x 30 cm x 30 cm]) samples from each tree -- 3 from lower third of tree, 4 from middle section and 3 from top. From each strata, at least one sample will be from the outer, middle and inner portions of the foliated crown.

2. If tree is taller than the bucket can reach, take 3 from bottom, 4 from about the middle height that the bucket can reach, and 3 from full bucket extension. Preferable to find a younger (shorter) tree.

3. Connect cube to pole (broomstick will work) with duct tape. This is so you can hold the pole against a front corner of the bucket and keep your hands free to clip leaves.

4. Clip leaves along the outside of the cube, then pluck those that are completely inside the cube. See drawing below.

5. Each of the 10 samples should be stored in its own zip lock bag, with as much air pushed out of bag as possible.




















6. Samples should be labeled with collectors name, species code, sample number, and date of collection. Therefore, for example, in permanent marker, the bags for Acer platanoides collected on July 29 by J. Doe should be marked as follows:
J.Doe ACPL 1/10 072902, J. Doe ACPL 2/10  072902, J. Doe ACPL 3/10 072902 ....to J. Doe ACPL 10/10 072902. Also, place on label a two-letter code noting the crown location leaves were taken from:
		LO = lower outer crown
LM = lower middle
LI = lower inner
MO = middle outer crown
MM = middle middle
MI = middle inner
UO = upper outer
UM = upper middle
UI = upper inner

7. It is best to pre-label all bags before starting and roll each set of bags up with a rubber band binding them and a note saying which species it is.

8. After collection, bags are immediately  stored out of direct sunlight in an ice chest ¡Vdon't put directly on top of ice, put a paper bag between ice and zipped bags. 

9. Store leaves for 3-5 days maximum. Ship FEDEX overnight so leaves arrive on a WEEKDAY. This is vital so leaves can be refrigerated upon arrival. Use large FEDEX boxes (about size of moving box for books) ...the fewer packages the better for keeping leaves cooler in transit.  End of Solicitation.

<DESC>AMENDMENT 1:
Q1.  Does your office have any particular preference of manufacturer or brand?  
A1. No
Q2. Is the 6 ton compressor a typographical error?
A2. Yes it it possible that this is an error in posting.  These ECUs will be used primarily in desert conditions and for heating and cooling of soldier sleep tents.
Q3.  Do you require an air-conditioner with supplemental electric heat or a heat pump design providing both cooling and heating but also with supplemental electric heat?
A3.  I need one that requires both heating and cooling.  I am not sure of the heat pump design.  
Q4. We will need the air temperature, preferably both dry and wet bulb, entering the evaporator section, the ambient temperature, and operating temperature range.  What is the desired airflow.
A4.  I have no idea.  It will be used in arid and humid environments such as the desert. As a reminder the airflow should accomodate soldiers in a sleeping tent whether it is small or large. 
Q5.  Can you tolerate weight greater than 300 lbs and aluminum construction.
A5.  Submit what you have. The unit would prefer as close to 300 lbs as these units need to be portable.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to incorporate clause FAR 52.216-2-Economic Price Adjustment-Standard Supplies attached in full text.  The clause is incorporated and herein made part of this solicitation. FAR 52.26-2-Economic Price Adjustment-Standard Supplies (Jan 1997) (a) The Contractor warrants that the unit price stated in the Schedule for _________ [offeror insert Schedule line item number] is not in excess of the Contractor's applicable established price in effect on the contract date for like quantities of the same  item. The term 'unit price' excludes any part of the price directly resulting from requirements for preservation, packaging, or packing beyond standard commercial practice. The term 'established price' means a price that -- (1) Is an established catalog or market price for a commercial item sold in substantial quantities to the general public; and (2) Is the net price after applying any standard trade discounts offered by the Contractor. (b) The Contractor shall promptly notify the Contracting Officer of the amount and effective date of each decrease in any applicable established price. Each corresponding contract unit price shall be decreased by the same percentage that the established pr ice is decreased. The decrease shall apply to those items delivered on and after the effective date of the decrease in the Contractor's established price, and this contract shall be modified accordingly. (c) If the Contractor's applicable established price is increased after the contract date, the corresponding contract unit price shall be increased, upon the Contractor's written request to the Contracting Officer, by the same percentage that the establish ed price is increased, and the contract shall be modified accordingly, subject to the following limitations: (1) The aggregate of the increases in any contract unit price under this clause shall not exceed 10 percent of the original contract unit price. (2) The increased contract unit price shall be effective -- (i) On the effective date of the increase in the applicable established price if the Contracting Officer receives the Contractor's written request within 10 days thereafter; or (ii) If the written request is received later, on the date the Contracting Officer receives the request. (3) The increased contract unit price shall not apply to quantities scheduled under the contract for delivery before the effective date of the increased contract unit price, unless failure to deliver before that date results from causes beyond the control and without the fault or negligence of the Contractor, within the meaning of the Default clause. (4) No modification increasing a contract unit price shall be executed under this paragraph (c) until the Contracting Officer verifies the increase in the applicable established price. (5) Within 30 days after receipt of the Contractor's written request, the Contracting Officer may cancel, without liability to either party, any undelivered portion of the contract items affected by the requested increase. (d) During the time allowed for the cancellation provided for in subparagraph (c)(5) of this clause, and thereafter if there is no cancellation, the Contractor shall continue deliveries according to the contract delivery schedule, and the Government shall pay for such deliveries at the contract unit price, increased to the extent provided by paragraph (c) of this clause. (End of Clause)
