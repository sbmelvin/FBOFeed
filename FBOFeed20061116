<DESC>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) (an operating administration within the United States Department of Transportation) is responsible for reducing the number of injuries and deaths on the highways resulting from vehicle crashes.  In support of this mission, NHTSA contractors conduct large scale surveys to determine the degree to which vehicle operators and passengers use occupant protection devices.  Those surveys include the National Occupant Protection Use Survey (NOPUS), the National Survey of the Use of Booster Seats (NSUBS), and the Seat Belt Use by Commercial Motor Vehicle Drivers (SBUCMVD) survey.  Each is a complex nationwide survey producing 50 to 4,000 estimates based on observing as many as 207,000 vehicles at between 120 to 2,000 sites across the United States.  Each survey utilizes a multi-stage clustered sample design, whose statistical complexity must be taken into account to produce quality survey results.  The objective of this procurement is to provide NHTSA with  professional services in support of the NOPUS, NSUBS, and SBUCMVD surveys.  In addition, the contractor shall fulfill ad hoc requirements through execution of contract task orders.   NHTSA intends to award a single, Time and Materials contract for a base period of two (2) years.  The contract will also include a provision by which up to three (3) one-year option periods can be exercised (in one-year increments) resulting in a total possible period of performance of five (5) years.  Each contract year (whether each of the two base periods or each of the three one-year option periods) will include a Base Level of Effort as well as a provision by which the government may issue task orders to fulfill ad hoc requirements.  As part of the Base Level of Effort for the contract?s base period (i.e. first two years of the contract), the contractor will be required to provide all necessary personnel, material, equipment, facilities, supplies and all other resources (unless identified specifically in the RFP and resultant contract as Government Furnished Property) to conduct the following surveys: the 2007 and 2008 National Occupant Protection Use Survey (NOPUS); the 2007 National Survey of the Use of Booster Seats (NSUBS); the 2007 Seat Belt Use by Commercial Motor Vehicle Drivers (SBUCMVD). As part of an option period?s Base Level of Effort, the contractor will be required to conduct the NOPUS survey applicable to that option period.  Potential Task Order requirements include: performance of  NSUBS and/or SBUCMVD surveys during 2008, 2009, 2010 and/or 2011;  designing and selecting new samples; investigating ways to improve survey preparation, data collection, or data analysis; and feasibility of incorporating changes to the surveys or conducting new related surveys desired by the Agency.  The solicitation will be available for downloading from www.FBO.gov on or about December 1, 2006.  Any questions related to this synopsis or related solicitation shall be referred, via e-mail only, to Mr. Anthony Garner, Contracts Specialist, by no later than December 11, 2006.  Mr. Garner's e-mail address is Anthony.Garner@dot.gov.  Award of the resultant contract is expected by no later than March 1, 2007.

<DESC>The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center, San Diego (SSC-SD) intends to negotiate a sole source contract with Metal Storm Incorporated, 4350 Fairfax Drive, Suite 810, Arlington, VA  22203-1625 for the production of one (1) 40mm anti-personnel unattended weapons pod utilizing Electronic Ballistic Technology (EBT) and one (1) operator control unit. The utilization of EBT, for the weapons pod, is proprietary to Metal Storm Incorporated. The technology enables multiple projectiles to be stacked and fired from a single tube (barrel).  These barrels can be grouped together in a range of sizes and calibers to form compact electronically operated weapons. The projectiles are stored and transported in, and eventually electronically fired from these multi-barreled tubes.  Due to the fact that Metal Storm Incorporated does not share their proprietary weapons design information with any other business, they are the only available and qualified source to provide the required technology. The contract type will be a firm fixed-priced (FFP) for an eighteen (18) month period of performance.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals or quotes.  Use of any other contractor would result in substantial duplication of costs and delays for the Government based on proprietary information controlled by Metal Storm Incorporated.  Authority for other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other suppliers or services will satisfy agency requirements. Electronic copies of the solicitation may be obtained from the SPAWAR E- Commerce website at http://e-commerce.spawar.navy.mil/ under SSC San Diego "Open Solicitations".  Hard copy versions of the solicitation and any subsequent amendments will not be available.  Matters posted on the web site are not terms of the solicitation unless the solicitation is written or amended to include such matters.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541620   NCEA TECHNICAL SUPPORT SERVICES This is a combined synopsis/request for quote (RFQ) for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. The identifying RFQ number is  RFQ-OH-07-00028.  The RFQ and incorporated provisions/clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-13.  A firm-fixed price purchase order is anticipated as a result of this full and open competition RFQ.  The NAICS code is 541620.   STATEMENT OF WORK I.   Project  Identification:  Consultation for Air Quality Science Assessment for Oxides of Nitrogen:  Controlled Human Exposure Studies. II.  Period of Performance:  24 Months from date of Award III.  Type of Purchase Order:  Firm Fixed Price (inclusive of all travel costs and fees) IV.  Estimated Labor  Hours:  382 hours for Tasks 1-8 (78 hours for Optional Tasks 9-11) BACKGROUND The Clean Air Act requires periodic review of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS).  As part of this process, the National Center for Environmental Assessment (NCEA) of the U.S. Environmental Protection  Agency (EPA) Office of Research and Development (ORD) reviews and integrates new scientific information for criteria pollutants (viz., particulate matter, O3, Pb, NO2, SOx, and CO) in an Air Quality Criteria Document (AQCD).   On April 30, 1971, the EPA promulgated primary and secondary NAAQS for  NO2 at 0.053 parts per million (ppm), annual average, based on the findings outlined in the 1971 NO2 AQCD.  In 1982, EPA published another AQCD for nitrogen oxides (EPA, 1982), which updated the scientific criteria upon which the initial standards were based. The most recent review of the science  on nitrogen oxides is included in the 1993 Air Quality Criteria for Oxides of Nitrogen (EPA-600/8-91/049cF).  The original NO2 standard remains in effect.  EPA is now in the process of again reviewing the NAAQS for oxides of nitrogen (NOx).  The scientific information historically presented in  the AQCD on NOx will summarized in a Science Assessment Support Document (SASD) and a Science Assessment (SA).  Attachment 1 briefly presents the multi-disciplinary issues that are individually discussed in the SASD and then integrated in the SA.  The first draft of the SASD will reviewed at an  authors review meeting sponsored by the EPA. This draft SASD will be revised to produce an external peer review draft that will be reviewed at a public meeting. Peer review comments will be incorporated in the draft final SASD.  From this, the SA (a concise integrative document) will be prepared as  an external review draft for review by the Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee (CASAC) of the EPA's Science Advisory Board (SAB) and for public comment.  EPA anticipates preparing two drafts of the NO2 SA for public and CASAC review before completion of the final document.   The schedule for  the current review of the NAAQS for NO2 is the subject of ongoing litigation and will eventually be established according to a court-ordered schedule.  The EPA's proposed schedule includes a commitment for completion of the NO2 SA by July 2008.  EPA's proposed schedule also includes a number of  target dates for interim steps in the development of the NO2 SA, including completion of the first draft of the NO2 SA by July 2007. ***Note:  Due to the length of the SOW, Technical Evaluation Criteria, and Attachments, the EPA could not post the entire information to the Fed Biz Ops website.  If  a contractor is interested in this requirement, please submit a request in writing via email to Scott Fogle at fogle.scott@epa.gov requesting an electronic copy of the SOW, Technical Evaluation Criteria and Attachments.

<DESC>The General Services Administration (GSA) is considering whether to remain in its existing lease space or relocate.  In making this decision, GSA will consider, among other things, the costs it would likely incur through relocation, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements, telecommunications infrastructure costs, non-productive agency downtime, security and other appropriate considerations. 

GSA currently leases 18,437 rentable square feet of office space along with thirty (30) on-site, reserved, covered parking spaces in Phoenix, AZ.  This lease is expiring August 31, 2007.  The GSA has an interest in leasing approximately 18,437 rentable square feet of office space of which a minimum of 14,687 ANSI/BOMA office area square feet must be contiguous, along with thirty (30) on-site, reserved, covered parking spaces.  Rentable space must yield a minimum of 17,389 ANSI/BOMA office area square feet.  The considered term of occupancy is ten (10) years, five (5) years firm.  Space must be located in the Central Business Area in Phoenix, Arizona and within these boundaries:  North-Camelback Road; South-Railroad tracks; East-7th Street; and West-7th Avenue.  Space must meet the Federal Government's standards for fire safety; seismic; accessibility; security, and must not be located within a 100-year floodplain.  The minimum contiguous space requirement and the parking requirements will be considered a go/no-go factor during consideration of possible alternatives.

ANNOUNCEMENT TYPE:  Initial announcement.

FUNDING OPPORTUNITY NUMBER: BAA 07-03-IFKA
CFDA Number: 12.800
DATES:  It is recommended that white papers be received by the following dates to maximize the possibility of award:  FY 07 should be submitted by 8 Dec 06; FY 08 by 31 Aug 07; FY 09 by 31 Aug 08 and, FY 10 by 31 Aug 09.  White papers will be accepted until 2:00 p.m. Eastern time on 30 Sep 10, but it is less likely that funding will be available in each respective fiscal year after the dates cited.  FORMAL PROPOSALS ARE NOT BEING REQUESTED AT THIS TIME.  See Section IV of this announcement for further details.

I.  FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:

Background:  The Air Force Research Laboratory Information Directorate (AFRL/IF) is a world recognized leader in the development of moving target tracking and Multiple Source Intelligence (Multi-INT) fusion algorithms.

AFRL/IF has established an in-house Fusion Laboratory for the testing, evaluation and development of Multi-INT tracking and fusion algorithms.  The state-of-the-art laboratory hosts an array of current up-to-date sensor simulations and a large repository of collected real world intelligence data available for use in algorithm development and evaluation.  In the past the laboratory has been used in the evaluation of a number of contractor and government developed tracking and fusion algorithms.  Algorithms are evaluated using a set of metrics developed by AFRL and their contractor partners.  This set of metrics has become the community standard for testing of tracking and fusion algorithms.  The laboratory is also used for the analysis of operational data to identify recurring patterns that can be used in the exploitation of intelligence data.

Through the evaluation of current state-of-the-art Multi-INT tracking and fusion algorithms, AFRL/IF has determined that new methods of data association must be developed to meet the tracking and fusion requirements of the operational community.  Lack of persistent surveillance, large collection gap times, and dense target environments (>3 targets per sensor resolution cell) result in ambiguous association conditions in Multi-INT tracking and fusion algorithms.  AFRL/IF believes that augmenting traditional Multi-INT tracking and fusion algorithms with knowledge and reasoning based association algorithms in difficult tracking environments shows promise to increase the tracking performance in difficult situations.  Technologies the laboratory is interested in developing and evaluating for this problem include knowledge based reasoning and learning, abductive and deductive reasoning, context based association and other heuristic techniques.

Objective:  The objective of this effort is to investigate and evaluate multiple reasoning, knowledge based, and heuristic algorithms against the temporal and spatial association challenges.  Work will include implementation and testing of complete systems, encompassing underlying technologies such as knowledge representation and learning techniques required to provide robust performance.  Data used to perform reasoning and context based association is Multi-INT in nature.  

Research conducted under this program will include application/investigation of knowledge based, reasoning and other heuristic approaches for association.  Other associated technologies required to implement various approaches, such as learning techniques, and knowledge representation and knowledge discovery shall also be considered in scope.  Incremental extensions to target tracking algorithms as well as implementations of new kinematic tracking algorithms will not be considered.

This BAA seeks research efforts that provide innovative technologies supporting new hybrid Multi-INT association algorithms that utilize a reasoning approach to account for large gap times, high density environments and large sensor data inaccuracies.

II.  AWARD INFORMATION:

Total funding for this BAA is approximately $3.0M.  The anticipated funding to be obligated under this BAA is broken out by fiscal year as follows:  FY 07 - $500K; FY 08 - $750K; FY 09 - $1.0M; and FY10 - $750K.  Individual awards will not normally exceed 36 months with dollar amounts ranging between $50,000 to $250,000 per year.   There is also the potential to make awards up to any dollar value.  Awards of efforts as a result of this announcement will be in the form of contracts, grants, or cooperative agreements depending upon the nature of the work proposed.

Individual white paper/proposal evaluations will be evaluated against the evaluation criteria without regard to other white papers and proposals submitted under this BAA.  White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.

2.  REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS:  Only Government employees will evaluate the white papers/proposals for selection.  The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in the administrative support contract, which do not require the review, reading, or comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks."  These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements.  The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals.  Examples of the administrative tasks performed include:  a. Assembling and organizing information for R&D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries.  Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.

VI. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION:

1.  AWARD NOTICES:  Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal.  Notification by email or letter will be sent by the technical POC.  Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract.  Those white papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner.  Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.

All offerors submitting white papers will be contacted by the technical POC, referenced in Section VII of this announcement.  Offerors can email the technical POC for status of their white paper/proposal no earlier than 45 days after proposal submission.

2.  ADMINISTRATIVE AND NATIONAL POLICY REQUIREMENTS:  

Depending on the work to be performed, the offeror may require a top secret and/or secret facility clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to top secret and/or secret information at the time of award.  In addition, the offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility to support work under this BAA.  Data subject to export control constraints may be involved and only firms holding certification under the US/Canada Joint Certification Program (JCP) (www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp) are allowed access to such data.

3.  REPORTING:  Once a proposal has been selected for award, offerors will be required to submit their reporting requirement through one of our web-based reporting systems known as JIFFY or TFIMS.  Prior to award, the offeror will be notified which reporting system they are to use, and will be given complete instructions regarding its use.

<DESC>The Social Security Administration intends to negotiate solely with Sterling Commerce America Inc, 12355 Sunrise Valley Drive, Suite 370, Reston, VA 20191 under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 6.302-1 ?Soliciting from a Single Source? to purchase additional on-site support services for SSA?s eData Services and the Electronic Records Express (ERE) application (formerly known as Electronic Medical Evidence (EME)).  Currently, Sterling is providing on-site programmatic support services at SSA by means of Contract 0600-02-60004.  This contract is due to expire December, 2006.  However, the government underestimated the number of hours needed for the task.  In order to continue support uninterrupted, SSA intends to modify the contract, in order to procure 640 additional hours of IT technical support services from Sterling Commerce, to expand and enhance the Electronic Records Express (ERE) production system, and to prevent development delays for this and associated projects.  Sterling Commerce software is proprietary in nature, and Sterling Commerce Inc retains the exclusive rights to the source code necessary to provide fixes, corrections and updates to the software.  Therefore, Sterling Commerce America, Incorporated is the only known source capable of satisfying SSA?s requirements.  The Government anticipates the award of a modification to the current contract, using firm-fixed price labor rates.  Written responses to this synopsis shall contain sufficient documentation to establish a bonafide capability to fulfill this requirement.  A solicitation is NOT available.  Therefore, written and/or verbal requests for copies of a solicitation related to this announcement will not be honored. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed modification based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  If you have any questions regarding this announcement, please contact the POC identified above BY E-MAIL ONLY.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>BRIEF BACKGROUND

UNAIDS estimates that there are almost two million adults and children living with HIV infection in Latin America and the Caribbean, of whom almost 700,000 are women of childbearing age and children (numbers that are generally regarded as underestimates).  In 2005, fewer that 65,000 adults and children were newly infected with HIV in North America, as compared with almost 180,000 adults and children in Latin American and Caribbean nations.  Lastly, while 73% of all people requiring antiretroviral therapy in Latin America are receiving it, only approximately 8% of children are receiving antiretrovirals and almost 3,000 children in these countries died of AIDS in 2005. 

The epidemiology of perinatal HIV infection has markedly changed over the years with implementation of interventions to prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV, i.e., antiretroviral prophylaxis, cesarean delivery before labor and before rupture of membranes, and complete avoidance of breastfeeding.  Use of highly active combination antiretroviral regimens to treat HIV disease has significantly decreased morbidity and prolonged the life of infected individuals, and when used by HIV-infected pregnant women, may further decrease the risk of mother-to-child transmission.   However, many questions remain. For example, the safety of exposure to combination antiretroviral regimens in pregnant women and their uninfected children, and the long-term effects of potent combination antiretroviral therapy on HIV-infected infants, children, and women, needs to be better defined.  

The goals of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Developments (NICHD) research on pediatric HIV infection include development of improved interventions for prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV, as well as improved treatment of HIV infection and its sequelae in infants, children, adolescents, pregnant women and mothers. NICHD has funded a NICHD International and Domestic Pediatric and Perinatal HIV Clinical Studies Network Coordinating Center to coordinate clinical studies related to HIV infection in these populations.  Westat , a contract research organization located in Rockville, Maryland, U.S.A, has served as this Coordinating Center for over 15 years.  The Coordinating Center has funded a network of clinical sites in the U.S. and other countries enrolling subjects in trials related to preventing and treating HIV infection and its complications in neonates, infants, children, adolescents, and pregnant women.  The network has included sites in the U.S. and more recently, international sites.

Additionally, over the previous 5 years, NICHD has asked the Coordinating Center to expand its international collaborations in countries in Latin America and the Caribbean through funding of two prospective cohort studies in the NICHD International Site Development Initiative (?NISDI?) project, which began enrollment in 2002.  One study enrolled HIV-infected pregnant women and followed these women and their HIV-exposed infants until six months after delivery/birth (the 

NISDI Perinatal study).  Another study enrolled HIV-exposed and HIV-infected infants, children, and adolescents (the NISDI Pediatric study).  

The new NISDI studies will be prospective cohort studies of two different populations: 

Protocol I: a perinatal study to collect data regarding HIV-infected pregnant women through 6 months postpartum and HIV-exposed, uninfected children for up to 5 years of follow up.

Protocol II: a pediatric study to collect data on HIV vertically-infected children less than or equal to 5 years of age (up to 5 years and 364 days old) for up to 5 years of follow up.

The conduct of these prospective, multicenter, observational studies of HIV-infected pregnant women and their HIV-exposed but uninfected children (Protocol I) and of HIV-infected children (Protocol II) at sites in Latin America and the Caribbean will provide critical data about the demographic, clinical, immunologic and virologic characteristics of these populations.  In addition, such studies will provide information about the safety of antiretroviral drugs or other therapies among HIV-infected pregnant women and children and about the safety of in utero and early postnatal exposure to antiretrovirals by HIV-exposed but uninfected children. 

As the NICHD Coordinating Center, Westat's role includes negotiating and managing budgets and subcontracts with clinical centers, participating in protocol and forms development, training clinical center staff, site monitoring, data processing, data analysis, and manuscript preparation.  The NICHD Coordinating Center will serve as the coordinating center for the observational studies to be conducted as specified in this RFP. 

GOALS/RESEARCH OBJECTIVES  

The overall goal of this initiative is to describe HIV-infected pregnant women, HIV-exposed, uninfected children, and HIV-infected children at clinical centers in Latin America and the Caribbean.  Please refer to the attached Abstracts I and II for more specific information regarding these two research studies.  Sites will have the option of proposing to participate in either one or both of these studies. Sites currently participating in the NISDI protocols must reapply to this RFP in order to be eligible to participate in these studies. If sites choose to propose to participate in both studies, only one proposal needs to be submitted to cover both studies. 

NOTICE OF INTENT TO SUBMIT A PROPOSAL
Proposal applicant institutions are requested to complete the Notice of Intent to Submit a Proposal form which is included with this RFP and return it by e-mail or fax to Steven Sokolowski at the address listed on the form by 5:00 p.m. U.S. Eastern Standard Time (USA) on Friday, December 15, 2006.  Although the Notice of Intent is not required, is not binding, and is not part of the review of a subsequent proposal, the information that it contains allows Westat staff to estimate the potential review work involved and avoid conflict of interest in the review process.

<DESC>BRIEF BACKGROUND 

Since 1992, Westat, a contract research organization located in Rockville, Maryland, has served as the coordinating center for the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) Pediatric and Perinatal HIV Studies Network under contract to NICHD.  The coordinating center subcontracts with clinical sites to form the multi-center NICHD Pediatric and Perinatal HIV Studies Network.  This Network consists of domestic and international clinical sites that conduct clinical studies related to treatment and prevention of HIV infection and its complications in infants, children, adolescents and pregnant women, observational HIV studies and selected clinical trials of gender-specific manifestations of HIV infection in non-pregnant women.  


Clinical studies are conducted within the NICHD Network primarily but not solely in collaboration with the International Maternal, Pediatric, and Adolescent AIDS Clinical Trials (IMPAACT) Group funded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and NICHD.  The IMPAACT Scientific committees, in conjunction with the Network Executive Committee (NEC), set the scientific agenda for therapeutic research in children and pregnant women in the U.S. and abroad.  These Committees consist of investigators from IMPAACT, NIAID- and NICHD-funded HIV clinical trials sites, and staff from DAIDS/NIAID and PAMA/NICHD. Additionally, NICHD has developed collaborations outside of IMPAACT such as with the Pediatric European Network for Treatment of AIDS (PENTA), HIV Prevention Trials Network (HPTN), and the Adolescent Trials Network (ATN) to permit the addition of special expertise to answer specific research questions.  


Westat and the Network have participated in over 120 multi-center phase I through IV clinical trials in HIV-exposed and infected infants, and HIV-infected children, adolescents, and pregnant and non-pregnant women.  The current coordinating center contract expires October 31, 2007. Westat has been directed by NICHD to conduct a competitive solicitation of clinical sites for participation in the Network in anticipation that NICHD will continue to support the network of clinical centers in the conduct of HIV studies in these populations.


As the demographics of pediatric and maternal HIV infection have changed over time, the NICHD Network has expanded and modified the number and type of clinical trials sites that form the Network as well as the types of studies being done within the Network.  Initially under this contract, the Network sites included a specialized obstetric component for the conduct of perinatal trials. In 1996 there was a competitive solicitation for new sites with an emphasis on sites with large pediatric/maternal populations that did not have access to clinical trials, and in 1997 the entire NICHD Network underwent a review prior to the coordinating contract recompetition.  In recognition of the global nature of the pediatric and maternal HIV epidemic, the NICHD began an international expansion in 1998 in mid-developing countries in the Caribbean and Latin America, funding 5 sites in Brazil and 1 in the Bahamas.  In 2002, all domestic NICHD-funded clinical sites were recompeted. Currently, the domestic Network consists of 29 centers located in 18 cities in 11 states/territories (including Puerto Rico). 


This Westat-initiated RFP intends to evaluate domestic and international sites for the NICHD Pediatric and Perinatal HIV Studies Network.  Current sites that wish to continue participation in the NICHD Network under the new NICHD contract and potential new sites that have evidence of prior participation in NIH sponsored HIV clinical research studies such as Pediatric AIDS Clinical Trial Group (PACTG)/IMPAACT, NICHD International Site Development Initiative (NISDI), ATN, HPTN perinatal studies (including HPTN040) and Comprehensive International Program of Research on AIDS (CIPRA) studies may respond to this RFP.  Clinical sites participate in the Network as subcontractors to the prime contractor.  They are funded through a fixed price budget that is negotiated annually based on the actual and projected numbers of subjects to be enrolled in protocols and the work to be performed.


GOALS/RESEARCH OBJECTIVES  

The primary goals of the NICHD Pediatric and Perinatal HIV Studies Network and this RFP include:
Evaluating and developing improved interventions to further reduce mother-to-child HIV transmission, particularly for women who are identified very late in pregnancy or at labor and therefore have not received antiretrovirals;
Evaluating the pharmacokinetics and safety of antiretroviral drugs in pregnant, infected women and their neonates, including metabolic and short- and long-term effects of exposure on the women and their infants;
Identifying optimal strategies for timing therapy initiation in antiretroviral-na?ve infants, children, and adolescents; determining when to change therapy in those who are antiretroviral-experienced; and finding optimal treatments for those failing therapy;
Identifying therapies that improve the clinical status, quality of life, and survival of HIV-infected infants, children, and adolescents at all stages of disease, from early asymptomatic infection to end-stage AIDS, including antiretroviral drugs, therapies aimed at reconstitution, and use of therapeutic HIV vaccines;
Identifying therapies or prophylactic regimens that prevent or mitigate the development of serious sequelae of pediatric and adolescent HIV infection, including opportunistic infections, growth abnormalities, neurologic /neurodevelopmental impairments and other complications;
Evaluating the long-term impact of antiretroviral therapy on HIV-infected infants, children, and adolescents, including morbidity and survival, with a particular emphasis  on metabolic toxicities;
Identifying and evaluating gender-specific manifestations of HIV and identifying therapies to treat women-specific manifestations in HIV-infected, non-pregnant women; and
Evaluating the pathogenesis of HIV disease in children and women, and that of perinatal transmission in the context of clinical trials.

Description
The Joint Primary Aircraft Training System (JPATS) Program, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH is surveying the market to determine potential sources qualified to perform JPATS Ground Based Training System (GBTS) Contractor Logistics Support (CLS).  We anticipate a 5 to 10 year contract with support beginning on 01 July 2007.

Anticipated Acquisition Schedule: 
Draft RFP Release                              September 06
Presolicitation Conference                     September 06

Contract Award                                 May       07

BACKGROUND

GBTS was developed and procured as part of the JPATS program with Raytheon Aircraft Corporation (RAC) as the prime contractor.  RAC is currently providing GBTS CLS and is responsible for integration of the T-6A aircraft with GBTS.  The GBTS and associated CLS was developed to support training operations for the maximum student and instructor training load at each training site. The GBTS has three major functional areas:  Courseware, Aircrew Training Devices (ATDs), and the Training Integration Management System (TIMS).

There are five different types of Aircrew Training Devices (ATDs) in training operations.  Three of these are Flight Training Devices used to teach students normal and emergency procedures as defined in the Joint Primary Pilot Training (JPPT) syllabus.  All three utilize the same Central Training Complex (CTC).  This includes a full functioning replica of the T-6 front seat cockpit and the same Instructor Operating Station (IOS).  Each simulator has no motion.  Each has five PC computers that run the IOS, the host, the flight deck I/O, the aural cueing system and the electronic control loading.  The primary difference in the devices is the level of corresponding visual system.  The Unit Training Device (UTD) has no visual system.  The Instrument Flight Trainer (IFT) has a 45 X 33 degree visual and the Operational Flight Trainer has a 270 X 70 degree visual.  Both use the same visual databases and a common Vital 9 or 10 Visual Control Computer and Image Generator.  Both also use forward projection Barco CRT projectors.  The IFT uses one and the OFT uses five.

The other two ATDs are used for teaching emergency and ground egress and include the Egress Procedures Trainer (EPT) and the Ejection Seat Trainer (EST).  The EPT replicates the forward cockpit of the T-6A with non-functioning instruments and a moving stick and throttle.  It also has a canopy that replicates the opening forces of the A/C.  The EST is a standalone mock-up of the A/C ejection seat and allows the student to practice strap-in and ejection procedures.  A student is given an aural indication when ejection has been properly initiated.

The Courseware consists of Developed and Standardized courses and their associated syllabi.  The T-6 Joint Primary Pilot Training (JPPT) student, T-6 Pilot Instructor Training (PIT) and admin courseware (which teaches users how to use the GBTS) are developed courseware.  The courseware was developed using Authorware.  Standardized courses include courseware for other undergraduate training platforms.

TIMS was designed to manage all Air Force and Navy undergraduate flying training programs (T-6, T-37, T-1A, T-38C, T-34, TH-57, etc.)  TIMS operates on Windows 2000 clustered servers, SQL 2000 databases and Windows XP clients.  Portions of TIMS, developed with Microsoft .NET, require an application server.  The core TIMS development environment includes Microsoft Visual Studio .NET (Visual Basic, C++, C# and Java).        

CURRENT ENVIRONMENT

RAC is currently responsible for integration of all GBTS components.

On-Site ATD support is provided at Randolph AFB, Moody AFB, Laughlin AFB, and NAS Pensacola.  At the Air Force locations, the contractor provides required manning, spare parts, and support equipment to meet mission effectiveness of 95%.  There are financial penalties for not meeting the mission effectiveness.  The Government does not own ATD spares at Air Force Locations.  At the Navy location, the contractor provides manning, support equipment and replenishes Government owned spare parts.  Maintenance actions and spare parts usage are tracked using Magic Service Desk.

On-Site TIMS Computer Aided Instruction (CAI) support is provided at Randolph AFB, Moody AFB, Laughlin AFB, Columbus AFB, Vance AFB and Sheppard AFB.  Each of these locations has CLS for the CAI labs and a Helpdesk (takes and responds to calls and walk-ins, enters trouble tickets, performs system administration and database administration, etc.).

Randolph AFB has one CAI lab in bldg. 740
Moody AFB has two CAI labs in bldg. 709
Laughlin AFB has two CAI labs (one right above the other) in bldg. 328
Columbus AFB has two CAI labs in bldg. 230 and 268
Vance AFB has two labs in CAI bldg. 672
Sheppard AFB has one CAI labs in bldg. 2320

Randolph AFB is the central site for the Modification and Update Support System (MUSS) which makes changes and distributes these changes to other GBTS locations.  The MUSS supports:
ATD software and visual database maintenance
Developed courseware (i.e. CAI Graphics, Test Bank Questions, Syllabus Management)
Standardized courseware integration, quality checks, syllabus management and distribution
TIMS software maintenance (additional support provided at contractor location)
Systems and Sustaining engineering (support provided at contractor location)


FOLLOW-ON CLS CHALLENGES AND EXPECTATIONS

The required support will not include on-site ATD maintenance support for the Navy.  Excluding the Navy sites, the total support provided will be no less than the support described in the current environment above.  Support will be required to integrate T-6 and ATD production changes into the fielded GBTS.  TIMS MUSS support will require Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) Level 3 certification as a minimum.  The contract type is anticipated to be fixed price with some T&M effort.

Interested sources should submit information that describes in-house capability and what might be subcontracted.  Provide experience and knowledge of:
1.  Simulator support
2.  Courseware support
3.  Training management systems and IT systems administration
4.  Software certification level
5.  Undergraduate/graduate flying training

If you have already responded to a prior sources sought announcement for this effort, updates may be submitted to address any changes contained herein.  Any comments to the documents for this effort may be addressed to the contracts representative, Ms. Lisa Adams, Lisa.Adams@wpafb.af.mil, or Mr. Marcus Duff, Marcus.Duff@wpafb.af.mil.

Information contained in this synopsis is for information and planning purposes only.  It does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) and it is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.

<DESC>The U.S. Coast Guard is considering whether or not to set aside an acquisition for HUBZone concerns or for Service-Disabled Veteran-owned Small Business concerns.  The small business size standard is less than 1,000 employees.  The acquisition is to repairs to a 26 Pontoon Floating Dock at Keokuk Iowa. The contractor will be responsible to transport the dock in sections to their facility to perform the work.  The performance period is FIFTY-SIX (56) calendar days and is expected to begin on or about 21 May 2007.  The scope of the acquisition is for the overhauling, renewing and repairing of various items on the floating dock at Keokuk Iowa.  This work will include, but is not limited to:  Transport dock section to and from home port; Renew sewage Tank Pump Unit; Preserve Underwater Body; Preserve Weather Deck Surfaces; Inspect Various Deck Fittings; Renew Dock Marking and Pier Lights; Install Sewage Line Discharge Pipe; Routine Drydocking; Preserve Pontoon Interiors and Sewage Tank; and Inspect Power Panels and Main Line Feed.  Trained welders, who have been certified by the applicable regulatory code performance qualification procedures, shall accomplish all welding and brazing.  At the present time, it is expected that the acquisition will be issued as a small business set aside.  However, in accordance with FAR 19.1305 if your firm is HUBZone certified or a Service-Disabled Veteran-owned Small Business and intends to submit an offer on this acquisition, please respond by e-mail to dawn.j.dabney@uscg.mil or by fax at (757) 628-4676.  Questions may be referred to Dawn J. Dabney at (757) 628-4636.  In your response you must include: (a) a positive statement of your intention to submit a bid for this solicitation as a prime contractor; (b) evidence of experience in work similar in type and scope to include contract numbers, project titles, dollar amounts, points of contact and telephone numbers; (c) past performance references with points of contact and telephone numbers; and (d) if your company does not own the drydock, a letter of commitment from the company providing the drydock committing to provide the drydock during the time period of this availability.  At least two references are requested, but more are desirable.  Your response is required by November 30, 2006.  Contractors are reminded that should this acquisition become a HUBZone set aside, FAR 52.219-3, Notice of Total HUBZone Set-aside, will apply, which requires that at least 50 percent of the cost of personnel for contract performance be spent for employees of the concern.   Contractors are also reminded that should this acquisition become a Service-Disabled Veteran-owned Small Business set aside, FAR 52.219-27, Notice of Total Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business Set-Aside, will apply, which requires that at least 50 percent of the cost of personnel for contract performance be spent for employees of the concern.  All of the above must be submitted in sufficient detail for a decision to be made on a HUBZone set-aside or Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business set-aside.  Failure to submit all information requested may result in Small Business set-aside acquisition.  A decision on whether this will be pursued as a HUBZone Small Business set-aside, a Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business set-aside or a Small Business set-aside, will be posted in FedBizOpps website at http://www.eps.gov.

<DESC>Request for Information (RFI) #1
Date:  16 November 2006


THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS NOT A NOTICE OF SOLICITATION ISSUANCE.  THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) FOR PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY.  This RFI is issued for the purpose of developing a viable solicitation that will best communicate the Government's requirements to industry. Response to this RFI is strictly voluntary and will not affect any corporation's ability to submit an offer if and when a solicitation is released. There is no bid package or solicitation document associated with this announcement. The requested information is for planning purposes and does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that a procurement action will be issued. No entitlement to payment by the Government of direct or indirect costs or charges will arise as a result of the submission of contractors' information. The Government shall not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for any improperly identified proprietary information. Proprietary information will be safeguarded in accordance with the applicable Government regulations.

GENERAL INFORMATION.  The Air Force Center for Environmental Excellence (AFCEE), Brooks City-Base, TX, is planning to contract with Architect-Engineer (A&E) firms to perform worldwide Title I, Title II, and other A&E services to administer, coordinate, and technically support Environmental, Military Family Housing (MFH), Military Construction (MILCON), and Sustainment, Restoration and Maintenance (SRM) programs of interest to the government.  We anticipate multiple award Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts using NAICS code 562910.  The small business size standard associated with this NAICS code is 500 employees.    We currently anticipate awarding approximately 15-20 contracts to large and small businesses.  All sub-categories of small businesses are being looked at during our market research phase.  At this time, we are considering that task orders under these contracts will be negotiated as either Time & Materials (T&M) or Firm Fixed Price (FFP) depending on the nature of the requirement.  Additionally, we currently anticipate that each contract will have a basic ordering period of five (5) years with three additional years for performance.  Central Contract Registration (CCR) will be mandatory for these contracts (see CCR website at www.ccr.gov).

BACKGROUND AND PROGRAM INFORMATION.  These IDIQ contracts will serve to functionally replace and expand services contained within AFCEE?s existing Worldwide Planning, Program, and Design (4P A-E) contracts whose current ordering period will expire during the Jan - Jun 2008 timeframe.  In general, the existing 4P A-E SOW scope remains applicable to services contemplated for the future.  However, scope modifications are contemplated in the following areas:
	
?	Expanded MFH Title I and II Services
?	Expanded MILCON Title I and II Services
?	New/expanded SRM Title I and II Services
?	Continued General Information Management System Support Services (however, will eliminate procurement of Information Technology Systems)

ANTICIPATED GENERAL SCOPE OF SERVICES
To provide Title I, Title II, and Other A-E Services for environmental and traditional (Housing, MILCON, and SRM) projects.  The anticipated scope includes support in the following existing and emerging program areas:

?	Title I Services:  Title I services include all aspects of design such as preparation and/or review of contract plans, specifications, scheduling, cost estimates, building commissioning services and preparation of operating and design manuals.  Title I efforts also encompass those efforts required to support and develop design work, including planning and programming, program management, project scoping, studies, investigations, evaluations, consultations, conceptual design, value engineering, and operation, monitoring, topographic survey services, and optimization of environmental treatment or control systems
 
?	Title II Services:  Title II services include all aspects of construction quality assurance and oversight of environmental and facility construction projects

?	Environmental Restoration:  Support the Environmental Restoration mission.  Major activities supported include A&E support for remedial investigation, remedial design, long-term maintenance operations, and long-term monitoring (LTM). Interim remedial actions (IRAs) may be infrequently required to reduce or limit an immediate threat to human health or the environment.   In addition, support includes technical oversight of environmental programs, laboratory quality assurance assessments, document reviews, and assistance in selecting remediation technologies

?	Environmental Conservation and Planning:  Support the Environmental Conservation and Planning mission.  Major activities supported include A&E support on the Environmental Impact Analysis Process (EIAP), natural infrastructure assessment and management, environmental management, natural and cultural resource programs, and comprehensive planning programs.  In addition, support environmental impact statements, baseline surveys, forestry, wildlife, archeology, Native American consultations, transportation, air space and range management, and noise programs

?	Environmental Quality:  Support the Environmental Quality mission.  Major activities supported include A&E support for compliance and pollution-prevention programs, environmental education and training, sustainable development, environmental management systems, and the Environmental Compliance Assessment and Management Program (ECAMP) 

?	Design and Construction:  Support the Design and Construction mission.  Major activities supported include A&E support related to standards, criteria and publications development, facility design, construction management, building commissioning, LEED analysis, interior design, landscape architecture, the Military Family Housing (MFH) and MFH Privatization program.  Also, support the development, testing, and documentation of new project management acquisition and construction methodologies   

?	Plans and Programs:  Major activities may include A&E support for defining housing market areas, detailed market research and analysis, development of housing requirements, pre-planning studies, detailed inspections and assessments of existing family housing and dormitories, development of programming guides for project scoping and the development of housing and dormitory investment strategies that integrate and prioritize, traditional housing construction and operations and maintenance (O&M) funding with private sector financing  

?	Other Areas of Support and Emerging Markets:  Support AFCEE with other areas of support and emerging markets.  Additional activities may include A&E support on Defense Energy Support Center (DESC) fuel facilities, unexploded ordnance (UXO), force protection, sustainable design, general information management system support services, and project delivery methods 

The final decision for inclusion of any requirements has not been made.

1.	Would you be interested in submitting a proposal considering the anticipated scope of work items?  If not, why?

2.	In reference to 1 above, do you have sufficient experience in the anticipated scope items that would allow the evaluator to assess your capability?  If not, please explain.

3.	What is the minimum and maximum dollar value project on which your firm would routinely consider submitting a proposal?

4.	What maximum capacity of work can your firm reasonably manage while assuring effective program/project implementation and maintaining quality products?

6.	 If you are a small business, would you consider submitting a proposal as a prime contractor?

7.	In what socio-economic programs do you now participate (e.g. Mentor Prot?g?, Indian Incentive, etc.)?  What is the extent of your participation in these programs?

8.	What are the most critical criteria that would distinguish one company?s capabilities from another?  Explain

9.	Address capability of performing both CONUS and OCONUS requirements versus limiting to one or the other.  Please provide recommendations.

For small business consideration, would your firm be able to compete under NAICS 562910?  If not, why? Please provide your recommendations concerning the anticipated number of contract awards, how many contracts should be reserved for small business, and the proposed NAICS. 

13.	If the Government were to contemplate splitting these A&E service requirements into two suites of IDIQ contracts (one covering environmental A&E services and one covering housing, MILCON, and SRM Title I and II services), what are your thoughts and/or concerns?

14.	For Market Research purposes, we are planning to host an Industry Forum.  What format do you think would be most beneficial for this Forum, what topics would you like to hear discussed, and what number of people would you envision sending?

<DESC>The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, is conducting a market survey to seek potential sources from qualified small business firms under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 516110 Internet Publishing and Broadcasting (500 people) which have the capability to migrate, operate, maintain, enhance, and evaluate two existing yet related AHRQ Internet repositories of evidence-based information and associated companion materials.  These are: the National Guideline Clearinghouse (tm) (NGC), www.guideline.gov, for evidence-based clinical practice guidelines; and the National Quality Measures Clearinghouse (tm) (NQMC), www.qualitymeasures.ahrq.gov, for evidence-based quality measures and measure sets. These Web resources have a database-backend, are indexed and searchable, and adhere to Health on the Net (HON)code ethics. Relationships between the two databases and Web sites that have already been established will be maintained. For this solicitation, each repository will retain its unique URL and name.

Content in NGC and NQMC is presented in a standardized format using a template of attributes relevant to each Clearinghouse. This format permits side-by-side comparison of database content online. All guidelines in NGC and all quality measures in NQMC meet specific inclusion criteria. NGC has two additional content items: syntheses and Annotated Bibliographies. NQMC has browse features not available in NGC.  NGC has search features not available in NQMC. The project is content driven supported by information technology.  While there are information technology components in the project, it is not IT driven. Content on both the NGC and NQMC must be evaluated against evidence-based practice standards separate and apart from IT standards.

The goal of these two Clearinghouses is to provide physicians, nurses, and other health professionals, health care providers, health plans, integrated delivery systems, purchasers and others an accessible mechanism for obtaining objective, detailed information on clinical practice guidelines and quality measures and to further their dissemination, implementation and use in order to inform health care decisions.

This project will develop, deploy and maintain the processes and systems to collect, abstract, index, publish, update and archive clinical practice guidelines and quality measures. Implementation or evaluation tools associated with the submitted guidelines or measures will be identified and shared as potential content for AHRQ?s QualityTools with that Contractor. The guidelines and measures will be evaluated, extracted, entered and stored in a Contractor-migrated or constructed database; they will be posted to the existing Web site that would be migrated to the Contractor. 

Early in this project's life cycle, the Contractor will make recommendations to AHRQ on enhancements to each Web site (content, functionality, design), and following a systems development life cycle and configuration management plan, conduct usability tests, and through an iterative process refine the enhancements, test, eventually deploy, operate, maintain and assess customer satisfaction. 

Related content tasks include establishing a single expert panel and a single editorial board with capacity to offer guidance to both projects, propose revisions to the established content inclusion criteria and templates of attributes. The expert panel will guide the Clearinghouses on broad project areas, and will participate in approval of revisions to the inclusion criteria and standardized template. 

The Editorial Board will work with the content teams in key aspects of content development and production, such as, but not limited to, reviewing submissions against the inclusion criteria and judging how new or emerging knowledge in the clinical practice guideline and quality measurement fields could be acted upon.  The Editorial Board will also serve to assist in the development of recommendations on what information to seek from submitters in an online submission form (not currently available) and on how to enhance the user?s experience with the content currently posted, fill content gaps, and manage posting of user comments to the Web site, including responses from relevant guideline or measure developer organizations much like that done for scientific journals. 

The Web sites shall continue to be user-centered and meet requirements of the E-Government Act of 2002, including ensuring information quality, following Department of Health and Human Services -wide policies, communicating with the public and following the Paperwork Reduction Act, using the approved domains, implementing security controls, protecting privacy, maintaining accessibility, and managing records and documentation. 

Sources must demonstrate expertise in developing, appraising, implementing and using evidence-based clinical practice guidelines and quality measures; developing or evaluating and integrating informatics in efforts related to health services research, clinical practice guidelines or quality measures; expertise in indexing using the National Library of Medicine?s Unified Medical Language System; complex database and government Web-site development and maintenance; and, managing and working with expert panels and editorial boards. In addition, Sources must demonstrate expertise in developing and managing complex content driven projects under tight timelines.  

Sources must demonstrate personnel are seasoned professionals with education and proven experience with successful results in areas such as development, implementation, use, and evaluation of clinical practice guidelines and quality measures; development of clinically related classifications schemes and use of National Library of Medicine?s Unified Medical Language system; working with developers of clinical practice guidelines and quality measure, as well as, clinical organizations, including but not limited to hospitals, health plans, and medical specialty societies; completing highly technical and complex projects; migrating and constructing large relational databases; migrating and developing user-friendly Government Web sites. A  PMI-certified or PMI-certification-eligible Project Manager is required as well as a demonstrated ability to provide EVM information.  

 Interested small businesses should submit their capability statements (no more than 10 pages in length) to Mary Haines, Contracting Officer, Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, Division of Contracts Management, 540 Gaither Rd, Rockville, Maryland 20850, no later than 12 noon pm eastern standard time, on November 29, 2006.

<DESC>It is the Department of Army's intention to award a modification for additional computer equipment and audio and video equipment on award W81XWH-04-P-0299 to Capitol IT Solutions. The SOW is to expand the provision of network operations and engineering support and other advanced infrastructure services, maintenance, and support to a metropolitan, Los Angeles, California bases TATRC field office charged with helping manage congress ionally- mandated, advanced medical technology projects being executed by partner organizations located on the West Coast and in the Pacific basin.  This modification is to upgrade the systems for the West Coast TATRC office.  The office needs 8 new high-e nd laptops for lease to TATRC to fill the requirements for the staffing increase.  These machines are required to be configured in a similar manner to the systems located at TATRCs main office in Fort Detrick for DITSCAP.  The VTC equipment needs to have an ISDN connection, which requires the use of an NTI network device.  The audio and video equipment will be used for presentations.  The Plasma and LCD screens are used for in-house meeting and for VTC meetings.  The Projector is used for when the number o f participants requires the use of an off-site facility.  The two audio receivers are to be used for in-house meetings.  The printers are used for documents and presentations; the staff for day-to-day activities and communications uses the mobile devices.  If another company can provide this product please respond by email to Michelle.Maldonado@det.amedd.army.mil by close of business November 30,2006.

<ARCHDATE>02132007
<CONTACT>Pamela J. Locke, 703/325-5779
<DESC>Sources are being sought for the commercial item availability of Active Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) equipment.  The Government has developed a Technical Specification Package to support the procurement of Commercial Off-the-Shelf ISO 18000. 7 standard compliant Active RFID tags and readers.  Detailed specifications of the major high-volume equipment components (transponders and fixed / hand-held interrogators) are intended to provide competition in the DoD Supply Chain In-Transit Visibility m arket by allowing commercial manufacturers access to open electrical and mechanical reference documents that have been produced to assist industry in their commercial item efforts.  This approach will enable the Government to competitively procure the spec ified active RFID products and associated services to foster competition for this technology.  A Technical Specification Package is available as a guide to vendors upon request from the PM J-AIT POC, Mr. Jay Gulati, (703) 339-400, ext 109, email jagjit.gul ati@us.army.mil  by providing company name, point of contact (POC), mailing address, telephone number, and email address.   Specifically, the Government is considering a follow-on competitive contract to RFID-II Contract DABL01-03-D-1002 (contract and specification information available on ITEC4 web site http://www.cecomacw.army.mil under awarded contracts) to include alternate  sources of supply for the specified Active RFID equipment.  The current requirement for the active RFID data rich transponders, at a minimum, shall include but are not limited to a memory size of 128 Kbytes, unobstructed read distance of at least 300 feet , battery life of four years, and operate at an FCC approved 433.92 Mhz frequency.  In addition, transponders with sensor (humidity, temperature, shock, light) data capture and reporting out-of-tolerance incidence are also required.  The requirement includ es the availability of handheld and fixed interrogators (readers) also. The products must be sufficiently mature (minimally a prototype) to verify full functionality and be fully compliant with the ISO 18000.7 standard.  The contractors shall address the Intellectual Property (IP) rights, on a reasonable and non-discriminatory  basis, specified in the standard with the appropriate IP license holder.  Government does not have the IP rights and shall not provide any IP to the contractors.  The products shall not be considered compliant with ISO 18000.7 standard without the use of IP specified in the standard.  The commercial item products shall include firmware and physical form that can pass hazards of electromagnetic radiation to ordnance (HERO) testing by Navy lab at Dahlgren.  All items shall be capable to operate in the worldw ide physically harsh environment inherent in current and future DoD deployments. At this time, the Government is requesting information related to the above requirement; this is NOT a Request for Proposals (RFP).  Information is sought regarding contractor capabilities to demonstrate the availability of products meeting the technical s pecifications no later than 31 March 2007.  The demonstration to ensure ISO 18000.7 compliance and interoperability with standard based transponder and interrogator shall take place at AIT Laboratory located at Tobyhanna, PA.   Potential sources for this r equirement are requested to provide the following information:  1)  A description of their capability for providing the required Active RFID transponder and interrogator; 2)  a summary of prior experience in providing active RFID products; 3)  a commitment  to participate in a product demonstration to Government timeline; 4)  a description of current active RFID offerings; 5) certification that the products demonstrated are fully compliant with ISO 18000.7 standard; 6)  a description of any specification and  air protocol issues; 7) product information and relevant GSA Schedule information, if available; 8)  addresses of Internet Web sites containing relevant information; 9) pricing information for all products; 10) CAGE Code; 11) type of business, e.g., small business, small disadvantaged business or a woman owned small business, veteran owned business, manufacturer, etc., and 12) whe ther their firm is registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database (http://www.ccr.gov/).  Potential sources are further requested to limit their response to 20 pages, excluding any attachments and pricing information.   Potential sources are requested to electronically deliver the above information to the following addressees no later than 15 December 06:  Anthony.jackson21@us.army.mil, joseph.zagursky@us.army.mil, jagjit.gulati@us.army.mil, and pamela.locke@us.army.mil.

<SUBJECT>A -- TECHNOLOGY/BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY Multi-Well Sample Plate Cover Penetration System for Automated Reagent Mixing and Aspiration
<DESC>TECHNOLOGY/BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY

Multi-Well Sample Plate Cover Penetration System
for Automated Reagent Mixing and Aspiration

Opportunity: Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by the University of California under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), is offering the opportunity to commercialize its multi-well sample plate cover penetration system for automated reagent mixing.

Background: Automation platforms employ sample arrays that need access but must be protected from well-to-well cross contamination. Current accepted standard laboratory protocols are concerned with a proven cross contamination vector of the plate-sealing-tape removal process. The tape is currently peeled back from the entire plate by hand, generating adhesive strings that cross wells, aerosolize solvents and analytes, and can contaminate other open wells. Additionally, the manual tape removal process can jostle the wells, spilling and mixing products into adjacent wells. Currently, to circumvent these issues, much slower and more time consuming processes are performed instead of tape sealing such as removal of samples from the plate and processing with individual capillary tubes which is a tremendous disadvantage in both time and expense. Or, entire rows and columns are left unused to reduce sample proximity, which doubles the number of plates required and similarly increases the analysis time.

Description:  LLNL?s multi-well plate cover penetration system is an array cutting and tape folding tool, based on 96-well, 384-well, and 1536-well geometries, that can be robotically operated and will cut, open, and fold inward the sealing tape so that samples can be subsequently aspirated without the need for human intervention to remove the seal which is an aerosol generating and contaminating process). To view a diagram of the system go to: http://www.llnl.gov/IPandC/technology/profile/announcement/MultiWellSamplePlateCover.php

Advantages:  This device will eliminate cross contamination and automate another step in the experimental protocol, improving accuracy while reducing both time and expense.

    (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
    Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting ?more than 50 percent? for ?at least 80 percent? each place it appears. 
    Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395 would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.

    (1)  The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
    (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity 
is held? 
In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
    (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
    (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliate. 
    Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
    (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
    (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
    (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign 
incorporated entity; or 
    (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).    
    (2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
    (3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purpose of this section.
    (d) Special rule for related partnerships.  For purposes of applying section 835(b) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b) to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 
    (e) Treatment of Certain Rights.

    (ii) Options; 
    (iii) Contracts to acquire stock;

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

<DESC>The following are questions received in response to the subject RFQ, and answers.  Please read carefully.  There are no extensions as a result of these questions and answers.  Thank you for your interest.

1)	Does CLIN 0001 have a reserved budget amount?  If so, what is that amount?

Answer:  That is a Government Estimate that NIST is not obliged to share.

2)	The solicitation states that the NIST will provide the contractor with a list of names of customers and stakeholders as well as their contact information.  How many names for each group (customers vs. stakeholders) are available? Are personal names and emails included as part of this contact information?  How current is the list of customers and stakeholders to be provided?

Answer:  We don?t separate the list into 2 separate groups (customers and stakeholders).  The total list size is about 1,795.  Names and emails are included.  We update the information quarterly.  Next update is December 2006.

In addition we will provide approximately 1,000 names/emails that are not part of our customer/stakeholder database.

3)	Do you wish to break down customers and stakeholders into any other relevant subgroups?

Answer:  Yes, we want to have demographic questions on the survey that enable respondents to select their appropriate group.

4)	Will NIST require a URL, with all of the research into potential domain names, as part of the deliverables? 

Answer:  No.

5)	Will NIST also require a trademark, with the necessary legal background research, as part of the deliverables? 

Answer:  We will not require that our chosen name be trademarked but we will require the vendor to conduct the necessary background research to ensure that names proposed to us are not already trademarked.

6)	Is a brand audit, to understand competitors of Baldrige, part of the project scope? 

No.

7)	The RFP phrase, deadlines noted in Section 5 appears in Section 3. Deliverable Due Dates and Period of Performance, and in Section 5. Monitoring Methods/Performance Standards.  Please confirm the appropriate section number for deadlines.  

Answer:  Section 4

8)	Under the RFPs Quotation Evaluation Factors, the second-to-last paragraph does not identify any Applicable National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) clauses please confirm.

Answer:  Yes.  We will add the following two NIST clauses:

1.  NIST LOCAL_04 Billing Instructions
(a)The Contractor shall submit an original invoice or voucher in
accordance with the payments provisions of this contract to:
 NIST
 Accounts Payable Office
 100 Bureau Drive, Mail Stop 1621
 Gaithersburg, MD 20899-1621
 FAX Number:  301-975-8283
 Email:  invoice@nist.gov
 (b)Each invoice or voucher submitted shall include the following:
 (1)Contract Number.
 (2)Contractor Name and Address.
 (3)Date of Invoice.
 (4)Invoice Number.
 (5)Amount of Invoice, and cumulative amount invoiced to-date.
 (6)Contract Line Item Number (CLIN).
 (7)Description, quantity, unit of measure, unit price, and extended
price of supplies/services delivered.
 (8)Prompt payment discount terms, if offered.
 (9)Any other information or documentation required by the contract.
 (END OF CLAUSE)

2.  NIST LOCAL_36 Travel Note
(a) The government will reimburse the contractor for all necessary expenses
in connection with travel authorized pursuant to this order/contract. Costs
incurred for lodging, meals, and incidental expenses shall be considered to
be reasonable and allowable only to the extent that they do not exceed on a
daily basis the maximum per diem rates in effect at the time of travel as
set forth in the Federal Travel Regulations prescribed by the General
Services Administration.
(b) Subsistence is authorized in accordance with the DoC and Federal
Travel Regulations.  Invoices requesting reimbursement for travel must be
accompanied by itemized paid receipts.  The invoices must be submitted to
the payment office specified elsewhere in this order/contract.
(END OF CLAUSE)

9)	The RFP footer refers to Government-wide Numbered Notes.  Please confirm which Numbered Note(s), if any, shall apply to this RFP.

Answer:  None.

10)	What is the professional level of the potential respondents? (Please
give examples of the titles of the contacts.)

Answer:  The respondents will include middle to senior level officials of U.S. business, healthcare, government, nonprofit, and education organizations.  Examples include Directors of various functions (e.g. Quality, HR, Organizational Development) Vice Presidents of various functions, and C-Level officials including CEOs, Superintendents, Executive Directors, etc.

11)	Will the list of potential respondents have direct telephone numbers
and e-mail addresses?

Answer:  The list will have email addresses, but not phone numbers.

12)	Does everyone on the list qualify for the survey? 

Answer:  Yes.

13)	Is this a blind study or can we reveal the sponsorship?

Answer:  It is not blind.  You can reveal sponsorship.

14)	What are the minimum quotas that are acceptable?

Answer:  If you mean survey response rates, we want a statistically representative sample for the overall survey populations (not necessarily for the segments within the overall populations).  If you mean numbers of names to consider, we would want a fair number (at least 5-10) to consider, provided the potential names are supported by the research.

15)	Is there any incumbent/ consultant already working on this project?

Answer:  No.

16)	Typically, government gives 30 days to respond to proposals.  Whys do we have only about 14 days on this one? 

Answer:  If this procurement was being conducted under FAR Part 15 procedures then you would be correct; 30 days would be the minimum response time.  However, this procurement is being conducted under FAR Part 12, as supplemented by Part 13, which does not have the same limitation.  Our reason for a shorter response time is that we believe that the given time is sufficient and we would like to move quickly on this project.

17)	Can we bring another partner (from large company) to partner with us. 

Answer:  No.  It is a small business set aside.

18)	What is the size of the customer and stakeholder database.  

Approximately 1,795 names.  Plus we will provide an additional list of approximately 1,000 names that are not in our customer database.

19)	How current is the database? 

Answer:  Updated quarterly.  Next update December 2006.

20)	Do you want a study on the brand or do you really want a market analysis on programs to implement quality standards?

Answer:  We are conducting a study to determine the value and equity of the Baldrige brand, as perceived by our customers and stakeholders, and to identify proposed new names that accurately reflect these perspectives.  It is not pure market analysis, per se, but the new name will clearly reflect the data we obtain from our stakeholders.

21)	Please define target audience in terms of customers and stakeholders, i.e., titles, job responsibilities etc.

Answer:  See answer to question 10.

22)	Please identify a targeted number of completed quantitative surveys to be administered.

Answer:  We want to administer the survey to our complete list of customers and stakeholders, approximately 1,795 names, plus we will provide an additional 1,000 names that are not part of our database.  In terms of response rates, we want a statistically representative sample for the overall survey population.

23)	Please confirm if customers and stakeholders will be eligible for an incentive to participate in the research and if so, what range of compensation would be appropriate i.e. $25.00 to $50.00, less, more?

Answer:  No compensation will be provided for participating.
