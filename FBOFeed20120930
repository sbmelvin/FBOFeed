<DESC>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. This is a notice of intent to award a purchase order to a single source under the Federal Acquisition Regulation authority specified at 13.106-1(b) Soliciting from a single source.
<p>The 2nd Special Operations Squadron (2SOS) requires the use of one 12'x60' trailer, one 24'x60' trailer and two 36' x 60' trailers, from 1 December 2012 through 30 November 2013. The 99th Contracting Squadron intends to satisfy this requirement by making a single source award to Modular Space Corporation, 1200 Swedesford Road, Berwyn, PA 19312. Modular Space Corporation is currently under contract FA4861-10-M-L002 for this requirement. The current contract expires 30 November 2012. The current trailer is located in a secure facility at Nellis AFB, NV 89191 that does not provide enough space to place additional trailers at the location prior to removing the current units. The 2SOS cannot stand down operations without unacceptable mission disruption, to allow for the replacement of the existing trailer. The contracting officer has determined that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available.<br />Any questions regarding this acquisition should be directed to the Contract Specialist, Mr. Mark Garrison at marka.garrison@nellis.af.mil.</p>

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT
<p>The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), intends to issue a firm-fixed price, sole source contract to Maiden Rock for the design development and delivery of prototype units of Meteor Burst Remote Radios.</p>
<p>This procurement is being conducted under Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Part 6.302-1 (a) (2) (ii) (A), Only One Responsible Source and no other Supplies will Satisfy Agency Requirements.</p>
<p>Currently the National Water and Climate Center (NWCC) collects data from multiple meteor burst master stations in order to obtain remote station data from SNOTEL and SCAN and is in need of additional work items for the existing SNOTEL system MRC520X. This work includes prototype PCA for FCC testing, test reports, and submittal for FCC acceptance. It also, includes upgrading the prototype PCA's to production PCA's, incorporating changes to PCA's resulting from factory settings and incorporating changes to all metal work drawings resulting from factory and field testing. Estimated value of services is $80,000.</p>
<p>The SNOTEL system is the largest meteor burst remote data collection system in the world. Meteorburst transmitters are the primary source for transmitted SNOTEL and SCAN data used in essential engineering research and development projects with field applications throughout the USDA-NRCS. The 520X radio and all connecting power and communication cables transmit data collected from Soil Climate Analysis stations and SNOTEL stations across the United States. All remote station radios operate against this proprietary operating system and were manufactured by MCC who has transferred the rights to Maiden Rock. To compete this award would create substantial duplication of costs in which the Government is not expected to recover.</p>
<p>This is not a request for Competitive Proposals. No contract will be awarded on the basis of offers received in response to this notice. A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon the responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. This is a notice and a solicitation will not be issued. NRCS will not respond to requests for solicitation copies and will not pay for information received in response to this announcement. No solicitation document is available. The associated North America Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 811213 and the Business Size Standard is 500 employees.</p>

The Service Contract Act of 1965 and all wage determinations applicable for the location of the proposed hotel facility will be made a part of any resulting award if FAR clause 52.222-41 is determined to be applicable.  The successful offeror will establish with the Veterans Administration a Business Associate Agreement in accordance with Veterans Healthcare Administration Directive 1600 and Handbook 1600.01 Business Associate Agreements.

This BPA will be established on a fixed price basis and may be discontinued upon 30 days' written notice by either party.

This BPA can only be changed by modification of the agreement itself.  Discontinuing or modifying this BPA shall not affect any prior contract incorporating this BPA.  This BPA does NOT state or imply any agreement by the Government to place future contracts or orders with the contractor; or be used in any manner to restrict competition.  All contracts and purchase orders using this BPA will be incorporated by specific reference, the BPA number and name when established.  This BPA for temporary lodging services located within the local commuting area of the facility listed in this synopsis has a dollar limitation of $1000 for each individual purchase of lodging services.  This BPA does not have a minimum purchase requirement.  The Government is obligated only to the extent of authorized purchases actually made under this BPA.

The physical location of the proposed hotel facility must be provided to permit a determination to be made as if minimum requirement (3) can be met. Pricing shall be provided on attached B.2 Schedule of Services/Pricing.

(b) Title Page and Front Matter. The title page shall include the equipment nomenclature, model number, effective date of the manual and the manufacturer's name and address. If the manual applies to a particular version of the equipment only, the title page shall also list that equipment's serial number. Front matter shall consist of the Table of Contents, List of Tables, List of Illustrations and a frontispiece (photograph or line drawing) depicting the equipment.    (c) Section I, General Description. This section shall provide a generalized description of the equipment or devices and shall describe its purpose or intended use. Included in this section will be a table listing all pertinent equipment specifications, power requirements, environmental limitations and physical dimensions. <BR> <BR>(d) Section II, Installation. Section II shall provide pertinent installation information. It shall list all input and output connectors using applicable reference designators and functional names as they appear on the equipment. Included in this listing will be a brief description of the function of each connector along with the connector type. Instructions shall be provided as to the recommended method of repacking the equipment for shipment (packing material, labeling, etc.).    (e) Section III, Operation. Section III will fully describe the operation of the equipment and shall include a listing of each control with a brief description of its function and step-by-step procedures for each operating mode. Procedures will use the control(s) nomenclature as it appears on the equipment and will be keyed to one or more illustrations of the equipment. Operating procedures will include any preoperational checks, calibration adjustments and operation tests. Notes, cautions and warnings shall be set off from the text body so they may easily be recognizable and will draw the attention of the reader. Illustrations should be used wherever possible depicting equipment connections for test, calibration, patient monitoring and measurements. For large, complex and/or highly versatile equipment capable of many operating modes and in other instances where the Operation Section is quite large, operational information may be bound separately in the form of an Operators Manual. The providing of a separate Operators manual does not relieve the supplier of his responsibility for providing the minimum acceptable maintenance data specified herein. When applicable, flow charts and narrative descriptions of software shall be provided. If programming is either built-in and/or user modifiable, a complete software listing shall be supplied. Equipment items with software packages shall also include diagnostic routines and sample outputs. Submission information shall be given in the Maintenance Section to identify equipment malfunctions that are software related.    (f) Section IV, Principles of Operation. This section shall describe in narrative form the principles of operation of the equipment. Circuitry shall be discussed in sufficient detail to be understood by technicians and engineers who possess a working knowledge of electronics and a general familiarity with the overall application of the devices. The circuit descriptions should start at the overall equipment level and proceed to more detailed circuit descriptions. The overall description shall be keyed to a functional block diagram of the equipment. Circuit descriptions shall be keyed to schematic diagrams discussed in paragraph (i) below. It is recommended that for complex or special circuits, simplified schematics should be included in this section. <BR> <BR>(g) Section V, Maintenance. The maintenance section shall contain a list of recommended test equipment, special tools, preventive maintenance instructions and corrective information. The list of test equipment shall be that recommended by the manufacturer and shall be designated by manufacturer and model number. Special tools are those items not commercially available or those that are designed specifically for the equipment being supplied. Sufficient data will be provided to enable their purchase by the Department of Veterans Affairs. Preventive maintenance instructions shall consist of those recommended by the manufacturer to preclude unnecessary failures. Procedures and the recommended frequency of performance shall be included for visual inspection, cleaning, lubricating, mechanical adjustments and circuit calibration. Corrective maintenance shall consist of the data necessary to troubleshoot and rectify a problem and shall include procedures for realigning and testing the equipment. Troubleshooting shall include either a list of test points with the applicable voltage levels or waveforms that would be present under a certain prescribed set of conditions, a troubleshooting chart listing the symptom, probable cause and remedy, or a narrative containing sufficient data to enable a test technician or electronics engineer to determine and locate the probable cause of malfunction. Data shall also be provided describing the preferred method of repairing or replacing discrete components mounted on printed circuit boards or located in areas where special steps must be followed to disassemble the equipment. Procedures shall be included to realign and test the equipment at the completion of repairs and to restore it to its original operating condition. These procedures shall be supported by the necessary waveforms and voltage levels, and data for selecting matched components. Diagrams, either photographic or line, shall show the location of printed circuit board mounted components.    (h) Section VI, Replacement Parts List. The replacement parts list shall list, in alphanumeric order, all electrical/electronic, mechanical and pneumatic components, their description, value and tolerance, true manufacturer and manufacturers' part number.    (i) Section VII, Drawings. Wiring and schematic diagrams shall be included. The drawings will depict the circuitry using standard symbols and shall include the reference designations and component values or type designators. Drawings shall be clear and legible and shall not be engineering or productions sketches. <BR> <BR>The terms and conditions of the contractor's FSS contract (including any contract modifications) apply to all Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPA) and task or delivery orders issued under the contract as a result of this RFQ.  When a lower price has been established, or when the delivery terms, FOB terms, or ordering requirements have been modified by the BPA or task/delivery order, those modified terms will apply to all purchases made pursuant to it and take precedence over the FSS contract.  Any unique terms and conditions of a BPA or order issued under the contract that are not a part of the applicable FSS contract will govern.  In the event of an inconsistency between the terms and conditions of a BPA or task/delivery order and the Contractor's FSS terms, other than those identified above, the terms of the FSS contract will take precedence <BR> <BR>(Note: as used in this clause, the term "brand name" includes identification of products by make and model.)    (a) If items called for by this invitation for bids have been identified in the schedule by a "brand name or equal" description, such identification is intended to be descriptive, but not restrictive, and is to indicate the quality and characteristics of products that will be satisfactory. Bids offering "equal" products (including products of the brand name manufacturer other than the one described by brand name) will be considered for award if such products are clearly identified in the bids and are determined by the Government to meet fully the salient characteristics requirements listed in the invitation.    (b) Unless the bidder clearly indicates in the bid that the bidder is offering an "equal" product, the bid shall be considered as offering a brand name product referenced in the invitation for bids.    (c)(1) If the bidder proposes to furnish an "equal" product, the brand name, if any, of the product to be furnished shall be inserted in the space provided in the invitation for bids, or such product shall be otherwise clearly identified in the bid. The evaluation of bids and the determination as to equality of the product offered shall be the responsibility of the Government and will be based on information furnished by the bidder or identified in his/her bid as well as other information reasonably available to the purchasing activity. CAUTION TO BIDDERS. The purchasing activity is not responsible for locating or securing any information that is not identified in the bid and reasonably available to the purchasing activity. Accordingly, to insure that sufficient information is available, the bidder must furnish as a part of his/her bid all descriptive material (such as cuts, illustrations, drawings or other information) necessary for the purchasing activity to:        (i) Determine whether the product offered meets the salient characteristics requirement of the Invitation for Bids, and        (ii) Establish exactly what the bidder proposes to furnish and what the Government would be binding itself to purchase by making an award. The information furnished may include specific references to information previously furnished or to information otherwise available to the purchasing activity.      (2) If the bidder proposes to modify a product so as to make it conform to the requirements of the Invitation for Bids, he/she shall:        (i) Include in his/her bid a clear description of such proposed modifications, and        (ii) Clearly mark any descriptive material to show the proposed modifications.      (3) Modifications proposed after bid opening to make a product conform to a brand name product referenced in the Invitation for Bids will not be considered. <BR> <BR>contractor guarantees the equipment against defective material, workmanship and performance for a period of NLT one (1) year or manufacturer's standard warranty, said guarantee to run from date of acceptance of the equipment by the Government. The contractor agrees to furnish, without cost to the Government, replacement of all parts and material that are found to be defective during the guarantee period. Replacement of material and parts will be furnished to the Government at the point of installation, if installation is within the continental United States, or f.o.b. the continental U.S. port to be designated by the contracting officer if installation is outside of the continental United States. Cost of installation of replacement material and parts shall be borne by the contractor. <BR> <BR>Rejected goods will be held subject to contractors order for not more than 15 days, after which the rejected merchandise will be returned to the contractor's address at his/her risk and expense. Expenses incident to the examination and testing of materials or supplies that have been rejected will be charged to the contractor's account. <BR> <BR>a) To improve the timeliness of payments and lower overall administrative costs, VA strongly encourages contractors to submit invoices using its electronic invoicing system.  At present, electronic submission is voluntary and any nominal registration fees will be the responsibility of the contractor. VA intends to mandate electronic invoice submission, subject to completion of the federal rulemaking process.  At present, VA is using a 3rd party agent to contact contractors regarding this service.  During the voluntary period, contractors interested in registering for the electronic system should contact the VA's Financial Services Center at http://www.fsc.va.gov/einvoice.asp. <BR> <BR>

While additional support documentation (e.g. Seller Attachments) may be requested, pricing shall be entered as a 'bid' in the reverse auction - offline pricing is not an acceptable bid. At the conclusion of the reverse auction, if attached to the buy, the apparent winning bidder shall be required to complete the solicitation documents prior to award. <BR> <BR>The bidder or offeror agrees that if a contract is awarded to him/her, as a result of this solicitation, he/she will not advertise the award of the contract in his/her commercial advertising in such a manner as to state or imply that the Department of Veterans Affairs endorses a product, project or commercial line of endeavor. <BR> <BR>(a) The successful bidder will supply operation/maintenance (service data) manuals with each piece of equipment in the quantity specified in the solicitation and resulting purchase order.

For large, complex and/or highly versatile equipment capable of many operating modes and in other instances where the Operation Section is quite large, operational information may be bound separately in the form of an Operators Manual. The providing of a separate Operators manual does not relieve the supplier of his responsibility for providing the minimum acceptable maintenance data specified herein. When applicable, flow charts and narrative descriptions of software shall be provided. If programming is either built-in and/or user modifiable, a complete software listing shall be supplied. Equipment items with software packages shall also include diagnostic routines and sample outputs.

Data shall also be provided describing the preferred method of repairing or replacing discrete components mounted on printed circuit boards or located in areas where special steps must be followed to disassemble the equipment. Procedures shall be included to realign and test the equipment at the completion of repairs and to restore it to its original operating condition. These procedures shall be supported by the necessary waveforms and voltage levels, and data for selecting matched components.

When a lower price has been established, or when the delivery terms, FOB terms, or ordering requirements have been modified by the BPA or task/delivery order, those modified terms will apply to all purchases made pursuant to it and take precedence over the FSS contract.  Any unique terms and conditions of a BPA or order issued under the contract that are not a part of the applicable FSS contract will govern.  In the event of an inconsistency between the terms and conditions of a BPA or task/delivery order and the Contractor's FSS terms, other than those identified above, the terms of the FSS contract will take precedence <BR> <BR>(Note: as used in this clause, the term "brand name" includes identification of products by make and model.)    (a) If items called for by this invitation for bids have been identified in the schedule by a "brand name or equal" description, such identification is intended to be descriptive, but not restrictive, and is to indicate the quality and characteristics of products that will be satisfactory. Bids offering "equal" products (including products of the brand name manufacturer other than the one described by brand name) will be considered for award if such products are clearly identified in the bids and are determined by the Government to meet fully the salient characteristics requirements listed in the invitation.    (b) Unless the bidder clearly indicates in the bid that the bidder is offering an "equal" product, the bid shall be considered as offering a brand name product referenced in the invitation for bids.    (c)(1) If the bidder proposes to furnish an "equal" product, the brand name, if any, of the product to be furnished shall be inserted in the space provided in the invitation for bids, or such product shall be otherwise clearly identified in the bid. The evaluation of bids and the determination as to equality of the product offered shall be the responsibility of the Government and will be based on information furnished by the bidder or identified in his/her bid as well as other information reasonably available to the purchasing activity. CAUTION TO BIDDERS. The purchasing activity is not responsible for locating or securing any information that is not identified in the bid and reasonably available to the purchasing activity. Accordingly, to insure that sufficient information is available, the bidder must furnish as a part of his/her bid all descriptive material (such as cuts, illustrations, drawings or other information) necessary for the purchasing activity to:        (i) Determine whether the product offered meets the salient characteristics requirement of the Invitation for Bids, and        (ii) Establish exactly what the bidder proposes to furnish and what the Government would be binding itself to purchase by making an award. The information furnished may include specific references to information previously furnished or to information otherwise available to the purchasing activity.      (2) If the bidder proposes to modify a product so as to make it conform to the requirements of the Invitation for Bids, he/she shall:        (i) Include in his/her bid a clear description of such proposed modifications, and        (ii) Clearly mark any descriptive material to show the proposed modifications.      (3) Modifications proposed after bid opening to make a product conform to a brand name product referenced in the Invitation for Bids will not be considered. <BR> <BR>contractor guarantees the equipment against defective material, workmanship and performance for a period of NLT one (1) year or manufacturer's standard warranty, said guarantee to run from date of acceptance of the equipment by the Government. The contractor agrees to furnish, without cost to the Government, replacement of all parts and material that are found to be defective during the guarantee period. Replacement of material and parts will be furnished to the Government at the point of installation, if installation is within the continental United States, or f.o.b. the continental U.S. port to be designated by the contracting officer if installation is outside of the continental United States. Cost of installation of replacement material and parts shall be borne by the contractor. <BR> <BR>Rejected goods will be held subject to contractors order for not more than 15 days, after which the rejected merchandise will be returned to the contractor's address at his/her risk and expense. Expenses incident to the examination and testing of materials or supplies that have been rejected will be charged to the contractor's account. <BR> <BR>a) To improve the timeliness of payments and lower overall administrative costs, VA strongly encourages contractors to submit invoices using its electronic invoicing system.  At present, electronic submission is voluntary and any nominal registration fees will be the responsibility of the contractor. VA intends to mandate electronic invoice submission, subject to completion of the federal rulemaking process.  At present, VA is using a 3rd party agent to contact contractors regarding this service.  During the voluntary period, contractors interested in registering for the electronic system should contact the VA's Financial Services Center at http://www.fsc.va.gov/einvoice.asp. <BR> <BR>New Equipment ONLY; NO remanufactured or "gray market" items. All items must be covered by the manufacturer's warranty. <BR> <BR>Bid MUST be good for 30 calendar days after close of Buy. <BR> <BR>Shipping must be free on board (FOB) destination CONUS (Continental U.S.), which means that the seller must deliver the goods on its conveyance at the destination specified by the buyer, and the seller is responsible for the cost of shipping and risk of loss prior to actual delivery at the specified destination. <BR> <BR>Offeror must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database before an award can be made to them.  If the offeror is not registered in the CCR, it may do so through the CCR website at http://www.ccr.gov. <BR> <BR>No partial shipments are permitted unless specifically authorized at the time of award. <BR> <BR>

<AWARDEE>Maiden Rock, 586 Double Arrow Rd, Seely Lake, MT 59868 US
<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT
<p>The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), intends to issue a firm-fixed price, sole source purchase order to Maiden Rock for an maintenance and repair service for Meteor Burst radio equipment and technical support for remote radios and master station equipment.</p>
<p>This procurement is being conducted under Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Part 6.302-1 (a) (2) (ii) (A), Only One Responsible Source and no other Supplies will Satisfy Agency Requirements.</p>
<p>Currently the National Water and Climate Center (NWCC) is being required to vacate the frequencies the remote field sites and master stations operate on and switch to frequencies dedicated to the USDA-NRCS. This required all 545B field radios to undergo a substantial upgrade to move to new frequencies. There are 50 remaining 545B radios to be repaired to meet NRCS specifications. In addition to the frequency changes we require repair work on the equipment at 5 master stations including 6 exciters and software modification to existing equipment. Estimated value of services is $51,000.</p>
<p>The SNOTEL system is the largest meteor burst remote data collection system in the world. Meteorburst transmitters are the primary source for transmitted SNOTEL and SCAN data used in essential engineering research and development projects with field applications throughout the USDA-NRCS. The 520X radio and all connecting power and communication cables transmit data collected from Soil Climate Analysis stations and SNOTEL stations across the United States. All remote station radios operate against this proprietary operating system and were manufactured by MCC who has transferred the rights to Maiden Rock. To compete this award would create substantial duplication of costs in which the Government is not expected to recover.</p>
<p>This is not a request for Competitive Proposals. No contract will be awarded on the basis of offers received in response to this notice. A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon the responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. This is a notice and a solicitation will not be issued. NRCS will not respond to requests for solicitation copies and will not pay for information received in response to this announcement. No solicitation document is available.

<DESC>Site R10 is located on the north levee of the American River at the Watt Avenue Bridge crossing, in Sacramento, California.  There is an existing cutoff wall in the levee that approaches the bridge on each side, but leaves a 183-foot gap across the Watt Avenue Bridge.  This contract involves construction of a jet-grout cutoff wall through Watt Avenue to fill in this gap.  The cutoff wall will consist of 6-foot diameter overlapping grout columns, 50 feet deep east and west of Watt Avenue, and 54 feet deep across Watt Avenue.  Traffic control for both vehicles and pedestrians/bicyclists will be required.  Only two lanes of Watt Avenue are allowed to be closed at any time, and the construction on Watt Avenue is limited to nights and weekends.

<DESC>CODING STATEMENT OF WORK - CHEYENNE VA MEDICAL CENTER

CODING PROCESSES

Contractor will:
o	Carefully read and review health record documentation for inpatient and outpatient cases as provided by Cheyenne VA Medical Center (CVAMC).
o	Assign appropriate ICD-9-CM and CPT/HCPCS codes at 95% accuracy rate and enter the codes into the system in accordance with the documentation and the provider's scope of practice.
o	Adhere to all coding guidelines and accepted VA regulation, including:
1.	The Official Guidelines and Reporting as found in the CPT Assistant, a publication of the American Medical Association for reporting outpatient ambulatory procedures and evaluation and management services,
2.	The Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting in the Coding Clinic for ICD-9-CM, a publication of the American Hospital Association, and VHA Guidelines for coding as found in the Handbook for Coding Guidelines current version, Health Information Management, Department of Veterans Affairs.  Note: While VHA does ask for reimbursement from third party payers, the VHA coding policy is to code according to coding guidelines.  Our own compliance audits use only this definition when determining if any encounter is correct.
3.	The Correct Coding Initiative.  The CPT Evaluation and Management codes assure documentation substantiates the code level assigned.
4.	VHA Resident Supervision Handbook.
5.	VA Coding Guidelines.
o	CVAMC will provide access to VHA publications.
o	When assigning multiple CPT codes, verify they are not components of a larger, more comprehensive procedure that can be described in a single code.
o	Assign modifiers as appropriate to override Correct Coding Initiative edits.
o	Identify and document those encounters created in error because the patient was not seen.
o	Provide a workload report each week indicating the events coded for the prior week in the following categories:
o	Number of inpatient events coded
o	Number of inpatient pro fees coded
o	Number of outpatient encounters coded
o	Number of lab encounters coded
o	Number of NSQIP events coded
o	Provide a backlog report weekly which shows events suspended and events to be coded as follows:
o	Inpatient events: Events not coded due to lack of documentation
o	Inpatient events: Events not coded for any other reason
o	Inpatient Pro Fees: Number of records requiring inpatient pro fee coding
o	Outpatient encounters: Number of outpatient encounters to be coded
o	Outpatient encounters: Number of outpatient encounters suspended
o	Lab encounters: Number of lab encounters to be coded
o	Lab encounters: Number of lab encounters suspended
o	Number of NSQIP events to be coded
o	Expected turnaround time is 5 work days from receipt of work for all types, provided there is sufficient documentation.  Lack of documentation for any work type must be communicated to CVAMC within the expected turnaround period.  Work is considered completed when it is received back at CVAMC with data entry done for all online work.  Inpatient events are considered complete when the event has been closed and released. CVAMC will transmit inpatient events.
o	Expected average productivity due to hourly invoicing is:
o	Inpatient - 4/hours
o	Outpatient - 10/hour
o	NSQIP - 7/hour
o	Errors will be corrected at no cost to CVAMC.

Outpatient Encounters including Radiology, Lab or other Ancillary Services

Contractor will:
o	Use primarily 1995 Evaluation and Management guidelines on encounters except when 1997 guidelines provide a better code.
o	Enter complete data entry, including CPT codes, modifiers, and diagnoses for the encounter or occasion of service when on-line coding is performed into PCE. Associate the provider with the CPT code performed by him/her at that encounter.  Note:  The association in VistA is very important to create a correct bill and for the budget allocation for each fiscal year for VA.  Contractor will correct any missing associations when doing on-line coding at no charge to CVAMC.
o	When coding, it is expected the contractor will search the record for an appropriate diagnosis.
o	Not validate any cases that already have initials and a date (of validation) in comments in PCE as these have already been validated by VA staff.
o	Link CPT procedure codes with the proper diagnosis.
o	Radiology encounters need to have the ordering physician listed as a secondary provider in the encounter.  The ordering provider's name should also be entered in CCM Comments.
o	Resident services: The primary provider for all clinics is the attending if there is attending documentation that meets VHA Resident Supervision guidelines.  If the attending documentation does not meet the guidelines, is incomplete, or is not present, the primary provider is changed to the resident and the encounter is marked not billable by entering reason code 25 in CCM comments so that the facility charge can be billed even if the professional fee cannot be billed.
o	Contractor will use the appropriate reason codes in Comments in CCM, not in Claims Tracking, for making an encounter not billable - CVAMC reason codes are listed in the CVAMC procedures.
o	If contractor re-codes an event with changes, comments will be placed in the Comments field in CCM, not Claims Tracking. CVAMC will review whether event has been billed and needs action due to code changes.

Emergency Department

Contractor will code:
o	CPT and ICD-9-CM for emergency room service or a level 1 office visit for encounters for prescription refills only.

Inpatient PTF and Pro Fees

Contractor will:
o	Follow VA Coding Guidelines and coding procedures for coding the inpatient PTF's and Professional Fees (Pro Fees).
o	Contractor will use the 801 screen to code the Pro Fees.
o	Contractor will complete all inpatient PTF's and Pro Fees within the fourteen (14) day rolling closeout period.

Required Coder Knowledge and Skills

Coders performing work must:

o	Read and interpret health record documentation to identify all diagnoses and procedures that affect the current outpatient visit or ancillary service.
o	Possess formal training in anatomy and physiology, medical terminology, pathology and disease processes, pharmacology, health record format and content, reimbursement methodologies and conventions, rule and guidelines for current classification systems (ICD-9-CM and CPT).

o	Code in accordance with CCI Bundling Guidelines.
o	Use the HCFA Common Procedural Coding Systems (HCPCS), where appropriate.
o	Exclude from coding information such as symptoms or signs characteristic of the diagnoses, findings from diagnostic studies or localized conditions that have no bearing on current management of the patient.
o	Clarify conflicting, ambiguous or nonspecific information appearing in the record by consulting with their supervisor who will, if necessary, discuss with CVAMC Chief of HIMS.

Required Coder Education and Experience

Coders must be credentialed and have completed an accredited program for coding certification, an accredited health information management or health information technician.  A certified coder is someone credentialed by the:

o	American Health Information Management Association (AHIMA) and includes RHIA, RHIT, CCS and CCS-P, or
o	American Association of Procedural Coders (AACP) as a CPC or CPC-H,

Credentialed Coders must have a minimum of two years experience in the area they will be coding.

Contractor may utilize an experienced, but non-credentialed coder who is eligible to sit for the coding exams, provided: Each instance of using a non-credentialed coder is pre-approved by the Chief of HIMS via email; 100% of the non-credentialed coder's work is reviewed by a credentialed contractor's supervisor prior to returning work to CVAMC and the name of the non-credentialed coder appears on each invoice for those records s/he has coded.

QUALITY CONTROL PROCESSES

The contractor will:
o	Provide a list of coded records bi-weekly.
o	Perform on-going assessment of not less than 5% of all coded services and provide bi-weekly (every other week) result to CVAMC to ensure that the 95% accuracy rate is met. Track results by coder to assure appropriate follow-up. Failure to provide the results of the audit on a bi-weekly basis will result in a 20% reduction in the negotiated price for work generated that week.  Failure to report results within the specified time frame three times during a calendar year will result in termination of the contract.
o	Monitor to ensure that the 95% quality standard is being met on an on-going basis. If monitoring demonstrates that work has fallen below the quality standard, the contractor must develop a corrective action plan and include it with the data for that week. The table below indicates the adjustment level in negotiated price for reduced accuracy rates.

When accuracy rate is 94%	The reduction will be 5% for that week
When accuracy rate is 93%	The reduction will be 15% for that week and the following week

o	Re-review any coded data where VA finds a question during our pre-bill process or when a denial is received to either make changes or substantiate the coding with appropriate coding rules and references. This service is included in the price of the work.
o	Use the following during the review processes:

1.	Select a representative sample of all coding.
2.	Count each one of the following as an error:
?	Those codes that were coded and not supported in the documentation, violate a coding rule and/or
?	Those CPT or diagnosis codes that should have been coded and were not and/or
?	Unbundled codes.
