The anticipated ceiling is $3.5 billion.<br /><br />Sources Sought Synopsis (SSS) GH-SSS-2013-1 was posted from 21 Jun 2013 through 9 Aug 2013.

<DESC>The US  Army Contracting Command, Aberdeen Proving Ground Natick Contracting Division, Fort Detrick invites applications for funding opportunities for the fiscal year 2015 Deployed War Fighter Protection Research Program (DWFP), renewable for up to 3 years, administered by the Armed Forces Pest Management Board (AFPMB).   <br> The AFPMB is soliciting pre-proposals for original, innovative research designed to develop new interventions for protection of deployed military personnel from diseases caused by arthropod-borne pathogens and to improve control of filth flies.  Diseases of significant concern include malaria, dengue fever, chikungunya fever, and other arboviruses.  The program supports development of: (1) new toxicants or the adaptation of existing toxicants to relevant vectors; (2) new insecticide application techniques; and (3) new personal protection tools that prevent human-vector contact (excluding work on topical repellents).  Ideally the research would support the development, evaluation, and registration of new insecticides, or improved formulations of existing insecticides for vector control, new technology or enhanced modalities of personal protection from biting arthropods, or would improve the efficacy and sustainability of equipment for application of pesticides for vector control in a military operational environment.  Research should be product oriented, consisting of basic or applied research related to a particular product, evaluation of experimental products for military uses, or research directed towards development of an existing product for commercial manufacture.  The research must be primarily applicable to the military but products should be transferable to civilian uses.  <br>  <br> It is anticipated that approximately $1,000,000 will be awarded this year (FY15), with future years subject to the availability of funds.  Total proposed cost may not exceed $250,000 per year for up to 3 years, inclusive of direct and indirect costs. Approximately 5-8 awards are anticipated. Funding is intended to begin in April 2015. Projects will be selected on the basis of peer-reviewed scientific merit and programmatic relevance determined by an Armed Forces Pest Management Board Integrated Process Team.  <br>  <br> Pre-proposals will be accepted from investigators who are employed by or affiliated with an eligible institution. Eligible institutions include for-profit, non-profit, public, and private organizations in any country. Examples include academic establishments (universities, colleges), hospitals, laboratories, companies, and agencies of local, state, and federal government (with the exception of USDA investigators for whom DWFP funding arrangements are made separately by inter-Agency agreement.) The pre-proposal form is available at http://www.afpmb.org/preproposal.docx <br> Follow the directions on the form for submission to the AFPMB webmaster.  This form should be submitted no later than 18 Dec 2014, 6:00 p.m. EST.  <br>  <br> Other estimated timelines for the FY15 DWFP are as follows: invitation to submit proposal should be sent by 8 Jan 2015, invited Full Proposals submission deadline will be approximately 9 February, 2015, 4:00 p.m. EST, and Award Start Date should be between March 2015 and April 2015.  Full proposals must be submitted through Grants.Gov website. Full proposal candidates will be provided complete instructions for full proposal submission.

<DESC>The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency intends to negotiate on a sole-source basis pursuant to simplified acquisition procedures with Coachange LLC, Glen Ridge, NJ, for team development of senior staff members. The director of a business unit within the agency currently receives executive coaching services from a Coachange LLC coach. The director requires team development for senior staff members within the business unit to ensure they are providing similar approaches to leading their respective staffs, consistent with the director's vision and goals. Because of the unique relationship between a coach and his or her client, i.e., the director, it is imperative that the same individual work with the director's leadership team to ensure alignment with the director's leadership agenda. The synergy achieved by all parties working with the same coach will ensure all team members are fully engaged at their highest level of potential at the lowest personal cost (balanced). The effort is estimated to encompass four one-day intensive customized workshops during FY 15. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; a solicitation document will not be issued. All information received within 5 days after the date of this notice with pricing and sufficient documentation to establish a bona fide capability to meet the requirement will be considered by the OCC. A determination not to compete this proposed contract action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the OCC. Information received will be considered primarily for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<SUBJECT>Identify Cost of Radiation Hardening Solutions as a Function of Radiation Environments for Tailkit Electronics

<DESC>The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) intends to negotiate and award a Purchase Order on a sole-source basis to Boeing Radiation Effects Lab (BREL), MC: 2T-50, P.O. Box 3707, Seattle, WA 98124, for an effort entitled "Identify Cost of Radiation Hardening Solutions as a Function of Radiation Environments for Tailkit Electronics." The statutory authority for this non-competitive action is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source.
<p>DTRA requires a cost to harden (CTH) study to gather data that will assist future research and development in the technical, complex field of parametric radiation hardening as a function of radiation environments for tailkit electronics.</p>
<p>The scope of this effort is to document the cost to achieve nuclear survivable electronics for the four levels of radiation hardness, referenced above, as a function of total dose, peak gamma dose rate, neutron fluence, and Single Event Upset (SEU). The costs are associated with the design, test and maintenance of nuclear survivability at those specified environments.</p>
<p>Boeing Radiation Effects Lab (BREL) is the only responsible source reasonably available in the market to conduct this CTH study. BREL's proprietary Radiation Effects Database will enable DTRA to come up with the most realistic cost to harden at these radiation levels. BREL is the only performer to already have procured the requisite parts in our GFI parts list, tested them, evaluated them against their proprietary radiation test database of commercial electronic parts, and now has the capability to determine the cost to harden DTRA's radiation requirements at the required levels on tailkit electronics. Because BREL has already tested many items on the GFI parts list, they are the only performer capable of providing DTRA with substitute or alternative parts that may not have originally been considered allowing this cost to harden study to be more accurate based on actual testing that took place and the cost to test those materials for DTRA's future radiation hardening testing efforts on the tailkit electronics. BREL's level of expertise in designing, testing and qualifying radiation hardened systems, along with their proprietary database access, will provide DTRA with a CTH that will validate and support future R&amp;D efforts to advance this technology enabling cost-savings on these future efforts. Furthermore, Boeing Solid-State Electronics Development (SSED), another division of Boeing, is the subject matter expert on mitigation of single event effects and redesign of electronic using Rad Hard By Design techniques. The exclusive relationship with Boeing SSED is necessary to obtain further proprietary data on Rad Hard By Design techniques that will be needed to validate this study. This proprietary database is not available to other performers and BREL's expertise cannot be substituted by using another performer.</p>
<p>This notice of contract action is not a request for competitive proposals; no formal request for quotation will be issued as a result of this announcement. All responsible sources may submit a capability statement which shall be considered by the Government. The Government will not be responsible for any costs incurred by responding to this notice. A determination to proceed with this effort on a sole source basis based upon capability statements received and evaluated in response to this announcement is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>

<DESC>MARKET SURVEY CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT FOR International Ground Handling and Trip Support Services.

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Flight Inspection Services (FIS), and Flight Inspection Operations Group (FIOG) as a requirement for the Ground Handling, international administrative and operational support services for its FIS Fleet, currently consisting of 15 aircraft. 

This is a market survey for International Ground Handling and Trip Support Services.  The responses to this market survey will be used for informational purposes only.  This is not a screening information request or request for proposal of any kind.  The FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals.

The FAA will not pay for any information received or costs incurred in preparing the response to the market survey.  Therefore any cost associated with the market survey submission is solely at the interested vendors expense.

At this time the nature of the competition has not been determined.  The FAA may decide to do a full and open competition or set aside all or part of the procurement for small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the SBA for participation in the SBA's 8(a) Program.

The purpose of this market survey is to solicit statements of interest and capabilities from small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses and 8(a) certified firms, capable of providing International Ground Handling and Trip Support Services.

This market survey is also being conducted in order to obtain the information necessary to determine whether adequate competition exists to set-aside the competition among small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or 8(a) certified firms.

The principle North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this effort is 488119, Other Airport Operations with a size standard of $32.5 million.   

Interested firms are required to submit the attached Business Declaration form and a copy of their SBA 8(a) certification letter, if applicable.

In order to make this determination the FAA requires the following from interested vendors:

1. Capability Statement - This document should identify:
Type of services provided by your firm, 
Size and type of services provided by previous contracts (elaborate and provide detailed information and past performance), 
Number of years in business

2.  Geographical areas where your company can provide services 

3.  Expected programmatic approach (in-house, teaming, subcontracting, etc.) - Respondents must provide their strategy for accomplishing this work, including the percentage of work that will be done by eligible small, service-disabled veteran-owned  and 8(a) certified businesses.

Attached is a draft of the statement of work.  Respondents are encouraged to review the statement of work and provide comments. 

All responses to this market survey must be received by December 4, 2014, 1:00 pm CST   All submittals should be submitted to the address below or electronically:

<DESC>The National Security Science and Engineering Faculty Fellowship (NSSEFF) program is sponsored by the Basic Research Office, Office of Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (ASD (R&amp;E)). NSSEFF supports innovative basic research within academia, as well as education initiatives that seek to create and develop the next generation of scientists and engineers for the defense and national security workforce.
<p>The Office of Naval Research (ONR) manages the NSSEFF program for ASD (R&amp;E). To accomplish this task, ONR is soliciting proposals for the NSSEFF program through this Funding Opportunity Announcement. This FOA seeks outstanding and distinguished researchers for the purpose of conducting innovative basic research in areas of interest to the Department of Defense (DoD) and fostering long-term relationships between the NSSEFF Fellows and the DoD.</p>
<p>As defined by the DoD, basic research is "systematic study directed toward greater knowledge or understanding of the fundamental aspects of phenomena and of observable facts without specific applications towards processes or products in mind. It includes all scientific study and experimentation directed toward increasing fundamental knowledge and understanding in those fields of the physical, engineering, environmental, and life sciences related to long-term national security needs. It is farsighted high payoff research that provides the basis for technological progress." (http://comptroller.defense.gov/Portals/45/documents/fmr/Volume_02b.pdf) The DoD's basic research program invests broadly in many scientific fields to ensure that it has early cognizance of new scientific knowledge.</p>
<p>DoD's basic research investment in this program will also contribute to the development of the next generation of high performing scientists and engineers, who will be educated and trained as a part of the NSSEFF Fellows' research. The NSSEFF program helps to ensure that our Nation has an active, long-term and aggressive research portfolio that attracts the foremost creative, innovative and productive university researchers and their students.</p>
<p>Objectives of the program are to:</p>
<p>Support scientific research that may lead to extraordinary outcomes</p>
<p>Educate and train outstanding student and post-doctoral researchers for the defense and national security workforce</p>
<p>Foster long-term relationships between outstanding university researchers and the DoD</p>
<p>Familiarize select university researchers and their students with DoD's current and future challenges</p>
<p>Increase the number of exceptionally talented technical experts that are contributing to DoD's mission and are able to actively participate in its accomplishment as part of the administration of grants issued under this FOA.</p>
<p>The NSSEFF program will focus its funding on innovative basic research projects that have the potential for significant long-term impact and support the development of the next generation of scientists and engineers for the defense and national security workforce. Risk-taking is encouraged; however, all proposals must demonstrate solid judgment and rationale. This FOA is for single investigator grant proposals for basic research in one or more of the following technical subject categories of interest to the DoD: <br />1. Synthetic Biology including e.g.<br />a. Mammalian platforms/chassis/systems <br />b. Genome scale engineering</p>
<p>2. Quantum Information Science including e.g.<br />a. Quantum sensing<br />b. Quantum metrology<br />c. Quantum algorithms</p>
<p>3. Cognitive Neuroscience including e.g.<br />a. Systems neuroscience <br />b. Cellular and molecular neuroscience</p>
<p>4. Novel Engineered Materials including e.g.<br />a. Functional materials <br />b. Structural materials <br />c. Nanomaterials and nanoscience</p>
<p>5. Applied Mathematics and Statistics including e.g.<br />a. Risk optimization<br />b. Dimensionality reduction<br />c. Scalable algorithms<br />d. Non-linear dynamics<br />e. Machine learning</p>
<p>6. Other fields of research with high potential</p>
<p>All proposers should ensure that they propose to conduct basic research as previously defined in this section. NSSEFF is oriented towards research that may lead to extraordinary outcomes such as: revolutionizing entire disciplines, creating entirely new fields, or disrupting accepted theories and perspectives.</p>

<DESC><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">1. DESCRIPTION</span></strong> <br /><br />The United States Air Force (USAF) Air Force Installation Contracting Agency (AFICA), 771st Enterprise Sourcing Squadron, Knowledge Based Services Commodity Council (KBSCC) at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base (WPAFB) in Dayton, Ohio, issues this Request for Information (RFI) regarding a potential future solicitation for Temporary Help Services.&nbsp; The future solicitation strategy may provide an Air Force-wide solution using Temporary Help Services throughout the United States (including Alaska and Hawaii). <br /><br /><strong>In accordance with FAR 52.215-3, this RFI does not constitute, nor should it be construed as, a solicitation, Request for Proposal, Request for Quotation, Invitation for Bid, or any other commitment by the Government.</strong> <br /><br />The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI, nor will the Government provide compensation for providing information. There is no solicitation available at this time; requests for a solicitation will not receive a response.&nbsp; Responses are not offers and the Government is not under any obligation to award a contract.&nbsp; Respondents are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI.&nbsp; If the Government decides to establish a contract for Temporary Help Services, it will issue a Request for Proposal at a later date.&nbsp; Please monitor the Federal Business Opportunities website (<a href="http://www.fbo.gov">www.fbo.gov</a>) for future information regarding this potential requirement. <br /><br />Respondents are also advised that submitting any information provides the Government express permission for the Government to use the data, pictures, and other information contained in the submittals for Government purposes. All information received in response to this RFI marked as "proprietary" will be handled accordingly. &nbsp;Information provided as a response to this RFI will not be returned. <br /><br />The Government highly encourages all interested parties to provide a complete and thorough response to this RFI. &nbsp;However, not responding will not preclude participation should a solicitation be released. <br /><br /><strong>The Government requests companies which are not primarily Temporary Help Service Firms to abstain from providing responses to this RFI.</strong> <br /><br />In accordance with 5 CFR 300.501, a Temporary Help Service Firm is a private sector entity which quickly provides other organizations with specific services performed by its pool of employees, possessing the appropriate work skills, for brief or intermittent periods. &nbsp;The firm is the legally responsible employer and maintains that relationship during the time its employees are assigned to a client.&nbsp; The firm, not the client organization, recruits, tests, hires, trains, assigns, pays, provides benefits and leave to, and as necessary, addresses performance problems, disciplines, and terminates its employees. &nbsp;Among other employer obligations, the firm is responsible for payroll deductions and payment of income taxes, social security (FICA), unemployment insurance, and workers' compensation, and shall provide required liability insurance and bonding. <br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2. PURPOSE <br /></span></strong><br />The purpose of publicizing this RFI notice is to aid in the development of the potential AFICA Temporary Help Services acquisition strategy, increase competition to broaden industry participation in meeting Government requirements, and gather information for planning purposes about the Temporary Help Services market or capabilities as defined in FAR 15.201(e). <br /><br />We seek large and small business respondents who are currently conducting business or providing similar services.&nbsp; The input will assist in determining the interest, capability, and capacity of all potential offers. <br /><br />A review of available North American Industrial Classification (NAICS) codes suggests the potential classification code of 561320.&nbsp; The Small Business Administration (SBA) has established a small business size standard of $27,500,000 (based on a 3-year average of annual receipts). <br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">3. MARKET RESEARCH SURVEY <br /></span></strong><br />The basis for this RFI is a survey located at <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/TXTXLPT">https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/TXTXLPT</a>.&nbsp; The survey is also&nbsp;attached as a PDF document for your review if you would prefer to see the entire survey prior to answering the online version. &nbsp;Do not submit the PDF document in response to this RFI.&nbsp; The survey will be available until 1 December 2014. <br /><br /><strong>In order to ensure the Government is receiving the most reliable, useful, and relevant information regarding the Temporary Help Services industry, the Government requests that only companies that are primarily Temporary Help Service Firms respond to the survey. <br /></strong><br />If you are unable to complete the survey in one sitting, you will need to close the survey window and re-open the survey link to edit your response.&nbsp; The survey will start from the beginning, but will show the responses you have previously provided. &nbsp;This only works if returning to the survey from the original computer used when you began filling out the survey.&nbsp; All responses are collected based on IP addresses; only one response per IP address is permitted. <br /><br />If you are having any questions or issues with the survey, please email <a href="mailto:KBServices.CC@us.af.mil">KBServices.CC@us.af.mil</a> for assistance. <br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">4. EVALUATION <br /></span></strong><br />Responses will not be evaluated, but are for the purpose of gathering information to help refine our requirements and acquisition strategy. &nbsp;Following your response to this survey, USAF representatives may choose to engage in additional communications with selected respondents. &nbsp;Such communications would only be intended to support USAF market research by obtaining further clarification of the capabilities of the industry to meet requirements.</p>

<RESPDATE>111414
<CONTACT>Rodney E. Brooks, Contract Specialist, Phone 3014020751, Email rodney.brooks@nih.gov - 
<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE
<p>1.Solicitation Number:	  HHS-NIH-NIDA-(SSSA)-SBSS-15-22<br />2.Title:  Linking CMS Data to  NIA Supported Surveys<br />3.Classification Code:  R499<br />4.NAICS Code:  541990<br />5.Description:  Linking CMS Data to  NIA Supported Surveys</p>
<p>This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations.</p>
<p>The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.</p>
<p>This notice is issued to help determine the availability of qualified companies technically capable of meeting the Government requirement and to determine the method of acquisition.  It is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract.  Responses will not be considered as proposals or quotes.  No award will be made as a result of this notice.  The Government will NOT be responsible for any costs incurred by the respondents to this notice.  This notice is strictly for research and information purposes only.</p>
<p>Background:  The mission of the National Institute on Aging includes the mandate to "support and conduct behavioral, social and economic research related to aging processes, diseases and conditions associated with aging, and other special problems and needs of older Americans."  As part of that effort, NIA supports a number of data collection efforts, including surveys such as the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) and the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID), with the goal of providing the research community with data resources to address pressing research questions on the health, economic and social resources of the aging population.</p>
<p>In accordance with this goal, the Division of Behavioral and Social Research (DBSR) at NIA supports initiatives linking surveys to administrative data on health care.  These linkages facilitate research on health care utilization, health outcomes and health expenditures which can inform policy and encourage development of more effective programs.  Administrative data from Centers of Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) is particularly valuable because it provides detailed information on healthcare services, out-of-pocket costs, and length and duration of illness.  Researchers can, for example, use the administrative data to validate self-reported health measures for individuals in the HRS sample.</p>
<p>Purpose and Objectives: The contractor shall provide all resources necessary to accomplish the tasks and deliverables described in this Statement of Work (SOW).   NIA wishes to contract with an entity who is a CMS approved contractor and who has specified data sets (see section B.3) from 1991 to 2012, to link to NIA funded surveys.  These data sets should be linked using existing algorithms developed through SBIR/STTR grants.  The contractor should update NIA funded surveys with the latest data from CMS as it becomes available on an annual basis and create user friendly summary research files which are consistent with previous years' summary files and distribute these files to researchers.</p>
<p>A.	CONTRACTOR REQUIREMENTS (SCOPE OF WORK)<br />1.	The tasks comprising this contract include already having full access to CMS data from 1991-2012, gaining full access of new CMS data as they become available, updating linkages of these new data to two surveys (HRS and PSID) and ensuring that previously linked data remains accessible and updatable; distribution of linked research files to approved users, and further enhancement of breadth and depth of the data products available for researchers.  Specific tasks include the following:</p>
<p>Task 1: Data Linkage and Acquisition<br />Contractor will maintain the existing CMS data inventory (which includes CMS data linked to HRS and PSID) and update this inventory as new CMS data become available and obtain approval from CMS for linkages as necessary.     <br />Note: NIA does not own the data.  The contractor should have an active DUA with CMS with data specified in section B.3 which they can re-use to link NIA supported surveys.</p>
<p>Task 2: Processing Research Files for survey linkages <br />Contractor will continue development of research extracts and summaries of CMS administrative files at the person level tailored to satisfy the research needs of a wide range of users. The aim is to create summary formats that remove the burden of working with large and complicated claims files in multiple formats across multiple years. In constructing these research files, algorithms will be created to translate raw claims records into meaningful indicators of medical conditions and treatments. These files will be formulated to provide user friendly and easy access to statistics describing individual respondents' health status and usage of medical services. This formulation shall be developed and refined with the input of the 2 survey developers (HRS and PSID)  and their research teams on an annual basis. Development shall also include creation of versions of research files designed to enhance information content while maintaining data confidentially through the masking of HIPPA-sensitive variable.   This tasks assumes no change in data structure/elements.</p>
<p>Task 3: Documentation<br />Contractor shall maintain and further enhance data documentation for both the linked research extracts of the raw claims records and the research summary constructions of the CMS data on an annual basis. This data documentation shall be directly built into the research extract files, making specific data elements both easily understood and retrievable by potential users. In addition to written material, documentation shall also be provided in accessible and easily searchable electronic formats (e.g., HTML, Excel and Access formats).  In addition to data layouts that report a label and description for each data element, contractor shall, in collaboration with study directors, develop more detailed data documentation and tools for working with CMS data, including value formats and value frequencies, advisories on specific data elements and general guidance on the usefulness of CMS data for health services  and health economics research.</p>
<p>Task 4: Distribution of Research Files<br />Contractor will distribute linked research extracts to end users in compliance with existing CMS and survey data security policies.  The process of extracting the data may be specific to each data request. Minimally, each data distribution shall include the following elements:<br />&bull;	Confirmation of request specifications;<br />&bull;	Validation of approval for distribution of CMS linked data from survey managers (e.g. HRS or PSID); <br />&bull;	Validation of approval of CMS DUA procedures;<br />&bull;	Verification of data extracts as specified in the CMS DUA;<br />&bull;	Encryption of data files when written to media; and <br />&bull;	Secure shipment/transfer of data files to the end user.</p>
<p>Task 5: User Support<br />Contractor shall provide technical assistance and other guidance to users during all phases of the data request process. Guidance includes assisting users with formulating their requests, directing users to resources regarding requests and DUAs, and facilitating DUA acquisition and maintenance. Contractor staff shall also provide technical support in decryption and reading data and support for understanding documentation to users after receipt of shipped data files. Contractor may develop and maintain other tools for user support, which could include websites and discussion boards, to supplement documentation.</p>
<p>Take 6: Project Management (see also Section D.2) <br />Contractor shall track and maintain detailed records of all request specifications and shipments and deliveries. These records will be available on a real time basis, and contractor will be able to respond to a request for information from NIA within 2 business days. Minimally, contractor shall provide reports monthly to NIA detailing the researchers (including institutional affiliation) who requested lined datasets, dates of requests, research files distributed, and timeframes of permitted use along with DUA number and NIA grant number (when applicable).<br />This report shall also identify any problems that arose and a statement explaining how the problem was resolved. This report shall also identify any problems that have arisen but have not been completely resolved and provide an explanation.</p>
<p>Contractor shall manage and coordinate regular communication with personnel from all affiliated surveys and registries. This communication will inform these personnel about the status of administrative data linkages, availability of data products, and details summarizing the distribution of files to users.<br />Finally, contractor will maintain whatever records and communication are required by CMS as part of its DUA procedures.</p>
<p>Task 7: Development of Research Files When CMS Changes Data Structures (Optional task)<br />CMS may from time to time modify their data structures which will require timely updates in order to maintain consistency with current summary files.   Contractor will continue such development under optional task and update algorithms of research extracts and summaries of CMS administrative files so that the data files distributed by the contractor remains consistent across multiple years as CMS changes data formats.  It is contractors' responsibility to inform NIA when such data structure changes occurs.  Offeror in their proposal should provide cost estimate for optional Task 7.</p>
<p>Task 8: Linkage of existing CMS administrative data to new surveys and registries (as identified by NIA) (Optional task) <br />NIA anticipates that new surveys may require linkages during the term of the contract.  In this case NIA will exercise the options.  Offeror should provide cost estimates per survey for up to 10 surveys.</p>
<p><br />Specific Data Requirements: Contractor must have full access to CMS data for the following CMS files and periods: <br /> Data Description	Period<br />1	Medicare Part A and Part B Data - Carrier, Durable Medical Equipment, Home Health, Hospice, Inpatient, Outpatient, Skilled Nursing Facility, Denominator, MedPAR	1991- Current CMS release<br />2	Part D Drug Event research files	2006 - Current CMS release<br />3	Minimum Datasets (MDS)	1999 - Current CMS release<br />4	Home Health Outcome and Asset Information Set (OASIS)	1999 - Current CMS release<br />5	Medicaid research files - Person Summary, Inpatient, Prescription Drug, Other Services/Other Therapy, Long-Term Care  <br /> 1999- Current CMS release</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>General Requirement<br />Independently, not as an agent of the US Government, the Contractor shall furnish the necessary material and equipment needed to carry out the tasks on this SOW. All work under this service contract shall be monitored by the NIA Project Officer.</p>
<p>I.	GOVERNMENT RESPONSIBILITIES</p>

<CONTACT>Jeffrey A. Norris, Phone 3019954846, Email jeffrey.a.norris@navy.mil
<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION <br />PMA-262
<p>Developmental efforts to produce a Sense and Avoid (SAA) radar capability for Triton have failed to produce a design that meets performance and manufacturing requirements to successfully implement this critical technology.</p>
<p>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. RESPONSES IN ANY FORM ARE NOT OFFERS AND THE GOVERNMENT IS UNDER NO OBLIGATION TO AWARD A CONTRACT AS A RESULT OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT INTEND TO AWARD A CONTRACT ON THE BASIS OF THIS REQUEST FOR INFORMATION OR OTHERWISE PAY FOR THE INFORMATION SOLICITED.</p>
<p>This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes - it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. This request for information does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. Further, the Navy is not at this time seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals. Respondees are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI; all costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested party's expense. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any is issued. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website. It is the responsibility of the potential offerors to monitor this site for additional information pertaining to this requirement.</p>
<p>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) in support of PMA-262 is surveying industry for Airborne Radar/Antenna capabilities that can serve to meet MQ-4C Triton Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) SAA Radar capability requirements. The information obtained through this effort will be used to further assist in the formulation of requirements, and acquisition approaches/plans for future investment.</p>
<p>The MQ-4C Triton UAS [previously referred to as Broad Area Maritime System (BAMS)] will provide persistent maritime Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) capability in support of a full Range of Military Operations (ROMO). To execute this mission set, the MQ-4C UAS will require worldwide airspace access to include the U.S. National Airspace System (NAS), international, and foreign airspace. The requirement to operate globally dictates that the MQ-4C UAS possess capabilities that will comply with civil and military airspace operating regulations, including the U.S. International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) ANNEX 2, Section, 3.2, U.S. Code of Regulations (CFR), Part 91.111 and 91.113, and Department of Defense Instruction (DoDI) 4540.01. These regulations address Pilot in Command (PIC) responsibilities for maintaining safe separation, and avoiding collisions with other aircraft and provide requirements guidance for development of an Alternative Means of Compliance (AMOC) to these regulations.</p>
<p>The SAA Air-Air Radar system shall be designed to fit within defined Size, Weight and Power (SWaP) constraints of the MQ-4C UAS, and that the system be modular and scalable for application in other Type/Model/Series (T/M/S) UAS. Furthermore, the SAA Radar must be capable of operating in a wide-range of natural, induced and air-traffic environments expected over the MQ-4C life-cycle, during all phase of flight. Due to performance impacts associated with ground clutter, it is anticipated that an on-board air-air radar may require supplemental capability from ground based radars when operating in the terminal environment, below certain altitudes. As such, SAA radar development growth provisions (spiral acquisition accomplished via an incremental approach) to address near term operational needs, with future requirements/standards maturation within the civil and military aviation airspace should be identified. A modular, scalable design, coupled with an incremental development approach is envisioned. The SAA system shall provide initial operating capability for Due Regard operations as defined in DODI 4540.01. Based on the MQ-4C Triton mission profiles, Attachment 1 provides insight into the expected operating and performance requirements system.</p>
<p>To understand each company's radar/antenna equipment, certain data documenting the technology, design, performance characteristics and associated costs are desired. Describe your product(s), their current state of maturity, and address the questions provided in Attachment 2, where possible and to the extent practical. Interested parties are requested to respond to this RFI by completing Attachment 2. In addition, any substantiating supplemental background, comparative analysis or trade studies that can be provided will greatly improve the government's understanding of your product in a white paper.</p>
<p>White papers in Microsoft Word for Office 2010 compatible format are due no later than 18 December 2014, 1700 EST. Responses shall be limited to 20 pages in length on 8.5 x 11 paper with one inch margins and font no smaller than 10 pt. Times New Roman or Courier New. A two sided page will be considered one page for the purpose of counting the 20 page limit for Section 2 and submitted via e-mail only to Daniel.Haertle@navy.mil with 45 of days of the publication date of this RFI. Proprietary information, if any, should be minimized and MUST BE CLEARLY MARKED. To aid the Government, please segregate proprietary information. Please be advised that all submissions become Government property and will not be returned. Responses to this RFI that indicate that the information therein is proprietary or represents confidential business information will be received and held in confidence for U.S. Government use only. This RFI is the initiation of market research under Part 10 of the FAR, and is not a Request for Proposals (RFP). However, the information from the vendor responses may be used in formulating requirements for a RFP. Vendors are advised that NAVAIR uses consultant contractors to assist in review of RFI information and appropriate non-disclosure agreements are included in these support contracts.</p>
<p>Section 1 of the attachment shall not be included in the 20-page limitation, it shall provide administrative information, and include the following as a minimum:</p>
<p>Name, mailing address, overnight delivery address (if different from mailing address), facility security clearance of the offeror, phone number, fax number, and e-mail of designated point of contact.</p>
<p>Section 2 of the white paper shall answer the issues addressed in Attachment 1 of this RFI and shall be limited to 20 pages.</p>
<p>NAVAIR representatives may or may not choose to meet with potential offerors. Such discussions would only be intended to get further clarification of potential capability to meet the requirements, especially any development and certification risks.</p>
<p>Questions regarding this announcement shall be submitted in writing by e-mail to the Contracting Officer, Daniel.Haertle@navy.mil. Verbal questions will NOT be accepted. Questions will be answered by posting answers to the FedBizOpps website; accordingly, questions shall NOT contain proprietary or classified information.

<DESC><strong>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY.</strong> The US Army Special Operations Command (USASOC), on behalf of the U.S. Army John F. Kennedy Special Warfare Center and School (USAJFKSWCS), is performing market research for a potential Business and Economic Development training program. The concept for the training was derived from the "Business on the Front Lines" curriculum, offered by the University of Notre Dame; the potential training module will be expanded to meet the unique needs of the U.S. Army Civil Affairs operators and Special Forces personnel. The purpose of this request for information is to survey industry for an accredited academic institution that can meet the unique requirements of a military-focused program. The accredited institution would provide all personnel, equipment, supplies, facilities, transportation, tools, materials, supervision and non-personal services necessary to perform Business and Economic problem-solving instruction that would be defined in detail in the Performance Work Statement (PWS) and as described in the brief synopsis below.
<p><br />The USAJFKSWCS trains, educates, develops and manages world-class Civil Affairs, Psychological Operations, and Special Forces warriors and leaders in order to provide the Army Special Operations Forces (ARSOF) regiments with professionally trained, highly educated, innovative and adaptive operators. Currently, the Civil Affairs Qualification Course (CAQC) and doctrinal framework does not afford the user the ability to adequately analyze economic factors directly impacting stability and those that contribute to violence in vulnerable civilian populations. Training in economic analysis and business in war-torn societies would greatly benefit future Civil Affairs Team Leaders and Non-Commissioned Officers by enhancing their ability to apply non-lethal, innovative economic solutions which support Department of Defense (DoD) and Department of State goals. The primary purpose of the course and seminar would be to increase Civil Affairs soldiers' understanding of business and economics, and prepare them to properly frame economic problem sets and apply business principles in order to develop innovative and sustainable solutions in support of governance and development while deployed. The secondary objective of the potential training would be the establishment of a greater involvement with, and presence of, Civil Affairs within the larger academic and international community that will increase operational relevancy and situational awareness.</p>
<p>The Business and Economic Development training would possibly consist of two parts; the first being three (3) five-day course instruction iterations and the second part consisting of three (3) two-day seminar-focused trainings, including train-the-trainer instruction. The anticipated period of performance is a 12-month base year with four (4) one-year option periods. The accredited institution shall develop the course syllabus to encompass at a minimum all the objectives of the PWS. The anticipated primary place of performance for the five-day course would be hosted at the institution-provided facility; the two-day seminars will be conducted at the USAJFKSWSC facility in Fort Bragg, NC. All responses would be used to identify qualified and interested institutions only if the Government determines this training is required and approved. This is not a request for quote. As stated this is only a request for information and will be used for market research only. Please provide a brief response to Ms. Megan Brady, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">megan.brady@soc.mil</span>, <strong>no later than 1300 EST Friday, 07 November 2014</strong>, if you believe that your institution can provide the above Business and Economic Development training detailed above.</p>

<DESC>The United States Air Force, AFLCMC/Operational Contracting Division, Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio 45433-5344. This is a Sole Source synopsis published for informational purposes only. This proposed action is for the procurement of a Stryker Neurovascular System. The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1).
<p>This proposed procurement will be a Sole Source under North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) 339113 - Surgical Appliance and Supplies Manufacturing. Business size standard is for NAICS 339113 is 500 employees.</p>
<p>The proposed source is Stryker Corporation, 47900 Bayside Parkway, Fremont, CA, 94538-6515. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations. However, all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, quotation or exception to the intent to purchase on a sole source basis, which shall be considered by the Government if received by 12:01 pm Local (Wright-Patterson AFB) Time, Thursday,&nbsp;6 Nov 14. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>In order to comply with FAR 5.207(c)(15), the reason for lack of competition is as follows: The Stryker Neurovascular System is the only known system that the Neuro Surgeon is trained on for this type of procedure. The Neuro surgeon has trained using these Stryker implants and plating systems and if these items are not used the surgery would need to be sent off base at a substantial duplication of cost of approximately $200,000.00.</p>
<p>The Department of Defense (DoD) has determined the System for Award Management (SAM) to be the single DoD registration for contractors who conduct business or who are interested in conducting business with the DoD. Contractors must be registered in SAM prior to award for solicitations issued after 29 May 2012. You may contact SAM by telephone at 866-606-8220 or online at https://www.sam.gov.</p>

<DESC><p>The United States Air Force, AFLCMC/Operational Contracting Division, Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio 45433-5344. This is a Sole Source synopsis published for informational purposes only. This proposed action is for the procurement of Teleradiology Services. The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1).</p>
<p>This proposed procurement will be a Sole Source under North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) 621111 - Office of Physicians (Except Mental Health Specialists). Business size standard is for NAICS 621111 is $11M.</p>
<p>The proposed source is Valor Network Inc., 7 Hemptor Road, New City, NY 10956. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations. However, all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, quotation or exception to the intent to purchase on a sole source basis, which shall be considered by the Government if received by 1:00 pm Local (Wright-Patterson AFB) Time, Friday,&nbsp;7 November 14. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>In order to comply with FAR 5.207(c)(15), the reason for lack of competition is as follows: Valor Network Inc. currently has the unique capability of USAF authorization to electronically extract radiologic diagnostic imaging studies, the physician staff to interpret and report on the radiologic diagnostic imaging studies/exams and lastly the ability to place the patient reports into the DoD Composite Healthcare Computer System (CHCS) in each patient record in the same manner the&nbsp;Wright-Patterson radiologists would so that the ordering physician gets the results; maintaining continuity of care and patient reporting. Valor Network Inc. is the only vendor granted access by the Air Force Surgeon General's Office to the USAF electronic patient medical record system (CHCS) with Department of Defense Information Assurance Certification and Accreditation Process (DIACAP) approval with the USAF. In order to reliably provide services to produce routine and urgent reports within required timeframe, remote connectivity must be established. Without approval and access to CHCS and DIACAP, the vendor will not be able to remotely connect to interpret and report on the patient's medical records. No other vendors have received USAF permission by the Air Force Surgeon General to electronically interface with CHCS and DIACAP for the purpose of interpreting and reporting on radiologic diagnostic images/exams. The Air Force Surgeon General's Office estimated that obtaining the appropriate CHCS and DIACAP authorizations required to perform this contract could take (at the very least) 12-24 months.</p>
<p>The Department of Defense (DoD) has determined the System for Award Management (SAM) to be the single DoD registration for contractors who conduct business or who are interested in conducting business with the DoD. Contractors must be registered in SAM prior to award for solicitations issued after 29 May 2012. You may contact SAM by telephone at 866-606-8220 or online at https://www.sam.gov.</p>
<p>Any information should be e-mailed to Kelli.Vaughn@us.af.mil no later than 1:00 pm Local (Wright-Patterson AFB) Time, Friday,&nbsp;7 November 14. Only inquiries/information received by this date will be considered.</p>
<p>Be advised that all correspondence sent via e-mail shall contain a subject line that reads "FA8601-15-T-0035, Teleradiology Services." Note that e-mail filters at Wright-Patterson AFB are designed to filter e-mails without subject lines or with suspicious subject lines or contents (i.e., .exe, or .zip files). Therefore, if this subject line is not included, the e-mail may not get through the e-mail filters. Also be advised that .zip or .exe files are not allowable attachments and may be deleted by the e-mail filters at Wright-Patterson AFB.

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD SOLE SOURCE
<p>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. This is a notice of intent to award a sole source contract under statutory authority 10 USC 2304(c) (1), set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.<br /><br />The Reference Number is N6889815RCBG807. The 628th Contracting Squadron, 101 E. Hill Blvd., Joint Base Charleston, intents to award a sole source contract for linear thermistor sensors and thermistor meters to Omega Engineering Inc.</p>
<p>The 628th Contracting Squadron intends to make an award to Omega Engineering Inc. 1 Omega drive, box 4047, CT 06907-0047. Market research was performed and information gathered in determining this company to be the only source for this requirement.</p>
<p>In accordance with (IAW) FAR Part 5.207(c) (15) (ii), the proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1(b) (ii). This notice of intent to award is not a request for competitive proposals; however responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency. A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>The justification for the sole source requirements as follows:</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR 6.303-2:</p>
<p>(1) Agency and Activity: 628 Contracting Squadron, Joint Base Charleston, SC</p>
<p>(2) Nature of action being approved: Sole source acquisition.</p>
<p>(3) The purpose of this acquisition is to provide thermistor meters and thermistor sensors for the Nuclear Power Training Unit at JB Charleston.</p>
<p>(4) Justification Rationale: IAW FAR 6.302-1(a) (2) Only one source is capable of providing the requirement because Omega Engineering Inc. is the manufacturer of these exact thermistor models. The Omega DP-25-TH-A thermistor meter and the Omega OL-705-PP thermistor sensor are required for performance of testing in the moored training ship at JB Charleston.</p>
<p>(5) Demonstration of Unique Qualifications: The test panel housing for the Moored training ship are specifically designed and configured to house these thermistors, other vendor model of thermistors would not have a similar physical configuration and require a complete re-design and re-manufacturing of the test panels. Also these thermistors are compatible with all three series of our temperature display, able to effectively communicate with our display and data acquisition software, avalable in sufficient quantity and meet the strict accuracy requirements for testing.</p>
<p>(6) Description of Solicitation Efforts: IAW FAR 5.102(a) (2), this notice will be posted on the Government-wide Point of Entry (FedBizOpps.gov), but retained in the contract file to document the rationale for a sole source award.</p>
<p>(7) The contracting officer has determined that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable based upon previous awards made to similar products.</p>
<p>(8) Description of market research: A GSA Advantage and SBA search yield no businesses able to perform the required services. These specific Thermistors are manufactured by Omega Engineering Inc. Extensive market research has been accomplished in order to confirm that no other sources can provide the requirements.</p>
<p>(9) Other supporting facts: Nuclear Power Training Unit has been unable to identify other thermistors in the stock system or with any outside vendor that meets both the technical (output, accuracy) and physical configuration required for the Moored Training Ship Testing.</p>
<p>(10) Interested Sources: Other companies were found with similar thermistors but non with the specific technical requirements that are needed.</p>
<p>(11) Actions to prevent barriers that may lead to restricted consideration in the future: <br />The Government will continue to survey the market for other alternatives and to increase competition.</p>
<p>(12) This justification is accurate and complete to the best of the contracting officer's knowledge and belief.</p>

<SUBJECT>GitHub Enterprise Licenses for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)
<SOLNBR>SS-CFPB-15-0005
<RESPDATE>111014
<CONTACT>Steve J Erb, Contract Specialist, Fax 304-480-7204, Email PSB3@bpd.treas.gov - Carey Gropp, Ms., Fax 304-480-7204, Email PSB3@bpd.treas.gov
<DESC>The Bureau of the Fiscal Service, on behalf of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) intends to award an Order to GitHub Inc. on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 6.302-1, for GitHub Enterprise Software Licenses.
<p>Github Enterprise (GE) is a web-based, project management and source code control software used by software developers. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) Office of Technology and Innovation (T&amp;I) uses GE for its source code control software. Due to T&amp;I's continued use of GE, and planned use by additional new employees and contractors, CFPB has an ongoing need for GE licenses.<br /><br />GE resides behind CFPB's firewall, and includes such features as issue tracking; collaborative code review and assignment; documentation; software versioning and permissions; which when combined allow a software developer to manage an entire team of software developers working on a particular project. The source code is vital to the development of all of CFPB's software applications featured on its website. GE also allows CFPB to publish its open source code to Git, which enables users in the public domain to use the open source code. GE also integrates with Jenkins, the continuous integration tool used by the CFPB. The tool integration allows for seamless software deployments to development, test and production servers.</p>
<p>Additionally, GE features two-factor security authentication. The authentication prevents unauthorized access to CFPB's GE account and its proprietary, non-public source code. Any product used by CFPB for source code and project management must utilize two-factor authentication for its security procedures.<br /><br />Since the launch of CFPB, T&amp;I has used Git and GE for its source code management and software development process. Currently, CFPB has thousands of lines of code contained in GE. Switching to another source code management framework or software would require this code to be copied and retested before being deployed, and force CFPB to restructure and write new standard procedures for its Development team. These tasks could take about a year to make and put all software development projects on hold. Such changes would carry a significant administrative burden, and would ultimately be detrimental to the CFPB development team's ability to develop and maintain software code. Dedicating 3-5 full time employees to move test and redeploy the code to another tool would create financial burden as well.</p>
<p>Therefore, Github Enterprise is the only software capable of meeting CFPB's needs. This software is only available through the manufacturer, GitHub, Inc. Accordingly, GitHub, Inc. is the only source capable of meeting CFPB's needs.</p>
<p>No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, the Government will consider responses received by November 10, 2014 by 2:00pm ET. Responses shall be submitted to PSB3@bpd.treas.gov, Attention S. Erb/C. Gropp.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>Interested offerors may register at http://www.fedbizopps.gov to receive notification when the solicitation and any amendments are issued and available for downloading. Please note that the General Services Administration provides the notification service as a convenience and does not guarantee that notifications will be received by all persons on the mailing list. Therefore, we recommend that you monitor the FedBizOpps site for all information relevant to desired acquisitions.

<DESC><p>The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) intends to make a sole source award to Debtwire (Mergermarkets) for annual online subscription services as a necessary source of credit quality, debt obligation, and financial news information for the PBGC insured inventory. A subscription to Debtwire (accessed via the Internet) gives the Corporate Finance &amp; Restructuring Department (CFRD) Financial Analysts access to information that is necessary for CFRD to assess the credit quality of pension plan sponsors and assist in the decision of whether or not to terminate a pension plan. Debtwire updates financial news and debt ratings on a regular basis, as events occur that impact the credit quality of the company.</p>
<p>There are a couple of independent research providers, including the rating agencies (Moody's and S&amp;P). What differentiates Debtwire is their intelligence on the latest advisory engagements and intercreditor negotiations. No<br />other competitor offers that information.</p>
<p>The contract action is being sought under the FAR 6. 302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The anticipated Period of Performance (PoP) is a 12-month Base Period of December 23, 2014 through December 22, 2015, four (4) 1-year options December 23, 2015 through December 22, 2016, December 23, 2016 through December 22, 2017, December 23, 2017 through December 22, 2018, and December 23, 2018 through December 22, 2019.</p>
<p>This is not a request for proposals but a Notice of Intent. No solicitation will be issued. Interested parties may, however, request further information (no later than 8:00AM Eastern Standard Time, on November 10, 2014) by email to the Contract Specialist, Julian O. Boggan Sr. at boggan.julian@pbgc.gov.</p>

<DESC>This Special Notice is to inform interested parties of the posted DRAFT Request for Proposal (RFP) and the DRAFT T2017 Manuals for comment/consideration in preparation of a future post of the FINAL TRICARE Managed Care Support Solicitation T2017.<br />&nbsp;<br />INTRODUCTION <br />The Defense Health Agency (DHA) wishes to further develop its current TRICARE Managed Care Support (MCS) requirements for health care support services, including (but not limited to) customer service/call center support activities, referral/authorization processing, claims adjudication, provider network development and management, beneficiary and provider education, medical evacuations, and other activities related to the delivery of health care in locations within the 50 United States and the District of Columbia. DHA seeks feedback from the commercial health care industry regarding the structure of a contemplated formal MCS contract solicitation and the adequacy of its description (as identified in the draft Request for Proposals (RFP)). DHA also seeks information from industry to enable inclusion of commercial best practices into the Government's objectives and requirements in a way that will encourage competition. Suggestions from industry will be considered; however, the Government reserves the right to solicit for the required services in a manner of its choosing in accordance with applicable procurement regulations.<br />DHA is currently in the requirements definition and acquisition planning state for the follow-on to the current MCS contracts. Before proposals are formally solicited, DHA is releasing the DRAFT RFP included in this Special Notice for industry comment. Responses to this request for comment on the draft RFP are due by 4:00 PM Mountain Standard Time (MST) on December 8, 2014.<br /><br />OVERVIEW<br />The health care services to be procured in this acquisition represent a continuing, statutorily defined requirement. TRICARE Health Care Programs, including the benefit structure and required administrative functions, are codified at Chapter 55 of Title 10, United States Code (U.S.C.), and Title 32, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 199. The Department of Defense (DoD) is responsible for administration of medical, dental, and pharmacy programs that provide health care to active duty, active duty family members, and retired military members and their families, as well as family member survivors. In order to fulfill this responsibility, DoD provides health care directly through military treatment facilities reimburses for the care furnished by private sector health care providers. This acquisition is to purchase health care support services and for the integration of that private sector care with the DoD direct care system. The total eligible non-overseas population in the United States is approximately 9.2 million beneficiaries.<br /><br />DISCLAIMER<br />This Special Notice is issued for informational purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation. Information contained herein does not necessarily reflect all requirements to be found in any future solicitation. Contract requirements and/or statutorily required provisions may be added, altered or deleted as a result of input from industry and internal Government analysis during the development of the RFP. Neither unsolicited proposals nor any other kinds of offers will be considered in response to this Special Notice. Responses to this notice are not offers and will not be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Responders are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this Special Notice. All information received in response to this Special Notice that is marked Proprietary will be handled accordingly. Responses to the Special Notice will not be returned.<br /><br />CONCLUSION<br />Please submit responses via e-mail in Microsoft Office 2010 format or hard copy by 4:00 PM Mountain Standard Time (MST) on December 8, 2014 to the Point of Contact (POC). Earlier responses are encouraged.<br />This Special Notice seeks feedback of the DRAFT RFP (to include the attachments) and the adequacy of its description. Responders are asked to key their comments to specific paragraphs/sections in the documents where appropriate. To the extent that simplifying assumptions are needed, respondents are encouraged to make and document such assumptions in their responses. Additionally, the Government seeks industry's feedback on alternative concepts or new technologies or approaches that could meet the functional requirements of the contemplated solicitation. Capability statements, promotional material, or sales pitches are not desired. Responses by consultants or attorneys shall disclose themselves as such and describe or identify the client or clientele served. Comments regarding any T2017 postings prior to this Special Notice will not be entertained at this time.<br />

Inspection/Acceptance: Inspection and acceptance will be pursuant to FAR 52.212-4(a) and the Statement of Work. <p> STATEMENT OF WORK-- High throughput sequencing of amplicons from in vitro evolution experiments. <p> 1.  INTRODUCTION <p> High throughput sequencing (HTS) provides critical insight into populations of in vitro evolved RNAs.  The evolved RNA populations are used to generate DNA amplicons that are specifically designed and prepared for analysis on Illumina HTS instruments. Illumina HTS instruments are expensive, frequently improved, and require considerable expertise to operate efficiently. Therefore, we are seeking outside service providers to carry out HTS for our in vitro evolution projects. <p> 2.  SCOPE <p> Periodic sequencing of indexed DNA libraries on Illumina HTS instruments. The DNA libraries are amplicons prepared at the NASA Ames Research Center. The libraries are designed to be run on Illumina HTS instruments, but they are not prepared using Illuminas sample preparation kits; however, previous preparations of these amplicon libraries have been successfully sequenced on an Illuminas Hiseq 2000 instrument. <p> For each service ordered, the contractor shall have representative available to discuss the specifics of NASAs library design and any recent changes to the requirements and capabilities of Illumina instruments. <p> Two types of sequencing runs are required. The first type of sequencing runs shall be provided on 1 to 3 lanes of an HTS flow cell on a HiSeq instrument (1 x 100 bases, single end reads). The contractor shall run samples on a single lane on a HiSeq instrument. The second type of sequencing runs shall be provided on a MiSeq instrument (2 x 250 bases, paired end reads).  HTS data shall be provided in fastq format and data from indexed samples shall be sorted into separate index-specific fastq files. NASA estimates requirement for-- but does guarantee orders-- from 2 to 7 sets of sequencing runs per year. Each set of sequencing runs will require 1-3 HiSeq lanes and/or 1-3 MiSeq lanes. <p> Deliverables The contractor shall provide the following: - Files with sequencing data from the sequencing run in fasq format. Sequence data will be demultiplexed i.e. sorted into separate fastq files based on sequencing indexes. - A summary of standard sequencing run statistics.

Within this clause, COR means Contracting Officer's Representative. If there is no COR appointed and identified to the Contractor, the term instead will mean the Program Manager or any other authorized individual responsible for technical oversight under the contract. "Work site" means the Government facility, office, construction site, and any other area within the Government office or facility that the Contractor must access to accomplish work under this contract.<br />(2) The work performed under this contract shall only be accomplished by individuals (in the employment of the Contractor or any subcontractors) whose conduct and behavior is consistent with the efficiency of the Federal Service and the requirements of this contract, and who are acceptable to the CO. If Reclamation finds a Contractor employee to be unsuitable or unfit for his or her assigned duties, the CO will direct the Contractor to remove the individual from the contract and access to the Federal facility at which the contract activities are occurring.<br />(3) The Contractor's employees governed by this contract may need access to sensitive information and/or sensitive areas. The Federal Government (Government) reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to determine suitability of Contractor personnel and deny access to any sensitive information or project specific area to any personnel for any cause.<br />(4) The Contractor is responsible for informing and ensuring compliance by its employees with any applicable security procedures of the Government facility where work may be performed under this contract.<br />(5) Any Contractor employee that will have access to a Federally-controlled facility or information system will be required to have a Government-issued identification card, consisting of a Personal Identity Verification (PIV) Card, a temporary identification card, or a visitor badge. During performance of the contract, the Contractor shall keep the COR apprised of any changes in personnel, or changes in personnel access or duration, to ensure that performance is not delayed by compliance with credentialing processes.<br />(6) A Contractor employee will not be provided access to a Government facility or information system until a Government PIV Card, temporary identification card, or visitor identification badge has been issued to the Contractor employee. For those individuals that will be receiving a PIV Card, the Government may, at its discretion, issue a temporary identification card or visitor identification badge after the electronic background investigation forms have been received and the investigation is initiated.<br />(7) All Contractor employees shall access the facility via the facility's entry screening system and visibly display the Government-issued PIV Card, temporary identification card, or visitor identification badge at all times. Contractor employees must visibly wear the Government-issued identification card at all times they are on Government facilities. Contractor employees are responsible for the safekeeping of all Government-issued identification cards, whether on-site or off-site. Cards that have been lost, damaged, or stolen must be reported to the COR within 24 hours. The Contractor shall return all identification cards and card keys and any other Government property and information upon completion of performance or when personnel depart permanently or for a period of 7 days or more. The Contractor may be required to turn in access control cards or identification cards on a daily basis.<br />(8) Misuse or loss of access control or identification cards, or failure to comply with required surrender of such cards may, at Government discretion, result in Contractor personnel being denied access to the work site, at no cost to Government. The Contractor may be charged up to $500 for each occurrence for any required replacement of Government-issued access control or identification cards due to loss or misuse. At the end of contract performance, or when a Contractor employee is no longer working under this contract, the Contractor shall ensure that all access control and identification cards are returned to the COR.<br />(9) All Contractor personnel, including subcontractor personnel, with access to the work site shall be U.S. citizens or foreign individuals legally residing in, or legally admitted to, the U.S. For all non-U.S. citizens working under this contract, the Contractor shall provide to the COR, legible and valid copies of the individual's passport and visa (unless individual is on the Visa Waiver Program) a minimum of 14 calendar days prior to beginning work or arriving at the facility. A driver's license is not acceptable identification. In addition, a completed form I-94 shall be submitted to the COR upon the individual's arrival at the work facility and prior to beginning work. For those individuals with access to the work site, the Contractor shall also provide documentation that the foreign individual is legally residing in, or has been legally admitted to the U.S.<br />(10) The Contractor shall report all contacts with entities, individuals, and counsel/representatives (including foreign entities and foreign nationals) who seek in any way to obtain unauthorized access to sensitive information or areas. The Contractor shall report any violations of contract provisions, laws, executive orders, regulations, and guidance to the Contracting Officer (CO). The Contractor shall report any information raising a doubt as to whether an individual's eligibility for continued employment or access to sensitive information is consistent with the interests of National Security and the Public Trust.<br />(11) Unsanctioned, negligent, or willful inappropriate action on the part of the Contractor (or its employees) may result in termination of the contract or removal of some Contractor employees from Reclamation facilities at no cost to the Government. These actions include, but are not limited to, exploration of a sensitive system and/or information, introduction of unauthorized and/or malicious software, or failure to follow prescribed access control policies and/or security procedures. Failure to comply with Reclamation policies, procedures, or other published security requirements may result in termination of the contract or removal of some contracted employees from Reclamation buildings and/or facilities at no cost to the Government.<br />(12) All provisions of this clause shall equally apply to all subcontractors. The Contractor shall incorporate the substance of this clause in all subcontracts.<br />(13) These security requirements apply to all sections of this Contract including Contract Drawings and other Contract Specifications as applicable. Related documents include other general provisions of Construction or Operations and Maintenance type Contracts, including FAR clauses by reference or as amended by related documents.<br />(b) Information Security Requirements.<br />(1) Sensitive Information. The term "sensitive information" means any information which warrants a degree of protection and administrative control as defined by Reclamation or that meets the criteria for exemption from public disclosure set forth under Sections 552 and 552a of Title 5, United States Code: the Freedom of Information Act and the Privacy Act. Sensitive information is generally categorized as FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY (FOUO) information or CONTROLLED UNCLASSIFIED INFORMATION (CUI), but in some cases may include other unclassified information. (The protection of National Security information is beyond the scope of this clause. If any work on National Security information is required under this contract, it is addressed under other contract clauses.) The Contractor shall protect this type of information from unauthorized release into public domain, or to unauthorized persons, organizations, or subcontractors. Information which, either alone or in aggregate, is deemed sensitive by Reclamation shall be handled and protected in accordance with Reclamation directives and standards for identifying and safeguarding sensitive information (SLE 02-01), which is available from the COR or at<br />http://www.usbr.gov/recman/DandS.html#sle.<br />(i) Any Government-furnished information or material does not become the property of the Contractor and may be withdrawn at any time. Upon expiration or termination of the contract, all documents released to the Contractor and any material created using data from such documents shall be returned to the COR for final disposition. Government-furnished information residing on any electronic systems (laptops, servers, desktops, media) shall be deleted from those systems using a COR-approved data erasure solution. Only with prior authorization from the CO may the Contractor retain the material. The Contractor or subcontractor shall not disclose or release the materials provided to the Contractor to any individuals of the Contractor's organization not directly engaged in providing services under the contract or that do not have a valid need-to-know. All technical data provided to the Contractor by the Government shall be protected from public or private disclosure in accordance with the markings printed on them. All other information relating to the items to be delivered or the services to be performed under this contract shall not be disclosed by any means without prior approval of the CO. Prohibited dissemination or disclosure includes, but is not limited to: permitting access to such information by foreign nationals or by immigrant aliens who may be employed by the Contractor, publication of technical or scientific papers, advertising, disclosure to Contractor staff not investigated and deemed acceptable at the appropriate information sensitivity level, and any other public release. The Contractor shall maintain, and furnish upon request of the CO, records of the names of individuals who have access to sensitive material in its custody. All questions regarding information security, access, and control shall be referred to the COR.<br />(ii) The Contractor shall not release to anyone outside the Contractor's organization any sensitive, or otherwise protected information, regardless of medium in which it is contained (for example, film, tape, document, electronic), pertaining to any part of this contract or any Reclamation program or activity, unless the CO has given prior written approval. This includes, but is not limited to, news releases, marketing promotions, articles, interviews, reports, and any other media releases. Requests for approval shall identify the specific information to be released, the medium to be used, the purpose for the release, and a description of the need-to-know. The Contractor shall submit its request to the CO ten business days before the proposed date for release. Subcontractors shall submit requests for authorization to release through the prime Contractor to the CO.<br />(iii) The Contractor shall notify the COR immediately when known or suspected loss/compromise of sensitive information or other documents, notes, drawings, sketches, reports, photographs, exposed film or similar information which may affect the security interests of Government has occurred. This requirement extends to employees and other personnel working on behalf of the Contractor, and expands responsibility to include prompt reporting of security issues, including observed or subsequently discovered efforts by unauthorized persons to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information.<br />(b) Classified Information.<br /> (i) The disclosure of U.S. Government documents by third parties can result in damage to our national security. While this contract may not deal directly with classified information, each contractor is obligated to protect classified information pursuant to all applicable laws and to use Government information technology systems in accordance with agency procedures so that the integrity of such systems is not compromised.<br /> (ii) Unauthorized disclosures of classified documents (whether in print, on a blog, or on websites, or other electronic or non-electronic media) do not alter the documents' classified status or automatically result in declassification of the documents. To the contrary, classified information, whether or not already posted on public websites or disclosed to the media, remains classified, and must be treated as such by Federal employees and contractors, until it is declassified by an appropriate U.S. Government authority. Executive Order 13526, Classified National Security Information (December 29, 2009), Section 1.1.(c) states, "Classified Information shall not be declassified automatically as a result of any unauthorized disclosure of identical or similar information." Although the Department has taken steps to secure access to publicly published classified materials from Departmental computers, it is important to understand our continuing duties and responsibilities in this regard.<br /> (iii) Contractors (which include all employees of the contractor, as well as subcontractors and its employees performing work for the contractor) are reminded of the following obligations with respect to the treatment of classified information and the use of non-classified government information technology systems:<br /> (iv) Except as authorized by agency procedures, the contractor shall not, while using Government issued computers or other devices (such as Blackberries or Smart Phones) access the web on non-classified Government systems, or access documents that are marked classified (including classified documents made publicly available by a third party), as doing so risks that material still classified will be placed onto nonclassified systems. This requirement applies to access that occurs either through agency or contractor computers, or through employee or contractor personally owned computers that access non-classified Government systems. This requirement does not restrict contractor access to non-classified, publicly available news reports (and other non-classified material) that may in turn discuss classified material, as distinguished from access to underlying documents that themselves are marked classified (including if the underlying classified documents are available on public Web sites or otherwise in the public domain).<br /> (v) Contractors are reminded that only Department of Defense (DoD) facility clearances and personnel with appropriate security clearances will be issued for any bureau or office entering into a contract where classified information may be obtained. Only those personnel granted a security clearance by DoD will be acceptable to the Department of the Interior for access to classified information. Consequently, any classified contracts will be coordinated through the Reclamation Chief Security Officer, or for IT requirements, the Bureau Chief Information Security Officer (BCISO). Therefore, no contractor shall access classified information unless proper clearances have been obtained<br /> (vi) Classified information shall not be removed from official premises or disclosed without proper authorization.<br /> (vii) Contractors who believe they may have inadvertently accessed or downloaded classified or sensitive information on computers that access the web via non-classified government systems, or without prior authorization, should contact their Contracting Officer immediately.<br />(End of Clause)

SECTION C - CONTRACT CLAUSES

C.1  FSS RFQ INTRODUCTORY LANGUAGE
  The terms and conditions of the contractor's FSS contract (including any contract modifications) apply to all Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPA) and task or delivery orders issued under the contract as a result of this RFQ.  When a lower price has been established, or when the delivery terms, FOB terms, or ordering requirements have been modified by the BPA or task/delivery order, those modified terms will apply to all purchases made pursuant to it and take precedence over the FSS contract.  Any unique terms and conditions of a BPA or order issued under the contract that are not a part of the applicable FSS contract will govern.  In the event of an inconsistency between the terms and conditions of a BPA or task/delivery order and the Contractor's FSS terms, other than those identified above, the terms of the FSS contract will take precedence.

The Government reserves the right to inspect or test any supplies or services that have been tendered for acceptance. The Government may require repair or replacement of nonconforming supplies or reperformance of nonconforming services at no increase in contract price.

The Government must exercise its post-acceptance rights-
    (1) Within a reasonable time after the defect was discovered or should have been discovered; and
    (2) Before any substantial change occurs in the condition of the item, unless the change is due to the defect in the item.

  (e) Definitions. The clause at FAR 52.202-1, Definitions, is incorporated herein by reference.
  (f) Excusable delays. The Contractor shall be liable for default unless nonperformance is caused by an occurrence beyond the reasonable control of the Contractor and without its fault or negligence such as, acts of God or the public enemy, acts of the Government in either its sovereign or contractual capacity, fires, floods, epidemics, quarantine restrictions, strikes, unusually severe weather, and delays of common carriers. The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer in writing as soon as it is reasonably possible after the commencement of any excusable delay, setting forth the full particulars in connection therewith, shall remedy such occurrence with all reasonable dispatch, and shall promptly give written notice to the Contracting Officer of the cessation of such occurrence.

        (A) The Contractor shall include EFT banking information on the invoice only if required elsewhere in this contract.
        (B) If EFT banking information is not required to be on the invoice, in order for the invoice to be a proper invoice, the Contractor shall have submitted correct EFT banking information in accordance with the applicable solicitation provision, contract clause (e.g., 52.232-33, Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer-System for Award Management, or 52.232-34, Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer-Other Than System for Award Management), or applicable agency procedures.
        (C) EFT banking information is not required if the Government waived the requirement to pay by EFT.

    (5) Overpayments. If the Contractor becomes aware of a duplicate contract financing or invoice payment or that the Government has otherwise overpaid on a contract financing or invoice payment, the Contractor shall-
      (i) Remit the overpayment amount to the payment office cited in the contract along with a description of the overpayment including the-

      (i) All amounts that become payable by the Contractor to the Government under this contract shall bear simple interest from the date due until paid unless paid within 30 days of becoming due. The interest rate shall be the interest rate established by the Secretary of the Treasury as provided in 41 U.S.C. 7109, which is applicable to the period in which the amount becomes due, as provided in (i)(6)(v) of this clause, and then at the rate applicable for each six-month period as fixed by the Secretary until the amount is paid.
      (ii) The Government may issue a demand for payment to the Contractor upon finding a debt is due under the contract.
      (iii) Final decisions. The Contracting Officer will issue a final decision as required by 33.211 if-

        (B) The Contractor fails to liquidate a debt previously demanded by the Contracting Officer within the timeline specified in the demand for payment unless the amounts were not repaid because the Contractor has requested an installment payment agreement; or
        (C) The Contractor requests a deferment of collection on a debt previously demanded by the Contracting Officer (see 32.607-2).
      (iv) If a demand for payment was previously issued for the debt, the demand for payment included in the final decision shall identify the same due date as the original demand for payment.
      (v) Amounts shall be due at the earliest of the following dates:
        (A) The date fixed under this contract.
        (B) The date of the first written demand for payment, including any demand for payment resulting from a default termination.

  (k) Taxes. The contract price includes all applicable Federal, State, and local taxes and duties.
  (l) Termination for the Government's convenience. The Government reserves the right to terminate this contract, or any part hereof, for its sole convenience. In the event of such termination, the Contractor shall immediately stop all work hereunder and shall immediately cause any and all of its suppliers and subcontractors to cease work. Subject to the terms of this contract, the Contractor shall be paid a percentage of the contract price reflecting the percentage of the work performed prior to the notice of termination, plus reasonable charges the Contractor can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Government using its standard record keeping system, have resulted from the termination. The Contractor shall not be required to comply with the cost accounting standards or contract cost principles for this purpose. This paragraph does not give the Government any right to audit the Contractor's records. The Contractor shall not be paid for any work performed or costs incurred which reasonably could have been avoided.
  (m) Termination for cause. The Government may terminate this contract, or any part hereof, for cause in the event of any default by the Contractor, or if the Contractor fails to comply with any contract terms and conditions, or fails to provide the Government, upon request, with adequate assurances of future performance. In the event of termination for cause, the Government shall not be liable to the Contractor for any amount for supplies or services not accepted, and the Contractor shall be liable to the Government for any and all rights and remedies provided by law. If it is determined that the Government improperly terminated this contract for default, such termination shall be deemed a termination for convenience.
  (n) Title. Unless specified elsewhere in this contract, title to items furnished under this contract shall pass to the Government upon acceptance, regardless of when or where the Government takes physical possession.
  (o) Warranty. The Contractor warrants and implies that the items delivered hereunder are merchantable and fit for use for the particular purpose described in this contract.

  (s) Order of precedence. Any inconsistencies in this solicitation or contract shall be resolved by giving precedence in the following order:
    (1) The schedule of supplies/services.
    (2) The Assignments, Disputes, Payments, Invoice, Other Compliances, Compliance with Laws Unique to Government Contracts, and Unauthorized Obligations paragraphs of this clause;
    (3) The clause at 52.212-5.
    (4) Addenda to this solicitation or contract, including any license agreements for computer software.
    (5) Solicitation provisions if this is a solicitation.
    (6) Other paragraphs of this clause.
    (7) The Standard Form 1449.
    (8) Other documents, exhibits, and attachments
    (9) The specification.
  (t) System for Award Management (SAM).
    (1) Unless exempted by an addendum to this contract, the Contractor is responsible during performance and through final payment of any contract for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.
    (2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the SAM database; (B) comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.
      (ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.
    (3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database.

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [x], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>Contractor SHALL provide the approved water distributor's name, address, and inspection responsibility code (IRC) with the bid. The water source must be approved and listed on the U.S. Army Medical Department/U.S. Army Veterinary Command Approved Sources list. This list is a comprehensive list of sanitarily approved food establishments and sources that may be utilized to provide services to the U.S. Government. The reference website is located at http://www.veterinaryservice.army.mil/sources.html. <BR> <BR>If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible contracting officer. However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC. The HQ, AMCLevel Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office or other external forum. Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO. The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing. To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below. All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. HQ Army Material Command Office of Command Counsel 9301 Chapek Rd, Room 2-1SE3401 Ft. Belvoir, VA 22060-5527 Facsimile number (703) 806-8866 or 8875 Packages sent by FedEx or UPS should be addressed to: HQ Army Material Command Office of Command Counsel Room 2-1SE3401 1412 Jackson Loop Ft.

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

<p>"Data Universal Numbering System+4 (DUNS+4) number" means the DUNS number assigned by D&amp;B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern. (D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at subpart 32.11) for the same concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the SAM registration process; and</p>
<p>(4) The Government has marked the record "Active".</p>
<p>"System for Award Management (SAM)" means the primary Government repository for prospective Federal awardee and Federal awardee information and the centralized Government system for certain contracting, grants, and other assistance-related processes. It includes-</p>

<p>(2) Prospective contractor-submitted annual representations and certifications in accordance with FAR subpart 4.12; and</p>
<p>(3) Identification of those parties excluded from receiving Federal contracts, certain subcontracts, and certain types of Federal financial and non-financial assistance and benefits.</p>
<p>(b) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>
<p>(A) Change the name in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(B) Comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12 of the FAR; and</p>
<p>(C) Agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor shall provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support he legally changed name.</p>

<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract. A change in the DUNS number does not necessarily require a novation be accomplished. Dun &amp; Bradstreet may be contacted-</p>
<p>(i) Via the internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform or if the Contractor does not have internet access, it may call Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 if located within the United States; or</p>
<p>(ii) If located outside the United States, by contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office.</p>

<p>"Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code" means-</p>
<p>(1) A code assigned by the Defense Logistics Information Service (DLIS) to identify a commercial or Government entity; or</p>
<p>(2) A code assigned by a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization that DLIS records and maintains in the CAGE master file. This type of code is known as an "NCAGE code."</p>
<p>"Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number" means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet, Inc. (D&amp;B) to identify unique business entities.</p>
<p>"Data Universal Numbering System +4 (DUNS+4) number" means the DUNS number assigned by D&amp;B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern. (D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see FAR 32.11) for the same parent concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, and Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code into the SAM database; and</p>
<p>(2) The contractor has completed the Core Data, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>

<p>252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure (Sep 2011)</p>
<p><br />a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA</p>
<p>Alternative line item structure offer where monitors are shipped separately:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA <br />0002 Monitor 20 EA</p>
<p>(End of provision)</p>
<p><br />252.225-7048 Export Controlled Items (Jun 2013)</p>
<p>(a) Definition. "Export-controlled items," as used in this clause, means items subject to the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) (15 CFR Parts 730-774) or the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) (22 CFR Parts 120-130). The term includes:</p>

<p>(b) The Contractor shall comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items, including, but not limited to, the requirement for contractors to register with the Department of State in accordance with the ITAR. The Contractor shall consult with the Department of State regarding any questions relating to compliance with the ITAR and shall consult with the Department of Commerce regarding any questions relating to compliance with the EAR.</p>
<p>(c) The Contractor's responsibility to comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items exists independent of, and is not established or limited by, the information provided by this clause.</p>
<p>(d) Nothing in the terms of this contract adds, changes, supersedes, or waives any of the requirements of applicable Federal laws, Executive orders, and regulations, including but not limited to-</p>
<p>(1) The Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (50 U.S.C. App. 2401, et seq.);</p>

<p>252.232-7010 Levies on Contract Payments (Dec 2006)</p>
<p>(a) 26 U.S.C. 6331(h) authorizes the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to continuously levy up to 100 percent of contract payments, up to the amount of tax debt.</p>
<p>(b) When a levy is imposed on a payment under this contract and the Contractor believes that the levy may result in an inability to perform the contract, the Contractor shall promptly notify the Procuring Contracting Officer in writing, with a copy to the Administrative Contracting Officer, and shall provide-</p>
<p>(1) The total dollar amount of the levy;</p>

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>

The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

(D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at subpart 32.11) for the same concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract.

<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>

<p>252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure (Sep 2011)</p>
<p><br />a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA</p>
<p>Alternative line item structure offer where monitors are shipped separately:</p>

The Contractor shall consult with the Department of State regarding any questions relating to compliance with the ITAR and shall consult with the Department of Commerce regarding any questions relating to compliance with the EAR.</p>
<p>(c) The Contractor's responsibility to comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items exists independent of, and is not established or limited by, the information provided by this clause.</p>
<p>(d) Nothing in the terms of this contract adds, changes, supersedes, or waives any of the requirements of applicable Federal laws, Executive orders, and regulations, including but not limited to-</p>

<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

Vendor is responsible to acquire RAPIDGate&reg; status and destination base individual access badge(s) activation prior to performance start date. Delays that may result from inadequate planning are contractor responsibility. Vendor instructions and program information is available at http://www.RAPIDGate.com or tel. 877.727.4342.

THE FOLLOWING PROVISIONS AND CLAUSES ARE APPLICABLE AND ARE HEREBY INCORPORATED INTO THE SOLICITATION BY REFERENCE AND BY FULL TEXT. THE FULL TEXT OF THE CLAUSES/PROVISIONS FROM THE FAR AND DFARS CAN BE ACCESSED VIA THE INTERNET USING THE FOLLOWING WEB-SITE ADDRESS: 
www.arnet.gov or http://farsite.hill.af.mil

It is the responsibility of the interested contractors to obtain copies of the necessary provisions and or clauses that are required as a part of this solicitation. Required clauses/provisions that are not submitted may render a quote not to be accepted by the Government. 

The following Clauses are applicable:


FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors - Commercial Items; NOTE: This provision must be reviewed completely.
 It contains the guidelines for submission of your quotation.

FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation of Commercial Items;  
The Government intends to award a Firm Fixed Price single award contract resulting from this solicitation on a technically acceptable, lowest price basis to responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation are evaluated and determined technically acceptable to the Government.  

The following factors shall be used to evaluate an offerors proposal: 

Technical Capability; 
Past Performance;
Price;

(A) Technical Capability: 
 
The technical capability of a vendor will be evaluated on the vendors ability to provide annual maintenance services to establish a leak-free status and certification to meet regulatory compliance requirements as specified under the scope of work.
 

For a contractors proposal to be determined technically acceptable, the contractor must furnish the following data: 

Technical data:
Technical data shall be submitted in accordance with FAR 52.212-1(a)(4). Service literature and technical data/narrative shall be submitted that clearly and sufficiently demonstrates to the Government that the Contractor has knowledge of the referenced equipment, is capable of performing all work in compliance with the Original Equipment Manufacturers technical specifications, is knowledgeable of and can meet all applicable federal and state laws and regulation, and has the training to evaluate, certify, and maintain the specified equipment. The service literature and technical data/narrative shall be no longer than three (3) pages.
 

(B) Past Performance: 

Offerors shall provide Past Performance data on your companies three most recently completed Federal Government or commercial contracts where the same type or similar services have been performed as identified under this solicitation. Data submitted shall not have exceeded (3) years since completion for same or similar services required by this solicitation.  See below for the Past Performance Information data sheet

This performance data will be used to evaluate your companies past performance in meeting contract cost/price, technical and delivery objectives. Past performance information submitted will be used to make a determination of whether the offeror has a satisfactory record of past performance.
 Offerors should, therefore, provide performance history and references to demonstrate capability and performance.

(C) Pricing: 

Contractors shall provide the following pricing information: 

The Contractor shall provide calculated itemized pricing for the annual maintenance services specified in this request for quote to include all material costs, labor costs, and transportation charges to San Diego, CA 92135, and a total cost. The contractor shall provide any published/commercial price/labor rate listings. The itemized cost will be used for evaluation purposes only. 

RATINGS: 

(A)  Technical capability factors shall be rated as Acceptable or Unacceptable. 

Offerors that comply fully with the technical capability requirements of submitting all required technical data, and the technical proposal will be rated as Acceptable and have their Past Performance data evaluated.

Offerors that do not fully comply with the technical data requirements will be rated as Unacceptable and may not be evaluated any further.

(B)  Past Performance factors shall be rated as ACCEPTABLE, UNACCEPTABLE or NEUTRAL

Past Performance ratings are as followed:

Acceptable:	Vendor has relevant past performance, no monetary assessment for non-conforming services, no 				terminations for default, met contract requirements for timely delivery and customer service.
  . 

Unacceptable:	Monetary assessment for non-conforming services, terminations for default or cause, poor 				performance, such as untimely delivery, poor customer service and inadequate equipment 

Neutral: 		No relevant past performance data available for evaluation.
 
The Government will not make award to a proposal that the Government evaluates as Unacceptable on Past Performance.  To be eligible for award, the Government must evaluate the Past Performance factor as either Acceptable or Neutral. 

The Government will give an Acceptable Past Performance rating to proposals where the offeror  has relevant past performance, no monetary assessment for non-conforming services, no terminations for default, met contract requirements for timely delivery and customer service.

The Government will give a Neutral Past Performance rating to offerors that lack a record of relevant Past Performance or for whom information on Past Performance is not available.
  In accordance with FAR 15.305 (a)(2), the Government will not evaluate such offerors favorably or unfavorably on Past Performance.  

Offerors are reminded, however, that a proposal that receives a Neutral on Past Performance may not represent the most advantageous proposal to the Government and, thus, may be an unsuccessful proposal.  Accordingly, the Contracting Officer reserves the right to determine that a higher-priced proposal with an Acceptable rating on Past Performance may be more advantageous to the Government than a lower-priced proposal with a Neutral rating on Past Performance.   

The Government may reject any or all proposals, if such action is in the best interest of the Government.
 The Government may waive informalities and minor irregularities in proposals received. The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract(s) without discussions with offerors (except clarifications) as described in FAR 15.306(a)). 

Therefore, the offerors initial proposal should contain the offerors best terms from a cost or price and technical standpoint. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary. If the Contracting Officer determines that the number of proposals that would otherwise be in the competitive range exceeds the number at which an efficient competition can be conducted, the Contracting Officer may limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition.

<DESC>SYNOPSIS
<p>INDEFINITE DELIVERY INDEFINITE QUANTITY (IDIQ) CONTRACT FOR ENHANCED COMMISSIONING SERVICES<br />FOR THE REAL PROPERTY SERVICES FIELD OFFICE, BALTIMORE DISTRICT</p>
<p>1. CONTRACT INFORMATION: This contract is being procured in accordance with the Brooks A-E Act as implemented in FAR Subpart 36.6, AFARS 5136.6 and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Acquisition Instruction (UAI) 36.6. Firms will be selected for negotiation based on demonstrated competence and qualifications for the required work. A Firm Fixed Price Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) for Commissioning Services is required to primarily support the Baltimore District's Real Property Services Field Office (RSFO) programs. The majority of the work will be for RSFO and other Baltimore District projects, but the contract may be used throughout the North Atlantic Division or by any other USACE District with proper approval. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541330, which has a small business size standard maximum of $15,000,000. One award will be made with a five-year period and a capacity of $25M. The acquisition will be unrestricted. Task orders will be issued for enhanced commissioning services for various military, intelligence community, and other government agencies. Anticipated start date is February 2015.</p>
<p>An active TOP SECRET Facility Clearance is required at the time the offer is due, at time of award, and throughout the life of the contract. In the event of a Joint Venture (JV), the clearance requirement will apply to the JV. This means that the entity identified submitting the SF330 must have the TOP SECRET Facility Site Clearance in that name along with the matching Cage Code. For example, if Company A and Company B form a Joint Venture called Company AB, then Company AB must have an active TOP SECRET Facility Site Clearance. Even if both Company A and Company B each individually posses the clearance, unless Company AB possesses its own TOP SECRET Facility Site Clearance, the proposal will not be eligible for award.</p>
<p>The firm must be capable of responding to and working on multiple task orders concurrently. Task orders will be awarded based on the contractor's current workload and its ability to accomplish the order in the required time, geographic location, type of services required, previous installation experience, including customer satisfaction, and performance and quality of deliverables under the current IDIQ. Project sites may be located anywhere within the continental United States (CONUS) or Hawaii. A contract may be issued up to one year after selection approval.

Small businesses are not required to submit subcontracting plans. All subcontracting goals will be monitored through the electronic Subcontracting Reporting System (eSRS).</p>
<p>The plan must be in accordance with FAR 52.219-9 and DFARS 252.219-7003 or DFARS 252.219-7004 if the inclusion of a comprehensive subcontracting plan is necessary. The goals for subcontracting will be aggressively negotiated with the selected firm. If the successful offeror fails to negotiate a subcontracting plan acceptable to the Contracting Officer, then the offeror will be ineligible for award. Maximum practicable utilization of small businesses is a matter of national attention with particular interest to this contracting agency. Inherently governmental functions will not be performed by contractors per FAR Part 7.5 and Office of Federal Procurement Policy Letter 92-1.</p>

Backfill and compaction shall be done by methods that do not damage or displace the concrete slab and underlying granular fill.  Backfill shall be compacted with standard compaction equipment until no displacement of compacted materials is observed.      <br>  <br>  <br> 11.	AS-BUILT DRAWINGS <br>  <br> The Contractor shall submit for approval paper prints and reproducible drawings of the completed work for final approval.  Failure to submit final as-built drawings and marked prints, as required herein will be cause for withholding payment due the Contractor under this contract.  These drawings shall be furnished to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the required contract completion date.  Approval and acceptance of final as-built drawings shall be accomplished before final payment is made to the Contractor. <br>  <br> 12.	SITE RESTORATION AND CLEAN-UP <br>  <br> The Contractor shall remove metal shavings, waste metal, filings, nails, bolts, wires and other debris and waste generated from the construction of the storage building from the work area daily. The Contractor may use the on-site metal and construction material dumpster for disposal of construction material associated with this project.  <br>  <br> At the completion of installation of the structure, the Contractor shall remove protective coverings/films, grease and oil films, excess sealants, handling marks, contamination from steel wool, fittings and drilling debris and thoroughly clean all exposed surfaces.

The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: <br>  <br> The Technical Approach factor is the most important factor of the overall evaluation. Within the Technical Approach factor all sub-factors are of equal importance. The Technical Approach factor is more important than Past Performance, and significantly more important than Price. Past Performance is slightly more important than Price. All evaluation factors other than price, <br> when combined, are significantly more important than price. <br>  <br> Factor 1: Technical <br> Sub-factor 1: Understanding the Requirements  <br> Technical sub-factor 1 will be evaluated to the extent to which the offeror proposes a solution that meets the requirements set out in the Performance Work Statement and proposes a technical approach to execute work to include listing of testing facilities, and equipment available for use during the project. <br>  <br> Sub-factor 2: Corporate Experience <br> Technical sub-factor 2 will be evaluated to the extent to which the offeror indicates specialized experience in providing test and analysis services of the type required under this requirement. <br>  <br> Sub-factor 3: Individual Qualifications and Experience  <br> Technical sub-factor 3 will be evaluated to the extent to which the qualifications of the key personnel reflect the knowledge and experience required to perform the testing and analysis services and the certification of key personnel provided, as well as experience performing index and performance tests of this type for geotextile fabrics. <br>  <br> Factor 2. Past Performance <br> The degree to which the offeror's past performance is similar to these requirements and objectives and the degree to which the offeror's past performance demonstrated quality results within projected schedule and cost parameters. <br>  <br> Factor 3. Price <br> Price proposals will be evaluated for reasonableness by price analysis. The total contract price will be considered as an independent element from the technical evaluation. Price will be evaluated to determine the Offeror's understanding of the work and ability to perform the contract. <br>  <br> (b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). <br>  <br> (c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. <br> (End of provision) <br>  <br> 52.202-1, Definitions <br> 52.203-6 Alt 1, Restrictions on subcontractor sales to the Government <br> 52.203-17, Contractor Employee Whistleblower Rights and Requirement to Inform Enployees of Whistleblower Rights <br> 52.204-4, Printed or Copied Double-Sided on Postconsumer Fiber Content Paper <br> 52.204-7 System for Award Management <br> 52.204-10 Reporting Executive Compensation and First-Tier Subcontract Awards AUG 2012 <br> 52.204-13, System for Award Management Maintenance <br> 52.209-1 Qualification Requirements FEB 1995 <br> 52.209-2 Prohibition on Contracting with Inverted Domestic Corporations- Representation MAY 2011 <br> 52.209-6, Protecting the Government's Interest When Subcontracting with Contractors Debarred, Suspended, or Proposed for Debarment.

(Applies only if the clause at FAR 52.225-5, Trade Agreements, is included in this solicitation.)<br />(i) The offeror certifies that each end product, except those listed in paragraph (g)(5)(ii) of this provision, is a U.S.-made or designated country end product as defined in the clause of this solicitation entitled "Trade Agreements."<br />(ii) The offeror shall list as other end products those end products that are not U.S.-made or designated country end products.<br />Other End Products<br />Line Item No.: Country of Origin:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[List as necessary]<br />(iii) The Government will evaluate offers in accordance with the policies and procedures of FAR Part 25. For line items covered by the WTO GPA, the Government will evaluate offers of U.S.-made or designated country end products without regard to the restrictions of the Buy American statute. The Government will consider for award only offers of U.S.-made or designated country end products unless the Contracting Officer determines that there are no offers for such products or that the offers for such products are insufficient to fulfill the requirements of the solicitation.<br />(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--<br />(1) [_] Are, [_] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and<br />(3) [_] Are, [_] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<br />(4) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p>(ii) Examples.<br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.<br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).]<br />(1) Listed End Product<br />Listed End Product: Listed Countries of Origin:</p>

(Does not apply unless the solicitation is predominantly for the acquisition of manufactured end products.) For statistical purposes only, the offeror shall indicate whether the place of manufacture of the end products it expects to provide in response to this solicitation is predominantly-<br />(1) [_] In the United States (Check this box if the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured in the United States exceeds the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured outside the United States); or <br />(2) [_] Outside the United States.<br />(k) Certificates regarding exemptions from the application of the Service Contract Labor Standards. (Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.) [The contracting officer is to check a box to indicate if paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) applies.]<br />(1) [_] Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror [_] does [_] does not certify that-<br />(i) The items of equipment to be serviced under this contract are used regularly for other than Governmental purposes and are sold or traded by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) in substantial quantities to the general public in the course of normal business operations;<br />(ii) The services will be furnished at prices which are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(c)(2)(ii)) for the maintenance, calibration, or repair of such equipment; and<br />(iii) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract will be the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing the same equipment of commercial customers.<br />(2) [_] Certain services as described in FAR 22.1003-4(d)(1).

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. <br />(2) (i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to:<br />(A) Change the name in the SAM database; <br />(B) Comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12 of the FAR;<br />(C) Agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer.

If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an "I agree" click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., "click-wrap" or "browse-wrap" agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause.<br />(iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement.<br />(2) Paragraph (u)(1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures.<br />(End of Clause)<br />Alternate I (May 2014) When a time-and-materials or labor-hour contract is contemplated, substitute the following paragraphs (a), (e), (i), (l), and (m) for those in the basic clause.<br />(a) Inspection/Acceptance. <br />(1) The Government has the right to inspect and test all materials furnished and services performed under this contract, to the extent practicable at all places and times, including the period of performance, and in any event before acceptance. The Government may also inspect the plant or plants of the Contractor or any subcontractor engaged in contract performance. The Government will perform inspections and tests in a manner that will not unduly delay the work.<br />(2) If the Government performs inspection or tests on the premises of the Contractor or a subcontractor, the Contractor shall furnish and shall require subcontractors to furnish all reasonable facilities and assistance for the safe and convenient performance of these duties.<br />(3) Unless otherwise specified in the contract, the Government will accept or reject services and materials at the place of delivery as promptly as practicable after delivery, and they will be presumed accepted 60 days after the date of delivery, unless accepted earlier.<br />(4) At any time during contract performance, but not later than 6 months (or such other time as may be specified in the contract) after acceptance of the services or materials last delivered under this contract, the Government may require the Contractor to replace or correct services or materials that at time of delivery failed to meet contract requirements. Except as otherwise specified in paragraph (a)(6) of this clause, the cost of replacement or correction shall be determined under paragraph (i) of this clause, but the "hourly rate" for labor hours incurred in the replacement or correction shall be reduced to exclude that portion of the rate attributable to profit. Unless otherwise specified below, the portion of the "hourly rate" attributable to profit shall be 10 percent. The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance materials and services required to be replaced or corrected without disclosing the former requirement for replacement or correction, and, when required, shall disclose the corrective action taken. [Insert portion of labor rate attributable to profit.]<br />(5) (i) If the Contractor fails to proceed with reasonable promptness to perform required replacement or correction, and if the replacement or correction can be performed within the ceiling price (or the ceiling price as increased by the Government), the Government may-<br />(A) By contract or otherwise, perform the replacement or correction, charge to the Contractor any increased cost, or deduct such increased cost from any amounts paid or due under this contract; or<br />(B) Terminate this contract for cause.<br />(ii) Failure to agree to the amount of increased cost to be charged to the Contractor shall be a dispute under the Disputes clause of the contract.<br />(6) Notwithstanding paragraphs (a)(4) and (5) above, the Government may at any time require the Contractor to remedy by correction or replacement, without cost to the Government, any failure by the Contractor to comply with the requirements of this contract, if the failure is due to--<br />(i) Fraud, lack of good faith, or willful misconduct on the part of the Contractor's managerial personnel; or<br />(ii) The conduct of one or more of the Contractor's employees selected or retained by the Contractor after any of the Contractor's managerial personnel has reasonable grounds to believe that the employee is habitually careless or unqualified.<br />(7) This clause applies in the same manner and to the same extent to corrected or replacement materials or services as to materials and services originally delivered under this contract.<br />(8) The Contractor has no obligation or liability under this contract to correct or replace materials and services that at time of delivery do not meet contract requirements, except as provided in this clause or as may be otherwise specified in the contract.<br />(9) Unless otherwise specified in the contract, the Contractor's obligation to correct or replace Government-furnished property shall be governed by the clause pertaining to Government property.<br />(e) Definitions.<br />(1) The clause at FAR 52.202-1, Definitions, is incorporated herein by reference.

The Government will pay the Contractor as follows upon the submission of commercial invoices approved by the Contracting Officer:<br />(i) Hourly rate.<br />(A) The amounts shall be computed by multiplying the appropriate hourly rates prescribed in the contract by the number of direct labor hours performed. Fractional parts of an hour shall be payable on a prorated basis.<br />(B) The rates shall be paid for all labor performed on the contract that meets the labor qualifications specified in the contract. Labor hours incurred to perform tasks for which labor qualifications were specified in the contract will not be paid to the extent the work is performed by individuals that do not meet the qualifications specified in the contract, unless specifically authorized by the Contracting Officer.<br />(C) Invoices may be submitted once each month (or at more frequent intervals, if approved by the Contracting Officer) to the Contracting Officer or the authorized representative.<br />(D) When requested by the Contracting Officer or the authorized representative, the Contractor shall substantiate invoices (including any subcontractor hours reimbursed at the hourly rate in the schedule) by evidence of actual payment, individual daily job timecards, records that verify the employees meet the qualifications for the labor categories specified in the contract, or other substantiation specified in the contract.<br />(E) Unless the Schedule prescribes otherwise, the hourly rates in the Schedule shall not be varied by virtue of the Contractor having performed work on an overtime basis.<br />(1) If no overtime rates are provided in the Schedule and the Contracting Officer approves overtime work in advance, overtime rates shall be negotiated.<br />(2) Failure to agree upon these overtime rates shall be treated as a dispute under the Disputes clause of this contract.<br />(3) If the Schedule provided rates for overtime, the premium portion of those rates will be reimbursable only to the extent the overtime is approved by the Contracting Officer.<br />(ii) Materials.<br />(A) If the Contractor furnishes materials that meet the definition of a commercial item at FAR 2.101, the price to be paid for such materials shall not exceed the Contractor's established catalog or market price, adjusted to reflect the--<br />(1) Quantities being acquired; and<br />(2) Any modifications necessary because of contract requirements.<br />(B) Except as provided for in paragraph (i)(1)(ii)(A) and (D)(2) of this clause, the Government will reimburse the Contractor the actual cost of materials (less any rebates, refunds, or discounts received by the contractor that are identifiable to the contract) provided the Contractor-<br />(1) Has made payments for materials in accordance with the terms and conditions of the agreement or invoice; or<br />(2) Makes these payments within 30 days of the submission of the Contractor's payment request to the Government and such payment is in accordance with the terms and conditions of the agreement or invoice.<br />(C) To the extent able, the Contractor shall-<br />(1) Obtain materials at the most advantageous prices available with due regard to securing prompt delivery of satisfactory materials; and<br />(2) Give credit to the Government for cash and trade discounts, rebates, scrap, commissions, and other amounts that are identifiable to the contract.<br />(D) Other Costs. Unless listed below, other direct and indirect costs will not be reimbursed.<br />(1) Other direct Costs. The Government will reimburse the Contractor on the basis of actual cost for the following, provided such costs comply with the requirements in paragraph (i)(1)(ii)(B) of this clause: [Insert each element of other direct costs (e.g., travel, computer usage charges, etc. Insert "None" if no reimbursement for other direct costs will be provided. If this is an indefinite delivery contract, the Contracting Officer may insert "Each order must list separately the elements of other direct charge(s) for that order or, if no reimbursement for other direct costs will be provided, insert &lsquo;None'."]<br />(2) Indirect Costs (Material handling, Subcontract Administration, etc.). The Government will reimburse the Contractor for indirect costs on a pro-rata basis over the period of contract performance at the following fixed price: [Insert a fixed amount for the indirect costs and payment schedule. Insert "tiny_mce_marker" if no fixed price reimbursement for indirect costs will be provided. (If this is an indefinite delivery contract, the Contracting Officer may insert "Each order must list separately the fixed amount for the indirect costs and payment schedule or, if no reimbursement for indirect costs, insert &lsquo;None'."]<br />(2) Total cost. It is estimated that the total cost to the Government for the performance of this contract shall not exceed the ceiling price set forth in the Schedule and the Contractor agrees to use its best efforts to perform the work specified in the Schedule and all obligations under this contract within such ceiling price. If at any time the Contractor has reason to believe that the hourly rate payments and material costs that will accrue in performing this contract in the next succeeding 30 days, if added to all other payments and costs previously accrued, will exceed 85 percent of the ceiling price in the Schedule, the Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer giving a revised estimate of the total price to the Government for performing this contract with supporting reasons and documentation. If at any time during the performance of this contract, the Contractor has reason to believe that the total price to the Government for performing this contract will be substantially greater or less than the then stated ceiling price, the Contractor shall so notify the Contracting Officer, giving a revised estimate of the total price for performing this contract, with supporting reasons and documentation. If at any time during performance of this contract, the Government has reason to believe that the work to be required in performing this contract will be substantially greater or less than the stated ceiling price, the Contracting Officer will so advise the Contractor, giving the then revised estimate of the total amount of effort to be required under the contract.<br />(3) Ceiling price. The Government will not be obligated to pay the Contractor any amount in excess of the ceiling price in the Schedule, and the Contractor shall not be obligated to continue performance if to do so would exceed the ceiling price set forth in the Schedule, unless and until the Contracting Officer notifies the contractor in writing that the ceiling price has been increased and specifies in the notice a revised ceiling that shall constitute the ceiling price for performance under this contract. When and to the extent that the ceiling price set forth in the Schedule has been increased, any hours expended and material costs incurred by the Contractor in excess of the ceiling price before the increase shall be allowable to the same extent as if the hours expended and material costs had been incurred after the increase in the ceiling price.<br />(4) Access to records. At any time before final payment under this contract, the Contracting Officer (or authorized representative) will have access to the following (access shall be limited to the listing below unless otherwise agreed to by the Contractor and the Contracting Officer):<br />(i) Records that verify that the employees whose time has been included in any invoice met the qualifications for the labor categories specified in the contract.<br />(ii) For labor hours (including any subcontractor hours reimbursed at the hourly rate in the schedule), when timecards are required as substantiation for payment-<br />(A) The original timecards (paper-based or electronic);<br />(B) The Contractor's timekeeping procedures;<br />(C) Contractor records that show the distribution of labor between jobs or contracts; and<br />(D) Employees whose time has been included in any invoice for the purpose of verifying that these employees have worked the hours shown on the invoices.<br />(iii) For material and subcontract costs that are reimbursed on the basis of actual cost-<br />(A) Any invoices or subcontract agreements substantiating material costs; and<br />(B) Any documents supporting payment of those invoices.<br />(5) Overpayments/Underpayments. Each payment previously made shall be subject to reduction to the extent of amounts, on preceding invoices, that are found by the Contracting Officer not to have been properly payable and shall also be subject to reduction for overpayments or to increase for underpayments. The Contractor shall promptly pay any such reduction within 30 days unless the parties agree otherwise. The Government within 30 days will pay any such increases, unless the parties agree otherwise. The Contractor's payment will be made by check. If the Contractor becomes aware of a duplicate invoice payment or that the Government has otherwise overpaid on an invoice payment, the Contractor shall-<br />(i) Remit the overpayment amount to the payment office cited in the contract along with a description of the overpayment including the-<br />(A) Circumstances of the overpayment (e.g., duplicate payment, erroneous payment, liquidation errors, date(s) of overpayment);<br />(B) Affected contract number and delivery order number, if applicable;<br />(C) Affected contract line item or subline item, if applicable; and<br />(D) Contractor point of contact.<br />(ii) Provide a copy of the remittance and supporting documentation to the Contracting Officer.<br />(6) (i) All amounts that become payable by the Contractor to the Government under this contract shall bear simple interest from the date due until paid unless paid within 30 days of becoming due. The interest rate shall be the interest rate established by the Secretary of the Treasury, as provided in 41 U.S.C. 7109, which is applicable to the period in which the amount becomes due, and then at the rate applicable for each six month period as established by the Secretary until the amount is paid.<br />(ii) The Government may issue a demand for payment to the Contractor upon finding a debt is due under the contract.<br />(iii) Final Decisions. The Contracting Officer will issue a final decision as required by 33.211 if-<br />(A) The Contracting Officer and the Contractor are unable to reach agreement on the existence or amount of a debt in a timely manner;<br />(B) The Contractor fails to liquidate a debt previously demanded by the Contracting Officer within the timeline specified in the demand for payment unless the amounts were not repaid because the Contractor has requested an installment payment agreement; or<br />(C) The Contractor requests a deferment of collection on a debt previously demanded by the Contracting Officer (see FAR 32.60702).<br />(iv) If a demand for payment was previously issued for the debt, the demand for payment included in the final decision shall identify the same due date as the original demand for payment.<br />(v) Amounts shall be due at the earliest of the following dates:<br />(A) The date fixed under this contract.<br />(B) The date of the first written demand for payment, including any demand for payment resulting from a default termination.<br />(vi) The interest charge shall be computed for the actual number of calendar days involved beginning on the due date and ending on-<br />(A) The date on which the designated office receives payment from the Contractor;<br />(B) The date of issuance of a Government check to the Contractor from which an amount otherwise payable has been withheld as a credit against the contract debt; or<br />C) The date on which an amount withheld and applied to the contract debt would otherwise have become payable to the Contractor.<br />(vii) The interest charge made under this clause may be reduced under the procedures prescribed in 32.608-2 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation in effect on the date of this contract.<br />(viii) Upon receipt and approval of the invoice designated by the Contractor as the "completion invoice" and supporting documentation, and upon compliance by the Contractor with all terms of this contract, any outstanding balances will be paid within 30 days unless the parties agree otherwise. The completion invoice, and supporting documentation, shall be submitted by the Contractor as promptly as practicable following completion of the work under this contract, but in no event later than 1 year (or such longer period as the Contracting Officer may approve in writing) from the date of completion.<br />(7) Release of claims. The Contractor, and each assignee under an assignment entered into under this contract and in effect at the time of final payment under this contract, shall execute and deliver, at the time of and as a condition precedent to final payment under this contract, a release discharging the Government, its officers, agents, and employees of and from all liabilities, obligations, and claims arising out of or under this contract, subject only to the following exceptions.<br />(i) Specified claims in stated amounts, or in estimated amounts if the amounts are not susceptible to exact statement by the Contractor.<br />(ii) Claims, together with reasonable incidental expenses, based upon the liabilities of the Contractor to third parties arising out of performing this contract, that are not known to the Contractor on the date of the execution of the release, and of which the Contractor gives notice in writing to the Contracting Officer not more than 6 years after the date of the release or the date of any notice to the Contractor that the Government is prepared to make final payment, whichever is earlier.<br />(iii) Claims for reimbursement of costs (other than expenses of the Contractor by reason of its indemnification of the Government against patent liability), including reasonable incidental expenses, incurred by the Contractor under the terms of this contract relating to patents.<br />(8) Prompt payment.

In connection with any discount offered for early payment, time shall be computed from the date of the invoice. For the purpose of computing the discount earned, payment shall be considered to have been made on the date that appears on the payment check or the specified payment date if an electronic funds transfer payment is made.<br />(l) Termination for the Government's convenience. The Government reserves the right to terminate this contract, or any part hereof, for its sole convenience. In the event of such termination, the Contractor shall immediately stop all work hereunder and shall immediately cause any and all of its suppliers and subcontractors to cease work. Subject to the terms of this contract, the Contractor shall be paid an amount for direct labor hours (as defined in the Schedule of the contract) determined by multiplying the number of direct labor hours expended before the effective date of termination by the hourly rate(s) in the contract, less any hourly rate payments already made to the Contractor plus reasonable charges the Contractor can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Government using its standard record keeping system that have resulted from the termination. The Contractor shall not be required to comply with the cost accounting standards or contract cost principles for this purpose. This paragraph does not give the Government any right to audit the Contractor's records. The Contractor shall not be paid for any work performed or costs incurred that reasonably could have been avoided.<br />(m) Termination for cause. The Government may terminate this contract, or any part hereof, for cause in the event of any default by the Contractor, or if the Contractor fails to comply with any contract terms and conditions, or fails to provide the Government, upon written request, with adequate assurances of future performance. Subject to the terms of this contract, the Contractor shall be paid an amount computed under paragraph (i) Payments of this clause, but the "hourly rate" for labor hours expended in furnishing work not delivered to or accepted by the Government shall be reduced to exclude that portion of the rate attributable to profit. Unless otherwise specified in paragraph (a)(4) of this clause, the portion of the "hourly rate" attributable to profit shall be 10 percent. In the event of termination for cause, the Contractor shall be liable to the Government for any and all rights and remedies provided by law. If it is determined that the Government improperly terminated this contract for default, such termination shall be deemed a termination for convenience.<br />52.212-5 -- Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders -- Commercial Items.<br />As prescribed in 12.301(b)(4), insert the following clause:<br />Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders -- Commercial Items (Jul 2014)<br />(a) The Contractor shall comply with the following Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clauses, which are incorporated in this contract by reference, to implement provisions of law or Executive orders applicable to acquisitions of commercial items:<br />(1) 52.222-50, Combating Trafficking in Persons (FEB 2009) (22 U.S.C. 7104(g)).<br />____ Alternate I (AUG 2007) of 52.222-50 (22 U.S.C. 7104(g))<br />(2) 52.233-3, Protest After Award (AUG 1996) (31 U.S.C. 3553).<br />(3) 52.233-4, Applicable Law for Breach of Contract Claim (OCT 2004) (Public Laws 108-77, 108-78 (19 U.S.C. 3805 note)).<br />(b) The Contractor shall comply with the FAR clauses in this paragraph (b) that the contracting officer has indicated as being incorporated in this contract by reference to implement provisions of law or Executive orders applicable to acquisitions of commercial items:<br />[Contracting Officer check as appropriate.]<br />(xiii) 52.225-26, Contractors Performing Private Security Functions Outside the United States (Jul 2013) (Section 862, as amended, of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008; 10 U.S.C. 2302 Note).<br />(xiv) 52.226-6, Promoting Excess Food Donation to Nonprofit Organizations.

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. Solicitation number is HSCG85-15-R-P45016 is issued as a Request for Proposals. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This Request for Proposal incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-77. The NAICS Code is 336611 with a size standard of 1,000 employees. The contract will be awarded on a firm-fixed-price basis. To receive an award, the Contractor must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) www.sam.gov.
<p>It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to: Commandant (CG-913), U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters, Acquisition Planning and Performance Measurement, 1900 Half St. S.W. Room 11-0402, Washington, DC 20593, Telephone (202) 372-3692.</p>

<p>8.  STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local partners advance peace and democracy in politically-transitioning countries. Seizing critical windows of opportunity, OTI works on the ground to provide fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief.  Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition.  OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations.  OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under U.S. Personal Services Contracts (USPSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives. USPSCs are considered employees of USAID for all purposes except programs administered by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) - such as federally sponsored health insurance, life insurance, and retirement benefits.  However, there are several other similar benefits that USPSCs may participate in, such as partial reimbursement for health and life insurance costs, as well as full coverage of workers' compensation, among other benefits. For more complete information on USPSC benefits, please see page 12 of this solicitation.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: <br />http://www.usaid.gov/political-transition-initiatives</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The Regional Team Leader manages the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA)/OTI's Afghanistan and Pakistan (AF/PAK) Regional Team within the Field Programs Division, reports to the OTI Chief of Field Programs or his/her designee, and is based in Washington, DC. OTI currently has five regional teams as part of its Field Programs Division: Africa (AFR), Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC), Afghanistan and Pakistan (AF/PAK), Middle East (ME), and Yemen, Europe and Asia (YEA). OTI's Regional Teams are responsible for all program implementation-related activity in the specific region.</p>
<p>The Regional Team Leader's principal responsibility will be the oversight and management of specific DCHA/OTI country programs in Afghanistan and Pakistan. This is a program-funded USPSC position, which OTI anticipates will focus the vast majority of time on the management and implementation of the two country programs. The objectives for this position are to ensure DCHA/OTI's regional team is managed effectively in Washington and the field (effectively manage and supervise OTI Program Manager staff in Washington, and OTI Country Representatives in the field), and to ensure that U.S. Government funds are spent wisely, in coordination with other key actors, and in a manner that reflects OTI standard practices and U.S. Government policy.</p>
<p>The successful candidate must demonstrate sound judgment, excellent communication, interpersonal and analytical skills, a well-developed understanding of U.S. foreign policy interests, and a strong interest in assisting countries in transition. Since work may require continual changes in program direction and implementation, including frequent coordination, the individual will be someone who is highly flexible and willing to work under conditions of ongoing change. It is important for the Regional Team Leader to be experienced in managing all aspects of transition program operations in order to mentor program staff and ensure that all processes and procedures are being followed, so that program implementation is undertaken efficiently and effectively. The successful candidate will be experienced in liaising with grassroots organizations and their constituencies, national and local government officials, U.S. Government agencies, and international organizations, and have worked for, or closely with, USAID or another branch of the U.S. Government foreign policy apparatus.</p>
<p>9.  CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>The work of the Regional Team Leader requires teamwork, the exercise of discretion, judgment, and personal responsibility. The Regional Team Leader is a strategic thinker, articulates innovative ideas, presents solutions, and is a positive role model for colleagues both in and outside of OTI. The incumbent is able to prioritize and complete tasks without follow-up by the supervisor, while also filling in gaps as needed to ensure the responsiveness of the team. The incumbent has a high level of integrity and attention to detail to ensure the use of OTI systems and procedures to maintain effective and efficient management of funds, programming, and monitoring and evaluation. The incumbent is highly flexible and willing to work under conditions of ongoing change, and remains professional and respectful of colleagues and authority in a diverse workforce. She or he places a premium on the building of positive relationships with his or her respective team both in the field and in Washington, and with key stakeholders both in and outside of USAID. As a member of a highly operational office, the incumbent is willing and able to perform a wide range of administrative functions to help ensure programmatic success.</p>
<p>Under the direct supervision of the DCHA/OTI Chief of Field Programs or his/her designee, the Regional Team Leader will perform the following duties:</p>
<p>&bull;	Apply a sound understanding of USAID's programmatic and operational processes in Washington to support transition programming overseas, including assessment and conceptualization, design, management, analysis and evaluation of political transition and/or post-conflict activities;<br /> <br />&bull;	Negotiate, oversee and manage the overall Regional Team country budgets to ensure that the team procurement plan is kept up to date, and that country programs are appropriately budgeted for. Additional responsibilities include working to secure additional funding from other U.S. Government sources if required, and ensuring that the team is trained on all the appropriate systems and tools for budgeting, finances and procurement;</p>
<p>&bull;	As requested by embassies and/or USAID Missions, provide support for the design and execution of programs that follow OTI's quick-impact programming model. Support may include attendance and/or facilitation of program management processes for follow-on programming such as rolling assessments, strategy review sessions, program performance reviews and management reviews;</p>
<p>&bull;	Lead and oversee the OTI Regional Team, including Program Managers in Washington, Country Representatives in the field, and implementing partner grants and agreements at the headquarters level;</p>
<p>&bull;	Monitor and evaluate OTI country programs through regular communication with staff, reports from the field and Washington, liaising with the OTI Program Office team, and regular field site visits;</p>
<p>&bull;	Design staffing plans to meet overall program objectives, ensure that tasks are well defined, and that recruitment is initiated immediately when staffing needs arise. Ensure that staff is highly qualified, trained, and mentored in all critical aspects of OTI operations and programming; Ensure that employee performance evaluations are completed in timely manner in accordance with OTI office policy;<br /> <br />&bull;	Supervise the implementation of OTI-financed activities, including overseeing and/or managing the selection of program implementers such as grantees, contractors, and Personal Service Contract employees;</p>
<p>&bull;	When required, assume higher representational responsibilities, potentially serving as Acting Chief of Field Programs or Country Representative in the field in their absence;</p>
<p>&bull;	Perform complex country and program analysis to develop existing and future strategies in high-priority countries, including the effective oversight of management, logistical, budget, administrative, human resources, and contractual issues;</p>
<p>&bull;	Serve as a central participant on inter- and intra-agency policy and crisis task forces as required;</p>
<p>&bull;	Develop and maintain collaborative relationships with USAID, Department of State, Department of Defense, and other U.S. Government personnel, to share programmatic information and coordinate Interagency response efforts;</p>
<p>&bull;	Liaise with grassroots organizations and their constituencies, national and local government officials, U.S. Government agencies, non-governmental organizations, donor and international organizations, to monitor and evaluate OTI country program activities;</p>
<p>&bull;	Disseminate regular DCHA/OTI reports to U.S. Government and non-U.S. Government agencies and organizations as deemed appropriate;</p>
<p>&bull;	Oversee, develop and manage, in conjunction with OTI Washington staff and the Country Representative in the field, an OTI close-out strategy that will, whenever appropriate and possible, ensure reasonable and effective handover to follow-on USAID and/or other donor programs;</p>
<p>&bull;	Ensure the proper development of documentation for required program contracts, grants or cooperative agreements in conformance with the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR), agency and office guidelines;</p>
<p>&bull;	Mentor other OTI Team Leaders, and mentor and train Country Representatives and Program Managers as required;</p>
<p>&bull;	Perform other duties and activities as required for the successful completion of country programs.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY RELATIONSHIP:<br />The Regional Team Leader will be supervised by the OTI Chief of the Field Programs Division or his/her designee.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY CONTROLS:<br />The supervisor will provide administrative directions in terms of broadly defined missions or functions.

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16 FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/16fam/index.htm</p>
<p>Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

Enter pricing only on the Government Schedule B. Offeror shall NOT alter the Schedule B in any way with the exception of entering pricing.

<p>(c) Period of Acceptance of Offers. The Offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm for 120 days from the date specified for receipt of offers.</p>
<p>(e) Multiple offers. If more than one solution to the services is available, Offeror may submit multiple offers for consideration, subject to same page limitations. Multiple offers may not be considered if they alter the Government's requirement. Should the Offeror claim exceptions to any requirement in the solicitation, these exceptions shall be listed and rationale provided.

<p>(h) Multiple awards. This award shall be made on an all or none basis.<br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-1)</p>
<p>(ix) The provision at FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, applies to this solicitation along with the following addenda to the provision:<br />52.212-2 Addendum:<br />Evaluation Criteria. The basis for award will be use of best value in which competing Offerors' past performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award a CSA for services from an incumbent Local Exchange Carrier (LEC) or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. Award will be made to the responsible Offeror proposing the combination most advantageous to the Government based upon an integrated assessment of the evaluation factors described below. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) FACTOR 1 -- TECHNICAL. The Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of acceptable or unacceptable. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following technical subfactors:<br />Subfactor 1 - Provider Capability <br />This subfactor is met when the Offeror provides evidence of being a telecommunications company and owning most of the facilities such as switching equipment, transmission lines and infrastructure, having the capability to provide Primary Rate Interfaces (PRI), Direct Inward Dial (DID), and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Subfactor 2 - Local Communications Services. <br />This subfactor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a SITE-SPECIFIC diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix 10 requirements. Reference generic example diagram in Appendix 10.</p>
<p>(b) FACTOR 2 -- PRICE. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent LEC or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) FACTOR 3 -- PAST PERFORMANCE. In evaluating PPI, the government will employ several approaches including: reviewing contract references provided by the offeror; seeking PPI through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. Only recent (within the last three years) and relevant PPI (similar or greater in scope, magnitude of effort, and complexity than effort described in this solicitation) will be evaluated. When reviewing PPI, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform the services described in this solicitation. The performance confidence assessment will result in an overall performance confidence rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower. If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer. <br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-2)</p>

For an offer's submission to be determined  quote mark Technically Acceptable quote mark  and receive consideration for award based upon lowest price submitted, the offer must receive a rating of  quote mark Acceptable quote mark  for each technical acceptability standard and past performance factor.  The Government will award the contract to the offer that meets all the evaluation criteria with an  quote mark Acceptability quote mark  rating, and has the lowest price.  Trade-offs between cost/price and non-cost/price factors are not permitted.   <br>    <br>  A price analysis of the proposals received will be in accordance with the techniques of FAR Part 15.404.  As part of price evaluation, the Government will evaluate its option to extend services (FAR Clause 52.217-8) by adding one-half of the offeror's final option period prices to the offeror's total price.  Thus, the offeror's total price for the purpose of evaluation will include the base period, first option period, second option period, third option period, fourth option period, and one-half of the fourth option period.  Offerors are required to only price the base and four options.  Offerors shall not submit a price for the potential one-half year extension of services period.  <br>    <br>  In the event of an unacceptable past performance evaluation rating for an otherwise technically acceptable low price offeror, the Small Business Administration (SBA) will be contacted for a Certificate of Competency (COC) determination in accordance with procedures in FAR 19.601.  In the event an offeror receives a rating of  quote mark unacceptable quote mark  for both the Technical Acceptability Factor and Past Performance Factor, a COC determination will not be requested as the offeror would remain  quote mark Unacceptable quote mark  based on the evaluation of the Technical Acceptability Factor.   <br>    <br>  Discussions or Negotiations:  The offeror's initial offer should contain its best terms from a price and technical standpoint.  Discussions, if any, will be conducted in accordance with FAR 12.602 and final offers will be evaluated in accordance with factors as were initial offers.    <br>    <br>  Award for All of the Work:  The Government intends to award one contract as a result of this solicitation.  Offers received with less than the stated number of items listed in the Bid Schedule will be considered non- responsive.    <br>    <br>       a.  Evaluation Criteria.     <br>    <br>  		(1)  Evaluation criteria consist of factors and elements as listed below.  The offers will be evaluated under three (3) evaluation factors:    <br>    <br>  Factor I:   Technical Acceptability  <br>    <br>  Acceptability Standard 1: Experience  <br>  			Acceptability Standard 2: Capability   <br>    <br>  		Factor II:  Past Performance 							  <br>    <br>  			Within the Past Performance (Quality of Products/ Services, Timeliness of Performance, and Business Relations will be evaluated) .  <br>    <br>  		Factor III:  Price  <br>    <br>  		(2)  Factor I -Technical Acceptability:  The Technical Acceptability Factor evaluation provides an assessment of the offeror's capability to satisfy the Government's minimum requirements.    <br>    <br>  Acceptability Standard 1:  Experience: The offeror demonstrates experience in performing the requirements identified in the PWS.  The offeror shall submit a list of recent (within the past 5 years) and relevant contracts/subcontracts that demonstrate an ability to perform the work described in the solicitation.  Specifically, the orders/contracts should demonstrate five years experience in preventive maintenance and repairing of hoist and cranes.   	  <br>    <br>  Acceptability Standard 2: Capability:  Offeror shall provide official documentation to support the certification, licenses, or training documentation to confirm qualifications/experience as outlined in the solicitation, paragraph   <br>    <br>  The Technical Acceptability Factor will receive one (1) of the adjectival ratings defined below.  The individual standards will not receive an adjectival rating.   <br>    <br>  Table 1. Technical Acceptable/Unacceptable Ratings  <br>  Rating	Description  <br>  Acceptable	Offer clearly meets the minimum requirements of the solicitation.  <br>  Unacceptable	Offer does not clearly meet the minimum requirements of the solicitation.  <br>    <br>    <br>  		(3)  Factor II - Past Performance:  The offeror shall submit a list of recent and relevant past contracts/subcontracts as defined below.  The past performance evaluation will assess the offeror's probability of meeting the solicitation's requirements as indicated by that offeror's record of past performance.  Past Performance is assessed at the factor level after evaluating aspects of the offeror's recent past performance and focusing on past performance that is relevant to the services being procured under this solicitation. Offerors are cautioned that in conducting the performance risk assessment, the Government may use data provided in the offeror's submission and data obtained from other sources, such as the Contractor Past Performance Reporting System (CPARS), Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) or similar systems and State Department Watch Lists.  <br>    <br>  Each offeror will receive a past performance rating of acceptable or unacceptable based on the Offeror's recent past performance, focusing on performance that is relevant to the contract requirements.    <br>    <br>  			(a)  Recency Assessment:  An assessment of the past performance information will be made to determine if it is recent.  To be recent, the effort must be ongoing or must have been performed during the past three (3) years from the date of issuance of this solicitation. Past performance information that fails this condition will not be evaluated.  <br>    <br>  			(b)  Relevancy Assessment:  To be relevant, the effort must be similar in nature of work, size, and complexity.  The Government will conduct an in depth evaluation of all recent performance information obtained to determine if it is the same or similar in nature, size, and complexity to the services being procured under this solicitation.  A relevancy determination of the offeror's (including joint venture partner(s) and major and critical subcontractor(s)) past performance will be made.  In determining relevancy for individual contracts, consideration will be given to the effort, or portion of the effort, being proposed by the offeror, teaming partner, or subcontractor whose contract is being reviewed and evaluated.  In establishing what is relevant for the acquisition, consideration should be given to what aspects of an offeror's contract history would give the most confidence that the offeror will satisfy the current procurement.  The past performance information provided in the offer and obtained from other sources will be used to establish the relevancy of past performance.  <br>    <br>  The Past Performance Evaluation Team will review past performance information and determine the quality and usefulness as it applies to past performance rating.    <br>    <br>  Assigning Ratings.  The Past Performance Factor will be assigned one (1) of the rating defined below.   <br>    <br>  Table 2: Past Performance Evaluation Ratings  <br>  Rating	Description  <br>  Acceptable	Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort, or the offeror's performance record is unknown.  <br>   Unacceptable	Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has no reasonable expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort.  <br>    <br>    <br>  Offerors without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available or so sparse that no meaningful past performance rating can be reasonably assigned, may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.  Therefore, the offeror shall be determined to have unknown past performance.  In the context of acceptability/unacceptability,  quote mark unknown quote mark  shall be considered acceptable.  <br>    <br>  		(4)  Factor III: Price:  The Price factor will not be scored or rated.  Evaluation of price will be performed using one or more price analysis techniques in FAR 15.404-1(b). Through these techniques the Government will determine whether prices are reasonable, complete and balanced.  <br>    <br>  			(a)  Options.  Pricing submitted for the Offeror Schedule, will be evaluated for price reasonableness.  The Government will evaluate the Offeror's total price, to include the base period, first option period, second option period, third option period, fourth option period, and one-half of the fourth option period, using price analysis techniques (See FAR Clause 52.217-8).  Pricing must be provided for all line items in order for an offeror to be considered for award.  Those offerors not providing pricing for all line items will be removed from consideration for award.  The Government will award a single contract to the offeror whose offer represents the Lowest Price Technically Acceptable offer.  <br>    <br>  			(b)  Unbalanced Pricing.  Unbalanced pricing may be evaluated in accordance with FAR 15.404-1(g), as applicable, to assess potential performance risk which could result in unreasonably high prices.

Offerors are required only to price the base and option periods.  Offerors shall not submit a price for the potential six month extension of services period.  The Government may choose to exercise the Extension of Services at the end of any performance period (base or option periods), utilizing the rates of that performance period.  Pricing must be provided for all line items in order for an offeror to be considered for award.  Those offerors not providing pricing for all line items will be removed from consideration for award.  <br>    <br>  In the event of an unacceptable Past Performance evaluation rating for an otherwise Technically Acceptable low price offeror, the Small Business Administration (SBA) will be contacted for a Certificate of Competency (COC) determination in accordance with procedures in FAR 19.601.  In the event an offeror receives a rating of  quote mark Unacceptable quote mark  for both the Technical Acceptability Factor and Past Performance Factor, a COC determination will not be requested as the offeror would remain  quote mark Unacceptable quote mark  based on the evaluation of the Technical Acceptability Factor.   <br>    <br>  Discussions or Negotiations:  The offeror's initial offer should contain its best terms from a price and technical standpoint.  Discussions, if any, will be conducted in accordance with FAR 12.602 and final offers will be evaluated in accordance with factors as were initial offers.    <br>    <br>  Award for All of the Work:  The Government intends to award one contract as a result of this solicitation.  Offers received with less than the stated number of items listed in the Bid Schedule will be considered non- responsive and therefore, not considered for award.  <br>    <br>  Evaluation Criteria.  <br>     <br>  (1)	Evaluation criteria consist of factors and elements as listed below.  Offers will be evaluated under three (3) evaluation factors:  <br>    <br>  Factor I:  Technical Capability  <br>  1.	Acceptability Standard 1: Experience  <br>  2.	Acceptability Standard 2: Capability   <br>    <br>  Factor II:  Past Performance 							  <br>  Performance evaluation will assess the relative risks associated with an offeror's likelihood of success in performing the solicitation's requirements as indicated by that offeror's record of past performance.  In evaluating Past Performance, Quality of Services, Timeliness of Performance, and Business Relations will be evaluated.  <br>    <br>  Factor III:  Price  <br>    <br>  Factor I:  Technical Acceptability:  The Technical Acceptability Factor evaluation provides an assessment of the offeror's capability to satisfy the Government's minimum requirements.    <br>    <br>  Acceptability Standard 1: Equipment Offerings: Offeror provides evidence that provided equipment is in compliance with paragraphs 4.2; 4.2.1; 4.2.2; 4.2.3; 4.2.4 and 4.2.5 of the PWS. Offeror shall provide sufficient descriptive literature so that the Government may determine that the offeror products meet the salient characteristics listed in the aforementioned PWS paragraphs. The Contracting Officer is not responsible for locating or obtaining any information not identified in the offer.  <br>    <br>  Acceptability Standard 2:  Experience:  The offeror demonstrates experience in providing the washers and dryers required along with outlined services as described in the Performance Work Statement (PWS).  The offeror shall submit a list of recent (within the past 5 years) and relevant contracts/subcontracts that demonstrate an ability to perform the work described in the solicitation.  <br>    <br>  The Technical Acceptability Factor will receive one (1) of the adjectival ratings defined below.  The individual standards will not receive an adjectival rating.   <br>    <br>  Table 1. Technical Acceptable/Unacceptable Ratings  <br>  Rating	Description  <br>  Acceptable	Offer clearly meets the minimum requirements of the solicitation.  <br>  Unacceptable	Offer does not clearly meet the minimum requirements of the solicitation.  <br>    <br>  (2)	Factor II: Past Performance:  The offeror shall submit a list of recent and relevant past contracts/subcontracts as defined below.  The past performance evaluation will assess the offeror's probability of meeting the solicitation's requirements as indicated by that offeror's record of past performance.  Past Performance is assessed at the factor level after evaluating aspects of the offeror's recent past performance and focusing on past performance that is relevant to the services being procured under this solicitation. Offerors are cautioned that in conducting the performance risk assessment, the Government may use data provided in the offeror's submission and data obtained from other sources, such as the Contractor Past Performance Reporting System (CPARS), Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) or similar systems and State Department Watch Lists.  <br>    <br>  There is no minimum or maximum number of references required; however, the offeror shall submit sufficient past performance information to demonstrate the depth and breadth to successfully satisfy all areas of the proposed effort.  It is incumbent upon the contractor to present the past performance information in such a manner and in sufficient detail to ensure the Government clearly understands the information provided.  <br>    <br>  Each offeror will receive a past performance rating of acceptable or unacceptable based on the Offeror's recent past performance, focusing on performance that is relevant to the contract requirements.    <br>    <br>  Recency Assessment:  An assessment of the past performance information will be made to determine if it is recent.  To be recent, the effort must be ongoing or must have been performed during the past three (3) years from the date of issuance of this solicitation.  Past performance information that fails this condition will not be evaluated.  <br>    <br>  Relevancy Assessment:  To be relevant, the effort must be similar in nature of work, size, and complexity.  The Government will conduct an in depth evaluation of all recent performance information obtained to determine if it is the same or similar in nature, size, and complexity to the services being procured under this solicitation.  A relevancy determination of the offeror's (including joint venture partner(s) and major and critical subcontractor(s)) past performance will be made.  In determining relevancy for individual contracts, consideration will be given to the effort, or portion of the effort, being proposed by the offeror, teaming partner, or subcontractor whose contract is being reviewed and evaluated.  In establishing what is relevant for the acquisition, consideration should be given to what aspects of an offeror's contract history would give the most confidence that the offeror will satisfy the current procurement.  The past performance information provided in the offer and obtained from other sources will be used to establish the relevancy of past performance.  <br>    <br>  The Past Performance Evaluation Team will review past performance information and determine the quality and usefulness as it applies to past performance rating.    <br>    <br>  The Past Performance Factor will receive one (1) of the adjectival ratings defined below.  <br>    <br>  Table 2: Past Performance Evaluation Ratings  <br>  Rating	Description  <br>  Acceptable	Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort, or the offeror's performance record is unknown.  <br>   Unacceptable	Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has no reasonable expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort.  <br>    <br>    <br>  Offerors without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available or so sparse that no meaningful past performance rating can be reasonably assigned, may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.  Therefore, the offeror shall be determined to have unknown past performance.  In the context of acceptability/unacceptability,  quote mark unknown quote mark  shall be considered acceptable.  <br>    <br>  (3)	Factor III: Price:  The Price factor will not be scored or rated.  Evaluation of price will be performed using one or more price analysis techniques in FAR 15.404-1(b).  Through these techniques the Government will determine whether prices are reasonable, complete and balanced.  <br>    <br>  Options.  Pricing submitted for the Offeror Schedule, will be evaluated for price reasonableness.  The Government will evaluate the Offeror's total price, to include the base period, first option period, second option period, and one-half of the second option period, using price analysis techniques (See FAR Clause 52.217-8).  Pricing must be provided for all line items in order for an offeror to be considered for award.  Those offerors not providing pricing for all line items will be removed from consideration for award.  The Government will award a single contract to the offeror whose offer represents the Lowest Price Technically Acceptable offer.  <br>    <br>  Unbalanced Pricing.  Unbalanced pricing may be evaluated in accordance with FAR 15.404-1(g), as applicable, to assess potential performance risk which could result in unreasonably high prices.  <br>    <br>  Offers are due no later than 24 November 2014; 4:00 PM CST.  All responsible sources may submit an offer, which will be considered by the agency.  In accordance with 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors, paragraph (f), quotes received after the established closing date will be viewed as late, and therefore not considered.

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

<p>(b) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>
<p>(A) Change the name in the SAM database;</p>

<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM.

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract. A change in the DUNS number does not necessarily require a novation be accomplished. Dun &amp; Bradstreet may be contacted-</p>

<p>252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure (Sep 2011)</p>
<p><br />a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA</p>
<p>Alternative line item structure offer where monitors are shipped separately:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA <br />0002 Monitor 20 EA</p>
<p>(End of provision)</p>

The Contractor shall consult with the Department of State regarding any questions relating to compliance with the ITAR and shall consult with the Department of Commerce regarding any questions relating to compliance with the EAR.</p>
<p>(c) The Contractor's responsibility to comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items exists independent of, and is not established or limited by, the information provided by this clause.</p>
<p>(d) Nothing in the terms of this contract adds, changes, supersedes, or waives any of the requirements of applicable Federal laws, Executive orders, and regulations, including but not limited to-</p>
<p>(1) The Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (50 U.S.C. App. 2401, et seq.);</p>

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:   <br>      <br>   The Technical Approach factor is the most important factor of the overall evaluation. Within the Technical Approach factor all sub-factors are of equal importance. The Technical Approach factor is more important than Past Performance, and significantly more important than Price. Past Performance is slightly more important than Price. All evaluation factors other than price,   <br>   when combined, are significantly more important than price.   <br>      <br>   Factor 1: Technical   <br>   Sub-factor 1: Understanding the Requirements    <br>   Technical sub-factor 1 will be evaluated to the extent to which the offeror proposes a solution that meets the requirements set out in the Performance Work Statement and proposes a technical approach to execute work to include listing of testing facilities, and equipment available for use during the project.   <br>      <br>   Sub-factor 2: Corporate Experience   <br>   Technical sub-factor 2 will be evaluated to the extent to which the offeror indicates specialized experience in providing test and analysis services of the type required under this requirement.   <br>      <br>   Sub-factor 3: Individual Qualifications and Experience    <br>   Technical sub-factor 3 will be evaluated to the extent to which the qualifications of the key personnel reflect the knowledge and experience required to perform the testing and analysis services and the certification of key personnel provided, as well as experience performing index and performance tests of this type for geotextile fabrics.   <br>      <br>   Factor 2. Past Performance   <br>   The degree to which the offeror's past performance is similar to these requirements and objectives and the degree to which the offeror's past performance demonstrated quality results within projected schedule and cost parameters.   <br>      <br>   Factor 3. Price   <br>   Price proposals will be evaluated for reasonableness by price analysis. The total contract price will be considered as an independent element from the technical evaluation. Price will be evaluated to determine the Offeror's understanding of the work and ability to perform the contract.   <br>      <br>   (b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).   <br>      <br>   (c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.   <br>   (End of provision)   <br>      <br>   52.202-1, Definitions   <br>   52.203-6 Alt 1, Restrictions on subcontractor sales to the Government   <br>   52.203-17, Contractor Employee Whistleblower Rights and Requirement to Inform Enployees of Whistleblower Rights   <br>   52.204-4, Printed or Copied Double-Sided on Postconsumer Fiber Content Paper   <br>   52.204-7 System for Award Management   <br>   52.204-10 Reporting Executive Compensation and First-Tier Subcontract Awards AUG 2012   <br>   52.204-13, System for Award Management Maintenance   <br>   52.209-1 Qualification Requirements FEB 1995   <br>   52.209-2 Prohibition on Contracting with Inverted Domestic Corporations- Representation MAY 2011   <br>   52.209-6, Protecting the Government's Interest When Subcontracting with Contractors Debarred, Suspended, or Proposed for Debarment.

There is no solicitation available at this time; requests for a solicitation will not receive a response.&nbsp; Responses are not offers and the Government is not under any obligation to award a contract.&nbsp; Respondents are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI.&nbsp; If the Government decides to establish a contract for Temporary Help Services, it will issue a Request for Proposal at a later date.&nbsp; Please monitor the Federal Business Opportunities website (<a href="http://www.fbo.gov">www.fbo.gov</a>) for future information regarding this potential requirement. <br /><br />Respondents are also advised that submitting any information provides the Government express permission for the Government to use the data, pictures, and other information contained in the submittals for Government purposes. All information received in response to this RFI marked as "proprietary" will be handled accordingly. &nbsp;Information provided as a response to this RFI will not be returned. <br /><br />The Government highly encourages all interested parties to provide a complete and thorough response to this RFI. &nbsp;However, not responding will not preclude participation should a solicitation be released. <br /><br /><strong>The Government requests companies which are not primarily Temporary Help Service Firms to abstain from providing responses to this RFI.</strong> <br /><br />In accordance with 5 CFR 300.501, a Temporary Help Service Firm is a private sector entity which quickly provides other organizations with specific services performed by its pool of employees, possessing the appropriate work skills, for brief or intermittent periods. &nbsp;The firm is the legally responsible employer and maintains that relationship during the time its employees are assigned to a client.&nbsp; The firm, not the client organization, recruits, tests, hires, trains, assigns, pays, provides benefits and leave to, and as necessary, addresses performance problems, disciplines, and terminates its employees. &nbsp;Among other employer obligations, the firm is responsible for payroll deductions and payment of income taxes, social security (FICA), unemployment insurance, and workers' compensation, and shall provide required liability insurance and bonding. <br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2. PURPOSE <br /></span></strong><br />The purpose of publicizing this RFI notice is to aid in the development of the potential AFICA Temporary Help Services acquisition strategy, increase competition to broaden industry participation in meeting Government requirements, and gather information for planning purposes about the Temporary Help Services market or capabilities as defined in FAR 15.201(e). <br /><br />We seek large and small business respondents who are currently conducting business or providing similar services.&nbsp; The input will assist in determining the interest, capability, and capacity of all potential offers. <br /><br />A review of available North American Industrial Classification (NAICS) codes suggests the potential classification code of 561320.&nbsp; The Small Business Administration (SBA) has established a small business size standard of $27,500,000 (based on a 3-year average of annual receipts). <br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">3. MARKET RESEARCH SURVEY <br /></span></strong><br />The basis for this RFI is a survey located at <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/TXTXLPT">https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/TXTXLPT</a>.&nbsp; The survey is also&nbsp;attached as a PDF document for your review if you would prefer to see the entire survey prior to answering the online version. &nbsp;Do not submit the PDF document in response to this RFI.&nbsp; The survey will be available until 1 December 2014. <br /><br /><strong>In order to ensure the Government is receiving the most reliable, useful, and relevant information regarding the Temporary Help Services industry, the Government requests that only companies that are primarily Temporary Help Service Firms respond to the survey. <br /></strong><br />If you are unable to complete the survey in one sitting, you will need to close the survey window and re-open the survey link to edit your response.&nbsp; The survey will start from the beginning, but will show the responses you have previously provided. &nbsp;This only works if returning to the survey from the original computer used when you began filling out the survey.&nbsp; All responses are collected based on IP addresses; only one response per IP address is permitted. <br /><br />If you are having any questions or issues with the survey, please email <a href="mailto:KBServices.CC@us.af.mil">KBServices.CC@us.af.mil</a> for assistance. <br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">4. EVALUATION <br /></span></strong><br />Responses will not be evaluated, but are for the purpose of gathering information to help refine our requirements and acquisition strategy. &nbsp;Following your response to this survey, USAF representatives may choose to engage in additional communications with selected respondents. &nbsp;Such communications would only be intended to support USAF market research by obtaining further clarification of the capabilities of the industry to meet requirements.</p>

There is no minimum guarantee in the option years.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Domestic Nuclear Detection Office (DNDO) will hold the 2014 DNDO Industry Day December 9th, 2014 in Washington, DC. <br /><br />Purpose: This event will provide interested vendors, universities, national laboratories, and federal collaborators an overview of DNDO's product acquisition priorities and long-term research and development (R&amp;D) focus areas and show how they align to the Department's Global Nuclear Detection Architecture (GNDA) strategy. <br /><br />This year's event will focus on:<br />&bull; Facilitating dialogue among Government, Industry, Academia, and National Labs to promote technology solutions to homeland security challenges. <br />&bull; Encouraging mutually beneficial relationships between Government, Industry, Academia, and National Labs.<br />&bull; Understanding the detector market.<br />&bull; Promoting technology transition from Research and Development to Commercialization.<br /><br />This event will feature a user panel, enabling attendees to participate in a dialogue with end users on the needs and challenges that can only be met through new technologies. Additionally, we will be holding breakout sessions to strategically target smaller, more focused dialogues around some of the more challenging facets of R&amp;D as they relate to DNDO's mission. The topics for the breakout sessions are:<br />&bull; Detection of SNM (Special Nuclear Material), especially if shielded;<br />&bull; Wide Area Search (WAS), including in Urban and Cluttered Environments; and<br />&bull; Low Cost Materials for gamma and/or neutron detectors<br /><br />Event Location:<br />Carnegie Institution for Science<br />1530 P Street, NW<br />Washington, DC 20005-1910
<p>Getting there via metro:<br />The Red Line/Dupont Circle station is the closet metro (subway) stop. Use the "Dupont Circle South" exit (19th and Connecticut). On reaching the street level, turn to face Dupont Circle, and proceed around the circle to the right (counterclockwise), crossing both Connecticut and Massachusetts Avenues. The third intersection around the circle is P Street. Turn to the right down P Street, where you will immediately cross 18th Street, then continue two more blocks and cross 16th Street. The Carnegie Institution is on P Street between 15th and 16th on the right.<br /><br />Parking:<br />The nearest parking garage is located one block away at 1616 P St NW Washington DC 20005. (Lot #372). If you have any questions, you may contact Colonial Parking directly at 202 295 8200.<br /><br />Hotels &amp; Restaurants:<br />As the venue is near the center of the city and the Dupont Circle area, there are many nearby hotels and many restaurants. <br /><br />REGISTRATION<br />Advance registration is required and open to all interested parties. No walk-ins allowed. Due to space limitations, we will limit participation to two attendees from each organization. As this is an UNCLASSIFIED event, submission of visit requests (security clearances) is not required. However, foreign nationals MUST register a minimum of 30 days prior to the event.<br />The registration form for this meeting is available through the Federal Business Opportunities website. Foreign nationals should request the Foreign National Visitor Form by emailing DNDOIndustryDay@hq.dhs.gov.

On this form you may:</p>
<p>1. Submit your publicly releasable information, including attendee names, affiliation, contact information, and a brief description (limit 500 characters) of your interests and capabilities in radiological/nuclear detection technologies. This information will be distributed to all attendees approximately one week before the meeting to facilitate networking opportunities, and to enable participants to set up one-on-one meetings with field experts. Participants may opt out of sharing this information during registration.<br />2. Select your preferences (first and second choice) for the breakout sessions. <br />3. Indicate your intention to provide company marketing material or technology brochures. (Each vendor will be allotted two- 8 &frac12;" X 11" areas on a table.)<br />4.

<DESC>(SBA Requirement Number 0912/13/302688)
<p>Restricted to eligible 8(a) construction firms with a bona-fide place of business located in the specified geographical area in which the work is to be performed. No seed project solicitation will be available. The draft BOA and the BOA submittal requirements are posted on FED BIZ OPPS in conjunction with this announcement. The United States Coast Guard Civil Engineering Unit Oakland is seeking Small Business Administration (SBA) certified 8 (a) firms serviced by SBA District Offices in Washington, Oregon and California, and other 8(a) participant with SBA recognized bona-fide places of business in Washington, Oregon and California to participate in a Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) Pilot Program. BOAs are designed to provide enhanced contracting opportunities to qualified firms under the 8(a) program serviced by the U.S. Small Business Administration. The BOA is not a contract but a written instrument of understanding negotiated between the US Coast Guard, Civil Engineering Unit (CEU) Oakland, and the 8(a) firm to facilitate the expeditious acquisition of construction services, if and when ordered. The BOA contains contract clauses, provisions, certifications, terms and conditions, which will apply to all task orders issued under the BOA according to the dollar amount of each task order. Annually, CEU Oakland will review the continued need for the BOA in light of (a) usefulness and need for services and (b) the effectiveness of individual contractors. The Contracting Officer will open/advertise the BOA program for new entrants once a year. Under the BOA, 8(a) firms compete on task orders for maintenance, repairs, construction and construction related service requirements pursuant to the BOA. General contractors are preferred, but specialty contractors will be considered as well. Individual projects will be solicited and awarded if and when required. CEU Oakland gives no assurance from the BOA of a steady stream of work. Nothing in the BOA is intended to state or imply any agreement by the Coast Guard to place future contracts or orders with the Contractor or to require that the Coast Guard solicit and acquire covered services from that contractor only. The anticipated construction work may require a diversity of skills suitable to a variety of tasks. The anticipated construction work to be covered under the BOAs include, but is not limited to, new construction, minor construction projects [exterior and interior renovations, alterations, repairs (emergency and routine)], handling of hazardous waste and material, maintenance, mechanical, electrical, heating/air conditioning, painting, paving, earthwork, demolition, installing pipelines, and design assistance. Construction projects covered under the BOA are for work performed in the NAICS Sub-sector Codes 236, 237, and 238.</p>
<p><br />GEOGRAPHICAL AREA OF COVERAGE: The BOA covers Coast Guard and government installations in Washington, Oregon and California. It has been determined that competition will be unrestricted to all eligible 8(a) firms located within the geographical area serviced by the cognizant SBA District Office and other 8(a) construction firms with a bona fide places of business within the competitive geographical area, and the assigned NAICS code. All other 8(a) participants are deemed ineligible to submit offers.</p>
<p>PERFORMANCE PERIOD: The performance period for the BOA is three (3) years with the Government reserving the right to grant extensions for up to two (2) additional years with no single extension exceeding one year OR until the firm graduates from the 8(a) program, whichever occurs first. Options will not be exercised for firms that do not continue to meet all BOA requirements and will be removed accordingly. The agreement can only be changed by modification of the agreement itself and not by individual orders issues hereunder. Either party may cancel the agreement with 60 days written notice to the other party. Any cancellation will not have any effect on task orders issued prior to the effective date of cancellation.</p>
<p>SOLICITATIONS: Each project solicitation will indicate the detail of pricing and technical information to be provided by the offeror, and evaluation criteria and the basis for award to be used for each project. The Contracting Officer, when awarding on a best value basis, may consider factors such as Past Performance, Technical Qualifications, Management Approach and Price. If the award basis will be on price alone, the Contractor may be required to furnish a bid bond with each proposal over $25,000. CEU Oakland will require Payment Bonds on each task order over $30,000 and Performance Bonds on task orders over $150,000. The Government reserves the right to obtain a more detailed cost breakdown of labor, materials, equipment, overhead and profit at any time.</p>
<p>ORDERS: Individual projects will be awarded using the Optional Form 347 and will provide appropriate descriptions, specifications, administrative requirements, pricing terms and completion time. Each order will be considered a separate binding contract.</p>
<p>LIMITATION OF ORDERS: The range will be from $3,000 to a maximum of $3,000,000. Firms must demonstrate they meet the qualifications to receive a BOA.

By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction.

<DESC>Justification for an Exception to Fair Opportunity to extend the period of  performance and total estimated cost within the authority of FAR Part 16.505(b)(2)(i)(C).<br /><br />This authority was utilized to extend the period of performance of the current Task Order. The Task Order implements the USAID Mexico Justice and Security Program, the USAID project under the Merida Initiative, a bilateral initiative of the highest priority for the Government of Mexico (GOM) and the United States Government (USG) to promote security and the rule of law in the region. This TO supports the implementation of the 2008 constitutional amendment that mandates Criminal Justice Reform (CJR) throughout Mexico. This activity was to be replaced by the procurement of a new activity by the end of Fiscal Year (FY) 2013. However, certain protests during the procurement process have delayed the new activity which is currently in the work plan development stage and is not expected to begin activities until at least December 2014. Meanwhile, the constitutional deadline of June 2016 for the GOM to implement the CJR, critical to the Merida-related reforms, is rapidly approaching. The GOM is accelerating the pace of the CJR implementation and has requested increase support from USAID. The extension of the TO with MSI is necessary to most economically and efficiently main USAID's level of effort until the new activity is operational and meet CJR goals previously scheduled and planned to take place in the months of October and November 2014. The extension will also allow for mobilization of the new activity and proper transition to the new activity during the November-December 2014, to ensure that there is no potential lapse in delivering this critical assistance to the GOM.&nbsp;
