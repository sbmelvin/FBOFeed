<DESC>NOTE:  This is a Request for Information only.  The Government is under no obligation to issue a solicitation.  Submission of any information in response to this RFI is completely voluntary, and shall not constitute a fee to the government.

The Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Battlelab (UAVB), located at Creech AFB NV, is chartered to rapidly identify and demonstrate the military worth of innovative concepts that exploit the unique characteristics of UAVs in order to advance the United States military forces combat capabilities.  The mission of the UAVB is to work with the war fighter and identify problems that can be solved using innovative UAV/Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) solutions. The UAVB team works with industry, academia, and our National/Service labs to find solutions to war fighter problems, demonstrate those solutions, make an objective decision on their military utility and then work to transition the initiative to the war fighter.  To accomplish its mission, the UAVB pursues high return initiatives with the goal of conducting each initiative with minimal investment and maximum impact to war fighters UAV/RPA organizations, doctrine, training, and future requirements and acquisitions.

To continue its investigation of innovative UAV and RPA solutions, the UAVB invites capabilities papers (not to exceed 20 pages in length) discussing innovative Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) concepts (concept papers in response to this announcement may be submitted at any time during the period for responsessee below).  The main thrust of the UAVB is to carry out initiatives focused on operations and intelligence.  Concepts will be based on the demonstration of a MATURE, TESTED, COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE TECHNOLOGY.  Capabilities papers should discuss:  (1)  how the product will enhance UAS operations (please describe impact of the proposed concept on one or more of the six Air Force Distinctive Capabilities: Air and Space Superiority, Global Attack, Rapid Global Mobility, Precision Engagement, Information Superiority, and Agile Combat Support), (2) what makes the concept innovative and how it will use commercial or non-developmental items (NDI) to accomplish its mission (please describe technical merit of the proposed concept with an emphasis on novel, creative, and innovative solutions), (3) the concepts execution methodology, (4) support components required for the concept to include hardware, software, data, facilities and training, (5) expected results, benefits or product of the concept, and (6) proposed AF and DoD operational users of the concept. 
 
Electronic submission of concept papers may be made to steven.ward@nellis.af.mil by attaching the document to e-mail.  Technical questions should be directed to Lt Col Steven Ward at (702) 652-0287.
