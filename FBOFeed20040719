<DESC>NASA/MSFC has a requirement for one (1) each Model LPSR 300 AZ Technology Laboratory Portable SpectroReflectometer. NASA/MSFC intends to purchase the items from AZ Technology, 7047 Old Madison Pike, Suite 300, Huntsville, AL 35806, pursuant to FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), for the acquisition of supplies or services determined to be reasonably available from only one source.  Competition is impractical for the following reasons: 1.  The proposed AZ Technology Model LPSR 300 SpectroReflectometer will replace one at MSFC.  This type of SpectroReflectometer is used extensively in the analysis of flight hardware to confirm adequate material properties or to observe changes caused by actual or simulated space environment.  The existing database contains over 15,000 measurements, including 600+ measurements of material samples currently on board the International Space Station.	Incompatible measurements would result in significant loss of knowledge about the space environment and its effects and would hamper flight hardware processing due to uncertainty of thermo-optical characteristics.   2.    AZ Technology is the developer and only known supplier of portable SpectroReflectometers.	Market research reveals that other SpectroReflectometers are available, but they lack portability and severely limit the size and configuration of samples.  Portability is extremely important, as this instrument will be used to make measurements of flight hardware on the shop floor and in various clean rooms as well as in the research laboratory.  The instrument must also have the capability to make measurements on any size sample above 0.5”, which may include direct measurements of Space Station hardware 14 feet in diameter.  AZ Technology is the only known company with the expertise and personnel to manufacture a laboratory portable SpectroReflectometer with the necessary capabilities in a timely manner. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on 07/26/2004.	Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce/National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration intends to negotiate with Travel Industry Association of America (TIA) 1100 New York Avenue, NW Washington DC 20005 on a sole source basis in accordance with the authority of 41 U. S. C. 253 (c)(1) only one responsible source.  
 
The acquisition includes establishing a contract to develop highly technical data on travel and tourism expenditures within the U.S. economy, targeting the improvement of Travel and Tourism Satellite Accounts.  The Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) has developed several satellite accounts designed to expand the analytical capabilities of the system of national accounts.  Included among these is the Travel and Tourism satellite Accounts (TTSA’s), which are used to determine the economic size of the U.S. travel and tourism industry.  BEA will be revising updating the TTSA’s and to improve these estimates, BEA requires more comprehensive data on U.S. travelers’ spending behaviors and trip characteristics.  Particularly, BEA requires better measures of travel and tourism expenditures by type of traveler and purpose of trip; better data on travel and tourism expenditures on particular commodities and activities, such as gasoline and gaming; and an additional source of high quality expenditure data collected directly from travelers.  The collection of this data should be based on sound statistical sampling techniques and methodologies.  

TIA is uniquely qualified to provide the dataset, surveys and techniques outlined in the requirement.  TIA conducts surveys soliciting data not available to BEA from other travel and tourism surveys.  These surveys are conducted using a TIA consumer mail panel, and other methodologies required by BEA.   

Offerors certain they can meet the requirements are requested to submit in writing an affirmative response and technical capabilities.  All written responses must include a written narrative statement of capability, including detailed technical information demonstrating their ability to meet the above requirements.  The response must be sufficient to permit agency analysis to establish a bonafide capability to meet the requirements.  Failure to submit such documentation will result in the Government proceeding as stated above.  A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Affirmative written responses must be received no later than 15-days after publication of this synopsis.

All information in response to this notification must be submitted in writing to the attention of the Joel Perlroth, Contracting Officer.  Note 22 applies.

<DESC>This notice releases a solicitation for IT facility, programming and repair services in support of three computer facilities for the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's Directorate of Science Technology and Medicine.  Interested parties need to read the entire announcement published on-line in the Federal Business Opportunities under Department of Labor, Office of the Assistant Secretary for Administration and Management, Washington, DC office, to include attached MS Word and Excel files for the solicitation and statement of work w/attachments, and then download documents from FedBizOps.  In accordance with FAR Part 12, this is a combined synopsis/solicitation notice.  This notice and attached documents are the entire solicitation; a paper solicitation will not be issued.  This is a new requirement currently being met through a variety of individual purchase orders and has not been consolidted into a combined contract action.  The facilities are located in Salt Lake City, Utah; Cincinnati, Ohio; and Washington, DC.  This is NOT the same requirement for which preliminary notices were released on 7/13/04 for other OSHA Information Technology requirements.  This requirement is 100% set-aside for small business but with sources restricted to those firms with existing management and performance in both the Salt Lake City, Utah and Washington, DC areas.  The requirement has been consolidated together due to the need for increased management oversight by the DOL under a single contract and project officer.  The requirement is not "bundling" because it is to be performed by small businesses.  Solicitation on this requirement is restricted to bidding from firms with existing management and performance in BOTH the Washington, DC area and the Salt Lake basin as of the date of this solicitation.  The Cincinnati portion of the requirement is a relatively small amount of the overall requirement and can be handled by a purchase order or subcontract within the umbrella of the overall contract without requiring existing performance in Cincinnati.  Market research indicates that due to the presence of Hill Air Force Base in the Salt Lake basin combined with the Federal presence in Washington, DC there will be a sufficient number of small business firms available under the required criteria to provide these services.  An electronic copy of the solicitation to include separate files for the statement of work and equipment list are attached to this solicitationas MS Word and Excel files.  This notice will appear first and then attachments will appear within a few hours afterwards.  Proposals are due by electronic submission not later than Monday, August 23, 2004, 2 p.m. Eastern Standard time.  Do not fax or mail proposals.  Separate pricing and technical proposals are to be provided, as specified under Section L of the solicitation.

<DESC>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC) is issuing notice of intent to negotiate a sole source procurement with the University of Massachusetts (Umass) to provide an analysis of herring stock composition using body and otolith shape from putative stocks in the Gulf of Maine, Georges Bank, and Nova Scotia areas.  The requirement is a large-scale study of mixing of different components of Atlantic herring in the waters off Canada and the eastern United States using morphometric methods.  The proposed contract is a follow on contract to a previous study of herring stock composition successfully conducted by the University.  Umass is uniquely qualified to provide the scientific expertise and assistance needed to accomplish the objectives of the proposed stock analysis project as they have pioneered the analysis and interpretation of morphometrics data and are leaders in determining future directions for this field of study.  University personnel have developed both conceptual and analytical expertise in this area of work over the last 10 years and no other entities in the region are capable of accomplishing the work that needs to be done.  The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is 41 USC 253 (c) (1), Only One Responsible Source.  Interested parties may identify their interest and must provide evidence of their capability to respond to the requirement by August 2, 2004.    Written requests for additional information may be faxed to (757) 441-3786.  Telephone requests will not be accepted. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.   Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Numbered Note 22 applies.

<DESC>APPROXIMATE SOLICITATION ISSUE DATE:  4 June 2004.  The 55th Contracting Squadron will be conducting the solicitation and award of a full and open competition, non-personal services, Cost Plus Award Fee, follow-on contract for a base period and 6 one-year option periods.  This effort is to provide engineering services for maintenance and enhancement of Automated Window Planning Systems (AWPS) and AWPS Analysis Initiative (AAI) software.  The Government anticipates issuing a Request for Proposal (RFP) for performance over a seven-year period.  This period will be the base year FY 05 contract and will include one-year options for the following six fiscal years (FY06 through FY11).  The AWPS tool has been a vital part of the Integrated Strategic Planning and Analysis Network (ISPAN) system for over ten years.  AWPS/AAI is a PC based, windows driven graphical user interface with data management and analysis capabilities used to support nuclear weapons employment plan development.  AWPS/AAI provides plan review and analysis capabilities, mapping, damage calculation, data migration, and plan maintenance.

The Air Force intends to solicit proposals for a Firm-Fixed Price contract for Repair of Acid Corrosion Warehouse, Bldg 415, Moron AB, Spain.  Contract magnitude is between $25,000 and $100,000.  The successful contractor will be selected using Past Performance/Price Tradeoff (PPPT) procedures resulting in the best value to the Government.  Past Performance will be rated significantly higher than price.  You are requested to notify the contracting officer, jeffrey.powell@moron.af.mil if you intend to download the solicitation.  It is highly recommended that you register to be notified of any new postings for this pre-solicitation notice and or any other postings published by our office.

Therefore, you should check EPS frequently for any new postings that may have been made.  As a last resort, if you cannot download the pre-solicitation from the EPS internet site, we will provide a CD ROM Disk, however, you must provide two working day notice (workdays are Monday through Friday except Spanish and American holidays) of your request for a CD ROM Disk to the above e-mail address or via fax at 95 584 8054.

<DESC>Expression of Interest and Industry comments are being solicited by the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) for Request for Proposal (RFP) FN5008/FMP, Rail Yard Expansion Project at Brentwood, Greenbelt, and Shady Grove Yards.  This is a “fast-track” two phase Design Build (DB) procurement that requires the DB to perform final design services for renovation and expansion of three existing WMATA Service & Inspection (S&I) yards, and construction of the requisite improvements.  Phase I, Request for Qualifications (RFQ), will require the Proposer(s) to submit their Statement of Qualifications (SOQ).  The Phase I proposals will be evaluated and no more than five Proposers will be invited to submit technical and price proposals under Phase II, Request for Proposals (RFP).  The Phase II technical and price proposals will be evaluated and a successful Proposer will be chosen to complete the final design and all construction work.  Award will be made to that proposer who provides the best overall technical design solution on a “Fixed Budget / Best-Design” basis.  In order to promote increased competition and to enhance design innovation and in consideration for preparation of a Phase II technical design proposal, WMATA will provide for a stipend to be paid to the unsuccessful Phase II offerors whose design conforms to furnished design criteria and whose technical proposal is deemed to be technically acceptable.  Details on the amount of the stipend and administration thereof will be included in the RFQ. 

The scope of the project is for the construction of a new, two-story 72,000 s.f. back shop building at the Greenbelt Yard facility to accommodate all component repairs from the Brentwood Yard.  Wheel and axle repairs will be expanded in the existing Greenbelt S & I shop.  Construction of a new 16 bay S & I double ended maintenance shop with necessary trackwork and systems will be constructed at the Shady Grove Yard immediately adjacent to the existing shop.  Expanded back shop, parking and laydown areas will also be constructed at Shady Grove.  Relocation of all heavy repair operations including wheel and axle repairs, electronics, HVAC, battery brake motor machine and other support functions from the Brentwood S & I shop to Greenbelt.  Three new tracks and four S & I bays will be installed in the space vacated by heavy repairs at the Brentwood yard.  The Budget for this project is between $100 to $125 million and the performance period is approximately 34 months with an end date for completion of September 2007.

The elevator modernization project will include, but is not limited to the following:  Modernization and maintenance of seven (7) building passenger elevators to be awarded in stages as follows:  STAGE ONE:  The Base Contract shall include the modernization (including the cabs) of three (3) passenger elevators, Nos. 1, 2, and 3, and the preventive maintenance of all seven (7) building elevators, Nos. 1 thru 7 from the 1st day of the month following the Notice to Proceed until twelve (12) months following the acceptance of the last car modernized.

However, if funding for these options is not available this fiscal year, the Government expects to award them at the start of the next fiscal year.  The estimated cost of this project is between $500,000 and $1,000,000.  Award will be made as a firm fixed price contract and the procurement method will be a competitive negotiated Request for Proposal (RFP).  Source Selection procedures as identified in FAR 15.3 will be utilized in the selection of a firm offering the best value to the Government in terms of price and technical merit and whose performance is expected to best meet the stated Government requirements when incorporating the tradeoff process between price-related and non-price related factors.  Upon receipt and evaluation of all technical and price proposals, a formal selection of a firm will be made that offers the greatest value to the Government based on a combination of technical evaluation and price factors.  Failure of offerors to submit a technical offer will preclude further participation on this acquisition.  This solicitation is being procured on an unrestricted basis.  The NAICS code applicable to this project is 238990.  The Government has reserved the right to make an award without discussions.  For this procurement, technical evaluation factors are significantly more important than price.

FORM B
REQUEST FOR SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED DOCUMENTS

SOLICITATION NO.:  GS-03P-04-AZC-0015

This solicitation includes Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU) building information.  SBU documents provided under this solicitation are intended for use by authorized users only. In support of this requirement, GSA requires bidders/offerors to exercise reasonable care when handling documents relating to SBU building information per the solicitation. 

REASONABLE CARE:

1. Limiting dissemination to authorized users. Dissemination of information shall only be made upon determination that the recipient is authorized to receive it. The criterion to determine authorization is need-to-know. Those with a need-to-know are those who are specifically granted access for the conduct of business on behalf of or with GSA. This includes all persons or firms necessary to do work at the request of the Government, such as architects and engineers, consultants, contractors, sub-contractors, suppliers, and others that the contractor deems necessary in order to submit an offer/bid or to complete the work or contract, as well as maintenance and repair contractors and equipment service contractors.

NOTE: It is the responsibility of the person or firm disseminating the information to assure that the recipient is an authorized user and to keep records of recipients.

Authorized users shall provide identification as set forth below:

Valid identification for non-Government users. Authorized non-Government users shall provide valid identification to receive SBU building information. The identification shall be presented and verified for each dissemination. Valid identification shall be all items (a) through (c), below, and including item (d), as necessary:

(a) A copy of a valid business license or other documentation granted by the state or local jurisdiction to conduct business. The license at a minimum shall provide the name, address, phone number of the company, state of incorporation, and the name of the individual legally authorized to act for the company. The business must be of the type required to do the work. A general contractor’s license may be substituted for the business license in states that do not issue such licenses. In the rare cases where a business license is not available from the jurisdiction, the information shall be provided and testified to by the submitter; and

(b) Verification of a valid DUNS Number against the company name listed on the business license or certification. Verification may be obtained through http://www.fpdc.gov, or by calling Dun & Bradstreet at 703-807-5078 to set up an account; and

(c) A Valid IRS Tax ID Number of the company requesting the information; and, as necessary,

(d) A Valid picture state driver’s license shall be required of person(s) picking up SBU documents. Phone verification must be made to a previously validated authorized user that the individual(s) picking up the documentation is authorized to do so by the company obtaining the documents. SBU documents will not be released to any individual or firm who has not, either previously or at the time of pickup, supplied the required documentation as outlined in paragraphs (a) through (c), above.

2. Retaining and destroying documents. The efforts required above shall continue throughout the entire term of the contract and for whatever specific time thereafter as may be necessary. Necessary record copies for legal purposes (such as those retained by the architect, engineer, or contractor) must be safeguarded against unauthorized use for the term of retention. Documents no longer needed shall be destroyed (such as after contract award, after completion of any appeals process or completion of the work). Destruction shall be done by burning or shredding hardcopy, and/or physically destroying CD’s, deleting and removing files from the electronic recycling bins, and removing material from computer hard drives using a permanent erase utility or similar software.

3. Term of Effectiveness. The efforts required above shall continue throughout the entire term of contract and for what specific time thereafter as may be necessary, as determined by the Government. Necessary record copies for legal purposes (such as those retained by the architect, engineer, or contractor) must be safeguarded against unauthorized use for the term of retention.

4. Written agreement of disposal. For all contracts using SBU building information, the contractor shall provide a written statement that he and his subcontractors have properly disposed of the SBU building documents, with the exception of the contractor’s record copy, at the time of Release of Claims to obtain final payment.  Documents no longer needed shall be destroyed (such as after contract award, after completion of any appeals process or completion of the work). Destruction shall be done by burning or shredding hardcopy, and/or physically destroying CDs, deleting and removing files from the electronic recycling bins, and removing material from computer hard drives using a permanent erase utility or similar software. The recipient acknowledges the requirement to use reasonable care, as outlined above, to safeguard the documents and, if not awarded, the contract (and at the completion of any protest/appeal process) will make every reasonable and prudent effort to destroy or render useless all SBU information received during the solicitation.
 

I agree that I will abide by this agreement and will only disseminate Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU) building information to other authorized users under the conditions set forth above.

<DESC>USAID will post a request for proposals (RFP) for indefinite quantity contracts (IQCs) with time and materials (T&M) pricing for technical assistance in the area of Commercial Legal and Institutional Reform. USAID estimates awarding up to five contracts, consisting of up to four unrestricted contracts and one set-aside contract for small business (on the condition that it is capable of undertaking the work). USAID anticipates that the maximum ordering limitation of the contracts resulting from this RFP will be $600,000,000 over the five-year ordering period. Note also that this ceiling applies across all contracts and cannot be exceeded in the aggregate. Note that there is no guarantee on the number of contracts awarded or the number of orders that any one firm will receive beyond the minimum stated in the RFP. The RFP will be posted only at www.fbo.gov. In accordance with FAR 5.102(d), availability of the solicitation is limited to this electronic medium only. Requests for other copies of the RFP will be disregarded without notice to the requestor. Proposals are expected to be due on March 4, 2003. The purpose of these IQCs are to empower missions to engage in commercial legal and institutional reform (CLIR) projects by enabling them to procure short- and long-term services through a structured and easy-to-use procurement system.  In the process, the CLIR IQCs seek to build upon the work completed under the original Support for Economic Growth and Institutional Reform (SEGIR) Legal and Institutional Reform (LIR) IQCs, accumulating the intellectual and technical resources necessary to better understand, and thereby overcome, legal and institutional constraints to economic growth experienced by developing countries. USAID hopes to make the task of CLIR more efficient by achieving economies of scale in response to the technical assistance demands of developing countries (as communicated through USAID missions worldwide).  Finally, USAID seeks to advance state-of-the-art practice within the international donor community by making contributions to development theory. Activities under this Subject Area will fall within the following functional areas: (a) General Commercial Legal Framework; (b) Business Environment; (c) Financial Services; (d) Trade and Investment; (e) Commercial Dispute Resolution; (f) Institutional Reform; and (g) Property Rights. NAIC Code 541611. Numbered Note 2 is applicable.

<DESC>The National Institute of Diabetes, and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) is planning a ten-year continuation of the follow-up study of approximately 1,400 subjects enrolled in the Epidemiology Diabetes Interventions and Complications (EDIC).  Twenty-eight clinical centers have been participating under a contract awarded to Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) by NIDDK in this follow-up study of participants originally studied in a randomized, multi-centered clinical trial called the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT).  

The DCCT began in 1982 with twenty-one centers and eight additional sites were added after the first three-year feasibility phase was completed.  The twenty-nine clinical centers were funded by cooperative agreements awarded by NIDDK.  The DCCT studied the effect of intensive blood glucose control on the occurrence of early microvascular complications of type 1 diabetes mellitus. The DCCT completed the intervention study in June 1993, and the main results were reported in the New England Journal of Medicine in September 1993.  At the end of the DCCT, two study sites were combined so that twenty-eight centers continued to follow the DCCT patients.  EDIC, the follow-on study to the DCCT, began in 1993 and was initially funded as a continuation of the DCCT cooperative agreements.

Since 1996 CWRU has performed under contract with NIDDK as the EDIC Clinical Coordinating Center, with one clinical center located on-site at CWRU and the other twenty-seven clinical centers performing under subcontracts with CWRU.  CWRU was chosen under a limited competition with the twenty-eight medical institutions that were the only known sources with access to the subjects who participated in the DCCT.  The institutions are CWRU, University of Pennsylvania, Cornell University Medical Center, Henry Ford Hospital, Institute for Research and Education, Massachusetts General Hospital, Mayo Foundation, Medical University of South Carolina, Park Nicollet Medical Foundation, University of Iowa, University of Minnesota, University of Missouri – Columbia, University of Pittsburgh, University of Tennessee, University of Texas Southwestern Medical School	, University of Toronto, University of Washington, University of Western Ontario, Vanderbilt University, Washington University at St. Louis, Yale University, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Northwestern University, University of California, San Diego. University of Maryland at Baltimore, 	University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center, University of South Florida, and University of Michigan. 

Under the EDIC, long-term follow-up of this cohort has provided additional important scientific information on late macrovascular complications that were not studied in the DCCT.  The EDIC study group has made the unexpected finding that “metabolic memory” exists for the effect of blood glucose control on the development of complications in patients with type 1 diabetes.  Despite similar levels of blood glucose control during the EDIC study, patients who were in the DCCT intensively treated group have had much slower progression of retinopathy, nephropathy, and cardiovascular event markers than the DCCT standard group patients.  This has been documented in multiple peer-reviewed publications (see attachment).  

It is the intention of the Government to negotiate with CWRU a ten-year follow-on contract to perform as the EDIC Clinical Coordinating Center (EDIC CCC).  CWRU has served as the EDIC CCC and has established and managed subcontracts with the other EDIC 27 centers since 1996.  In this role CWRU has developed the experience and expertise to efficiently manage these contracts.  The participants are a closed population so the subcontracts for the extension of EDIC will be with the same 27 institutions which are the only sources with access to the approximately 1,400 EDIC subjects.  None of the other twenty-seven EDIC clinical centers with access to the EDIC participants have the staff, organization, experience, and facilities to perform as the EDIC CCC.
The EDIC CCC is responsible for supervising and monitoring the subcontractors’ performance for the approximately 1,400 patients at the twenty-eight clinical centers.  The EDIC CCC is responsible for supervising the structure and functioning of the EDIC clinics.  This includes monitoring the performance of study personnel, approving the allocation of study FTE, approving changes in clinical center Principal Investigators, providing uniform supplies to the clinics for performance of the subjects’ assessments, supporting the preparation and submission of informed consent documents, and monitoring the performance of subject assessments and data collection.  The subject assessments include obtaining blood specimens for biochemical analysis of renal and metabolic status in central labs, renal function evaluation, ultrasound and electrocardiograph macrovascular assessment, stereo fundus photographs of the retina, carotid ultrasound examinations, and coronary calcification computed tomography scans. The EDIC CCC has developed an interactive relationship with the 27 subcontracting centers.  Subcontracts are issued for the study deliverables and continuously monitored.   The EDIC CCC compiles, completes, and submits all financial reports for the 28 institutions (including itself).

<DESC>The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) is planning to negotiate an extension contract to the Epidemiology of Diabetes Intervention and Complications (EDIC), an ongoing, longitudinal follow up to the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT).  The goal of the DCCT, a multi-centered clinical trial that ran from 1982 until 1993 and involved 1441 patients with Type 1 Diabetes, was to investigate the early microvascular and neurologic complications of Type 1 Diabetes and whether intensive insulin treatment would prevent and/or ameliorate those complications.  The main results of the DCCT have been reported (NEJM, September 30, 1993).  In EDIC the surviving participants from the DCCT cohort are followed longitudinally to study the long-term effects of prior separation of glycemic levels, risk factors for macrovascular outcomes, and the correlation of progression of micro- and macrovascular outcomes.  
Ongoing EDIC assessments include:  biochemical analyses of blood specimens to ascertain renal and metabolic status, electrocardiography, ultrasonography and coronary artery calcification studies by computed tomography to determine macrovascular disease; and stereo fundus photography to ascertain retinal status.  The DCCT/EDIC Study Group has published a combined 90 reports and has produced an additional 150 presentations and abstracts based on the research findings (see Attachment 1).  Planned future assessments include cardiac NMR imaging, blood and urine proteomics, and repeat neuropathy screening.  Continued long-term follow-up of the currently active 1354 EDIC participants (see Attachment 2) will provide important scientific information on late macrovascular complications that have only recently begun to be observed in this cohort.  

The George Washington University Biostatistics Center has served as the Data Coordinating Center (DCC) for DCCT/EDIC since 1982.  The following describes the expertise of The Biostatistics Center and its collaborators and their contributions to DCCT and to EDIC.

EXPERTISE IN BIOSTATISTICS AND DIABETES EPIDEMIOLOGY   The Principal Investigator of the Data Coordinating Center at the GWU Biostatistics Center since the inception of the DCCT in 1982 is John Lachin, Professor of Biostatistics and Epidemiology, and of Statistics. Dr. Lachin has authored three books on biostatistical methods, over 55 articles on statistical and clinical trials methodology, an additional 30 articles of medical research results; and is a corporate author of over 100 additional articles published by research groups in which he had participated. Since the inception of the DCCT, Ms Patricia Cleary has served as Deputy Director, and now Director, of the Coordinating Center.  Dr. Lachin and/or Ms. Cleary have been an author of virtually all of the published reports from DCCT/EDIC and have each chaired writing committees for many of these reports.  In addition, both Dr. Lachin and Ms. Cleary have given presentations of DCCT/EDIC results to the annual meetings of the American Diabetes Association, the International Diabetes Federation, and the International Diabetes Epidemiology Group, among others. Dr. Lachin and Ms. Cleary are recognized internationally as experts in the epidemiology of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. 
Dr. Lachin, often in collaboration with leading theoretical statisticians, has also developed statistical methods that have been employed in the design of DCCT and EDIC and the analysis of DCCT/EDIC results. These include statistical methods for the repeated interim analysis of the emerging results from the DCCT and EDIC, methods for the analysis of interval censored event-time data with time-dependent covariates, among others.
In addition, the Biostatistics Center (BSC) of The George Washington University has extensive experience with diabetes trials and longitudinal epidemiologic studies.  
The DCCT/EDIC Study has taken a leading position in studying the role of genetics in the development of diabetes.   Assessments of familial aggregation were performed during DCCT and will be repeated in EDIC in order to test whether DNA variation in a number of candidate genes is related to susceptibility to diabetes and its complications.  To this end, DNA is being collected from all available parents of DCCT/EDIC participants and at least one full non-diabetic sibling.  In addition, measures of diabetic complications are also being assessed on diabetic siblings of participants.  The DCC is currently initiating the establishment of a repository of DNA samples from the DCCT/EDIC participants and their relatives.  Mechanisms for accessing these samples by qualified researchers are also being generated.

PROFESSIONAL AND TECHNICAL EXPERTISE   All procedures necessary for data collection, editing, and processing; and for the maintenance of permanent study files and documentation related to the DCCT/EDIC database are implemented by the DCC staff as specified in the Internal Procedures Manual and in accordance with HIPAA regulations.  The DCC professional and technical staff includes the principal and co-principal investigators, database manager, statisticians, programmers, technology and web support specialists, research assistants, contractual, financial and administrative specialists, and data entry clerks.  Overall, the DCC staff has expertise in statistics, programming (SAS and FoxPro), contract and sub-recipient agreement management, clinical trials management as well as web site development and maintenance.

COMPUTING FACILITY   The DCC utilizes the computing infrastructure of the George Washington University Biostatistics Center.  At the core of the computing infrastructure is an IBM Multiprise 3000, S/390 class enterprise server.  This server acts as the central data warehouse for all data received for the DCCT/EDIC study.  The server provides one of the most fault tolerant, secure and stable platforms available in the industry.  Access to the computing facility is restricted to Biostatistics Center staff.  All access is monitored and logged.  Unauthorized access is prevented by way of account deactivation and is monitored 24 hours a day.  Data stored for the DCCT/EDIC study is kept separate from other studies conducted by the Biostatistics Center.  Access to the DCCT/EDIC data is restricted to the DCC staff and is password protected.  Physical site security is maintained by way of electronic access key entry system and closed circuit video cameras.

DATA SECURITY   Data is stored on the enterprise server and is accessible to DCC staff for analysis and reporting needs.  All data for the DCC is backed up on a daily basis.  Dozens of backups are maintained for extended period of time so that they would reflect the state of the databases and files at various points in time.  Extensive systems are in place to ensure proper backup of all information so that data loss is prevented.  All desktop systems are backed up using a central backup server.  Disaster recovery measures have been taken to prevent data loss in the event of a catastrophic disaster.  All data and files stored on the enterprise server and various network file servers are backed up to tape and sent off-site to a remote location where they are kept in an environmentally controlled safe.  In addition, designated desktop computers that house particularly important information participate in this off-site disaster recovery program.  

PROJECT, CONTRACTUAL AND FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT  The Administrative Group of the Biostatistics Center has extensive experience handling the various contractual mechanisms necessary including:  government and subcontract contracts, clinic, and consulting and service agreements.  The Administrative and Programming group have also developed an automated system to generate clinic reimbursement reports and payment requests linked to receipt of central laboratory data.  This system is programmed to interface with the University payment system.  The DCC also coordinates the existing subcontracts and service agreements with central laboratories, reading centers and coding units needed to perform subject assessments in accordance with study protocol.  

FORM DESIGN AND SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT   Sixty-eight EDIC forms and Twenty-four Genetic Studies forms were designed and developed by DCC staff for data collection, adverse event verification, patient status notification, certification of technicians, and mailing status.  Using SAS FSEDIT, software was developed and is maintained by DCC programming staff for data entry and data editing of EDIC forms.   Procedures used to create the data entry system include: creation of fifty-three map files and range edit files, software development to integrate map files and range edit files, software development to create main menus and selection menus for new and continuing data entry, software development to produce 131 data entry screens, one data entry screen for each page of a form for all forms, software development to create fifty-three driver programs, procedures to integrate data entry screens and driver programs into FSP, and procedures to incorporate text files into the SCL application using Interactive SAS.  
FoxPro was used to design and develop data entry screens for Genetic Studies data collection forms.  Procedures for software development using FoxPro include: creation of data dictionaries with finalized data structures and set requirement levels with logical ranges, uploading the data dictionaries to the mainframe, preparation for data entry by building an executable file that when launched will give the end user the data entry screens for keying, uploading keyed FoxPro files to the mainframe and executing the production program.  In addition to FoxPro software, SAS software was used for Genetic Studies to develop programs to integrate FoxPro data dictionaries and data files keyed in FoxPro, into SAS datasets on the mainframe.  The Genetic Studies Database Management System consists of 48 data entry screens.  The EDIC ancillary study URO-EDIC, also keyed in FoxPro, consists of 12 data entry screens.  
A separate data dictionary, and separate files containing valid ranges for each variable, were generated and are maintained by DCC Database Management staff for both EDIC and Genetic Studies data collection forms.  The DCC has 84 master files for the EDIC and EDIC Genetics Forms, some forms with as many as 5 versions.  The number of records for each file ranges between 5 and 8,530; and the number of variables in each file ranges between 12 and 466.  A list of all of the EDIC and EDIC Genetics Forms is attached to this document (see Attachment 3).  In addition, summary listings of the master files for the EDIC and EDIC Genetics Forms data are attached to this document (see Attachment 4).
Programs and systems have also been written and established to interface with, convert, receive, batch, check, scan and/or process data receive and process information received from the central coding and reading units.  A summary list of the master files for EDIC Central Reading Unit data is attached to this document (see Attachment 5). The procedures utilized at the DCC for receiving and processing this data is summarized below:

      The Central Ophthalmologic Reading Unit:
Fundus Photographic data is received via diskette from the Central Ophthalmologic Reading Unit, for both EDIC and EDIC Genetic Studies, and uploaded to the mainframe.  SAS Software is used to process the raw data and create a Master File.  SAS Software is also used to produce patient feedback reports based on Fundus Photograph and Visual Acuity data. 
     
        The Central Biochemistry Laboratory:
EDIC CBL Data is received via diskette and uploaded to the mainframe.  SAS Software is used to process the raw CBL data and create a Master File. SAS Software is used to produce patient feedback reports based on CBL data.  EDIC Genetic Studies CBL Data is received via FTP at a secured web address.  SAS Software is used to process the raw CBL data and create a Master File.  SAS Software is also used to produce patient feedback reports based on CBL data.

The Central ECG Reading Unit:
Copies of ECG tracings are received via mail from the Clinical Centers.  The ECG tracings are batched by a Data Control Clerk and mailed to the ECG Reading Unit for processing.  Two types of ECG data are received via diskette from the ECG reading Unit: the raw Minnesota Code data and the ECG Serial Change Comparison data.  Separate SAS programs are used to process the data, and separate master files created.  SAS Software is used to generate patient feedback reports based on ECG data.

The Central Ultrasound Reading Unit:
Carotid Ultrasound data is received via email from the Central Ultrasound Reading Unit.  Raw data is processed using SAS Software and a Master File was created.  SAS Software was used to generate patient feedback reports.

     The Central Food Frequency Recall Unit:
Food Frequency Questionnaires are mailed from the Clinical Centers to the Data Coordinating Center.  Questionnaires are checked, batched, and mailed to the Central Food Frequency Recall Unit for scanning and processing.  Food Frequency Data was previously received via diskette and are now being received via email.  SAS Software is used to process the raw data and create a Master File for Food Frequency Questionnaire data.

     The Central Computed Tomography Reading Unit:
Data was received via EUDORA and uploaded to the mainframe.  SAS Software was used to process CT Scan data and create a Master File.  SAS Software was used to edit CT Scan data based on specifications received from the CT Reading Unit.  Patient feedback reports based on CT Scan data were generated and mailed to the Clinical Centers for distribution to the patients.  New data values were received from the CT Reading Unit based on adjustments to existing data.  SAS Software was used to incorporate the new data values into the Master File for CT Scan data.
Invoices were generated for payment of CT Scans along with several reports tracking payments for CT Scans.  
 
All software used for data entry and data editing for EDIC and Genetic Studies was designed and developed internally, by the DCC EDIC Database Management staff and are not available commercially.  

DATA MANAGEMENT   Over the past 20 years, the DCC has developed an extensive and well-established central data entry system and quality control procedures for receiving, checking, entering and verifying data to be entered into its central data entry system from the 28 EDIC clinical centers.  Forms are mailed from each of the 28 clinic sites in monthly mailings.  The procedures for receiving and processing the data from these forms are summarized below:  

Each of the 28 EDIC clinic centers mail all completed forms once a month on the Thursday of the week designated for each clinic.  When forms arrive at the Data Coordinating Center, the number and types of forms received is compared to the number and types of forms sent by the Study Coordinator as listed on EDIC Form 101, Forms Mailing List, and EDIC Form 100, Clinic Forms Inventory.  A trace is initiated if there are any discrepancies, and the Study Coordinator is contacted so that copies of any missing forms may be mailed with the next month’s batch.  Data entry specialists then key the data using SAS programs.  There is a separate FSEDIT data entry program for each EDIC Form.  FoxPro Software is used to perform data entry and initial editing of the EDIC Genetics Studies data.  Keyed data is verified by the execution of another SAS program.  Keyed batch files are transferred from each data entry PC to the mainframe for further processing on a weekly basis.  EDIC Genetics Studies data is uploaded to the mainframe from each PC on a bi-weekly basis.

A SAS program is executed to produce a listing of keyed batches in preparation for the weekly production run.  The report lists the number of Forms in each batch, the date that the batch file was transmitted to the mainframe, and the date that the batch file was processed.  The production program is executed on a weekly basis.  This program adds keyed batch files for each EDIC Form to the corresponding Master File.  The DCC maintains a separate Master File for each EDIC Form.  SAS Software is used to convert the FoxPro data into a SAS database Master File for each Genetics Studies form, separately.

A separate edit program that searches for missing data, inconsistencies, and values out of range edits each form.  If any are found, an error notice (which lists all the errors detected for a given form) is generated and mailed to the originating Clinical Center for recording the correct information.  Corrected notices are returned to the Data Coordinating Center in the next month’s mailing.  A SAS FSEDIT program is used to key data received via EDIC Edit Message Reports.  Batches containing keyed EDIC Edit Message Report data are transferred from each PC hard-drive to the mainframe for further processing.  Another SAS program is run to add the Edit Message data to a transaction file.  Finally, another SAS program is executed to apply the edits to the appropriate Master File.  

The DCC generates clinical and feedback reports for each participant.  The purpose of the Patient Clinical Report/Feedback Report is to provide the patients and their physicians with the centrally determined results of his/her examination each year.  The EDIC Patient Clinical/Feedback Report that the patient receives includes exam results for all DCCT and EDIC years.  The report provides the following results for the examinations:	
HbA1c Measurement (%)
Glomerular Filtration Rate (Creatinine Clearance Lothalamate)
Serum Creatinine and Urine Albumin Excretion
Lipids (Cholesterol, Triglycerides, HDL, and LDL)
Retinopathy Level as measured with the ETDRS grading system
Visual Acuity (Snellen units)
Macular Edema Status
Intraocular Pressure (mmHg)
Ankle/Arm Doppler
ECG
Yearly gifts and holiday cards are also circulated from the DCC to the EDIC clinics to be distributed to the participants.

The DCC also generates reports for the clinics and various monitoring committees associated with the study.  These include:  a) one annual report for clinical centers; b) one quarterly report for clinical centers; c) nine reports for the Data Quality Assurance Subcommittee; d) eight quarterly reports for the Adherence Monitoring Subcommittee; e) six monthly reports for the Genetic Studies Subcommittee; f) 15 monthly reports for the CT Scan Subcommittee; and g) ten annual reports for the External Advisory Committee.  A summary list of these reports and their content is attached to this document (see Attachment 6).  

STATISTICAL ANALYSIS   The statistical staff of the DCC has extensive experience with the various types of data that are recorded and analyzed in studies of Type 1 diabetes, and with the statistical methods that are employed.  In some cases, these are highly specialized.  These include the analysis of ordinal longitudinal retinopathy data using multivariate rank tests, the analysis of coronary calcification measures with a lower limit of quantification using Tobit regression models, and the analysis of interval censored event time data, among others.
The Biostatistics Center has numerous software packages and products available to its statisticians and programmers (SAS and related SAS products, S-Plus, StatXact, LogXact, NQuery and various others) for use in conducting analyses and running periodic, ad hoc and interim study reports.  

WEBSITE MANAGEMENT   The DCC maintains and updates the secured, password protected EDIC website where current versions of EDIC and EDIC Genetics forms, manuals of operations and protocols, and directories can be found.  Meeting materials and minutes, as well as information regarding EDIC and its ancillary studies can also be downloaded from this site.  Recently, the DCC has begun to incorporate interactive web forms that allow the clinical centers and central units to update certain EDIC Genetics Studies data remotely.  Future plans to accommodate evolving data management methods for the DCC includes moving towards a paperless, web-based data entry system where the clinics can conduct the yearly visits with patients and the data would be immediately available to the coordinating center.  

COLLABORATIONS   One important function of the DCC is to facilitate scientific collaborations utilizing this unique cohort.  Extensive knowledge of the DCCT/EDIC database allows the DCC to function as an investigative partner.  Currently, the following institutions are collaborators with DCCT/EDIC Study Group on ongoing research projects: 
 
The Medical University of South Carolina is studying candidate genes for vascular disease complications in the DCCT/EDIC and determining associations of a detailed serum lipoprotein profile with microvascular disease status by performing a cross sectional study of subjects from DCCT/EDIC.  

The University of Washington’s School of Medicine is evaluating specific common polymorphisms in candidate genes related to insulin resistance and central adiposity.  

The University of California, San Francisco is studying the natural history of Urologic complications in adults with Type 1 Diabetes.

The Joslin Diabetes Center and University of Pittsburgh are working jointly with the DCC in evaluating the effects of chronic hyperglycemia and episodic severe hypoglycemia on cognitive function.  

Finally, the University of Toronto is assessing familial aggregation of DNA variation in candidate genes within the cohort and their diabetic and non-diabetic family members in order to assess associations with diabetic complications.

The DCC staff is also making preparations for impending analyses utilizing the extensive DCCT/EDIC data, including:  retinopathy, visual acuity, albumin:creatinine ratio, carotid stenosis, urologic complications, obesity and overweight, cardiovascular and sub-clinical events, quality of life and SCL 90, dietary data, family clustering of diabetes, heart rate, and mortality.


The Data Coordinating Center contract was competitively awarded to The George Washington University on February 8, 1982 through March 7, 1987, and extended non-competitively three times through February 2007.   Data analysis and reporting in DCCT/EDIC is ongoing.  Determination to use other than full and open competition is made in accordance with 41 U.S.C. 253 © (1) as set forth in FAP 6.301-1.

The Government will issue an order as a result of this Request for Quotations to the responsible quoter whose quote, conforming to the solicitation, will be most advantageous to the Government, cost or price and other factors considered. The evaluation factors in order of importance shall be used to evaluate quotes: 1) Contractor’s Capability and Capacity: Provide the number of years this specific entity has been doing this type of work with native grasses. If part of the experience period was doing business under a different business name, identify that business and period separately. If not using Government-furnished stock seed, give a brief history of fields in current production status, including date field planted, source of seed, elevation range of source seed, and whether seed is foundation or first generation. The purpose is for the Government to determine Contractor’s capacity and capability to meet priorities and contract requirements; 2) Past Performance: Provide a listing of your projects for the past three-year (3) period, which most closely relates to this type of work. Include the following information for each contract: a) Type of native grass species, b) Total contract value, c) Completion date, or stage of completion if still in progress, and d) Client’s name, address, telephone.

You may use the separate supplemental document for addressing evaluation factors. The supplemental also includes offeror representations and certifications. The Government may reject any or all quotes, issue orders to other than the lowest quote, and waive minor informalities or irregularities in quotes received. If necessary, the Government may conduct discussion with any or all quoters. ITEM DESCRIPTION - Whereas the policy of the Willamette and Umqua National Forest is to use genetically local native seed from specified elevation ranges on restoration and revegetation projects, the following will be given highest priority for purchase: 1) First Priority- Seed from stock collected on the Willamette or Umqua National Forests from specified elevation bands; 2) Second Priority- Seed from stock collected on lands adjacent to the Willamette or Umpqua National Forests, within the Cascades province. Growout fields shall be located in the state of Oregon, west of the Cascades in the Willamette Valley. Seed must also meet the following requirements: a) Foundation or first generation seed only. This means seed collected from federal lands and directly seeded into fields (foundation) or seed from a field that has been planted with seed from a foundation field (first generation).  This is to ensure no seed becomes genetically fixed for characters found in the valley rather than within the Willamette or Umpqua National Forest or the Cascade Province where the seed will be used; b) Seed shall be from the most recent crop year and shall have been tested within two (2) months of delivery. The Government will provide 10 pounds of stock seed for each lot no earlier than October 1, 2004, upon request by Contractor. The Government will notify the Contractor by task order if additional seed will be required in a given year. Task orders for the following years harvest will be submitted by August 16th. The Contractor shall test each lot. Testing shall occur at Oregon State University or other lab acceptable to the Government. The Contracting Officer must approve any other lab. Seed shall be packaged in bags (heavy duty paper, poly-lined burlap or nylon/plastic with sown bottom and top) and clearly labeled with lot identification, species name, year of harvest, weight, percent purity, percent germination, percent other crop seed, percent inert matter, percent weed seed, test date and tester. Seed shall be prepared for delivery consistent with standard commercial practice. For species such as blue wildrye, this means de-awning all seed. The Contractor shall submit an invoice with transferred seed. Results of seed tests must accompany seed. The Contractor shall have packaged seed ready for pickup by the Government no later than September 30th of each year, as specified in each task order. The Government has the right to purchase excess seed over and above that specified in task orders. The Contractor shall notify the Government when excess seed is available and the Government will respond with additional task order(s) within two (2) weeks if it intends to purchase additional seed. Inspection and Acceptance: Seed shall meet the following standards: a) purity - 94% minimum, b) germination - 90% minimum, c) other crop seed - 1% maximum, d) inert matter - 4% maximum, e) weed seed - 1% maximum, and f) Oregon State listed noxious weed seed - None. The Government reserves the right to reject any lot that is noncompliant with specifications. The Government reserves the right to select seed turned in for original testing and to be present when seed for testing is selected. The Contractor shall contact the Contracting Officer Representative 48 hours prior to seed selection. Selection shall occur during normal business hours, from 8:00 am-4:30 pm Monday-Friday. Payment will be made for no more than 4% inert material. If the percentage of pure live seed is less than 96%, payment for the seed will be for the actual percentage of pure live seed delivered. Payment cannot exceed 100%. For example, if inert material is 12%, this exceeds the specifications by 8%. Thus, the payment would be for 92% of the unit price per pound. If seed standards are not met, the Government retains the right to purchase seed at a reduced price.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541380   The U.S. EPA intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Microbial Insights for an analysis and report of aquifer solids and zero-valent iron core samples collected from a hazardous waste site with ground water contaminated by dissolved arsenic under the authority of FAR Part 6.302-1.  EPA will provide the contractor with approximately 100 core samples for Phospholipid Fatty Acid Analysis (PLFA) and a maximum 40 samples for Dentauring Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (DGGE) and Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (DGGE) Band Analysis in batch sets.  The  contractor shall provide a report separated by batch set, describing the analyses conducted, number of samples analyzed, QA/QC procedures utilized, and any general data analysis.  Analytical results shall be reported on a dry weight basis to maintain consistency with previous analyses conducted.   This acquisition requires a contractor which has proven accomplishments in conducting PLFA, DGGE, and DGGE Band Analysis.  The U.S. EPA believes that Microbial Insights is uniquely qualified to meet this requirement as it has already developed the testing methods and conducted analyses and reports  on previous samples.  Utilizing Microbial Insights for these analyses will ensure consistency in data reporting, analytical procedures, and the need to directly compare data.  THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATION.  However, any firm believing itself capable of providing the required  components may submit technical documentation to establish its assertion.  Such documentation must be submitted to the POC within 15 days of electronic posting of this notice.  A determination not to compete the proposed requirement based upon responses received will normally be considered solely  within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement or to proceed on a sole source basis.

<DESC>The Air Armament Center (AAC), Miniature Munitions Systems Group, submits this pre-solicitation notice in preparation for award of a sole source modification to McDonnell Douglas Corporation, A Wholly Owned Subsidiary of the Boeing Company.  The objective of this modification is to provide a “pathfinder” to explore technology and/or process issues associated with implementing a seeker on the Small Diameter Bomb (SDB).

In order to perform these efforts, a contractor must be very familiar with the SDB weapon system and modes of operation, and must have access to the SDB weapon system technical data package (TDP), including all of its sub-components, and the SDB 6-DOF model.  This is necessary to understand the SDB performance characteristics and weapon system interfaces in order to determine if potential precision guidance technologies can be integrated with the SDB weapon system design.  The Government does not own/possess a TDP for the SDB weapon system nor will the Government provide one to complete this effort. The contractor must be able to complete the effort not later than 31 Dec 2005.  Interested firms who believe they have the capability to perform this effort should respond with details of their qualifications, experience, and how they will gain access to the SDB TDP (in accordance with Numbered Note 26).  Firms responding to this synopsis should state whether or not they are a small business concern or small disadvantage business concern, as defined in FAR 52.219-2.

<DESC>NASA/JSC has a requirement for continuing services currently provided by United Space Alliance (USA) under the Space Flight Operations Contract.  The primary requirements are: -	Mission Design & Planning -	Software Development & Integration -	Astronaut & Flight Controller Training -	System Integration -	Flight Operations -	Vehicle Processing, Launch, & Recovery -	Vehicle Sustaining Engineering -	Flight Crew Equipment Processing The Space Shuttle Program proposes to use a cost-plus-award fee/performance fee contract.  The period of performance will be 4 years plus options to provide coverage through the end of Program life and Program shutdown.  The Space Shuttle Program anticipates retiring the fleet and shutdown of the Program in approximately 2010.  The options provide flexibility to allow the Program to continue to meet its needs, should retirement and shutdown extend beyond the current estimate. NASA/JSC intends to award a contract for these services to USA. The statutory authority for proceeding with this acquisition using Other Than Full and Open Competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1) as contemplated by the provision of FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii).	This provision states that full and open competition need not be provided for when the services required by the agency are available from only the original source in the case of a follow-on contract for the continued provision of highly specialized services.  The provision also states that this exception is applicable when it is likely that award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition, or there would be unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency’s requirements. The original Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition (JOFOC) for the current NAS 9-20000 Space Flight Operations Contract (SFOC), currently held by USA was approved by the NASA Administrator on November 7, 1995.  This JOFOC determined that, pursuant to the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(7), as implemented by Subsection 6.302-7 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation, it was in the public interest to use other than full and open competition for the award of the SFOC contract. The SFOC strategy was developed as a result of a recommendation from a study done by Dr. Christopher Kraft, to improve efficiency and reduce costs for the Space Shuttle Program.  The single prime shuttle operations contract was also planned to reduce the number of civil servants required for day-to-day shuttle operations, thereby further reducing costs. NASA plans to use the Space Shuttle to complete the assembly of the ISS.  The ISS assembly schedule is tightly constrained.  The schedule margin that would be required for a competitive selection and potentially incorporating a new prime contractor into the Program would not support the ISS assembly schedule.   Competition of the Space Shuttle operations requirements could also lead to the loss of knowledgeable personnel and  introduce added risk to the Shuttle program, and, because of the transition time required, could potentially increase the safety risks to the orbiter and crew.  Because of these considerations, including the unacceptable costs and delays that would be incurred to conduct a competition and/or select a different prime contractor, the potential benefits from competition do not justify accepting these substantial risks to the Shuttle and ISS programs. In conclusion, USA is the only firm believed to be capable of fulfilling the proposed requirements. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See Note 26. See note 22.   Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.  See NASA Specific Note "B". Any referenced notes may be viewed at the following URLs linked below.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

APPROXIMATE SOLICITATION ISSUE DATE:  4 June 2004.  The 55th Contracting Squadron will be conducting the solicitation and award of a full and open competition, non-personal services, Cost Plus Award Fee, follow-on contract for a base period and 6 one-year option periods.  This effort is to provide engineering services for maintenance and enhancement of Automated Window Planning Systems (AWPS) and AWPS Analysis Initiative (AAI) software.  The Government anticipates issuing a Request for Proposal (RFP) for performance over a seven-year period.  This period will be the base year FY 05 contract and will include one-year options for the following six fiscal years (FY06 through FY11).  The AWPS tool has been a vital part of the Integrated Strategic Planning and Analysis Network (ISPAN) system for over ten years.  AWPS/AAI is a PC based, windows driven graphical user interface with data management and analysis capabilities used to support nuclear weapons employment plan development.  AWPS/AAI provides plan review and analysis capabilities, mapping, damage calculation, data migration, and plan maintenance.  AWPS/AAI provides tools for production management, operations and quality review, damage calculations, and plan analysis.  Upcoming enhancements and development projects are potentially as follows: continuation of software improvement and maintenance efforts using SQL, PowerBuilder, Fortran; possible conversion all FORTRAN applications to C++.  The ISPAN program is undergoing modernization, based on the Nuclear Posture Review (NPR) and Unified Command Plan (UCP) directions.  AWPS/AAI may require some new development and tools integration efforts.  Currently, the data base management system is Sybase, but efforts are underway to migrate to the Oracle platform.  All software will be maintained and developed in accordance with applicable DOD and AF regulations and standards, and USSTRATCOM Strategic Administrative Instructions and Architectures.  The contractor must maintain a SECRET facility clearance with storage capacity for SECRET documents and equipment.  All contractor personnel shall be a United States citizen and possess a TOP SECRET clearance.  Any contractor personnel required to work on the  ISPAN computer system must have a TOP SECRET clearance with SBI and be SIOP/ESI briefed.

<DESC>The Government intends to award on a sole source to Sensis Corporation, 5793 Widewaters Parkway, DeWitt, NY 13214 for installation of the Multi-Static Dependent Surveillance System and Surveillance Data Server at Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center (MCAGCC), Twentynine Palms, CA. with an approximate value of $ 4.3 M.  Sensis will provide familiarity and knowledge of the MCAGCC infrastructure, which is essential for installation of the Air Position, Location, Information (PLI) system as it will require integration with existing and planned (Government installed) communication infrastructure aboard the Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center (MCAGCC). The system must be COTS, capable of distributed interrogations in order to operate in a rugged topography when direct line of sight between transmitters and receivers is not available. Additionally, system supplier should provide proven past performance and field experience installing and deploying FAA compatible systems to Air Traffic Control facilities. Only one source is responsible and no other supplies or services will satisfy the requirement. 

As part of this Notice to Award, the Marine Corps System Command, Program Manager for Training Systems (PMTRASYS), releases a DRAFT Statement of Work and DRAFT Systems Requirements Document for industry review.  These documents and all future documents are available for download from the PM TRASYS website, Business Opportunities Division at: http://www.marcorsyscom.usmc.mil/trasys/trasysweb.nsf/All/B3C9089505B12F5C85256D98004BC152

This is not a request for quotations or an announcement of a forthcoming solicitation. It should not be construed as a commitment of any kind by the US Government to issue a solicitation.   Any information provided to the Government in response to this RFI will become USMC property and will not be returned.  All proprietary or classified information will be treated appropriately.  If no affirmative written response is received within 15 days after publication of this notice, a sole source contract to Sensis Corporation will be issued.

<DESC>The Naval Network Warfare Command and PEO Ships Smartship Program Office are sponsoring Navy Wireless Networks Summit II to be held in San Diego, California on August 17-19, 2004.    Summit II will build on the success of the first Naval Wireless Networks Summit held at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Lab in December 03.  This summit established the framework for identifying: (1)	technical issues associated with Naval wireless networks,  (2)	applications and opportunities for test and evaluation, (3)	the need for developing a Community of Interest (COI) focused on advancing wireless technologies within the entire Naval enterprise for continuing efforts   This announcement is the official request for participation by vendors who provide wireless network or related products that may be of interest to the Naval community.  The open period for this announcement is  from July 19, 2004 through July 30, 2004. As part of this effort, an Industry Day will be held on Wednesday, August 18th from 8:30 AM until 5:00 PM. The purpose of the Industry Day is to provide a forum for vendors with wireless products to demonstrate or discuss their products with key Navy and DoD decision makers. There will also be presentations and panel discussions in three tracks devoted to subjects relevant to wireless technologies in a Naval context.  For the purpose of this announcement, participation entails supporting a booth or table display of current and/or planned relevant products. Approximately forty vendor displays can be accommodated. Exhibitor slots have been reserved according to different categories of products as described below. When requesting to participate, vendors MUST indicate the category for which they are applying. Vendors may indicate a se cond and third category option if products are suitable for those categories, but secondary or tertiary preferences will only be considered if all slots are not filled by the end of the announcement period. Categories and slots available are as follows: ¨	Wireless Network Infrastructure. Access Points, client cards & drivers. Primarily for products with an RF component. Not for wireless switches with no RF element. – 10 slots ¨	Security Products. Security software, wireless security switches, wireless intrusion detection/prevention software/systems. – 10 slots ¨	Wireless Peripherals.  Antennas, client devices, etc. – 10 slots ¨	Wireless Wide Area Network Products.  Cellular data services/products, satellite data services/products, etc. – 5 slots ¨	Wireless Applications.  Design tools, installation tools, other products or services not covered by other categories. – 5 slo ts There is a particular interest not just in current technology but also in next generation technology that may be available in the near future. Vendors are encouraged to provide information or exhibits of upcoming or planned products. Vendors with products that meet stringent DoD and Navy requirements are particularly encouraged to participate. Applicants who meet the criteria for a category will be considered on a first come, first served basis. Once the announcement period is over, any slots remaining will be assigned based on the secondary and tertiary categories, or as space is available. Any costs for participation are the responsibility of the vendor. Vendors are required to contact the conference center for equipment or services. However, vendors may not initiate the process for configuring a space at the event until their participation has been confirmed by o ne of the designated government contacts. Information on whom to contact to make arrangements for your display will be provided with confirmation of your attendance. Vendors interested in participating should submit a request with descriptions of the products/services to be displayed, how they can fulfill DoD/Navy requirements or needs and the primary category under which they wish to be considered. As above, a second and third category may be indicated, if appropriate. Requests to participate with the above information should be emailed to: Kathryn Zepeda (primary) zepedake@nswccd.navy.mil 301-227-0127 Lance Flitter (secondary) flitterla@nswccd.navy.mil 301-227-3161

<SUBJECT>F--California Golden Trout Genetic Monitoring
<DESC>The USFWS is planning on awarding a contract to UC Davis for the California Golden Trout Genetic Monitoring.The proposed study would use the most current molecular genetic techniques to analyze hybridization levels at specific localities for multiple year samples and determine whether admixture proportions are increasing, decreasing, or stable over time.  Using the latest proven techniques (i.e. microsatellite and recently developed Single Nucleotide Polymorphism markers), we will evaluate changes in admixture proportions and genotypes over time.  Localities from areas within the South Fork Kern and Golden Trout Creek drainages will be used to determine whether trends are consistent among the two major drainages in the native range.   Samples for the proposed project are stored in the Genomic Variation Laboratory tissue archive, with additional samples being collected during the summer 2004 field season by California Department of Fish and Game. EXPECTED RESULTS OR BENEFITS: Results of the proposed research will assist the US Fish and Wildlife Service in developing a Genetics Management Plan for California golden trout and will help target actions necessary for the conservation and recovery of the species so as to avoid its listing.  Benefits to the public include economic, recreational, and other non-tangible gains associated with the persistence of California's state freshwater fish within its native habitat. Not to Exceed Amount is $35,000. For questions on this, please contact Kristin Young at 503-872-2827.

<SUBJECT>A -- LAWRENCE LIVERMORE NATIONAL LABORATORY SEEKS PARTNERSHIPS WITH INDUSTRY TO DEVELOP AND COMMERCIALIZE A SIX DEGREES OF FREEDOM SENSOR
<DESC>LAWRENCE LIVERMORE NATIONAL LABORATORY SEEKS PARTNERSHIPS WITH INDUSTRY TO FURTHER DEVELOP AND COMMERCIALIZE THE
SIX-DEGREE-OF-FREEDOM (SixDOF) SENSOR


Announcement:  Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by the University of California under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), is seeking one or more industrial partners to commercialize LLNL's Six-Degree-of-Freedom (SixDOF) sensor.  

LLNL has developed and patented the Six-Degree-of-Freedom (SixDOF) sensor.  It is a small, relatively low cost, non-contact sensor that increases the capability and flexibility of computer-controlled machines.  It does this by detecting the sensor’s relative position to any mechanical part in all six-degrees-of-freedom by using a laser in combination with simple optics and position sensitive detectors (PSD’s).  

It has the potential to significantly improve data collection speed and accuracy compared to prior art.  It is estimated to be about 200 times faster and 25 times more accurate than current three-degree-of-freedom sensors.  It can be produced using loose manufacturing tolerances and inexpensive materials, is easily calibrated, and is micro-scale accurate.  Potential applications include: manufacturing automation; aviation quality control; computing; robotic surgery; hazardous materials handling.

Additional technical information can be obtained on the Industrial Partnerships and Commercialization Website at http://www.llnl.gov/IPandC/technology/profile/6dof/index.php

LLNL is seeking partners and licensees with a demonstrated ability to bring such inventions to the market. Moving critical technology beyond the Laboratory to the commercial world helps our U.S. licensees gain a competitive edge in the marketplace. The University of California’s Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory can license technology through exclusive or nonexclusive licensing agreements, as appropriate. All projects are conducted under policies relating to the strict nondisclosure of company proprietary information.

Note:  THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.  Companies interested in commercializing LLNL's Six-Degree-of-Freedome (SixDOF) sensor should provide a written statement of interest, which includes the following:

1.	Company Name and address
2.	The name, address, and telephone number of a point of contact
3.	A description of corporate expertise and facilities relevant to commercializing this technology

 
Written responses should be directed to:

	Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory
	Industrial Partnerships and Commercialization
	P.O. Box 808, L-795
	Livermore, CA  94551-0808
	Attention:  FBO 79-04.

Please provide your written statement within thirty (30) days from the date this announcement is published to ensure consideration of your interest in LLNL's Six-Degree-of-Freedom (SixDOF) sensor.

<DESC>SOLICITATION NO: GSWR040121 - REQUEST FOR QUOTATION DATE: 19 July 2004 CLOSING DATE: 30 July 2004 This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This acquisition is set aside for small business concerns.  The associated NAICS code is 238990 - All Other Specialty Trade Contractors.   The U.S. Geological Survey, Western Coastal Marine Geology Team, has identified a requirement to study the occurrence of natural offshore oil seeps in the Point Conception (Santa Barbara County, CA) area.  The goal of this study is to sample with a Remote Operated Vehicle (ROV) and document submerged oil or tar seeps and then chemically analyze the samples and subsequently relate the seeps to onshore tarball populations.  Interested concerns are invited to submit quotations for the following: SCOPE OF WORK: The contractor shall organize and execute the following operation: 1.	The contractor shall negotiate and hire a vessel and ROV, and other necessary equipment and personnel to ensure the success of the operation. 2.	The contractor shall be prepared to spend three 24-hour days on at least 6 stations but no more than 20.  If a 12-hour day boat is used we anticipate that the mission length will extend to 6 days and that the vessel can find safe anchorage near the work site.  At sites are within 10 nautical miles of the coastline.   Our goal is to acquire 10 discrete oil or tar samples from distinct seep sites.  We shall need berths for at least 4 persons, and at most 6.  3.	The contractor shall use the ROV in water depths of about 70 to 300 feet below sea level.  The ROV will have the ability to record seep locations and emission on video, and sample either liquid or solid (tar) hydrocarbons.  USGS personnel will have the primary responsibility for sampling the hydrocarbons once the ROV is recovered and for the conveyance of samples to the USGS labs.  Obtaining hydrocarbon samples from the seeps is the highest priority of this work. 4.	The contractor shall provide a report to the USGS in both paper and digital format.  The report shall include a GIS coverage of seep sites, ROV and ship tracklines with a digital navigation file.   5.	The contractor shall also deliver to the USGS copies of any other documentation, such as video, photographs, navigation logs, field notes, etc. generated as a result of these operations. Offerors are also invited to propose a plan for addressing any weather related contingencies that may arise.   PLACE OF PERFORMANCE:  This operation will take place in the Point Conception (Santa Barbara County, CA) area.  Interested concerns must be able to launch an operation in this area without incurring undue travel or mobilization costs.  METHOD OF EVALUATION Prospective contractors are advised that quotations will be evaluated based upon the following, not necessarily listed in order of importance: 1)	Technical Merit - Offerors must demonstrate a clear understanding of technical requirements and specifications.  Such factors as: experience, record of past performance, quality and availability of equipment and personnel, location, familiarity with local waters, contingency plans, etc. will be considered. 2)	Total Price.

<DESC>This announcement constitutes a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) in accordance with FAR 6.102(d)(2).  No request for proposal (RFP), solicitation, or other announcements will be made.  Offerors shall respond to this BAA by submitting a proposal electronically to the Contracting Officer, joverton@rdc.uscg.mil, by August 18, 2004 at 3:00 p.m EDT.  ELIGIBILITY INFORMATION:  All potential applicants are eligible.  APPLICATION AND SUBMISSION INFORMATION: This announcement constitutes the only solicitation.  THE BAA SUBJECT AREA is as follows:
BACKGROUND:  During offshore patrols, a Coast Guard (CG) helicopter or fixed wing aircraft sometimes detects a suspicious 25-40 foot wood or fiberglass vessel (outboard powered), often at night running with no lights.  Though the vessel is suspected of illegal activity, the aircraft cannot deploy a boarding party, and is typically fuel limited, so it may be unable to stay on scene until a Coast Guard surface vessel intercepts.  We desire to "mark" the suspect boat from the aircraft from a standoff distance of 100’ to 200’ in a way that enhances later relocation by a surface ship and/or another aircraft.  (Typically, the relocation takes place within a few hours after the initial contact.)   Marker delivery is undefined – possible methods include paintball, water balloon, water cannon, and spray equipment.  The markers themselves, and any binder used, shall be non-toxic, eye-safe, non-mutagenic and environmentally benign.  Ideally they should also be hard to see by the naked eye, and resistant to being washed off or otherwise removed.  The markers shall be capable of being detected by one of the following sensor types that are presently deployed aboard CG ships and aircraft, (but alternate sensor proposals will be considered).  Present CG sensors include gen III night vision goggles (near infrared, wavelengths approximately .75 to .90 microns), forward looking infrared cameras (mid-IR, wavelengths approximately 3-5 microns) and marine x-band radar.  The proposed markers’ signature shall be as strong as possible to increase present detection ranges significantly.  The Coast Guard has already conducted a technology survey, and concluded that promising marker types include retroflective particles and luminescent particles  (e.g. dyes, rare-earth materials, quantum dots, and chemical luminescents).  Marker concepts that are illuminated by a suitably tuned eye-safe non-visible laser mounted on the search vessel or aircraft appear promising. (No radar reflectors or active radio frequency tags were identified that satisfied the requirements of being covertly deliverable and resistant to removal, but such technologies are still open to consideration.)  The purpose of this BAA is specifically to obtain proof-of-concept samples of potential marker types.  The marker material shall be applied to a coupon of 4”x 4” rigid unpainted aluminum, and provided to the Coast Guard R&D Center for comparative detection range testing.  A Material Safety Data Sheet shall be provided with the sample.  PLEASE CONTACT JOYCE P. OVERTON AT JOVERTON@RDC.USCG.MIL FOR PROPOSAL PREPARATION INSTRUCTIONS.  APPLICATION REVIEW INFORMATION:  Criteria:  Evaluation of Proposals will be performed using the following criteria:  (1) Technical Merit:  a.) Provide the firm delivery date for the marker sample.  b.) Identify the marker material, and discuss its potential toxicity.  If toxic, the offeror shall present a plan for encapsulating the marker particles to mitigate these effects.  c.) Any available information on visual appearance of the marker, illumination requirements (if any), and emission characteristics (wavelength, spectrum, quantum efficiency, durability) shall be included.  d.) Include any available information on detection range, signal processing requirements or special sensors needed for detection.  e.) Discuss any previous studies, demonstrations or applications of marking technology.  f.) Also, provide an estimate of material costs per square foot of marked area if the proposed marker material were purchased in quantity (1000 square feet coverage). (2) Price:  Provide a detailed breakdown of all labor, material and overhead costs associated with preparation of the sample, including profit.   Include an estimated cost of any specialized sensors or signal processing needed for marker detection.  Criterion (1) is more important.  Criterion (2) will become increasingly important if scores under Criterion (1) are comparable.  Individual Proposals will be evaluated against the evaluation criteria without regard to other Proposals submitted under this BAA.  No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting Proposals.  AWARD INFORMATION:  Total funding for this BAA is approximately $50K.  Individual awards will not normally exceed a three-month performance period or dollar amounts of $5K to $10 K.  Awards as a result of this announcement will be in the form of fixed-price purchase orders. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION:  Award Notices:  The Government will notify offerors when a submittal has been accepted or rejected.  Rejections will normally be because the proposed solution did not fit the needs of the Government, that it was too costly, or that it failed to meet the minimum requirements as specified in the BACKGROUND section of this BAA.  The cost of preparing Proposals in response to this announcement is not considered an allowable direct charge to any resulting contract or any other contract, but may be an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect cost specified in FAR 3.1205-18.  Any contractor who is awarded a contract as a result of this BAA must first be registered in the Central Contractor Registration Database (CCR).   The website for the CCR database is http://www.ccr.gov.  AGENCY CONTACTS:  Questions prior to the submission of Proposals can be addressed to the Contracting Officer joverton@rdc.uscg.mil or (860) 441-2886.  Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.

OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date ( if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 

(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 

(i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or 

(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 

(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 

(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 

(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships.

(iii) contracts to acquire stock; 
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and 
(v) others similar interests. 
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. 

(f) Disclosure. 
By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107- 296 of November 25, 2002.

<DESC>This amendment provides answers to the following questions:

(1)  The Government has accepted FAA field approval in the past for the NVG compatibility.  The required STC approval will add significant cost to the NVG compatibility.  Will the Government accept FAA field approval via FAA Field Approval Form 337 for the NVG compatibility?

Answer - Yes, provided the FAA Field Approval Form 337 is included/provided with the purchased aircraft.

(2)  In the past the Government has used a VHF frequency range of
146-174MHz on the Grand Caravans in Bogotá.  Is this an acceptable frequency range?  The Cessna Grand Caravan already comes with dual NAVCOM VHF transmitters/receivers in the frequency range 118.00-136.975MHz (Silver Crown).

Answer - 146-174MHz is not acceptable, but the Silver Crown is.
Deadline for proposals is 4 pm 7/21/04.
