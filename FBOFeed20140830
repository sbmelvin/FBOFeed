<DESC><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">INTRODUCTION</span></strong><br />This is a pre-solicitation non-competitive (notice of intent) synopsis to award a contract without providing for full or open competition (including brand-name). THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.
<p>The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), Consolidated Station Support and Simplified Acquisitions (CSS/SA) Branch intends to negotiate and award a purchase order to WP Company LLC  for Ketamine studies advertisements without providing for full and open competition (including brand-name).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">NORTH AMERICAN INDUSTRY CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM (NAICS) CODE</span></strong><br />The intended procurement is classified under NAICS code 511110 with a Size Standard of 500 Employees.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">REGULATORY AUTHORITY </span></strong><br />The resultant contract will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 05-72 dated January 30,2014.</p>
<p>This acquisition is for a commercial item or service and is conducted under the procedures as prescribed in FAR subpart 13-Simplified Acquisition Procedures; FAR Subpart 13.5-Test Program for Certain Commercial Items; and FAR Part 12-Acquisition of Commercial Items. This acquisition is not expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">STATUTORY AUTHORITY </span></strong><br />This acquisition is conducted under the authority of the authority of FAR Subpart 13.106-1.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENT </span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Background Information</strong><br />The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) Section on Neurobiology &amp; Treatment of Mood Disorders needs to reach a broad audience for protocols # 04-M-0222 as they are seeking to target individuals between the ages of 18-65.   In order to reach this broad audience NIMH is using outdoor media.  NIMH ran this same plan for several other depression studies and received significant call results and persons enrolling into multiple depression research studies including this protocol, so this kind of media buy has been successful for patient recruitment.</p>
<p><strong>Purpose and Objectives</strong><br />NIMH needs to increase enrollment for research studies for individuals with depression and bipolar disorder between the ages of 18 and 65.  Publicizing these studies through the Washington Post/Express newspapers will help reach the targeted audience as well as a broad spectrum of the public.</p>
<p><strong>Period of Performance</strong><br />The period of performance shall be from September 22, 2014 through March 30, 2015. A firm fixed price purchase order is contemplated.<br /> <br /><strong>Project Description</strong><br />Ads titled, "Improve Bipolar Depressive Symptoms Faster," and "Improve Depressive Symptoms Faster" for the Ketamine study will be run in the Washington Post Express for the duration of the period of performance.</p>
<p>The ads will include both of the images provided to the Contractor to be placed and printed within the first three (3) pages of the daily circulation for the duration of the period of performance.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">CONTRACTING WITHOUT PROVIDING FOR FULL OR OPEN COMPETITION (INCLUDING BRAND-NAME) DETERMINATION<br /></span></strong>The determination by the Government to award a contract without providing for full and open competition is based upon the market research conducted. Specifically, only WP Company LLC is capable of meeting the needs of this requirement due to the access that the Washington Post Express provides to reaching a broad spectrum of individuals provides NIMH with the opportunity to obtain a greater number of individuals that are eligible to become participants in the depression and bipolar disorder studies.  The cost associated with the preferred location of the advertisements in the Washington Post Express of the first three (3) pages, will allow for the advertisements to be circulated for an extended period of time that is greater than if the ads were posted in other circulars.</p>
<p>The intended source is:</p>
<p>WP Company LLC<br />1150 15th St NW<br />Washington, D.C. 20071-0001</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">CLOSING STATEMENT</span></strong><br />THIS SYNOPSIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.  However, interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to this notice.  Responses to this notice shall contain sufficient information to establish the interested parties' bona-fide capabilities for fulfilling the requirement and include: unit price, list price, shipping and handling costs, the delivery period after contract award, the prompt payment discount terms, the F.O.B. Point (Destination or Origin), the Dun &amp; Bradstreet Number (DUNS), the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN), and the certification of business size. All offerors must have an active registration in the System for Award Management (SAM) www.sam.gov."</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  The information received will normally be considered solely for the purposes of determining whether to proceed on a non-competitive basis or to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>All responses must be received by the closing date and time of this announcement and must reference the solicitation number.  Responses may be submitted electronically to Megan Ault, Contract Specialist, at megan.ault@nih.gov. US Mail and Fax responses will not be accepted.</p>

<SUBJECT>Independent Authoritative Assessment of Hospital Care and Medical Services
<SOLNBR>14-PSC-NAS119A
<CONTACT>Michele Namoski, Phone 301-443-3337, Email SHELLEY.NAMOSKI@PSC.HHS.GOV
<DESC>Title: Independent Authoritative Assessment of Hospital Care and Medical Services<br /><br />Pursuant to the authority of FAR 6.302-1 The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), Program Support Center (PSC), Acquisition Management Services, on behalf of the Veterans Health Administration (VHA), Department of Veteran Affairs (VA), intends to negotiate on a sole source basis, a cost reimbursement order under the PSC Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) with the National Academy of Sciences, for an "Independent, Authoritative Assessment of Hospital Care and Medical Services"<br /><br />The &lsquo;&lsquo;Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act of 2014'', was enacted by Congress on August 7, 2014. This Act requires the conduct of an independent assessment of hospital care and medical services, and other health care furnished in medical facilities of the Department. This assessment also includes an identification of appropriate access standards for each individual specialty (i.e. neurology, post-care rehabilitation, etc.). Title II Healthcare Administration Section 201 (a) Independent Assessment, requires within 90 days of the enactment of the Act, the VA would enter into contracts to conduct various assessments. Additionally the Act, "requires establishing the appropriate system-wide access standard applicable to hospital care, medical services and other health care furnished by and through the Department, including identification of access standards for each individual specialty and post-care rehabilitation.", which this acquisition is established to do.<br /><br />The PSC BOA with the National Academy of Sciences is a vehicle that will ensure the VA meets the Act's contract implementation deadlines.<br />&nbsp;<br />Recent investigations and whistle blowing reports have identified wait times for appointments within the VA health care system to be too long, were poorly handled and were erroneously reported. This significantly tarnished the VA's reputation with Veterans, Congress and the American public. VA requires an independent, authoritative source to assess industry wait times, discuss those times and establish standards.<br /><br />In order to regain the credibility of Veterans, Congress and the American Public, it is necessary to have an authoritative, independent, non-profit organization to assess industry standards, convene a formal consensus study team, and establish standards for VHA. The Institute of Medicine is one such an organization who earned the respect and credibility of Congress. <br /><br />VHA has identified the National Academy of Sciences Institute of Medicine as the only source that can provide an independent, unbiased authoritative assessment and recommendation. The IOM is a non-profit having no financial ties to sway its judgment. The Institute of Medicine (IOM) is capable of convening a consensus panel which would provide a totally independent unbiased formal consensus study in an open expert forum to discuss and assess the problem at all angels and convene a consortium to discuss the issues and establish a standard. <br /><br />NAS has the unique ability to rapidly assemble the Nation's most eminent scholars and other experts, who are appointed by the President of the Academy to provide their expertise without compensation on committees and boards, which render advice and guidance of the highest quality and unparalleled objectivity to address national issues of high priority. Accordingly, NAS stands alone in its capacity to provide the highest level of expertise, independence, objectivity and audience acceptance necessary to meet the VA's program requirements. <br /><br />The Institutes of Medicine (IOM) have extensive experience convening expert committees from a variety of fields to provide objective, credible, and scientific recommendations addressing the areas of this proposed study. The IOM's selection of experts draws on nationally known experts in the field, with specific consideration of the overall balance of viewpoints on the committee. Studies are undertaken by distinguished individuals selected for their extensive expertise and experience in the topics under study. The IOM can secure the participation of experts whom it invites to serve. The National Academies work is made possible by 6,000 of the world's top scientists, engineers, and other professionals who volunteer their time without compensation to serve on committees and participate in activities.<br /><br />The purpose of this acquisition is to contract with an independent authoritative source in the area of medicine and hospital administration to assess and recommend an objective and attainable clinically relevant "wait-time" standard for the VHA which considers patient acuity, clinician decision-making, and patient preference.<br /><br />Scheduling and wait times for healthcare appointments is very complex and a standard in either public or private healthcare facilities does not exist. VHA has been challenged in the past because of excessive wait times. In order for a standard for VHA to be established, experts in the field are needed to examine literature addressing scheduling and wait times, identify best practice industry, convene a formal consensus team of experts to discuss and hold a public workshop to gather information across the healthcare industry.<br /><br />In accordance with&nbsp;the &lsquo;&lsquo;Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act of 2014'',the contractor shall conduct of an independent assessment of hospital care and medical services, and other health care furnished in medical facilities of the Department. This assessment also includes an identification of appropriate access standards for each individual specialty (i.e. neurology, post-care rehabilitation, etc.). The contractor shall assess and recommend an objective and attainable clinically relevant "wait-time" standard for the VHA. The standard shall consider patient acuity, clinician decision-making, and patient preference. The contractor shall provide a work plan, inclusive of a Project Master Schedule, preferably in Microsoft Project digital file (mmp) format. The work plan shall define the tasks leading up to the achieving the outcome of this task. The work plan shall address risks, and performance measures. The contractor shall conduct review of all pertinent literature related to medical center appointment wait times and scheduling. The contractor shall synopsize and present findings and recommendations to the government. The contractor shall identify and review industry best practices related to medical appointment wait times. The contractor shall provide a synopsis of its findings and recommendations. The contractor shall develop a discussion paper elaborating on the complexities and challenges of not having a framework for appointment scheduling and wait times. The contractor shall organize and convene a formal consensus study team. The study team shall consist of experts in the field and use their collective wisdom in conducting the following studies: <br />&bull; Review VA wait time proposals coming from the Leading Access and Scheduling Initiative (LASI) (CONTEXT or constraints for VA issues)<br />&bull; Review mandates/guidance coming from recent legislation (Sanders-Miller Bill)<br />The contractor shall synopsize their findings in a report to VHA. The contractor's consensus study team shall organize and convene a public workshop regarding the scheduling and wait time issue. The workshop will also serve as a listening session for the VA Secretary and House Veterans Affairs Committee (HVAC). The contractor shall invite the healthcare community to include industry and academics. The contractor shall recommend attendees and attend to the logistics of the meeting. The contractor shall record and distribute meeting minutes. The contractor shall develop a final report to include findings and recommendations regarding scheduling and wait times. The contractor shall take into consideration patient acuity, clinician decision-making, and patient preference, as well as other factors the contractor deems relevant. The report shall also take into consideration the ability to compare VA performance on scheduling and wait times with private sector practices and performance. <br /><br />A cost reimbursement order will be negotiated and awarded under the PSC Basic Ordering Agreement with the National Academy of Sciences. The anticipated period of performance shall be for seven (7) months from date of award. <br /><br />This is not a solicitation for competitive proposals, as the Act does not allow time for a competitive procurement.&nbsp; A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement is based upon the referenced legislation that requires contracts to be established within 90 days from the effective date of the Act which was August 7, 2014.<br /><br />Questions regarding this notice may be emailed to <a href="mailto:shelley.namoski@psc.hhs.gov">shelley.namoski@psc.hhs.gov</a>&nbsp; through September 4, 2014.&nbsp; Please reference 14-PSC-NAS119A

<DESC>The Jamaica Plain VAMC, located at 150 South Huntington Avenue has a requirement for a procurement of a Xltek/Natus Neurology equipment for Electromylagram (EMG) nerve condition for the nerve conduction studies of Veteran Patients with possible neuromuscular illness /injuries. This equipment allows for improved EMG support for Boston VAHS, as well as consults from within VISN 1. The VA Boston Healthcare System currently has demand to offer patient centered care for patients from facilities and clinics within VISN 1. We have 2 technicians and are working toward being a center of excellence. Natus Neurology is currently the only vendor which manufactures and sells the Xltek/Natus equipment. There other vendors which manufacture EMG equipment but cannot be used because of existing Neurology hardware that cannot be upgraded through this procurement. For example, current Xltek servers will not be replaced and these items contain past studies which can only be compared to current studies using Xltek software. This comparison is imperative for clinical long-term follow up studies for patients who are seen on a regular basis. In addition to servers, certain Xltek hardware items will not be upgraded through and these items are only able to interface through Xltek/Natus devices. 

This Notice of Intent is NOT a request for competitive proposals. Parties may identify their interest, accompanied by supporting literature, to the Contracting Officer no later than 2:00pm EST on 9/4/2014. Responses should be sent to James.Corbett2@va.gov. Information received will be for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct a competitive procurement. The determination to conduct a competitive procurement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer.

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only notice; Proposals are being requested and a written solicitation is issued. This solicitation is issued as a Request for Proposals (RFP).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through the Federal Acquisition Regulation.  The North American Industry classification (NAICS) code is 541199.
This acquisition is being solicited in accordance with FAR Part 15. The solicitation is full and open competition. The Period of Performance (POP) shall be proposed. See the SOW for complete performance requirement details. The resultant contract may be awarded as a hybrid type contract with elements of a firm fixed-price contract as defined in FAR 16.2 and FAR 16.6. The Government intends to make a single contract award. Due to the urgent need, the response period and proposal due date is shortened. See the complete solicitation for details.
BACKGROUND 
The mission of the Division of Tribal Justice Support (TJS), a division within the Office of Justice Services (OJS) of the Department of the Interior (DOI) is to further the development, operation, and enhancement of tribal justice systems and Courts of Indian Offenses.  Congress and the Federal courts have repeatedly recognized that tribal justice systems are the appropriate forum for adjudicating tribal civil disputes and addressing most of the criminal activity within Indian country.  TJS is statutorily tasked to provide training and technical assistance to tribal courts pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3602 et seq.  
In July 2010, the United States Congress passed the Tribal Law and Order Act (TLOA).  The TLOA amended several statutes, one of which is the Indian Civil Rights Act 25 U.S.C. 1301-1303- by expanding under certain circumstances- the sentencing capabilities of tribal courts.  Among other things, the Tribal Law and Order Act of 2010 amends the Indian Civil Rights Act of 1968 to increase tribal court sentencing authority from one year incarceration to up to either three to nine years incarceration in a tribal detention facility.  
On March 7, 2013, the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2013 (VAWA) was signed by President Obama.  VAWA provides that in 2015, tribes may take special domestic violence criminal jurisdiction over certain defendants, regardless of their Indian or non-Indian status, if those defendants are alleged to have committed acts of domestic violence or dating violence or violate certain protection orders in Indian Country.  
In order for tribes to exercise these new aspects of their sovereignty by increasing the tribal court jurisdiction as well as the increasing incarceration time under TLOA and VAWA, tribal courts must satisfy certain basic fundamental due process rights of defendants. In many instances, tribes and tribal courts have suffered from inadequate funding, and thus trained and qualified law trained attorneys and judges often are not a central part of the tribal judicial systems.  Without specifically tailored training and technical assistance that is geared to the implementation of expanded sentencing authority under TLOA and VAWA many tribes may never be able to exercise this aspect of their sovereignty.  Generally speaking, all tribes need qualified law trained public defenders to meet the new requirements under the TLOA and VAWA.   Without qualified law trained tribal public defenders, tribal courts might very well lack the basic fundamental due process protections as contemplated by the TLOA and VAWA.  And thus tribes, will not be able to exercise the increased sentencing authority without qualified public defenders.
In May, 2012, the United States Government Accountability Office issued a finding on the awareness of eligible finding for funds directly related to Indigent Defense issues in all courts.  While it was not a substantial part of the GAO finding, the GAO recognized that the BIA funded or could fund tribal court defenders through the 638 funding process.  The GAO report suggested that the BIA find ways to alert tribal governments and tribal courts that PL 638 funding could be used to support a tribal public defender, if the tribe so chose.  To that end, and to support the efforts of the BIA to alert tribes that funding could be used for the purpose of the defender, TJS was previously assisted by law school tribal public defender clinics devoted to tribal public defenders, whether law trained or lay advocates, would be an effective way to further the mission of the office.  Moreover, these defender clinics alerted tribes on the opportunity to train potential tribal court personnel and CFR court personnel as well as tribal public defenders who practice in tribal court. 

OBJECTIVE
The objective of the Contractor is to assist TJS in meeting its statutorily required training objectives as well as the objectives to provide personnel for the Court of Indian Offenses, through the skilled training of an accredited clinical program.  See 25 U.S.C. 3611.  The development or enhancement of a law clinic specifically dedicated to providing special training for indigent defense in tribal courts is essential to TJS meeting its statutory requirement by providing assistance to tribes that wish to implement the enhancement provision of the TLOA.

The Materials Science and Engineering Division (MSED) of NIST strives to provide high precision measurements and high purity standard materials to facilitate new materials research and development by US industry. The Nanotube Metrology project within the MSED focuses on a specific type of material: single-wall carbon nanotubes. An objective of the project is to purify each and every single nanotube species from a synthetic mixture, with highest resolution and purity. Studies conducted by NIST scientists have shown that the polymer aqueous two-phase method carried out by the countercurrent chromatography is capable of achieving highest resolution and purity in an automated fashion. Acquiring such a capability is expected to increase the output as well as speed (by &gt; 10-fold) of the Division's carbon nanotube processing capabilities. The required instrument will be used as a fundamental tool within the Nanotube Metrology project for routine chirality fractionation of carbon nanotube dispersions.<br /><br /><strong>This is a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Brand Name or Equal Requirement.</span></strong> Brand name or equal description is intended to be descriptive, but not restrictive. It is to indicate the quality and salient characteristics of products that are considered satisfactory to meet the agency's requirement.<br /><br />Reference Combined Synopsis/Solicitation attached.

<p>Qualifications. (In accordance with the Statement of Work) <br />Price</p>
<p>Options will be evaluated in accordance with 52.217-5 Evaluation of Options.</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR 13.004 -- Legal Effect of Quotations the following information is provided in regards to quotations.</p>
<p>A quotation is not an offer and, consequently, cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Therefore, issuance by the Government of an order in response to a supplier's quotation does not establish a contract. The order is an offer by the Government to the supplier to buy certain supplies or services upon specified terms and conditions. A contract is established when the supplier accepts the offer.</p>
<p>When appropriate, the contracting officer may ask the supplier to indicate acceptance of an order by notification to the Government, preferably in writing. In other circumstances, the supplier may indicate acceptance by furnishing the supplies or services ordered or by proceeding with the work to the point where substantial performance has occurred.</p>
<p>If the Government issues an order resulting from a quotation, the Government may (by written notice to the supplier, at any time before acceptance occurs) withdraw, amend, or cancel its offer.</p>

Refer to new Standard Form 30 (SF-30, Amendment form), and two new attachments: Attachment no. 6 (REVISED Terms and Conditions) and Attachment no. 7 (Questions & Answers). The response date is changed from 5pm (PST) on 9/2/14 to3pm (PST) on 9/3/14.
As originally posted, Offerors and all interested parties are hereby notified that the solicitation documents, including the above mentioned amendment documents, are publicly posted for the above referenced project for Olympic Naitonal Park, WA. 
The solicitation form (SF-1442), Amendment form (ASF-30), and all associated attachments can be retrieved via the link below, from FedConnect (http://www.fedconnect.net). 
Accessing the solicitation and attachments does not require registration in FedConnect. Once at the FedConnect home page, click on "Search Public Opportunities Only."  Next screen, select "Reference Number" from drop-down menu and type in solicitation number, and click "search." Next screen should show the solicitation title as "(OLYM) Remove and Replace Docks and Pilings, Olympic National Park, WA." Click the title to open the overview page, where this announcement and upcoming solicitation and attachments will be posted. It is the responsibility of the offerors to monitor the FBO and FedConnect websites to download all amendments and attachments which may also be issued against the solicitation prior to the solicitation's closing date. 
An organized site visit will not be scheduled. Offerors are welcome to make a site visit on their own. Offerors are encouraged to inspect the site, and to satisfy themselves regarding the conditions that may affect the cost of the products and performance. In no event shall failure to inspect the site constitute grounds for a claim after contract award. The project location is at the Log Cabin Resort, 3183 East Beach Road, Port Angeles, WA 98363. Although the physical address says Port Angeles, WA, the resort is approximately 20 miles west of Port Angeles (turn off of Highway 101 onto East Beach Road) on the north shore of Lake Crescent. The resort is open to the public during the summer season, from Memorial Day through Labor Day. 
This project is being solicited and awarded as a total (100%) Small Business set-aside in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 19.5. The NAICS code for this solicitation is 237990 with an associated small business size standard of $36.5 million. 
The magnitude of construction for this project is between $100,000 and $250,000. Offerors are reminded that when the Government anticipates making an award within the Simplified Acquisition Threshold (SAT), that it solicits quotations via RFQ. 
A single firm-fixed price construction contract will be awarded as a result of the solicitation.

<DESC>This requirement was solicited and awarded on a sole source basis to Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) of Woods Hole, MA in accordance with FAR 6.302-1 and 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) - Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements.&nbsp; Please refer to the attached Justification &amp; Approval Document for further details.<br /><br />This ID/IQ contract contains Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) and Cost Only provisions (for other direct costs) due to the nature of the work required.&nbsp; This is a research and development effort for engineering, technical, and operational services in support of D-ACOMMS, underwater communications systems, REMUS UUV, and Ocean Engineering technologies required for integration into the PLUS, EOD- Fast Track, REMUS Auto L&amp;R, and other Navy programs.&nbsp; These services involve a high degree of uncertainty and complexity which cannot be specified, requires trial and error, or will be the first time being conducted or attempted.&nbsp; This effort also involves support of at-sea operations which are highly dependent on environmental and vessel conditions which cannot be reliably predicted.&nbsp; Due to the nature of the work being performed, a CPFF contract is necessary as other pricing arrangements impose too great a risk for a contractor with respect to technical, schedule, and cost components.<br /><br />
