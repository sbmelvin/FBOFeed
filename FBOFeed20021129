The OSDS system consists of a variety of interfaced subsystems that provide flight data processing, situation display, flight data input and output, and air-to-ground and ground-to-ground data link for oceanic air traffic control at the New York Air Route Traffic Control Center (ZNY), and the Oakland Air Route Traffic Control Center (ZOA).  Life cycle hardware and software maintenance for OSDS is provided from the oceanic laboratory located at the William J. Hughes Technical Center (WJHTC) in Atlantic City, New Jersey.   <P> Raytheon Systems Company (RSC) is the current contractor providing these services; therefore, RSC will not be required to submit documentation evidencing their capabilities. <P> The intent of this announcement is to permit companies that may possess the technical knowledge, skills, and abilities to maintain and support the OSDS system to provide specific information as to their capabilities.  Should the FAA conclude that a sufficient number of companies possess the unique technical abilities required, the FAA may determine to conduct a competitive procurement and release a "Request for Offer-Screening Information Request (SIR)." <P> Interested companies are required to submit documentation evidencing the possession of each of the following demonstrated capabilities and qualifications, which are all equally important: <P> 1.  Experience in the development, maintenance, and/or testing of air traffic control automation software.  This must include sufficient knowledge of oceanic air traffic control procedures and National Airspace System (NAS) interfaces with oceanic automation to be able to diagnose OSDS automation problems, recommend options to resolve problems, and modify the software (primarily written in C++) to implement the chosen solution. <P> 2. Experience in the development, maintenance, and/or testing of the FAA's flight data processing software (i.e., HOST, ODAPS, or OFDPS), including experience in programming in JOVIAL to provide corrections or changes to the software. <P> 3. Experience in providing 24/7 on-site hardware and software maintenance at an operating air traffic control facility, with workers on-call to provide repair services within two hours of notification. <P> 4. Experience in hardware CMLS for a complex distributed computer system including associated servers, lans, monitors, and peripherals, that required both the maintenance of on-site spares and of a second-level depot facility for repair or replacement.  <P> 5. Proof of ISO 9001 and/or CMM Level 3 Certification. <P> The Contractor will be required to furnish labor, facility, material, special tools, parts, and test equipment to perform software and hardware maintenance and CMLS on the OSDS systems located at the New York and Oakland ARTCCs and at the Technical Center in New Jersey.   <P> The anticipated contract type for this procurement is Time and Materials. The total period of performance is four years; a one-year base period and three one-year option periods to be exercised at the sole discretion of the Government.  <P> Responses to this market survey are to be submitted directly to: Mary D. Dobbs, Contracting Officer, marked "OSMS Market Survey", and to be received by 5:00 p.m. EST on January 13, 2003.  Facsimile and electronic mail responses are not acceptable.  Companies that submit technical capabilities statements that fail to demonstrate possession of any of the five qualification factors, or fail to meet the response deadline will not be considered for distribution of any resulting solicitation.  <P> The FAA will not pay for any information received or costs incurred in preparing responses to this announcement.  Any proprietary information should be marked.  Also, this announcement shall not be construed as a request for proposal or as an obligation on the part of the FAA to acquire these services. POC: Mary D. Dobbs, Contracting Officer, 400 7th Street, S.W., Plaza Level 200, Washington, DC 20590. Tele: (202) 366-5050. <P>

C.	Prepare virus suspensions that meet FDA requirements.  The preparation of the viruses can in most cases be performed at BSL2 level, but the ability to prepare viruses at BSL3 conditions might be anticipated. These preparations will include, but not be limited to, the following viruses:  

1-Paramyxoviruses.   Prepare 1-2 liters of up to four (4) suspensions of wild type or attenuated parainfluenza, respiratory syncytial virus, or metapneumovirus per year in (i) human or simian diploid cells such as DBS-FRhL-2 cells or (ii) heteroploid cells such as Vero cells that have been qualified for use in the production of a live virus vaccine for administration to humans as currently recommended by the FDA.  These viruses shall include wild type or attenuated viruses such as temperature sensitive (ts) and cold adapted (ca) viruses. The vast majority of the seed viruses provided to the contractor  will have been produced at LID/NIH using recombinant DNA technology.  Produce and test these viruses as described above and ensure that they have an infectivity of 106 or greater for parainfluenza viruses and 105 or greater for respiratory syncytial virus or metapneumoviruses. Nucleotide sequence analysis and testing to determine if the candidate vaccines retain the laboratory markers of attenuation will be performed by LID/NIAID.

2-Rotavirus.  Prepare 2-3 liters of up to three (3) rotavirus suspensions in human or simian cells such as DBS-FRhL-2 and Vero cells suitable for production of vaccines intended for use in humans.  Aliquot virus suspensions which (a) have acceptable infectivity, i.e., 106 pfu per ml titered in MA104 cells or other suitable infectivity titers as determined by the Project Officer and (b) retain the identity of the rotavirus supplied by the Project Officer.

3-Dengue viruses and other flaviviruses.  Prepare 2-3 liters of up to four (4) wild type or live attenuated dengue virus per year in Vero or other cells qualified for use in preparing vaccines for administration to humans.  Similarly prepare up to three (3) live attenuated vaccines for the following flaviviruses: tick-borne encephalitis virus, West Nile virus, and St. Louis encephalitis virus.  Viruses will be supplied by the Project Officer in the form of DNA-derived viruses recovered from transfected C6/36 mosquito cells or Vero cells.  The viruses will be passaged and produced in Vero or another cell line qualified for use in the preparation of viruses to be given to humans.  Ensure that the viral preparations have an infectivity of 105.0-6.0 or greater.  The viruses are to be administered parenterally and should not contain serum or antibiotics.  Crude cell harvests containing virus can be treated with Benzonase to decrease the quantity and size of contaminating Vero cell DNA. The amount of cell DNA that contaminates the vaccine should meet FDA requirements for parenterally administered vaccine preparations prepared in cell lines such as Vero cells.  Benzonase should not be detectable in the vaccine preparation administered to humans.  Tests to estimate the size of DNA after Benzonase treatment, if sufficient DNA is present in the speciman, likely will be required by FDA for continued use of candidate vaccines through Phase II and III clinical trials. Nucleotide sequence analysis and testing to determine if the candidate vaccines retain the laboratory markers of attenuation will be performed by LID/NIAID.

4-Influenza Viruses.  Prepare up to three (3) virus suspensions of 2-3 liters of influenza virus in embryonated chicken eggs obtained from specific pathogen free flocks and safety test these suspensions during each contract year.  These viruses include attenuated influenza influenza A viruses belonging to hemagglutinin subtypes H1 to H15 and neuraminidase subtypes N1-N9 or to other subtypes as they appear in nature.  Seed virus will be provided by the Project Officer.  The suspensions shall be grown in SPAFAS avian leucosis virus-free embryonated eggs.  The final product shall be tested for freedom from avian leucosis virus and other adventitious microbial agents.  The viral suspensions shall (a) have requisite infectivity, i.e., 107.3 to 108.0 plaque forming units (pfu) per ml measured on MDCK cell culture monolayers in the presence of approximately one microgram of trypsin per ml and (b) retain the laboratory markers of the attenuated seed virus such as high efficiency of plaque formation at low temperature (ca phenotype) or decreased efficiency of plaque formation at high temperature (ts phenotype).  Laboratory workers who handle these viruses should be immunized with currently licensed influenza A virus vaccines. Nucleotide sequence analysis and testing to determine if the candidate vaccines retain the laboratory markers of attenuation will be performed by LID/NIAID.

D.	Deliver the materials, i.e., viruses and appropriate Clinical Lot Release Reports within five (5) months of the date of availability of seed viruses in order to accomplish the goals of this contract. The release reports for these virus suspensions will provide details of production of the virus suspension, the identity and titer of the virus using information provided by LID/NIAID on nucleotide sequence analysis (and other virus specific tests), demonstration of freedom of the virus suspension from adventitious agents, and quantity and size of Vero cell DNA, if sufficient DNA remains in the preparation for such characterization.  

E.	Provide a repository for the GMP long-term storage of viruses at minus 75 degrees C for viruses produced by the contractor and of government owned cells banks at minus 150 degrees C.  

F.	Produce and qualify cell lines as directed by the Project Officer for use by LID and by the contractor in the production of viruses to be administered to humans or for other uses as directed by the Project Officer.  As for all virus suspensions produced by the contractor, cell lines produced and qualified for use under this contract will be considered government-owned materials.  

It is estimated that an average of seven virus suspensions and one cell line will be produced and delivered annually.   The lots that will be made are predominantly for Phase I/early Phase II clinical studies.  The Contractor will not be required to follow the traditional method of commercial vaccine preparation for production of a Master and Working Virus Banks.  Alternatively, the LID will provide the contractor sufficient seed virus to inoculate the substrate used for Clinical Lot production (e.g., Vero cells or SPF eggs).   The contractor shall confirm microbial sterility of material provided by LID before initiating Clinical Lot production.  Next, the experimental lot of vaccine is produced and the bulk harvest is frozen at minus 70 degrees C (in some cases final filling can be done on the day of harvest for small lots of vaccine).  For the bulk harvest, the titer of virus (performed by contractor or LID/NIAID), its nucleotide sequence (performed by LID/NIAID), markers of attenuation (performed by LID/NIAID), and its microbial sterility (i.e. absence from contamination with bacteria, fungi, and mycoplasma - performed by contractor) are determined. It is estimated that this might take three weeks to complete. It is estimated that up to 30% of such attempts might fail to meet all three of the above criteria. Those lots that meet titer, sequence, and sterility requirements are filled and further tested for absence from the full set of likely adventitious agents. LID will supply sufficient quantities of antiserum against the virus in the experimental lot of vaccine to be used in the in vitro tests performed to detect the presence of adventitious viral agents in the vaccines.  LID will supply qualified Vero cells for production of vaccines.

 Any offeror must be able to document the experience and capabilities of the professional and technical personnel assigned to this project. The professional and technical personnel shall have extensive experience in the preparation of suspension of viruses, including wild type viruses.  In addition, the offeror must possess the necessary facilities to accomplish this work, or must demonstrate the ability to obtain these.  It is proposed that any contract issued will be a Fixed-Fee, Indefinite-Delivery Indefinite-Quantity, Requirements contract for a base year and six option years.  The RFP will be issued on or about December 16, 2002.  All requests for the RFP must be in writing (electronic request will not be accepted) and directed to:

<DESC>Technical POC:   Mr. John V. McNamara, 315-330-4175, e-mail:  John.McNamara@rl.af.mil.  Program Manager, Mr. Jerry F. Lipa , 315-330-4494, email:  Jerry.Lipa@rl.af.mil.   Contracting POC: IFKA, Contracting Officer, email: IFKA@rl.af.mil.  
The Information Directorate, Systems Concepts and Applications Branch  of the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), Rome Research Site, is soliciting white papers under this announcement for innovative technologies to support Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence (C4I) applications.  Of particular interest are technologies that can significantly reduce the time between information technology availability and its employment into the research and development programs that support legacy and new military electronic systems.  Also of interest are commercial technologies that can improve the functionality, performance, reliability, longevity, and useability of these new and legacy military electronic systems.  Access to Rome Research Site laboratories, including such legacy systems as Theater Battle Management Core System (TBMCS), Master Caution Panel (MCP), Joint Defensive Planner (JDP), and others, will be provided as necessary.  This effort will investigate the application and/or development of emerging and in-use commercial information technologies, products and standards as they relate to the following technical areas: (1) Legacy and evolving Air Force C4I systems:  This area covers not only technological  upgrades to the existing Air and Space Operations Center (AOC) command and control structure/functions, but also revolutionary concepts for future operations centers, such as the Advanced Technology Air and Space Operations Center (AT-AOC).  Examples of the applicable technologies are advanced distributed architectures, publish/subscribe concepts and architectures, distributed computing environments, real-time processing, digital graphics, portable/wearable/mobile computational devices, and advanced displays/user interfaces.  (2) Simulation and modeling technologies applicable to Air Force C4I systems:  Simulation and modeling for this purpose represent the full range of applications from supporting the development of the individual components within an Air Force C4I system to developing course of action evaluation tools to facilitate the  AOC planning function.  Examples of these technologies include: model abstraction, multi-resolution modeling, model interoperability, real-time simulation systems, advanced simulation architectures, C4I concept evaluations, long haul networked simulations utilizing HLA and other standard protocols, and application of these, or other, technologies to the concepts of  rehearsal, dynamic planning/execution, and dynamic battle management.  (3) Technology for integration, test and demonstration of Air Force C4I systems:  Systems integration and demonstration are used here to represent the spectrum of testing, evaluation, and demonstration that is typically conducted during the development, integration, and fielding phases of an Air Force C4I system and any of its component parts.  Examples of these technologies are those that are involved with the integration, measurement, assessment, and demonstration of information, Command and Control, communications, and enterprise systems as they relate to, or are part of, legacy and developing Air Force C4I systems.  (4) Development of appropriate information technology to enhance the capabilities of current and future Air Force C4I systems:  This area encompasses all information technology that could potentially contribute to enhancing the functionality, performance, reliability, longevity, and usability of legacy or planned Air Force C4I systems/applications.  Examples of these technologies are data retrieval/mining, data storage, software/system monitors, data visualization, data busses, publish/subscribe mechanisms, digital moving maps, and decision making techniques.  (5)  Development of technology to enhance and enable the use of collaborative environments in AF C4ISR systems and enterprises:  This refers to development of individual collaboration tools, as well as the larger collaborative environment which results from networking the individual tools for simultaneous employment with multiple users that are widely dispersed.  Examples of these technologies are collaborative engineering and virtual prototyping environments which enable the collaborative development and application of information, air planning, and enterprise technologies/applications  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION.  DO NOT SUBMIT A FORMAL PROPOSAL AT THIS TIME.  Offerors are required to submit three (3) copies of a 2-3 page white paper with a cover letter.  The white paper will be formatted as follows: Section A: Title, Period of Performance, Cost of Task, Name of Company; Section B: Task Objective; and Section C: Technical Summary. Offerors must mark their white papers/proposals with the restrictive language stated in FAR 15.609(a).  All responses to this announcement must be addressed to ATTN: Jerry F. Lipa, Reference BAA-03-02-IFKA, Rome Research Site/IFKA, 525 Brooks Road, Rome NY 13441-4505.  Multiple white papers within the purview of this announcement may be submitted by each offeror.  The purpose of the white paper is to preclude unwarranted effort on the part of an offeror whose proposed work is not of interest to the Government.  Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal.  Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract.  Complete instructions for proposal preparation will be forwarded with the invitation for proposal submission.  An informational briefing is not planned.  The cost of preparing proposals in response to this announcement is not considered an allowable direct charge to any resulting contract or any other contract, but may be an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect cost specified in FAR 31.205-18.  Evaluation of proposals will be performed using the following criteria: (1) The overall scientific and technical merits of the proposal, (2) the innovativeness of the proposed approach and technologies, (3) the applicability of the proposed technologies to proposed and legacy military electronic systems, and (4) the reasonableness and realism of the proposed costs and fees.  The offeror?s capability and capacity to achieve the objectives of this BAA will also be evaluated.  The technical criteria (1-3 above) will also be used to determine whether white papers submitted are consistent with the intent of this BAA and are of interest to the Government.  White papers submitted will be evaluated as they are received.  Individual white paper and proposal evaluations will be based on acceptability or unacceptability without regard to other proposals submitted under this BAA.  Options are discouraged and unpriced options will not be considered for award.  Principal funding of this BAA and the anticipated award of contracts will start approximately the second quarter of FY-03.  Individual awards will normally  not exceed 24 months in duration, with dollar amounts ranging from $100K to $500K.  Total funding for this BAA is approximately $25M.  Questions, clarification, or concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition should be communicated directly to the IFKA Contracting Officer at AFRL email IFKA@rl.af.mil.  The e-mail must reference the title and solicitation number of the acquisition.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>Introduction: The Government desires to divest itself of surplus Material such as scrap metal, equipment, vehicles, etc. that cannot be made available to the general public. The Material is currently located at sites across the Government complex.  The Material is believed to have some value to certain commercial enterprises, therefore, the Material is not considered waste.  The Material meets the definition of personal property as stated in the Federal Acquisition Regulation.  Some of the Material may be radioactively contaminated and regulated under The Atomic Energy Act of 1954 as amended. Background: The federal government and in particular the U.S. Department of Energy Complex has an indeterminate amount of potentially contaminated radioactive Material that could be recycled, reused or buried.  The Material is in the form of small to large pieces of metal, structural steel, equipment and vehicles.  The Material may be in scrap piles, outside locations and stored in containers, and/or it may be located within underutilized or abandoned facilities.  In some cases the Material may be attached and/or part of the building in which they are located. Scope: General ? The Contractor shall disposition the Material by decontamination, sorting, segregating, or by other means, processing the Material at the Contractor?s facility(ies). The requirements shall be specified in each order. Hereafter referred to as ?order(s)?. The order may include removal, characterization, packaging, and transportation to the Contractor?s facility. Security ? The requiring organization shall make the determination if the Material has security concerns.  If the Material to be dispositioned requires special handling or processing due to classification, Unclassified Controlled Nuclear Information (UCNI), or Export Controlled Information (ECI) specific requirements shall be detailed within the individual orders.  It is anticipated that such requirements will be minimal, but where applicable shall likely require certified destruction or reconfiguration of the affected Material. Where required, methods of destruction or reconfiguration may be proposed by the contractor for approval by the organization issuing the order. Contractors may not be able to perform those orders requiring security clearances until such clearances are obtained. Radioactive Property - When the Material subject to transfer is radioactively or potentially contaminated the contractor shall comply with federal requirements for all activities performed at that site.  It is anticipated only minimal decontamination processing to expedite handling, loading, and transporting of the Material will be permitted at the federal work site. Material located at the contractor?s facilities shall be managed and regulated in accordance with the terms and conditions of its NRC or NRC Agreement State license. Environment, Safety and Health (ES&H) and Quality Assurance (QA) - The ES&H and QA requirements will likely vary with each order depending on what work (if any) will be performed on the government?s site.  If the order requires dismantling for parts or equipment on a government site there would likely be additional ES&H and QA requirements.  The organization issuing the order shall be required to detail the ES&H and QA requirements associated with a given order. Onsite Actions, Packaging, and Transportation - For some tasks, the contractor shall be responsible for removal of the Material from designated facilities and/or storage areas.  Onsite actions shall be defined by each order.  The requiring organization shall provide the best information available on the description, characterization, and history of the Material.  The removal and transportation of the Material by the Contractor shall be done in compliance with all applicable State, Federal, and local laws and regulations. Title and Possession ? The government?s intent is to transfer title to all the Material at some point in the disposition process. The point of title transfer and possession shall be clearly defined in each order. Possession shall occur no later than at the point of receipt at the Contractor?s facility. If there are no security concerns with the material under an order, title transfer will likely be concurrent. If the Material has security concerns the title will transfer after the security concerns are resolved and prior to any unrestricted release of Material or final disposition of the Material. Applicable Directives: 1. The Contractor shall maintain all required licenses/permits to conduct the scope of each applicable task, including shipping, storage, handling and waste disposal. 2. The Contractor shall perform all work in accordance with federal, state, and local rules, regulations and standards and within the limits of the Contractor?s permit or license. 3. The Contractor shall comply with quality assurance requirements as established by Nuclear Quality Assurance manual (NQA-1), Quality Assurance Program Requirements for Nuclear Facilities. 4. Any other applicable organization directives (e.g. DOE Orders and/or Site-specific procedures) shall be specified in each order. Performance Requirements: Specific performance requirements shall be delineated for each order. General Requirements -The Department of Energy, Oak Ridge Operations, National Center of Excellence for Metals Recycle (NMR) is the sponsor of this BOA. NMR reserves the right to conduct annual quality assurance audits to the requirements of the Contractor?s NRC or NRC Agreement State license. All organizations that issue orders under this BOA will rely on the NMR annual audits and shall not conduct their own.  If NMR finds major concerns during an audit, the Contractor shall not be allowed to participate in the competition for any orders until the finding is corrected and approved by NMR.  NMR, or a contractor for NMR, may also conduct surveillance. 1. The Contractor shall have the legal authority to possess and process radioactive materials, such as a NRC license or NRC Agreement State radioactive material license. 2. The Contractor shall comply with all applicable Federal and State requirements including EPA, OSHA, DOT and NRC/NRC Agreement State regulations. The Contractor shall notify DOE if any of their licenses or permits has expired, been revoked, or is under any other action by regulators that shall not allow the Contractor to accept Material for processing. 3. The Contractor shall provide DOE the results of regulatory audits conducted, or Notices of Violations issued by regulators. 4. The Contractor shall have health and safety programs that meet the requirements of their licenses or permits to handle Material in the specific order. Deliverables For each order the Contractor shall provide an annual Mass Balance Report in accordance with the attached format delineating the Material dispositioned under that order to the BOA Administrator listed in Article 3. One copy shall also be provided to the activity or site issuing the order. Annual Mass Balance Reports shall be due on February 1st for the previous year. Additional deliverables may be specified in each order.
