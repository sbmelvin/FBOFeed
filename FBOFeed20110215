<DESC>Joint Force Command Naples (JFC Naples) intends to advertise for International Competitive Bidding (ICB) on works and services within the framework of the NATO Military Budget Committee (MBC). Eligible firms will be invited to bid on the supply of an Integrated Terrestrial & Satellite Automatic Identification System (AIS) to Headquarters Allied Maritime Command Naples.

To bid this project, a U.S. company must 1) maintain a professionally active facility (office, factory, laboratory, etc.) in the United States, 2) be pre-approved for participation in NATO ICB, and 3) have successfully performed at least two contracts in the last five years that are substantially similar in scope to the requirement described in the solicitation.

JFC Naples is serving as the procurement agency for this project, which was authorized by the MBC. JFC Naples intends to use the two sealed envelope bidding procedure. The contract will be awarded to the lowest technically compliant bidder. This is a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract.

The estimated value of this project is 540,000 (270,000 for base year + 270,000 for one option year). The reference for this project is IFIB-ACO-NAP-11-34 and all correspondence in relation to this procurement shall refer to this reference. 

The Invitation for International Bid (IFIB) package will contain material at the level of NATO UNCLASSIFIED.

BIDDING PROCEDURE 

Before a firm can be nominated to the bidders list for this ICB procurement, it must be approved for participation in NATO ICB. Firms are approved for NATO ICB on a facility-by-facility basis. Only facilities located in NATO member nations may participate in NATO ICB. The U.S. Department of Commerce approves facilities that are located within the United States. 

U.S. firms will find a copy of the U.S. NATO ICB application at the following website:

http://www.bis.doc.gov/defenseindustrialbaseprograms/OSIES/NATOprograms/index.htm

The NATO ICB application is a one-time application. The application requires supporting documentation in the form of 1) a company resume and 2) an annual report or set of financial documents indicating compilation, review, or audit by an independent CPA.

- the title and/or solicitation number of the project
- the name/phone/FAX/email of the point of contact for the bid documents

Upon approval of your one-time NATO ICB application, the Department of Commerce will then know to follow up by issuing a Declaration of Eligibility (DOE) for that project.  A DOE is used to nominate an approved firm to the bidders list for a particular NATO ICB project.

IMPORTANT DEADLINES

1. Deadline for requesting Declaration of Eligibility: 04 March 2011

(Under MBC rules, the contracting agency will continue to accept nominations to the bidders list after the IFIB is issued and until the bid closing date.)

Only one responsible qualified large business and no other sources will satisfy agency requirements. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement. This notice is not a request for competitive proposals. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract will be based on responses to this notice and is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will be considered solely for informational purposes. Additional quantities of vaccines acquired under preceding or succeeding separate supply contracts or delivery orders may be added to the stockpile by modification to this contract. Material will be held at the contractor furnished storage site for subsequent delivery as required by the contract. The storage site shall be located at one or more domestic facility (i.e.) that is/are controlled by the Contractor. The Contractor shall only store the product in filled, labeled, ready-to-use containers in the stockpile. Pfizer Pharmaceuticals, Attn: Don Ashley, 33 Morehall Road, Malvern, PA 19355-1759.

This RFI is issued solely for information, planning purposes, and market research only; it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP. This RFI does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service.

<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">BACKGROUND:</strong></p>
<p>CBP employs a system referred to as the Remote Video Surveillance Systems (RVSS). The RVSS provides a persistent wide area electro-optic and infrared surveillance capability to enable the detection, tracking, identification and classification of illegal entries.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>While RVSS systems have performed relatively well, shortfalls in both effectiveness and suitability combined with obsolescence issues have generated a requirement for an enhanced remote day/night motion imagery surveillance and monitoring capability.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>CBP is looking into replacing/upgrading the current RVSS and deploying new systems referred to as RVSS Generation II (RVSS GEN II). CBP intends to deploy the RVSS GEN II systems as part of a tailored, layered approach to improve situational awareness along the United States Border.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;<br /><br /></span><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">PURPOSE:</strong></p>
<p>This RFI seeks to obtain information from industry that will provide CBP with insight into market conditions, capabilities, and/or scientific advances that will aid in the formation of an acquisition strategy for upgrading, replacing and deploying the RVSS GEN II system. This system will enable detection, tracking, identification, and classification of illegal incursions and to provide CBP agents with improved situational awareness between the Ports of Entry (POE).</p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">SCOPE: </strong></p>
<p>CBP is interested in obtaining information related to existing, fully developed, and integrated systems to provide the desired capability. CBP intends to make maximum use of an open systems approach and desires the system to meet Technology Readiness Levels 7-9 and Manufacturing Readiness Level 5. There is no intent to develop any items or systems under this program. At this time, no decision has been made by CBP on whether site selection and<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>preparation for new deployments will be a Government or an Industry responsibility.</p>

<SUBJECT>Notice of Intent to Sole Source:  Pulsed Electron Paramagnetic Resonance Spectrometer System
<SOLNBR>NB620040-11-00826
<RESPDATE>030111
<CONTACT>Paula Wilkison, Contract Specialist, Phone 301-975-8448, Email paula.wilkison@nist.gov - Todd D Hill, Contracting Officer, Phone 301-975-8802, Email todd.hill@nist.gov
<DESC>The Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), intends to negotiate a firm fixed price purchase order, on a sole source basis, with Bruker Biospin Corporation for the purchase of a pulsed electron paramagnetic resonance spectrometer system under other than full and open competition by the authority of FAR subpart 6.302-1: Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.
<p>The required pulsed electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectrometer system will allow characterization of materials and processes critical to energy conversion and solar fuels and will guide development and innovation of novel catalysts for emerging energy technologies.</p>
<p>The required EPR spectrometer system consists of a magnet capable of producing magnetic fields of adequate magnitude to permit measurements over a wide range of microwave frequencies in addition to sample temperatures ranging from liquid helium to room temperature. The required system is compatible with optical excitation and monitoring of samples in liquid and solid states. The required system is also capable of detecting weak hyperfine interactions and electron-electron dipolar interactions over a range of interaction distances/strengths.</p>
<p>Key required specifications are as follows:</p>
<p>a. Pulsed microwave bridge for electron-electron double resonance (nanometer distance measurements) and electron-spin-echo envelope modulation (detection of weak nuclear hyperfine interactions) experiments.<br /><br />b. Variable sample temperature for detection of spin centers with a range of spin-lattice relaxation times.</p>
<p>c. Multi-frequency bridge capability for assignment of g and hyperfine anisotropy associated with spin centers.</p>
<p>Conventional EPR (i.e. continuous wave) spectroscopy can be used to determine 0.8 - 2.0 nm distances between isolated paramagnets in frozen samples of larger biomolecules or at ambient temperatures in small systems (&lt; 15 kDa). To extend the range of distances that can be measured between isolated paramagnetic centers in biological systems (including nanobiomaterials, which is the intended project focus), pulsed EPR methods must be applied. Using pulsed EPR spectroscopy, interspin distances can be determined to as far as 8.0 nm.</p>
<p>In addition, pulsed methods are required for detecting weak electron-nuclear spin interactions using a technique called electron spin echo envelope modulation, which provides information about the chemical environment of the unpaired electron. Bruker is the only commercial entity that sells EPR spectrometers with this pulsed capability.</p>
<p>The pulsed electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectrometer system offered by Bruker Biospin Corporation, Inc. is the only commercially available integrated system that meets all of NIST's specific research needs.</p>
<p>Delivery shall be FOB Destination, Gaithersburg, MD, and be completed in accordance with the Contractor's commercial schedule.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334516, and the size standard is 500 employees.</p>
<p>No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement. The Government will consider responses received by 12:00 p.m. (Eastern) on March 1, 2011. Inquiries will only be accepted via email to paula.wilkison@nist.gov. No telephone requests will be honored.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in the future.</p>

<DESC><br />THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED. It is the intent of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) for the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), NIH Chemical Genomics Center (NCGC), to negotiate/award a purchase order to Thomson Reuters (Scientific), INC., 1500 Spring Garden Street, Philadelphia, PA, 19130 for the purchase of one Thomson Reuters (Scientific) Integrity 4/user Subscription Access.<br /><br />The sole source determination is based upon the fact that Thompson Reuters (Scientific)&nbsp;Integrity stands alone in its focus on approved and investigational drugs and their mechanisms of action. In addition, the access to patents directly associated with drugs, biological targets and diseases makes Thompson Reuters Integrity particular unique. This product has been in use at the NIH Chemical Genomics Center (NCGC) / NIH Center for Translational Therapeutics (NCTT) for the past year. Continued access to it is essential to the ongoing projects at the center. The software meets the following needs for the NCTT: (1) Access to drugs and investigational drugs worldwide; (2) Data on the mechanisms by which those drugs work; (3) Disease information and associated drugs, targets and clinical trials; (4) Access to associated patents for above content. These needs are essential to the operation of the NCTT. There are no other known products that contain the comprehensive and manually curated data that exists in the Integrity database. This purchase is a renewal of a previous purchase order. The software is currently being used by NCGC and to change vendors at this time would be detrimental to the work that has been completed. <br /><br />PRODUCT DESCRIPTION:<br /><br />1 year, 4-user subscription to Thomson Reuters Integrity Subscription Access<br />This acquisition is being conducted under FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, and is exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6, Competition Requirements. The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 519130 and the Size Standard is 500 Employees. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) intends to issue a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA), as contemplated by FAR 6.102(d)(2), soliciting proposals for research concerning the type or combination of types of technology considered to be suitable and most effective for assessing how to best meet presidential vertical lift requirements.
<p><br />The U.S. Marine Corps maintains and operates modified aircraft dedicated to the transportation of the President of the United States. Worldwide deployment requirements will expose the aircraft to both symmetrical and asymmetrical threats. The mission of the platform(s) is to provide worldwide, safe, comfortable, and reliable transportation for the President, the staff and passengers. In addition to the President and Vice President, others who regularly travel aboard the platform(s) include: the First Family, White House Medical Unit (WHMU) staff, senior White House staff, U.S. Secret Service (USSS) Presidential Protective Detail (PPD) members, and White House Communications Agency (WHCA) staff.</p>
<p>Assigned to Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the platform(s) is under the Operational Control (OPCON) of the White House Military Office (WHMO). Upon receiving WHMO notification of a mission, HMX-1 plans and executes the mission through completion. HMX-1 must be able to perform a wide variety of missions in the Washington DC area, throughout the Continental United States (CONUS), and Outside the Continental United States (OCONUS). The aircraft must be deployable worldwide with minimum reconfiguration on U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) strategic lift assets and operate in a variety of threat spectrums. They must operate into and out of large international airports as well as airfields with short runways, helipads, parking lots, football/soccer fields, sports stadiums, and countryside fields. The aircraft must be characterized by the ability to operate in urban areas having minimal impact to existing infrastructure and environment and must operate throughout a large array of environments to include, but not be limited to, arctic, desert, mountainous, littoral, and tropical, day or night, in all weather conditions.</p>
<p>The objective of this BAA is to gain further knowledge and understanding in areas of interest pertaining to the technology required for the presidential vertical lift mission. The specific areas of interest include, but are not limited to, mass properties and weight management, airworthiness certification, requirements analysis, critical technology elements, affordability and communication system integration. The Government is interested in concepts or approaches that address these areas of interest as they pertain to the presidential vertical lift mission. The BAA and all unclassified associated documentation will be posted on the NAVAIR website at http://www.navair.navy.mil under "Business Opportunities" and "Open Solicitations." Interested offerors shall pay particular attention to the Information Security and Information Assurance requirements defined in the BAA. Specific information concerning proposal submission will be identified in the BAA. Interested offerors are responsible for monitoring the NAVAIR website for official posting of the BAA.</p>

<DESC>This synopsis is being posted to the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website located at http://www.fbo.gov, the Navy Electronic Commerce on Line (NECO) website located at https://www.neco.navy.mil/, and the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division, Acquisition website located at http://www.navsea.navy.mil/nswc/crane/working/contracting/default.aspx.  FBO is the primary point of entry to be used when access to synopses and solicitations from the World Wide Web is required.  However, the NECO webpage as well as the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division, Contracting webpage serve as alternatives if the FBO website is unavailable. 
Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWC) Crane Division plans to sole source a purchase of ARC-233 System spare parts from RF Products, 1500 Davis Street, Camden, New Jersey 08103 (58022).
  This purchase will cover the following spare parts:  Filter Pre-Amp P/N 800A200, USOM (UHF Switched Output Multicoupler) P/N 800225 and RFD (Radio Frequency Distribution) Assembly P/N 800425-01 for the ARC-233 System. These spares are used in the ARC-233 Satellite Communication (SATCOM) Radio Frequency Distribution (RFD) System, which contains the necessary components to complete a Radio Frequency (RF) signal path for transmitting and receiving RF signals in the Ultra High Frequency (UHF) range, utilized for collecting field data.  The ARC-233 system allows up to six SATCOM/Line of Sight (LOS) transceivers to connect to six different antennas in its application on the P3 SPA aircraft.
This requirement will be negotiated on a sole-source basis in accordance with the statutory authority 10 U.S.C.
 23049c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6302.1.  The Government does not possess data rights necessary for the manufacture of the spare parts.  The basis for restricting competition is the cost that would be duplicated to perform first article testing, acquire flight certification, generate Acceptance Test Procedures, and perform electrical load and stress analysis.  The competitive sourcing of this procurement will cost an estimated $3.2 million and result in a 36 month delay in qualification for the current SPA aircraftboth of which are unacceptable.
No solicitation will be available at FedBizOpps and at NECO and no hard copies of the solicitation will be mailed.  Responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency.
  Submitting a bid from the NECO website by clicking on Submit Bid does not guarantee offers will be received by the proper person in the correct format.

<DESC>The Office of Naval Research intends to issue a solicitation for a follow-on effort under its Manufacturing Technology (ManTech) program for the Navy Electronics Manufacturing Center (EMTC). An Indefinite Delivery / Indefinite Quantity Contract is anticipated. The Government reserves the right to make single or multiple awards. The solicitation will be made available on or about 2 March 2011, and all future information about this acquisition, including solicitation amendments, will be distributed solely through the Federal Business Opportunities website. Interested parties are responsible for monitoring this site to ensure that they have the most up-to-date information about this acquisition. Proposals will be due thirty days after issuance of the solicitation.
<p>The Office of Naval Research (ONR) Manufacturing Technology (ManTech) program has established Centers of Excellence (COEs) in various technology areas in order to assist in the selection, development, and execution, of ManTech Projects. These COEs serve as focal points for the development and technology transfer of new and or improved manufacturing processes or products. Navy ManTech has an ongoing effort to develop, advance and deploy technology dedicated specifically to electronics science and technology, manufacturing technology, technology transfer and the United States industrial base improvement through a dedicated Navy Electronics Manufacturing Center (EMTC). For the past five years, the Navy's Electronics Manufacturing Center (EMTC) has been operated under Navy Contract N00014-06-D-0090 by ACI Technologies Inc. located at One International Plaza, Suite 600, Philadelphia, PA 19113. The website is found at http://www.empf.org and provides additional information on the center, information on active projects, and technical reports on completed projects.</p>
<p>The Government encourages innovative approaches to meeting the Navy's technology needs, and the lack of in-house large industrial facilities or equipment should not deter prospective offerors. Some examples of how the needs could possibly be met without actually possessing a facility and equipment include, but are certainly not limited to, teaming arrangements and consortiums. The focus is on the development, advancement and deployment of manufacturing technologies to benefit Navy and DoD weapon systems platforms. As a result, it is envisioned that most if not all of the technical effort on ManTech projects will be performed by manufacturers and integrators of electronic components and not by EMTC personnel using EMTC facilities. The intent is to increase implementation of the technologies as well as minimize the operations and management costs of the Center. Special projects as assigned by the ManTech Director or Program Officer could be performed in-house by the EMTC or via subcontract. Some ManTech or Special Projects could potentially be classified as "Secret." As a result, offerors must have a Secret facility clearance with Secret safeguarding, or have the capability to obtain one prior to award of a contract. Offerors should also be able to provide access to both classified and unclassified meeting spaces.</p>
<p>Websites that may provide additional information on Navy ManTech and the DoD's ManTech Program as a whole are http://www.onr.navy.mil/sci_tech/3t/mantech/default.asp and http://www.dodmantech.com .</p>

<p>12. STATEMENT OF WORK:</p>
<p>I. Position Description Overview</p>
<p>The USAID PMI Resident Advisor shall provide leadership, guidance and overall direction on the development and execution of the President's Malaria Initiative (PMI) in collaboration with the PMI Resident Advisor of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Rwanda and the USAID health team, especially Rwandan professionals assigned to PMI. The PMI Resident Advisor shall liaise with backstops for the PMI in USAID Washington, counterparts in CDC Rwanda and Atlanta, and USAID personnel working within and overseeing the Mission's activities related to malaria control. These responsibilities include regular contact and collaboration with the counterparts in Rwanda's National Malaria Control Program (NMCP) of the Ministry of Health (MOH) and other government ministries and agencies, as well as in a wide range of civil society and private organizations, other donor and international organizations, and other United States Government (USG) entities working in malaria prevention and control. The PMI Resident Advisor shall exercise independent judgment in planning and carrying out tasks, in representing the USG in critical technical and policy forums, in resolving problems and conflicts, and in taking steps necessary to meet deadlines. The PMI Resident Advisor will formulate and advise on policy documents, manage contracts and grants, budgets, and develop planning documents and work plans. <br />The incumbent must possess technical expertise in the area of malaria prevention, treatment and control, and possess an understanding of the social, economic and cultural determinants and implications of the epidemic in Rwanda and neighboring countries, as well as have the experience and skills required to help formulate the USG position on malaria and make important policy decisions as a key representative of the USAID/Rwanda Mission. <br />USAID/Rwanda Health Portfolio</p>
<p>USAID/Rwanda's health portfolio has grown from $25 million in FY 2004 to $124 million in FY 2010, including the introduction of four Presidential Initiatives: the President's Malaria Initiative (PMI) and President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), and the newly announced Feed the Future and Global Health Initiatives. In addition, Rwanda is a priority country for the Administrator's reforms under USAID Forward and new health strategies to promote Best Practices at Scale in the Home, Community and Facilities (BEST). The Mission has organized management of the health portfolio under a team vision "to build capacity in Rwanda for sustained and improved health outcomes by providing innovative and responsive technical and financial assistance." The organizational structure reflects integrated programming across funding streams and includes three teams: Health and Social Welfare Promotion, Health Service Delivery, and Health Systems Strengthening. Each team has developed its vision and expected results, and manages an integrated portfolio of activities. PMI goals and supporting activities are a high priority and key components of all three teams, with the majority managed primarily within the Health Service Delivery Team.</p>
<p>Rwanda is one of eight GHI Plus countries under President Obama's Global Health Initiative (GHI) to helps partner countries improve health outcomes through strengthened health systems, with a particular focus on improving the health of women, newborns and children through programs including infectious disease, nutrition, maternal and child health, and safe water. Under GHI, the USG Rwanda health team will further the GHI business model based upon the GHI's core principles, drawn from the principles of effective development announced by President Obama at the G-8 meeting in L'Aquila. This business model includes:<br />&bull; Implementing a woman- and girl-centered approach<br />&bull; Coordination, collaboration, and integration at all levels<br />&bull; Strengthening and leveraging other efforts<br />&bull; Partnership with countries<br />&bull; Learning and accountability</p>
<p>Similarly, Rwanda is one of 28 countries selected to launch USAID's Best Practices at Scale in the Home, Community and Facilities (BEST). BEST is a process to ensure that, under the Global Health Initiative, USAID applies state-of-the-art programming in family planning, maternal and child health, and nutrition (FP/MCH/N) programs that draws on evidence-based interventions. It hypothesizes that a degree of integration relevant to a country's specific situation will be one characteristic of state-of-the-art programs and reaffirms USAID's commitment to the three areas of programming, strengthens our technical leadership and scales up proven interventions. The BEST planning process will build on our ongoing work and integrate programs where it makes sense to do so to contribute significantly to the ambitious goals the GHI has set for target countries:<br />&#9642; Preventing 54 million unintended pregnancies<br />&#9642; Reducing maternal mortality by 30 percent <br />&#9642; Reducing under-five child mortality by 35 percent <br />&#9642; Decreasing child under nutrition by 30 percent, in conjunction with the Feed the Future food security initiative.</p>
<p>One key principle of the GHI approach is to achieve "smart" integration. BEST facilitates this approach in relation to FP/MCH/N, and encourages integration with HIV/AIDS, other health elements and other sectors, including PMI, where doing so is a pathway to reaching program goals and objectives. BEST recognizes that integration is not an end in itself, but is a potential facilitator for achieving increased availability of key services, cost-savings or sustainability. BEST also recognizes that we lack an evidence base regarding whether, how and under what circumstances integration leads to improved health outcomes and health impact. Therefore, countries' plans will identify ways to provide additional learning in order to promote "smart" integration.</p>
<p>II. Specific Responsibilities</p>
<p>Specifically, the PMI Resident Advisor shall: <br />&bull; Collaborate with officials of the NMCP and other partners, such as the Global Fund (GF), World Health Organization (WHO), United Nation's Children's Fund (UNICEF), World Bank (WB), non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and faith-based organizations (FBOs) to design, plan and implement malaria prevention and control activities consistent with the malaria control coverage needs identified by the strategy and plans of the NMCP and PMI.<br />&bull; Ensure that all activities are consistent with internationally accepted best practices and relevant to the specific malaria epidemiology of Rwanda;<br />&bull; Coordinate with other partners and support efforts to address malaria control delivery gaps and help build technical and managerial capacity within Rwandan institutions at the national, district and lower levels;<br />&bull; Provide technical support to all partners and managerial support as needed during the designing and implementation phases of projects to ensure the quality of interventions supported and that programmatic targets are met;<br />&bull; Work with suppliers and partners to ensure that programmatic commodities are purchased in a timely and cost effective manner. Also, ensure that the absorptive capacity exists in implementation sites to receive, manage and distribute these items effectively. <br />&bull; Ensure that malaria activities are integrated into overall USAID-supported health activities and coordinate these activities with relevant Rwandan authorities to avoid duplication of effort and programming gaps; <br />&bull; Assist the PMI administrative manager of USAID Washington to ensure full accountability and value for money of funds provided by PMI; <br />&bull; Assist the MOH in ensuring effective communication and coordination between Roll Back Malaria (RBM) and GF partners, including donor agencies and other stakeholders working on malaria control in Rwanda;<br />&bull; Promote effective coordination between Government of Rwanda (GOR) entities related to malaria prevention and control in Rwanda. These departments include MOH Senior Management, NMCP, Child Health, Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI), Reproductive Health, Nutrition, School Health, and Health Education and Promotion, Planning at the national level. At the district level, key stakeholders include district administrations, health facility managers and staff, and community leaders and health workers. <br />&bull; Work with the NMCP and other partners to develop and execute a monitoring and evaluation plan to be implemented through existing GOR systems and existing USG supported mechanisms. Carry out monitoring and evaluation visits to implementation sites to ascertain all quantitative and qualitative data is collected properly and ensure programmatic quality and value for money are maintained;<br />&bull; Assist PMI administrative manager of USAID Washington to ensure that financial and technical reports on the President's Malaria Initiative in Rwanda are prepared and submitted as required;<br />&bull; Manage contracts and grants subject to USAID rules and regulations.</p>

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The Coast Guard Academy has as its Mission to develop Leaders of Character. The premier character trait desired in our graduates is Integrity. We need to develop a way to measure Integrity in our cadets which does not depend upon self-assessment. That method is the Situational Judgment Test, a method that depends upon the use of critical incidents that involve the full continuum of Integrity, and which derive from independent judgments of integrity-related behavior and actions endorsed by the individual being assessed. It is desired to have this situational judgment test reach the final developmental stage by October 30, 2011. It has been determined that there will be approximately 1200-1300 individual surveys required. <br /><br />All interested parties please contact Mr. Kevin Gustin @ <a href="mailto:Kevin.W.Gustin@uscg.mil">Kevin.W.Gustin@uscg.mil</a> for a copy of the RFQ package.&nbsp;

<DESC>The Federal Acquisition Service (FAS), General Services Administration (GSA), is undertaking an initiative to modernize the supply chain capabilities of its Office of General Supplies and Services (GSS). GSS is adopting a new business model to provide variable levels of service depending on the needs of its customers. This new strategy, and a desire for greater business agility, is driving the need for GSS to leverage best practices in supply chain management and to update its current legacy information systems environment.

Supply chain systems modernization is a key part of the strategic initiative sup-porting GSSs business goal to become more agile, flexible, and competitive as a supply chain provider. GSS has determined that the best approach for systems modernization is to use a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) solution rather than transforming legacy systems. GSS is also considering Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) for the solution. GSS intends to transition from the legacy application environment to this new systems environment by 2014.

GSA is interested in establishing an information technology (IT) environment that provides end-to-end support for supply chain planning and execution. COTS software suites from single vendors may provide capabilities to support many of the supply chain business requirements. However, GSA realizes that a best-of-breed solution may provide even greater capabilities in critical functional areas, while enabling data visibility and interoperability through the use of standards-based communications protocols. GSA is issuing this request for information (RFI) to obtain information and sources for a COTS software solution for transportation management that will support GSSs business requirements and will en-able integrated end-to-end business processes.

<SUBJECT>RFQ545654: GSA Supply Chain Modernization RFI for a Warehouse Management System
<SOLNBR>RFQ545654
<RESPDATE>031111
<CONTACT>Carlton T. Benton, Contracting Officer, Phone 7036052794, Email carlton.benton@gsa.gov - Carolyn M. Van Pelt, Contract Specialist, Phone 7036052788, Email carolyn.vanpelt@gsa.gov
<DESC>The Federal Acquisition Service (FAS), General Services Administration (GSA), is undertaking an initiative to modernize the supply chain capabilities of its Office of General Supplies and Services (GSS). GSS is adopting a new business model to provide variable levels of service depending on the needs of its customers. This new strategy, and a desire for greater business agility, is driving the need for GSS to leverage best practices in supply chain management and to update its current legacy information systems environment.

Supply chain systems modernization is a key part of the strategic initiative sup-porting GSSs business goal to become more agile, flexible, and competitive as a supply chain provider. GSS has determined that the best approach for systems modernization is to use a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) solution rather than transforming legacy systems. GSS is also considering Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) for the solution. GSS intends to transition from the legacy application environment to this new systems environment by 2014.

GSA is interested in establishing an information technology (IT) environment that provides end-to-end support for supply chain planning and execution. COTS software suites from single vendors may provide capabilities to support many of the supply chain business requirements. However, GSA realizes that a best-of-breed solution may provide even greater capabilities in critical functional areas, while enabling data visibility and interoperability through the use of standards-based communications protocols. GSA is issuing this request for information (RFI) to obtain information and sources for a COTS software solution for ware-house management that will support GSSs business requirements and will enable integrated end-to-end business processes.

<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), through the Office of the Chief Counsel (AGC), requires professional legal services to provide support and to supplement in-house legal resources for the FAA's environmental work.
Legal help is needed to assist in the review and preparation of Environmental Impact Statements (EISs) or Environmental Assessments (EAs), pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and related environmental statutes for airport development and reconstruction and the defense of litigation associated with these projects.  Currently, the FAA has numerous airport development and reconstruction projects in progress or slated for future development. Ordinarily these airport development and reconstruction projects increase operational efficiency at airports and are often directed at expanding capacity and reducing delay within the national transportation system.  
This work is specialized for the federal government, i.e., not a commercial item.  The attorneys engaged in performing this effort will be serving FAA in a professional legal capacity and will be bound, as applicable, by all privileges and other professional obligations that attach to this relationship.
The period of performance for this effort will be from the Date of Award through twelve consecutive months, with four additional one-year options to be exercised at the discretion of the Government.
This is a Full and Open procurement with applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 541110 (Offices of Lawyers) with a size standard of $7.0 million.
Interested parties responding to this solicitation are directed to the attached Screening Information Request (SIR).  All questions/inquiries must be provided in writing by 3:00 PM Eastern Standard Time (EST) Friday, February 25, 2011 to Janella Davis at janella.davis@faa.gov.  Proposals are due by 2:00 PM EST on Monday, March 14, 2011. See Section L of the SIR for more information on submittal of proposals and written inquires. 
Prospective offerors are hereby on notice that any amendment(s) issued to this SIR will be published on this website http://www.faaco.faa.gov under the current announcements for the FAA Headquarters. It is the Offerors' responsibility to visit this website frequently for updates on this procurement. 
The FAA will not be liable for any costs associated with the preparation of responses to the SIR, nor reimburse or otherwise pay any costs incurred by any party responding to this announcement.
This announcement does not obligate the Government to award any effort resulting from SIR DTFAWA-11-R-00066.

<DESC>Sources Sought. This is the public notice for acquisitions over $10,000. The U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), located in Miami, FL intends to issue a fixed price indefinite delivery indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract for sea turtle satellite tags, both FASTLOC GPS and Pop-up Archival Transmitting (PAT) satellite tags. The satellite tags are used for sea turtle research to determine the impact of fisheries interaction, assess annual survival rates, and spatial distribution of sea turtles. The proposed acquisition is for supplies for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the Authority Cited: The Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994 (Title VIII, PL 103-355) as implemented at Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.102 and FAR Subpart 13.106-1(b). Wildlife Computers, Inc. designed and built the above sea turtle satellite tags. They have proprietary drawings, engineering data, and the parts necessary to build these essential components. As an example of the intricate requirements of sea turtle satellite tags, the following are minimum functional requirements of PAT satellite tags: weigh 80 grams or less, excluding tether and attachment (to animal) material, and positively buoyant when released from tether; operational range in open ocean environment attached to moving animals to depths of 1000m, temperatures of 0 to +60 deg C, and placed globally; lithium battery sufficient to sample data for one year and transmit at least 10,000 32 byte transmissions; tag with salt-water switch and with out-of-water sensor; $16 MBytes of non-volatile flash memory; detailed data are stored in archival tag and summary data are transmitted at release; 12-bit analog converters to provide high-accuracy depth and temperature readings; 8-bit analog-to digital converter for light level and battery voltage readings; depth accuracy of 1% or better, measurable between 0-1000m with a resolution of 0.5m; temperature accuracy of 1% or better, measurable from 0 to +60 deg. C with a resolution of 0.05C; on-board real-time clock temperature-compensated to accurately time data readings and release date. These specifications are essential to ensure the compatibility of results with earlier results of the similar studies; the government has since deployed 47 such tags in a post-hooking mortality study for ESA-protected loggerhead sea turtles. Wildlife Computers is the only U.S. supplier that has popup satellite archival tags with operational protocols that ensure that even if the turtle dies wearing the tag, scientists will get back the data transmitted through the ARGOS satellite system. These protocols include a mechanical failsafe system that releases the tag prior to the popup date if the turtle sinks past 1,500m, and software that allows researchers to program the tag to release prior to its programmed date if the animal maintains a specified depth range for a particular time period. The PAT tags also can be programmed to transmit intermittently while still attached to the turtle to provide data critical to using known-fate mark-recapture analysis methods. Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive responses. However, all responses received within seven calendar days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. Responses can be sent via email to: jackie.a.shewmaker@noaa.gov. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Interested firms shall include, in writing, the company name, address, point of contact, telephone number, and business size; a statement regarding their capabilities and qualifications to manufacture sea turtle satellite tags; and sufficient information that describes or demonstrates the firm's knowledge of sea turtle satellite tags. Only affirmative responses to this notice will be evaluated to the extent necessary for the Government to determine whether it is feasible to conduct a competitive acquisition considering demonstrated knowledge and experience. Submissions received in response to this notice shall be evaluated based on demonstrated technical ability to successfully provide the required supplies as stated herein. If no affirmative responses are received, the government intends to issue an IDIQ contract to Wildlife Computers. DOC, EAD requires that all contractors doing business with this office be registered with the Central Contractor Registry (CCR). No contract/purchase order can be made to a company not registered in CCR. For additional information and to register in CCR, please access the following web site: http://www.ccr.gov. In order to register, all offerors must have a Dun &amp; Bradstreet Number. A Dun &amp; Bradstreet number may be acquired free of charge by contacting Dun &amp; Bradstreet on-line at https://www.dnb.com/product/eupdate/requestOptions.html or by phone at (800) 333-0505.

<DESC><strong>Sources Sought Notice for Submarine Skills - Training Network (SubSkillsNet) / Virtual Interactive Shipboard Instructional Tour (VISIT).</strong>
<p><strong><br />INTRODUCTION<br /></strong>The Naval Air Warfare Center, Training Systems Division (NAWCTSD), Orlando FL, Undersea Program Directorate is seeking potential sources with the ability to provide the development of training simulations, training systems, training data products, training software configuration management, and lifecycle support for the Submarine Skills-training Network (SubSkillsNet)/Virtual Interactive Shipboard Instructional Tour (VISIT). These products and capabilities primarily support requirements originated by Naval Sea Systems Command, Undersea Warfare (SEA 07TR) and Submarine Sensor Systems Program Office (PMS 435).</p>
<p>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT to determine the availability and technical capability of small businesses (including the following subsets, HUBZone Firms; Certified 8(a), Service-Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses) to provide the required products. The responses to this Sources Sought will be used to determine if the procurement will be set-aside for a small business category.</p>
<p><strong>PLACE OF PERFORMANCE<br /></strong>98% of the effort is to be performed at a Government site with the majority (about 95%) of the work being at NAWCTSD, deFlorez building, located at 12350 Research Parkway, Orlando, Florida; about 3% at other Government sites; and about 2% at other non-Government sites as specified by the Government.</p>
<p><strong>DISCLAIMER<br />THIS SOURCES SOUGHT IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. IT DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A SOLICITATION AND SHALL NOT BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT. RESPONSES IN ANY FORM ARE NOT OFFERS AND THE GOVERNMENT IS UNDER NO OBLIGATION TO AWARD A CONTRACT AS A RESULT OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. NO FUNDS ARE AVAILABLE TO PAY FOR PREPARATION OF RESPONSES TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. ANY INFORMATION SUBMITTED BY RESPONDENTS TO THIS TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION IS STRICTLY VOLUNTARY.<br /><br /><br />CONTRACT/PROGRAM BACKGROUND<br /></strong>1. Current contract number is N61339-06-D-0017, a single source Indefinite Delivery Contract (IDC) for (mainly) software related products, still photography, graphics, 2D and 3D modeling, spares or materials, and travel .<br />2. Contract type: Firm Fixed Price (FFP) with some Cost lines.<br />3. Incumbent contractor: Symvionics, Inc. <br />4. A total of 17 delivery orders have been issued over the last four (4) years since 2006 totaling approximately $6.5 million. The procurements have been made to meet planned and emergent requirements.</p>
<p>NAWCTSD (SUBSKILLSNET-VISIT team) has been directed to procure a full range of modeling and simulation; design; development; production; modification; documentation; test and evaluation; delivery; upgrading, and life cycle support of training systems for various customers (primarily the submarine training community). NAWCTSD's SUBSKILLSNET-VISIT suite consists of both software and hardware components that are primarily focused on submarine navigation and photo-centric virtual tour training systems for a variety of platform types. These two primary product lines (SubSkillsNet, VISIT) have been in an incremental development cycle since the mid-1990s. Their development has included creation of entirely new products and components as well as incremental capability improvements as required by customers. Most of the work consists of development of software in the NAWCTSD laboratory; however several tasks also involve travel to other Government sites to support requirements clarification, integration, testing, and delivery activities. Most of the travel is planned in advance, however emergent issues from time-to-time have required responsive unplanned travel (e.g. for correction of trainer software related malfunctions that have been recently integrated at a training site). Additionally, occasionally, the team receives requirements to rapidly develop or expand the SubSkillsNet-VISIT product-line capabilities. When this occurs, it requires a re-ordering of priorities and work-item delivery schedules.</p>
<p>SUBSKILLSNET consists of a set of networked software applications that include, but are not limited to, the following workstation simulations: Radars, Fathometers, Electrically Suspended Gyro Navigator (ESGN) displays, Ring Laser Gyro Navigator (RLGN) displays, Global Positioning System (GPS), sonar control displays, dynamic bridge view (SurfCAT), optical periscopes and photonics imaging systems, AIS systems, Contact Evaluation Plot, and Ship's Data Displays. Additionally, SUBSKILLSNET includes a set of networked software applications that provide instructional capabilities consisting of: a scenario authoring tool (SubScript), an environment authoring tool (EDGE), a runtime scenario control application (RTS), an instructional exercise set-up and control tool (IC), and a student performance monitoring and feedback display system (PerfEval). SUBSKILLSNET also includes software interfaces to several external simulations, commercial navigation-related systems, and tactical trainers (e.g., SMMTT, LSMMTT, COAET, STVTS). The work to be executed under the follow on IDC will require the development of software products including additional simulations, displays, software interfaces and other functional capabilities. The newly developed products shall be required to run within the existing network of training products. VISIT consists of software capabilities that enable the display of spherical photographs, linking of the spherical photographs to the existing virtual tour software platform (so that they may be navigated by a user), linking of instructional media throughout the tours that may be accessed by the user, and spatial location and multiple choice test authoring and presentation capabilities. VISIT also consists of the software tools required to create and edit new tours. The current set of virtual tours includes: submarines, surface ships, and aircraft. The work to be executed under the IDC will require the development of additional functional capabilities of the virtual tour software and the development of virtual tours for additional platforms. Software development-related requirements such as product testing, hardware and software integration, hardware and software installation are some of the software applications that will be required under the IDC which will also include Contractor personnel travel. The list of software applications and related work above is not all-inclusive and additional requirements will be identified. NAWCTSD anticipates that all future SUBSKILLSNET and VISIT requirements for new training device software and trainer software modifications will be placed under the resulting IDC.</p>

<CONTACT>William Adams, Contract Specialist, Phone 301-492-3641, Email William.Adams@nrc.gov
<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION FOR HUMAN RESOURCES SOLUTIONS
<p>GENERAL INFORMATION</p>
<p>This is a Request for Information (RFI) to obtain information for planning purposes. This RFI is not a request for proposals; therefore, responses to this notice will not be considered offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a contract. Parties that respond to this RFI are advised that the NRC will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI; all cost associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the submitting party's expense. <br />PURPOSE</p>
<p>The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) seeks information to determine the commercial availability and technical capabilities of qualified responsible sources and/or Government Shared Service Providers that are currently capable of providing solutions for the work described here-in. The information that NRC gathers from this RFI and related market research is for planning purposes only and will be used to assist the NRC in planning its acquisition strategy.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The NRC, Office of the Chief Financial Officer (OCFO) is the current sponsor of the NRC's Human Resource Management System (HRMS). The customized commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) product from PeopleSoft that is currently used by NRC for this purpose is comprised of four modules: Human Resources (HR), Time and Labor (T&amp;L), Payroll, and Training Administration (TA). In November 2001, the NRC implemented the four PeopleSoft HRMS modules: HR, T&amp; L, Payroll, and TA. In 2002, the NRC planned to upgrade the 7.51 version of PeopleSoft to 8.3. However, as part of the President's Management Agenda to streamline common Federal payroll systems and processes referred to as e-Payroll, the NRC was directed to cross-service its payroll operations with the U.S. Department of the Interior (DOI)/National Business Center (NBC) using FPPS. As a result, NRC delayed the HRMS system upgrade and in November 2003, converted its HR and Payroll systems to FPPS located in Denver, Colorado and converted Training Administration to the U.S. Office of Personnel Management's (OPM) iLearn. Historical HR and Payroll data (i.e., data prior to November 2003) were not converted during the transition to FPPS. The historical information continues to be used to support business operations at the NRC. The current HRMS' primary use is to collect time, attendance, and labor data from approximately 4,600 personnel. HRMS is currently housing historical HR and Payroll data and official training records for all NRC employees.<br /><br />In 2005, the OCFO conducted two studies. The first study was to evaluate alternatives for T&amp;L and the second to ascertain if the current T&amp;L business process policy and procedures met the business needs of the agency. Both studies confirmed NRC's implementation of T&amp;L met programmatic needs for the agency. However, both studies confirmed that a customized COTS solution continued to best serve the agency in meeting its multiple uses for the information. T&amp;L information is used to compensate employees, to bill licensees, to recover costs from other Government agencies, to formulate and execute budgets, to manage project-level resources and analytics, and to support cost management practices and decision-making.</p>
<p>In 2007, a business process improvement effort for the integration of T&amp;L and fee billing processes, described process improvements that can only be supported by a custom COTS solution. NRC initiated a project to upgrade T&amp;L from PeopleSoft 7.5 to PeopleSoft Time and Labor 9.0 as an intermediary solution. Since then, the NRC&nbsp;is&nbsp;researching alternative solutions to managing a T&amp;L system in-house at NRC.</p>
<p><br />Questions for Respondents</p>
<p>In order for NRC to learn about current marketplace offerings and capabilities, NRC strongly encourages that parties respond in writing to the questions below. Please correlate the response to the question number.</p>
<p>1. What is your company with respect to NAICS code 541511 (i.e. "small" or "other than small")? If your organization is a small business, what type of small business (i.e. small disadvantaged business, woman-owned small business, economically disadvantaged woman-owned small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, 8(a), or HUBZone small business?) Specify all that apply.<br />2. Does your organization have experience implementing FISMA-compliant cloud computing solutions for&nbsp;the Federal Government ? If so, please so indicate and describe those contracts (contract number, contract type, contract value, description of supplies and services included in the scope, period of performance, etc.) and indicate your organization's role (prime contractor, first tier subcontractor, and/or supplier)<br />3. Does your company currently manufacture or resell product solutions (i.e,, hardware and/or software) for HR, T&amp; L, Payroll, and/or TA requirements? If so, please describe those solutions, including hardware, software, services, etc. and include commercial price list(s) or range of prices for those commercial offerings. These may be cloud-based or non-cloud-based solutions. If your company is a reseller for product solutions, then please indicate what those solutions are and provide commercial price list(s) or current range of prices for those commercial offerings.<br />4. Please indicate what commercial solutions (cloud or other) that you believe would be feasible and cost effective alternatives for NRC to consider, and why, to replace its current PeopleSoft&nbsp;HRMS solution for HR, T&amp; L, Payroll, and TA requirements. Provide supporting justification for your positions. In providing this assessment, please also disclose if your organization is a reseller for any of those solutions.<br />5. Does your company have experience with operating a helpdesk in support of a new system implementation? If yes, please explain that experience and address what process was used for issue tracking.<br />Indicate whether your company sells HR, T&amp; L, Payroll, and/or TA solutions on existing Federal Government contracts (i.e., GSA Federal Supply Schedule contract or a GWAC contract) that NRC could order from and, if so, provide the contract number(s) and indicate what is available for ordering frome each of those contracts.</p>

The Department of Veterans Affairs, Office of Construction and Facilities Management, is seeking interested firms that are classified under one or more of the following small business programs: (1) Section 8(a), (2) HUB Zone, (3) Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB), (4) Woman-Owned Small Business (WOSB), (5) Service-Disabled Veterans-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB), and/or (6) Veteran-Owned Small Business (VOSB). The interested firms shall be architects or architect/engineer firms with experience in the planning and design of renovating hospitals, large medical and significant outpatient/ambulatory care clinics, or similar complex healthcare projects and capable of preparing all design and construction documentation including, but not limited to, advance/master planning, site development, utility infrastructure design, local utility approval, architecture, medical planning, civil engineering, structural engineering including seismic design, mechanical engineering, historic preservation, environmental protection, communication and data engineering, electrical engineering, interior design, landscape design, commissioning, construction cost estimating and market research, parking and traffic studies, and geotechnical investigation and surveying.  The applicable North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) is 541310.

Scope:
This project will correct potentially hazardous seismic, life safety and infrastructure deficiencies, as well as consolidate outpatient programs and clinical research into a state of the art treatment facility located at the VA Sierra Nevada Health Care System's Reno campus.  The proposed project will accomplish renovation of approximately 90% of Building 1, with the exclusion of the major utility and life safety improvements which were completed within the last 3 years.  The proposed project would provide the following upgrades in Building 1 which is approximately 138,007 square feet.

1.  Seismic upgrades to reduce/eliminate the possibility of catastrophic failure of the 60+ year old building should a significant seismic event occur.
2.  Correct life safety and infrastructure deficiencies.
3.  Substantially improve building energy efficiencies.

In addition, this project will construct a 30,000 square foot clinical expansion to correct space deficiencies identified through the Capitol Asset Inventory and Strategic Capitol Investment Plan.  The Research Program would be increased by approximately 5,000 square feet as part of this project.  The following programs will be impacted and will benefit from the proposed project: Mental Health, Dental, Compensation and Pension,  Audiology, Patient Admissions and Testing, Surgical Service, Quality Management, Veterans Service Offices, Warehouse, Voluntary Services, Veterans Eligibility Center, Geriatrics and Extended Care, Dietetics, In-patient Kitchen, Morgue, Laboratory and Pathology Services, Research, Surgical Service, Medical Service, Ambulatory Care (Patient Centered Medical Home), OEF/OIF, and Women's Health Clinic.  The addition has been tentatively located at the east side of Building 12.  The exact location will be determined after all access and adjacencies have been analyzed by an Architect to determine the ideal location.

Seismic design will adhere to VA's manual for Seismic Design Requirements (H-18-8).  Space layout and interior partitioning will meet current VA Space Planning Guidelines and optimize patient care and staff efficiency.  Applicants must demonstrate success in sustainable design including prescribing the use of recovered materials, achieving waste reduction, along with water and energy efficiencies in design; and, in addition, the project will comply with the VA Sustainable Design and Energy Reduction Manual.  Mechanical, plumbing, electrical, nurse call, medical gases, and fire and safety systems will meet current codes and standards.  All structures and utilities will be designed to meet VA's criteria as detailed in its Physical Security Design Manual for VA Facilities, both Life-Safety Protected and Mission Critical Facilities.  The space will be in compliance with the Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards (UFAS) and PG-18-13 in all areas.  Required services will include preparation of schematics and design development plans, including all appropriate architectural and engineering disciplines, and a firm estimate of construction cost.

The campus is residentially landlocked with a limited footprint.
 
At this time it is anticipated that the seismic upgrade and expansion of Building 1, will follow the design-bid-build delivery method.  Once a thorough analysis of the user's and the facility's needs has been completed, the scope and method of meeting those needs may change and require a different design delivery method.

The contract may include options for: design development documents, construction documents, construction period services, site visits, and other professional services.

The completed project will be required to be LEED Silver certified.  Renewable energy systems will be required as part of this project.

Only firms, or teams, with in-house architectural services, recent experience in the design of contemporary, state-of-the-art medical facilities similar to that proposed will be considered.  Additional tasks may include site analysis and campus master plan.  Emphasis will be placed on cost and scope management capabilities and previous successful experience with construction and renovations of medical facilities, along with the proposed Quality Assurance/Quality Control procedures.   In addition, the firms or teams must demonstrate their ability to effectively utilize IFC version 2x-3 (or later) compliant parametric Building Information Modeling (BIM) system in developing this project from its initial conception through completion of documentation.  The team shall have the experience, ability, and data management skills to execute an integrated design approach using BIM technology.  Only architects or architect/engineer firms, or teams, demonstrating the above capabilities and a planned approach to perform contract services will be considered.  All VA design guides and requirements can be found online at:  http://www.cfm.va.gov/TIL/. 

In addition to design capabilities, estimating capabilities of the applicants will be considered.  An estimate of construction cost based on level of design detail will be required at each design phase.  The selected team shall design to the government's estimated cost for construction.

Applicants must have an established working office within 150 miles of Reno, Nevada and be of sufficient size and experience to accomplish the work, and be licensed in the State of Nevada.  Preference will be given to firms with working offices capable of performing all design work within 150 miles of the VA Sierra Nevada Healthcare System, 1000 Locust Street, Reno, Nevada 89502.  Office site visits to verify location and capacity may be performed.

All interested firms responses should include the following information: 1. Company Name, 2. Address, 3. Point of Contact, 4. Phone number and e-mail address, 5. Business size determination and qualifying Small Business status, 6. Certification of Small business Status, 7.

<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION. NO SOLICITATION IS BEING ISSUED AT THIS TIME. REQUESTS FOR A SOLICITATION WILL NOT RECEIVE A RESPONSE.
<p>The objective of this Request for Information (RFI) to industry is for recommendations to maximize production throughput and reduce costs at Oklahoma City Air Logistics Center (OC-ALC) for the General Electric line of engines. It is for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation, nor is it to be construed as a commitment by the Government. Any resulting procurement action will be the subject of a separate, future announcement. The following information is provided for discussion purposes and any potential strategy for this acquisition may change prior to any solicitation release.</p>
<p>Specifically, OC-ALC is interested in industry supply chain strategies to fill in the gaps we currently experience within the USAF supply system by considering supply-chain options both (a) inside and (b) outside the government sources of supply.</p>
<p>Additionally, OC-ALC is looking for approaches to support a steady monthly production target comprising a mix of both scheduled and unscheduled overhaul/repair. These approaches need to address both (a) scheduled output and (b) goals to reduce material costs.</p>
<p>Submittals should address the following production quantity scenarios for engine Type Maintenance Series (TMS) per year:</p>
<p>F101 - 200<br />F108 - 120<br />F110 - 50<br />F118 - 5</p>
<p>Interested parties should provide a brief written response and description of potential approaches for review by the Government 30 days from date of issuance of this RFI.</p>
<p>Any information submitted by respondents to this RFI is strictly voluntary. This RFI does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an Invitation for Bids (IFB), nor does its issuance restrict the Government's ultimate acquisition approach. The Government will neither award a contract solely on the basis of this notice, nor pay for any information that is submitted by respondents to this RFI.</p>
<p>Please note that the Government does NOT intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or to otherwise pay for the information requested.<br /><br />Request a response by COB (1600 CST) 16 March, 2011 to the Contracting Officer, who can be reached at email: alan.lee@tinker.af.mil or phone: (405)734-6644.

The specific version of this radio being requested by the SNPLI team features a custom Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) l28-bit cryptographic co-processor that is required for the technology development activity resident to the team.<BR><BR>2. A demonstration that the proposed contractor is the only source available to provide these services or goods (i.e. unique qualifications, proprietary rights, etc.): <BR><BR>Raytheon-Thales Tactical Communications Systems West (TCS-West) is the only manufacturer and reseller of the RTC-I922 (C) (G) and specific ancillaries. This RTC-1922 (C) (G) is a fielded item and no other substitute is available. The AES cryptographic co-processor is specific to this unit and unavailable from other variants within the EPLRS family of radios.<BR><BR>3. A description of the market research that was conducted and the results, or a statement of the reason a market research was not conducted:<BR><BR>The RTC-I922 (C) (G) with the AES cryptographic co-processor is the software defined radio that is compatible with the developmental Soldier systems that the SNPLI team has developed. Any other variant within the EPLRS family of radios is not compatible with the network topology and data exchange format generated by the SNPLI Developmental Systems.<BR><BR><BR>4. Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition:<BR><BR>The RTC-1922 (C) (G) with the AES cryptographic co-processor has been extensively tested by CERDEC and other developmental organization. It is the current defined baseline communication solution for the Nett Warrior Program of Record. The AES cryptographic co-processor allows maximum flexibility and compatibility with SNPLI data formats and will support our experimental and demonstration schedule. Any other product will put successful experimentation and demonstration at risk jeopardizing this team's ability to transition effective and reliable components.<BR><BR>5. A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required: <BR><BR>None<BR><BR>6.

<DESC>Introduction:  Pursuant to FAR Subpart 13.106-1(b)(1), the U.S. Army RDECOM Contracting Center, Natick Contracting Division, on behalf of the US Army  Warfighter Science, Technology and Applied Research Directorate (WARSTAR), intends to award a firm fixed price purchase order on a sole source basis to: Faro Technologies, Inc., Lake Mary, FL 32746.<BR><BR><BR>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS. <BR><BR>RESPONSES WILL BE RECEIVED FOR FUTURE REQUIREMENT CONSIDERATION ONLY.<BR><BR>NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENT IS AVAILABLE. <BR> <BR>1. Nature and description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs: <BR><BR>Team at NSRDEC is in need of a high-quality computer aided measurement system that will calculate basic geometric and GD& T measurements and compare complex geometry, surfaces, and feature positions to nominal data with consistent results and reporting functionality using a measurement arm. The Biomechanics Team is currently using a Faro Technology Advantage Arm measurement arm that has been on short term loan from Right Patterson AFB. The Biomechanics Team has already purchased and completed training on the Faro CAM2 Q Software (Faro Technology, Inc.) to run this equipment. In order to continue and complete the current work as required for the Heads-Up ATO the biomechanics team will need to purchase the FaroArm Platinum measurement arm and required attachments that are compatible with the Faro CAM2 Q software to replace the on-loan equipment that is being returned to Patterson AFB.<BR><BR>Faro Technologies Inc. located in Lake Mary, FL produces the FaroArm measuring equipment. FaroArm models offer 6 or 7 axes of rotation, the FaroArm is as accurate as large, expensive fixed-bed CMMs, but it is portable and much easier to use. The flexibility of the FaroArm enables it to tackle multiple applications under one roof, allowing for quality improvements across all processes resulting in time and production costs savings. The FaroArm Platinum's high accuracy renders traditional CMMs, hand tools and other portable inspection equipment obsolete. The FaroArm allows for inspection, reverse engineering or performing CAD-to-Part-analysis on parts, fixtures and assemblies with extremely high precision (Specifications: Accuracy  O.029mm, 7-Axis, 6-Degrees-of-Freedom Probe, Adaptable 3D Measurement Technology Composite Material Construction). In addition, the FaroArm system is lightweight and portable, enabling users to collect data from Soldiers equipment off-site. A large support network exists for FaroArm users. This network includes online forums hosted by Faro Technology and administrated by their employees.<BR><BR>2. A demonstration that the proposed contractor is the only source available to provide these services or goods (i.e. unique qualifications, proprietary rights, etc.): <BR><BR>Faro Technology is the sole developer and US distributor of the FaroArm and Faro CAM2 Q software. Faro Technology Inc. is a preferred source among researchers for precise measurement of equipment and is an industry leader. Faro Technology Inc. offers users high- quality, low-cost, user- friendly, and widely-supported hardware and software for academia and industrial uses. Faro Technology Inc. personnel have experience with working with USAF researchers at Wright Patterson Air Force base and have developed customized software and hardware applications that NSRDEC engineers and scientists will be using. This results in a user support network that understands the user's research needs and intentions for FaroArm devices.<BR><BR>3. A description of the market research that was conducted and the results, or a statement of the reason a market research was not conducted:<BR><BR>Online and phone-based research determined that Faro Technology Inc. is the sole provider of the FaroArm hardware system and CAM2 Q software for domestic customers. If NSRDEC were to purchase the FaroArm hardware system the only purchasing option would be Faro Technologies Inc. Other portable lab based measurement systems were ruled out as alternatives to the FaroArm system due to the CAM2 Q Software compatibility that NSRDEC currently owns and uses. The application, expandability, and portability of the FaroArm measurement device integrates' optimally with the NSRDEC Biomechanics Lab center of mass and moment of inertial equipment and requirements currently being implemented in Soldier research.<BR><BR>4. Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition:<BR><BR>Additionally, future planning for research using the 3-D Scanning attachment is currently underway. Faro Technologies Inc. has a wide array of equipment attachments that will fulfill future requirements and research needs. This Faro Technology equipment will allow the NSRDEC Biomechanics lab to be the leading center within the US Army for human mechanical measurements and equipment interface measurements for the Warfighter.<BR><BR>5. A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required: <BR><BR>None<BR><BR>6.

<SUBJECT>This is an amendment to a previously synopsized requirement to change the response date from 02/23/11 to 02/28/11 - - Notice of intent to award non-competitive contract for one base year plus four option years to the City of Port Angeles.

<DESC>In accordance with FAR 6.302 and 5.2, this notice advertises the government's intent to award a non-competitive contract to the City of Port Angeles, Peninsula Communications Service (PENCOM) for one base year plus four option years at firm-fixed prices per year.  PENCOM provides Olympic National Park after-hours dispatch/emergency communications service per the Memorandum of Understanding signed in 2004, still in effect.  PENCOM provides service during the block of time when the Olympic National Park dispatch/communications office is closed.  Olympic National Park lacks its own staff, funding, and other resources necessary to maintain its own 24-hour emergency communications operation.
Comments and questions regarding this announcement may be directed to Phaedra Fuller, Contracting Officer, at phaedra_fuller@nps.gov.  All comments received before February 28, 2011 will be considered.  

JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION for SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITIONS OVER $3,000 AND UP TO $100,000  (See FAR 13.106-1)
Date:   01/24/2011      Requisition Number: R9506110001
1.  NATURE AND/OR DESCRIPTION OF THE ITEM/SERVICE BEING PROCURED AND ITS INTENDED USE (INCLUDE ANTICIPATED COST):  Non-competitive award (base year + four option years) to the City of Port Angeles, for the purpose of paying quarterly invoices for PENCOM services, in effect from 01/01/11 to 09/30/15 (3 quarters in base year FY11, and 4 quarters per year for option years FY12 - FY15).   The after-hours dispatch service provided by the City of Port Angeles is unique because the service is provided through a network called PENCOM, which is a 24-hour emergency communications service; a division of the Port Angeles Police Department and operates under the direction of the Chief of Police.  FY11 cost is $25,500 plus $34,000 for each option year from FY12-FY15.  The aggregate total cost for five years is $161,500.
2.  SOLE SOURCE JUSTIFICATION RATIONALE (CHECK ONE AND EXPLAIN BELOW): __x___	Only one responsible source. ______	Urgent and compelling circumstances exist. Include critical delivery or performance dates, and when you became aware of the requirement.  Provide a specific statement of the impact on Government operations, financial or otherwise, if the required delivery or performance dates are not met. ______ Other  __________________________________
EXPLAIN:  41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) AND FAR 6.302-1 ONLY ONE RESPONSIBLE SOURCE AND NO OTHER SUPPLIES OR SERVICES WILL SATISFY AGENCY REQUIREMENTS:  PENCOM is funded by most of the law enforcement, fire, and emergency service agencies in Clallam County, Washington, and these agencies make up an advisory board which helps guide the operation of PENCOM.  The 16 member agencies are City of Port Angeles Fire and Police, the Clallam County Sheriff, City of Sequim Police, Fire Districts 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, Lower Elwha Tribal Police, City of Forks Police, La Push Police, Jamestown Fish and Game, Forks Ambulance, Olympic Ambulance, and Olympic National Park.  No private sector entity or other public safety dispatch operations are available to provide equivalent services.  
A Memorandum of Understanding was signed in 2004 by the city of Port Angeles, Clallam County, city of Sequim, Clallam County Rural Fire Department, Lower Elwha Klallam Tribe, Quileute Tribe, and the National Park Service/Olympic National Park (OLYM).  The agreement is still valid.  Each party pays a portion of cost for receipt of PENCOM services.  Annual cost for OLYM is determined by a PENCOM funding formula, which states "Olympic National Park's fee is charged at the same rate as the lowest paying law enforcement member, but in no case lower than $10,000."  
In accordance with the formula, "The number of full time sworn officers for each Member is multiplied by $2,000 for a base amount. These numbers are then totaled and subtracted from the police share of the overall budget.  The total is then divided further based on the percentage of calls for service for those agencies that use PENCOM's full services, including the records management system.  The base amount is added to the percentage amount for a grand total for each member."   Between 2006 and 2010, OLYM paid $10,000 annually.  On January 1, 2011, PENCOM raised OLYM's annual rate to $34,000.  Using the formula, OLYM's share for fiscal year 2011 is $25,500 ($8,500 per quarter for quarters 2, 3, and 4, from January 2011 to September 2011).  OLYM has fiscal year 2011 funds available (to be awarded as the "base year") in the amount of $25,500.  
The annual cost for fiscal years 2012 through 2015, which will be awarded as option years, will remain fixed in the amount of $34,000 (equal to 4 quarters at $8,500 per quarter each option year).  The total price for the base year plus four option years is $161,500.  Funds will be obligated in accordance with Principles of Federal Appropriations Law (Red Book), one fiscal year at a time.
PENCOM has fifteen communications officers, three supervisors, one communications manager, two IT/computer staff, and one warrant/restraining entry program support staff.  PENCOM covers 911 "dispatch" with a minimum of three communications officers (public safety dispatchers) on duty 14 hours a day, 7 days a week.  If OLYM were to provide its own after-hours dispatch service, it would require running the same type of 24-hour operation, hiring an additional 2.5 FTE of GS-06 dispatchers at a salary (no benefits) of $30,600 per FTE.  Salary alone would cost OLYM approximately $75,000 annually.  The total estimate, including salary, benefits, additional utilities, support costs, training to keep up certifications, etc. is approximately $90,000 to $100,000 annually.  PENCOM's annual cost of $25,500 for FY11, and $34,000 annually for FY12 - FY15, when compared to what OLYM would spend performing the service in-house, is considered to be fair and reasonable.
3.  MARKET RESEARCH.  Please explain the results or why one was not performed. State whether any other offers were received or anyone expressed interest:   Market research was not conducted because the City of Port Angeles is the only entity set up to provide PENCOM services.  PENCOM is networked to several county, state, federal, and Native American entities, and no equivalent system or network exists in the private sector or by a single federal agency.    
4.  IF THIS IS A DETERMINATION FOR SOLE SOURCE, THE CONTRACTING OFFICER CERTIFIES:     a.  Only one source is available, or urgent and compelling circumstances exist.     b.  The anticipated price will be determined fair and reasonable using the price analysis techniques described in      FAR Part 13.106-3(a).

<DESC>1. INTRODUCTION <br />The Avionics Department (AIR-4.5) is soliciting technical/cost proposals for research and development support in technologies that are applicable to Communications Relay, Electro-Optical (EO), Radio Frequency (RF), Acoustic Sensors, Manned and Unmanned Airborne Payloads, Persistent Surveillance Technologies, Unattended Ground Sensors (UGS), and Special Sensor Systems for Navy Aircraft and Unmanned Air Vehicles (UAVs). Technologies proposed should emphasize rapid development, Test and Evaluation (T&amp;E), and technology insertion to the warfighter.
<p>2. BACKGROUND <br />The Avionics Department (AIR-4.5) develops advanced sensors (Acoustics, EO, Radar, Magnetics, and other special sensors) and systems.

<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11.5pt">The requirement is for hydrostatic testing and refilling of medical oxygen bottles. The bottles shall be hydrostatically tested as per Department of Transportation (DOT) requirements by an appropriate testing facility to ensure integrity of each bottle. Integrity means the cylinder can safely hold the maximum fill pressure. There are two types of bottles that need to be tested and refilled. The larger type bottles (H) are at a pressure of 2000 psig and contains 6910 liters 244 cubic feet of gas. The smaller type bottles (D) are at a pressure of 2000 psig and contain 425 liters 15 cubic feet of gas. The pressure ratings are normally the same for different types of gases but this requirement is for medical oxygen only. Oxygen cylinders are marked to designate the type of cylinder, maximum fill pressure, hydrostatic test date, inspector, and manufacturer. The markings are normally stamped into the shoulder of the cylinder. The hydrostatic test date and inspector mark indicate when the cylinder was last tested and who tested the cylinder. If the shoulder of a cylinder is already full of markings and there is no space to stamp new information, the vendor has permission to peen out the prior stampings. The bottles after being tested satisfactory and stamped with appropriate DOT markings shall be refilled with medical grade oxygen to the bottles rated pressures and returned to the Medical treatment Facility (MTF). If a cylinder fails hydrostatic testing, the vendor will return it to the MTF which will then process it for disposal via the Defense Reutilization Marketing Office (DRMO). This requirement is for testing and refill of 496 "H" cylinders and 212 "D" cylinders, all of which are the property of the MTF. All cylinders are made of steel and are required to be hydro tested every 5 years. When the vendor is selected, they need to notify the MTF three days before the scheduled pick-up date. This will allow the MTF to collect the bottles, palletize them, and crane them to the platform where the vendor will load them to their truck. All the bottles can be offloaded and picked up at one time or done in two or more batches as long as the vendor coordinates schedule with the customer. This is a critical requirement and all cylinders must be tested, refilled, and returned to the MTF no later than 04 March 2011.</span></p>

<DESC>The purpose of this RFP is to identify and evaluate the potential of candidate nanotechnologies to significantly improve the therapeutic index, bioavailability, solubility, and/or pharmacokinetics of otherwise failed anti-cancer agents. Specifically, any subcontract awarded under this RFP is intended to fund nanotechnology delivery systems which will allow for re-examining anti-cancer drugs which could not otherwise be delivered in free form due to their excessive toxicity, poor oral bioavailability, poor solubility in biological fluids, inappropriate pharmacokinetics, and lack of efficacy within a tolerable dose range. The purpose of this RFP is NOT to fund basic research on nanoplatform development nor is it intended to fund the new synthesis approach to failed anti-cancer compounds.
<p>If the drug can currently be administered to humans in free form and the properties of drug-nanoparticle construct provide only an incremental improvement over the free drug delivery, then the drug-nanoparticle construct is not of interest to NCI and SAIC-Frederick. If, however, the delivery of the drug-nanoparticle construct results in a significant improvement in properties over the free drug, then NCI and SAIC-Frederick would be interested in the drug-nanoparticle construct. If the drug can not currently be administered to humans in free form and the drug-nanoparticle construct mitigates the unacceptable properties of the drug allowing the drug to be re-evaluated as an anti-cancer agent, then NCI and SAIC-Frederick would be very interested in the drug-nanoparticle construct.</p>

NITC has a requirement to host, deploy and sustain an array of Enterprise Business Systems that will be utilized throughout various Navy Organizations to include all NAVFAC sites, all Navy Regions, the Marine Corps, and select private business partners.
  This procurement is in support of NITCs mission to meet this requirement.  



FAR 8.405-6(a) (2) is titled Limited sources justification and approval and states:
(a) Orders placed under Federal Supply Schedules are exempt from the requirements in Part 6. However, an ordering activity must justify its action when restricting consideration
(2) To an item peculiar to one manufacturer (e.g., a particular brand name, product, or a feature of a product, peculiar to one manufacturer). A brand name item, whether available on one or more schedule contracts, is an item peculiar to one manufacturer. Brand name specifications shall not be used unless the particular brand name, product, or feature is essential to the Governments requirements, and market research indicates other companies similar products, or products lacking the particular feature, do not meet, or cannot be modified to meet, the agencys need.
NAVFAC has a requirement to Common Access Card (CAC) enable all existing Citrix applications hosted at NITC.
  In order to meet NAVFACs requirements, NITC must upgrade existing Citrix Licenses to Platinum Edition.  This is a license upgrade to existing software. No new software will be added.  The license upgrade will allow NITC to use additional features of the existing Citrix software.  Since the requirement is to CAC enable an existing product, no other products can meet the governments needs.


The NAICS Code for this procurement is 541519

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />FAX: 202.475.3904 <br />.372.3695</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />FAX: 202.475.3904 <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695</p>

52.233-4703	 AMC-LEVEL PROTEST PROGRAM	05/01/2004
If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible contracting officer.  However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the General Accounting Office or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103.  If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

The Contractor shall install appropriate size rock on each culvert face or adjacent slopes to reduce future erosion potential. Trans-located rock obtained on-site may be used for this activity.  During any activities utilizing trans-located rock, extreme caution should be exercised to avoid damage to the natural stream channel and its habitat.  If rock retrieval from the downstream channel is determined likely to adversely impact habitat within the stream channel or addition rock is required, the Contractor shall obtain new rock from an off-installation quarry.  <BR><BR>11.  The Contractor shall deposit the existing culvert at a location to be designated by the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) during final staking.  The Government will be responsible for final deposition of the culvert.<BR><BR>12.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'; COLOR: red; FONT-SIZE: 11pt">Disregard.&nbsp; This instruction was first incorporated due to the possibility of the intended award having option periods.&nbsp; However, there will be options requested at this time.</span></p>

<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'; FONT-SIZE: 11pt">3-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Page 4, Section B.2,&nbsp; CLIN004 states that "the Contractor will build search indexes based on the metadata and OCRed provided by LoC and the contractor".</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'; COLOR: red; FONT-SIZE: 11pt">In order to clarify the prime contractor's role on providing metadata and OCRed text as related to CLIN004, the LoC is not holding the contractor responsible for the metadata and OCRed text.&nbsp; The Library of congress will provide the necessary inputs.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'; COLOR: red; FONT-SIZE: 11pt">a.

<CONTACT>Tanisha Contee, Contract Specialist, Phone  , Email tanisha.l.contee@census.gov
<DESC>The U.S. Census Bureau intends to procure services (maintenance renewal) needed for Tandberg and Gold TMS maintenance agreement. The maintenance and support will be for a period of October 1, 2010 through September 30, 2011. Please see the services listed below. All responsible sources that can provide the services and meet the detailed requirements, may respond to this solicitation by submitting a quote to <a href="mailto:Tanisha.L.Contee@Census.gov">Tanisha.L.Contee@Census.gov</a>. Phone calls will not be honored. &nbsp;Award will be made by Government Purchase Order. Written responses should be received within 15 days from the publication of this synopsis. Closing date and time for receipt of quotes will be on February 19, 2011, 9:00 am Eastern time. <br /><br />***QUESTIONS &amp; ANSWERS***<br /><br />
<p>1. Is the requirement just for the renewal purchase of these Tandberg<br />contracts? In other words, will no other service and support be required<br />from the vendor such as phone support, level 1 response to issues, onsite<br />visits etc.<br /><br />Answer - No we are the engineer on-site and handle ALL issues. This is just so we have coverage on the Endpoints for upgrades, and RMA's if something fails.<br />Something we are currently running without on a few CORE components to our<br />VTC infrastructure.</p>
<p>2. The quantity of 1000 MXP units is listed as 5 yet there are only 4<br />serial numbers listed. Is this a mistake in the count or is a serial number<br />missing? <br /><br />Answer - 13A30820</p>
<p>3.

<DESC>As of 2/15/2011, The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), contemplates awarding, on a sole source basis, a firm-fixed price contract in accordance with FAR Part 15 for the storage and rotation of Pfizer's pediatric vaccines to be used as a national stockpile. CDC has purchased vaccines under a separate supply contract or delivery order, and the Contractor shall provide storage of the same at Contractor furnished sites. Justification for other than full and open competition is considered to be in the government's best interest due to the fact that Pfizer is the only company which has exclusive full capabilities to store and rotate the vaccines that Pfizer manufactures. The rotation aspect of this requirement is what really makes this procurement a sole source for the Manufacturer. The Federal Drug Administration's (FDA) website confirms that Pfizer remains the only manufacturer of Prevnar13&reg; also known as Pneumococcal 13-valent Conjugate Vaccine (Diphtheria CRM197 Protein), which is licensed by the FDA for immunization and distribution in the United States. Note 22 applies herein. The statutory authority permitting other-than-full-and-open competition is 41 U.S.C., 253(c)(1): FAR 6.302-1. Only one responsible qualified large business and no other sources will satisfy agency requirements. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement. This notice is not a request for competitive proposals. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract will be based on responses to this notice and is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will be considered solely for informational purposes. Additional quantities of vaccines acquired under preceding or succeeding separate supply contracts or delivery orders may be added to the stockpile by modification to this contract. Material will be held at the contractor furnished storage site for subsequent delivery as required by the contract. The storage site shall be located at one or more domestic facility (i.e.) that is/are controlled by the Contractor. The Contractor shall only store the product in filled, labeled, ready-to-use containers in the stockpile. Pfizer Pharmaceuticals, 33 Morehall Road, Malvern, PA 19355-1759. All questions or concerns about this Synopsis shall be submitted via e-mail to Gary Morgan at gmorgan1@cdc.gov. No solicitation package will be available or posted at this site for downloading. Consider this the only public notification issued. This buy is under classification code 68 with 1 base year and 4 option years. No telephone requests for more information will be accepted. The associated NAICS codes is 325412. The size standard is 750 employees. Offers will be due 3/2/2011 by 11:00 A.M. EST at Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; Procurements and Grants Office; Attn: Gary Morgan ; 2920 Brandywine Road, M/S K71, Suite 3629 Atlanta, GA 30341. Offers will be accepted by e-mail.

<DESC><p>The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) is hosting a Pre-Solicitation Conference in support of the Corporate Investments Department's (CID) Investment Risk Management System (IRMS), scheduled for <strong>Thursday, March 3, 2011 at the PBGC Headquarters, 1200 K Street, NW, Washington, DC 20005-4026.</strong> Registration will begin at 1:00 pm to 1:25 pm. The conference will start promptly at 1:30 pm and conclude at 3:30 pm (Eastern Standard Time).</p>
<p>The IRMS will be an externally hosted, web-based system that is secure, reliable, flexible, and easy-to-use. It must provide the capability to measure, report, and manage absolute investment risk (e.g., standard deviation, value-at-risk, et al) and relative investment risk (e.g., beta, tracking risk, et al) of the entire PBGC investment program and its various components including, but not limited to, asset classes, portfolios, and investment securities. The IRMS must relate investment risk to corresponding investment returns and report risk-adjusted investment performance and various statistical measures commonly used to characterize such performance. It must also have look-through capability to determine and report total exposure to a security, group of securities, industry, country, currency, or other common factor, and properly account for fixed income, public equities, and private market assets.</p>
<p>The primary objective of the pre-solicitation conference is to educate vendors now considering a submission about achieving compliance with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and that one of the evaluation factors will entail a Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) of 2002 Security Requirement.</p>
<p>Per the FISMA security requirement, offeror's technical proposal shall be evaluated on their ability to meet PBGC Security Requirements as outlined in the Statement of Objectives, attachment entitled, "Information Security &amp; Privacy Contract Requirements." The Offeror will be evaluated on their self assessment of current security controls, supporting justification, and the approach/plan to implement the required controls during the Implementation/Operational Phases.</p>
<p>A secondary objective of the pre-solicitation conference is to provide a high level review of the Statement of Objective (SOO) draft (inclusive of attached Questionnaire and Mandatory Requirements documentation).</p>
<p>This forum will better communicate CID and the Office of Information Technology's requirements and increase competition by sharing information.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>RSVP and Questions Submission<br /><br /></strong></span>Attendees are required to RSVP to Patricia Page, Senior Contract Specialist at page.patricia@pbgc.gov and copy Patrick McFarlane, Contracting Officer at mcfarlane.patrick@pbgc.gov with company's name, attendee, business size, email address, business address, and attendance preference by <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Monday, February 28, 2011 at 9:00am.</span></strong> A firm may participate either at the PBGC Headquarters' location or by audio teleconference. Firms are limited to two representatives for attendance at the conference and one bridge line for teleconference attendance per company. Teleconference number will be provided in response to RSVP.</p>

<SUBJECT>Identification of Benthic Macroinvertebrates
<SOLNBR>WC133R-11-RQ-0312
<RESPDATE>031411
<CONTACT>Shelley Smith, Contracting Specialist, Phone 816-426-2066, Fax 816-274-6993, Email shelley.smith@noaa.gov
<DESC>Amendment Details:&nbsp; The scope was changed from 410 specimens to 410 samples.<br /><br />This is a pre-solicitation for services to identify Benthic Macroinvertebrates from Lake Ontario and Musekgon Lake for the Great Lakes Environmental Laboratory (GLERL) in Ann Arbor, MI.
<p><br />Benthic macroinvertebrate populations have long been used to monitor the relative health of Great Lakes ecosystems. Community changes integrate and reflect relative impacts of various perturbations, including nutrient enrichment and invasive species. Currently, populations in Lake Ontario are undergoing extensive changes that are unprecedented in both spatial extent and temporal scale.</p>
<p>Scope: GLERL will provide the contractor a total of 410 <span style="text-decoration: underline;">samples</span> of Oligochaeta and Chironomidae. The specimens of Oligochaeta and Chironomidae will be mounted on glass slides. The contractor will identify the organisms to the genus or species level.</p>
<p>Objectives: The goal of the contract is to get organism with the two groups Oligochaeta and Chironomidae identified to the species level. GLERL will then count and tabulate the species in each sample and analyze changes in species composition over time and space.</p>
<p>Tasks: GLERL will provide the contractor with organisms after they have been placed in glyerine and mounted on slides under coverslips. Prior to this, organism lengths have been traced on sheets under low magnification using a camera lucida mounted on a microscope. The contractor will identify each organism to species (or genus) under high magnification and place an identification code next to each tracing on the sheet. All transfers of mounted organisms and sheets with the traced lengths will be accomplished hand-to-hand. The government will pre-arrange a method of transporting the material. Extreme care in organism transfer and exchange is important since once the organisms are mounted and traced, the slides must not be jostled or the organisms will move and their position on the slide will no longer correspond to their tracing on the sheets.</p>
<p>Period of Performance: 18 months from date of award.</p>
<p>Required Technical Expertise:<br />&bull; A minimum of 10 years of experience in identifying species of Oligochaeta and Chironomidae collected from Great Lakes sediments<br />&bull; A minimum of 10 years of experience in the preparation of benthic invertebrates for the identification of Oligochaeta and Chironomidae gained from a combination of graduate school or experience <br />&bull; Demonstrated ability to operate and calibrate microscopes and to use taxonomic texts Demonstrated ability to identify Oligochaeta and Chironomidae organisms to the genus or species level</p>
<p>This is a small business set aside. The NAICS code for this action is 541620. The government intends to procure services using FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures. A copy of the Request for Quote will be issued on or about February 25, 2011 and will be uploaded to this announcement. An e-mail may be sent to shelley.smith@noaa.gov after this issue date to request a copy of the Request For Quote by e-mail.</p>
<p>The government requires all contractors doing business with the government to be registered with the Central Contractor Registry (CCR). For additional information and to register in CCR, please access the following website: http://www.ccr.gov. In order to register with CCR and to be eligible to receive an award, all offerors must have a Dun &amp; Bradstreet number, which may be acquired free of charge by contacting Dun &amp; Bradstreet on line at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform or by phone at 1-866-705-5711. The government encourages all contractors to submit their Representations and Certifications on-line Business Partner Network (BPN) at https://orca.bpn.gov. The BPN is the single source for vendor data for the federal government. Award will not be made to any contractor that is not registered in CCR.</p>

<DESC>This contract action was not awarded as a fixed price type because uncertainties involved in contract performance did not permit costs to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed price contract. As such, a cost-reimbursement type action was awarded (FAR 16.301-2).<br><br>The mission of the Department of Defense's (DOD's) Medical Chemical Defense Program as executed by the U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command and the Chemical Biological Medical Systems Joint Project Management Office is to protect the soldier against any chemical threat requiring a medical response.  One of the major responsibilities is establishing and maintaining an effective medical chemical defense posture for our Armed Forces to augment the DOD in-house scientific endeavors by improving the survivability of soldiers in chemically-contaminated environments.  A Request for Proposal (RFP) will be issued to solicit a Contractor to answer and validate applied and developmental biomedical questions critical to providing medical countermeasures against existing chemical warfare agents and emerging threats.  The RFP work statement requires writing study protocols and conducting tests for potential decontamination and protective systems, as well as antidotal and therapeutic compounds against chemical agent contamination.  Studies will involve in vivo and vitro experiments, animal models, alternatives to animal models, and comprehensive bench top procedures utilizing chemical surety materials (CSM)  RDT&E dilute solutions of CSM, and other hazardous chemicals.  Protocols, studies, and reports shall comply with Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) guidelines, the Army Standards Surety Clauses for use of Chemical Agents at Contractor-Owned/Contractor-Operated (COCO) Facilities as required by Army Regulation AR 50-6 Chemical Surety, and other applicable U.S. Government regulations.  This requirement is follow-on to Contract No. W81XWH-05-D-0001 with Battelle Memorial Institute.  Upon award of the new contract, the resultant contractor must be able to conduct multiple tasks simultaneously and adjust to rapidly changing priorities.  The Government plans to award a three-year indefinite-delivery (cost reimbursement plus fixed fee) contract with a provision for two one-year options.  Work will be assigned through individual task orders.  RFP No. W81XWH-10-R-0001 is planned for release approximately April 2010.  A copy of the full solicitation will be posted to the following URL:  http://www.usamraa.army.mil.  The solicitation and any applicable solicitation amendments will be available only at this URL.  HARD COPIES OF THE SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE PROVIDED.  The responsibility lies with all interested parties to check the above address frequently for any posted changes to the solicitation.  Telephonic requests will NOT be honored.  Proposals are due 45 days after issue date.  This acquisition is unrestricted.

The contract will be awarded to Silicon Graphics International, 46600 Landing Parkway, Fremont, CA 94538. Market research was previously conducted and it has been determined this is a sole source requirement IAW FAR 6.302-1.
<p>This is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation is available. All interested sources must respond in writing with clear and convincing evidence to support their ability to provide timely and effective services within three (3) days of this publication. A determination by the Government not to compete this action based on responses received is solely within the discretion of the Government.<br /><br />Line items are as follows:<br />CLIN 0001 SGI Support and Renewal</p>
<p>Authority: 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), Justification: Supplies (or Services) required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source(s) and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.</p>
<p>Market Research indicated no other vendor can provide such maintenance due to the proprietary nature of the product and the vendor's restriction of third-party maintenance. Mr. Howard E. Marks Jr, ASC/AE, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH, 45433, has been appointed as Ombudsman to hear concerns from offerors, or potential offerors, during the proposal development. The purpose of the Ombudsman is to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. Existence of the Ombudsman does not diminish the authority of the program director or the contracting officer. Accordingly, the Ombudsman does not participate in the preparation of solicitations, the evaluation of proposals or the source selection process and, therefore, for routine matters on individual solicitations, please contact the buyer at the telephone number listed herein. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. Should you desire to contact the Ombudsman, Mr. Marks can be reached at (937) 255-8642, e-mail: howard.marks@wpafb.af.mil. Any questions regarding this acquisition should be directed to the Contract Negotiator, Daniel Staloch at (937) 656-7373 or e-mail: Daniel.staloch@wpafb.af.mil.</p>

<DESC>The objective of the Integrity and<br />Reliability of Integrated Circuit&sect; (IRIS) program is to develop the technology to derive<br />the functionality of an integrated circuit (IC) to determine unambiguously if malicious<br />modifications have been made to that IC, and to accurately determine the IC's useful<br />lifespan from a physical perspective. The IRIS program seeks to develop nondestructive,<br />scientifically based techniques for full functionality identification and functionality<br />modification detection for ICs utilized in military systems. IRIS also seeks to develop<br />innovative test technologies and processes that can determine an IC's useful lifespan<br />based on a significantly reduced number of samples. Once developed, the resulting<br />technology may be deployed to Government or appropriate organizations that can<br />provide critical IC functionality and reliability inspection services to the DoD, thereby<br />ensuring that a scientific means is available to determine functionality and reliability in<br />the various ICs deployed in DoD systems.
