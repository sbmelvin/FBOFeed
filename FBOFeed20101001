<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">The ESB will be an approximately 145,000 gross square feet (gsf) four-story facility (one story below grade) with a mechanical penthouse and approximately 46,000 asf of 21<sup>st</sup> Century laboratory space.<span>&nbsp; </span>The other areas of the building include:</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">A number of the ESB spaces will house very sensitive equipment that require the most stringent criteria for controlling such factors as vibration and electro-magnetic interference.<span>&nbsp; </span>The construction of the ESB will support these criteria.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">Safety is of paramount importance in the construction and operation of the ESB.<span>&nbsp; </span>The ESB Project Team is dedicated to a construction safety goal of zero lost workday cases.<span>&nbsp; </span>Safe work practices will be integrated into all aspects of the construction process.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">Due to the specialized nature of the facility, and the fact that proper construction phase implementation is fundamental to the mission of the facility, Argonne will implement a prequalification process to ensure invited general contractors have the requisite capabilities and experience, as determined by Argonne.<span>&nbsp; </span>A key focus of Argonne&rsquo;s evaluation will be a contractor&rsquo;s track record of successfully completing projects similar to the ESB as described above.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></p>

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The Oklahoma City Area Indian Health Service, Office of Environmental Health and Engineering, seeks qualification statements of Architect-Engineer (A-E) firms to provide professional design services for various projects. Qualification Statements submitted in response to this notice must be received no later than November 9, 2010 and will be used to select the highest qualified A-E firm.  The selected A-E firm will then be asked to propose various rates for the eventual award of an Indefinite Delivery - Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract. Individual projects under the IDIQ contract will be negotiated and awarded on separate delivery orders issued after a firm fixed-price is agreed to by both parties based on various applicable rates in the basic IDIQ contract.

Professional services include planning, design and related A-E services including construction contract administration, and post-construction contract services for various federal and tribal health facilities and support facilities located in Oklahoma and Kansas. Health care facilities include hospitals, health care clinics and dental clinics, as well as their support facilities and associated infrastructure.  Buildings range in size from 1,000 square feet to over 111,000 square feet. Under this potential contract, IHS plans to conduct projects to perform major maintenance, periodic repair of building components, and facility improvements.

The work will primarily involve requirements for federally operated Indian Health facilities at or near the following localities but may be at any location the Oklahoma City Area Indian Health Service is responsible for:

Anadarko, OK	Claremore, OK
Clinton, OK	                      El Reno, OK
Haskell, KS                         Lawton, OK
Pawhuska, OK	Pawnee, OK
Watonga, OK	Wewoka, OK

Additional project needs may occasionally be identified at tribally operated health facilities. There are several of these facilities throughout Oklahoma and one in Texas. 

The resultant IDIQ contract will contain negotiated rates to be used to establish firm fixed-prices for delivery order projects and be for a base period of one year from the date of award with four one-year options that may be exercised at the Governments discretion. IHS anticipates awarding a contract to a single A-E firm under this IDIQ requirement.


Required A-E Services

Services that would be required under individual delivery orders include, but are not limited to, the following:

a. Evaluations, Assessments, and Planning Services: facility condition assessments; site development feasibility studies; conceptual designs; cost estimating; space planning and space efficiency studies; energy modeling and investment-grade energy feasibilities studies; building systems evaluations; electrical studies including short-circuit coordination studies and evaluation of power quality problems; pre-design commissioning activities; environmental testing and environmental site assessments; geotechnical and soil investigation and testing; water quality analysis; legal survey work for real property transfers including metes and bounds surveys.

b. Design Services: development of design and construction documents (i.e. drawings, specifications) and associated engineering work in accordance with the most current Indian Health Service Architect/Engineer (A/E) Design Guide.

c. Construction Contract Administration and other A-E related services: participating in pre-construction conferences; responding to construction contractor requests for information (RFIs); reviewing construction submittals and shop drawings; performing construction inspections and preparing field observation reports; advising the project officer regarding deficiencies and actions required or recommended; preparing supplementary drawings or revision drawings; managing document versions and revisions; reviewing contract modification proposals; and, reviewing contractor progress payment requests.

d. Post-Construction Contract Services: commissioning; preparing operation and maintenance manuals; preparing conformed-set drawings; preparing record drawings and as-built drawings; issuing certificates of completion (often required to be prepared and signed by a registered professional engineer); providing training on proper operation, maintenance of equipment, support for building automation, and systems troubleshooting (IHS provides support to tribal utility departments and may identify needs to provide training and troubleshooting of sanitation systems through this contract.) 

e. Integrate Sustainable Features: To the maximum extent possible these scope items shall integrate or include sustainability features that will reduce the energy usage, water usage, reduce emissions, divert solid waste, reduce consumption of toxic materials and chemicals, increase organic waste diversion, ensure retrofitting and renovation promotes buildings long term viability, and other sustainable enhancements.
We estimate there will be 4  8 task orders during the first year with the most common cost magnitude per task order ranging from $25k-$100k. Although it is required that the A-E firm be able to provide the full scope of required services, (a) the Evaluations, Assessments, and Planning Services and (b) Design Services will likely be utilized the most frequently.


A-E Qualification Statement Submission Form and Format

Interested firms must prepare and submit an original plus five (5) copies (identified as such on the face of each) of a recently completed Standard Form (SF) 330, Architect-Engineer Qualifications, pursuant to the instructions contained on the SF330, to the Contracting Officer no later than November 9, 2010. Copies of SF330 may be photocopies of the original except for the copy number identification on each. Address your submission as follows:

SF330 - 10-161-SOL-00001 
Attn: Contracting Officer
IHS Division of Engineering Services - Dallas
1301 Young Street, Suite 1071
Dallas, TX 75202-5433

When completing the SF330, include information on the key team members you would use for projects under this contract, including relevant personnel of sub-consultants and subcontractors. If partnering with another or multiple firms, please submit a single SF330 for the entire team. A fillable-PDF version of the SF330 is an attachment to this Notice. A link to download this form is visible on the right-hand side of the webpage where you are viewing this Notice.

You may submit supplementary information that assists to illustrate your firms ability to meet the evaluation criteria listed below. However, to facilitate review and evaluation, your SF330 submission package should not exceed sixty (60) typed pages unless partnering with additional firms, in which case the maximum pages of your submission may be increased by an additional 10 pages for each additional partnering firm. The submission does not need to be bound. However, if the SF330 package is bound, do not use bulky 2- or 3-ring loose leaf binders for this purpose.

CAUTION: we highly recommend that the actual SF330 be used for your submission, along with any necessary supplemental pages. If you do not use the SF330, your submission must follow the precise format and sequence of the SF330 to facilitate evaluation. SUBMISSIONS THAT DO NOT STRICTLY FOLLOW THE FORMAT OF THE SF330 MAY BE DETERMINED AS NON-RESPONSIVE TO THE REQUIREMENTS OF THIS NOTICE AND NOT EVALUATED FURTHER.

IHS may create a shortlist of A-E respondents from the initial evaluation process for a second evaluation phase that would include a face-to- face interview with the Source Selection Evaluation Board. Respondents will be notified if the Interview Stage will be added to the evaluation process.

The purpose of this Sources Sought Notice is to conduct market research in accordance with FAR Part 10 and to gain knowledge of potential qualified sources and their size classifications. The market research includes the determination of Small Business set-aside concerns. Responses to this sources sought notice shall not constitute responses to solicitation, which is not currently available. As stipulated in FAR 15.201, responses to this notice are not considered offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND:</p>
<p>The intent of this notice is to gather industry input on SBA's Online Communications Support Services Contract. In 2010, the SBA is taking strides to improve its overall web presence, strengthen its ability to provide enhanced information services, and to build a personalized and dynamic web site. Our intent is to strongly encourage citizen engagement and to fully support the tenets of open government. As such, SBA is currently improving its primary SBA.gov web site to make it more user-centric and focused on the needs of the small business and lender communities. The new web site merges key elements of current SBA resources, in particular the SBA.gov and Business.gov web sites. The SBA is investigating sources that could provide a combination of technology management, product and content strategy, content development, user training, architecture and system development, process and policy documentation, and operations and maintenance support for this new, dynamic SBA.gov website, which is slated to come online in early 2011.</p>
<p>While the web site is being redesigned, SBA integrated some basic social media tools into its communications strategy. Continued expansion of social media across the enterprise is planned and day-to-day support in messaging and moderating the use of these tools is required. SBA would also like to develop other information and service delivery mechanisms including mobile applications, video podcasts, and other citizen engagement tools and requires support to do so.</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>This project requires work in the following areas:</p>
<p>&bull; Web Design and Development. Develop and implement new templates, tools and features in accordance with the agency's standards and online strategy.

Create plans for ongoing Usability Testing and conduct sessions according to those plans.</p>
<p>Of note, strong support is required for the following:</p>
<p>&bull; Rehabilitation Act Section 508 Accessibility. The Small Business Administration intends to use the new SBA.gov website be a showcase for application of accessibility provisions expressed in Section 508 and in the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and requires robust support to ensure that Section 508 provisions are incorporated wherever practicable within the SBA.gov website, tested, and maintained up to date.<br />&bull; Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) and the Open Government Initiative. The PRA presents challenges as it is applied to the use of dynamic websites and social media to convey governmental content. In particular, how the PRA works in unison with the Open Government Initiative continues to be an area of growth for Federal websites. The SBA is committed to ensuring its online communication activities fully embrace the principles of the PRA and the requirements for an Open Government. Strong support in citizen engagement and collaboration and its provisions within the framework of the Open Government Initiative is essential.<br />&bull; System Security Compliance. The SBA requires that all SBA systems are properly certified and accredited in accordance with OMB Circular A-130. This process requires constant monitoring and interaction between the program office, the SBA's Office of the Chief Information Officer, SBA's Security Office and the agency's hosting provider. The SBA requires proactive support to ensure that the system and its upgrades are up to date as regards the requirements of the C&amp;A process.<br />&bull; Capital Planning and OMB Circular 300. The SBA requires support of the capital planning requirements as expressed in OMB's Circular 300 to ensure that the technical aspects of OMB 300 planning and management are incorporated into program planning and the system management cycle.<br />&bull; Also, experience with cloud computing and with transitioning system hosting to the cloud is of great interest.</p>

<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) intends to award, under a sole source agreement, a purchase order to Gladson, Incorporated. The purpose of this acquisition is to provide the CDC with brand-specific data needed to combine with other nutrient database sources to establish a comprehensive packaged foods database, which can then be analyzed to assess 2010 baseline sodium content values for packaged foods sold in the U.S, and then merged with national sales and market-share data to establish a list of key foods that are major contributors to sodium intake in the US.
<p>This acquisition is being procured applying simplified acquisition procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13. The authority for this sole-source acquisition is FAR 13.106-1(b). Gladson is the only source with the required expertise to provide the data required by the CDC. Because of the comprehensive infrastructure and methodology employed by the Gladson Incorporated, no other vendor has the capacity to collect or maintain the volume of data collected by Gladson; the work that has been done for this data collection cannot be duplicated by CDC internally. Justification for other than full and open competition is considered in accordance with FAR Part 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirement. This synopsis is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation is available. All responsible contractors that believe they can provide the services are encouraged to identify themselves and give written notification to the Contracting Officer no later than 2:00 PM Eastern Standard Time, on August 16, 2010, or within 15 days of the publication date of this synopsis. Determination by the U.S. Government not to compete this proposed action based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the U.S. Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in the future. Respondents will assume all financial costs for preparing a response to this notice. The U.S. Government assumes no financial obligation for the preparation and distribution of prepared responses. Inquiries may be sent to Darlene Seminko, by e-mail at fxo3@cdc.gov or by fax to 770-488-2044.</p>

<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) intends to award, under a sole source agreement, a purchase order to The Nielsen Company. Individually, and not as an agent of the Government, the vendor will provide all labor, materials, and supplies to provide the specified datasets and up to twenty user licenses for the specific datasets and services. The purpose of this project is to secure the specified product (datasets) and services (consultation and data enhancement) from Nielsen Claritas for the Comparative Effectiveness Review (CER) Enhancing the Use of Cancer Registry Project. The objective of this project is to make available datasets containing specified demographic components at the census tract level to the Cancer Surveillance Branch (CSB), the state cancer registries selected for the CER activity, and the prime contractor for the CER project.&nbsp; These datasets will be utilized by the registries to link with other data elements collected as a part of the CER Project.
<p>This acquisition is being procured applying simplified acquisition procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13. The authority for this sole-source acquisition is FAR 13.106-1(b). Nielsen is the only source with the required expertise to provide the data required by the CDC. The Population Facts Demographics datasets offer an unmatched opportunity to link CER project data with proprietary datasets to more fully understand cancer patient populations identified in the registries. Justification for other than full and open competition is considered in accordance with FAR Part 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirement. This synopsis is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation is available.

<DESC>(I) This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice and in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures authorized in FAR Part 13. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.
<p>(II) This solicitation is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ). Submit written quotes on RFQ Number NRMAG00-11-DG.</p>
<p>(III) The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-30.</p>
<p>(IV) This procurement will be set aside for small business if qualified responses are received. The associated NAICS code is 541690. The small business size standard is $7 million.</p>
<p>(V) This combined solicitation/synopsis is for purchase of the following commercial services:<br /><br />Develop software, written in IDL (version 8.0 is preferable), with user-configurable code functionality via user-specified variable input control parameters.</p>
<p>Raw data will be High Definition Video frames recorded with a consumer (as opposed to professional) camcorder such as, but not limited to, a Panasonic HDC-TM700K. Recording will be 1080p Progressive Recording (corresponding to a minimum resolvable hydrometeor size of approximately 0.15 mm). The camcorder is suspended about 33 meters below a balloon that flies through storms. A video frame may contain an image of hydrometeor(s) that is obtained with a 1/8000 of a second shutter speed. Software must be able to digitally detect and track individual, illuminated particles against dark background of the particle imaging chamber, and obtain various derived characteristics of individual particles and particle size distributions.</p>
<p>(VI) Software must meet the following requirements:<br />1) Software must be written in IDL as fully documented source code with instructions for use by a person unfamiliar with IDL, including instruction prompts. Documentation must include in-code commenting of significant tasks/functions/routines and a separate, searchable PDF-format Users Manual with step-by-step guidance.</p>
<p>2) Provide a quick-look data perusal capability of individually selected video frames for qualitative assessment of data. The quick look should provide users a convenient capability to skip a selected number of frames, which will allow users to step through the data from a flight. The step-through capability must include single frame, both forward and backward.</p>
<p>3) Automatically load sequence of individual frames from the video camera or other common storage media.</p>
<p>4) For each frame, automatically identify/position and determine the number of particles. Automatically classify the basic shape, such as round, horizontally extended ellipsoid, irregular, indeterminate, particle aspect ratio, etc., of each particle. Software fits appropriate shape models (e.g., circle, ellipse, etc) to estimate shape and relevant parameters as well as statistical deviation from fitted model(s).</p>
<p>5) Automatic calculation of oblateness (i.e., fit oblate-spheroidal model for drop at terminal fallspeed) for drop habit.</p>
<p>6) Produce summary information for the hydrometers, including the number of particles having each basic shape within each specified range of particle sizes in adjacent size bins that can be defined and changed by the end user. Allow optional bin spacing with user-specifiable number of bins (1-100): (1) linear (i.e., input constant bin spacing/number); (2) logarithmic (i.e., input smallest bin width/stretch factor/number). Provide a convenient ability for users to (1) specify the length of time to be included in each summary, (2) specify a start and stop time, or alternatively a start time and length of time, for which a series of summaries will be produced, and (3) automatically process video frames spanning the specified time period to produce and write out in ASCII readable form a series of summaries, each having the specified length of time. Each summary should specify the start time, stop time, and the length of time for which the summary was produced.</p>
<p>7) Produce histograms (i.e., both for total particles and for individual habits) of particle concentration in units of number per unit volume per unit diameter/radius interval. Software must estimate sampling volume derived from product of image width x depth x number of images x image height (i.e., swept out by ground-relative vertical motion of videosonde). (At 30 fps frame rate and approximately 5 m/s balloon rise rate, individual images are non-overlapping and therefore simply summed to obtain desired number of total particles.)</p>
<p>8) Data from balloon-borne GPS tracking will be available. Software needs to integrate the tracking and timing information to indicate the instantaneous location and time of images, as well as the start and stop location and distance spanned for each summary period or the period/mean height/mean temperature/layer thickness corresponding to each histogram. Header record that includes time and GPS-determined location should be attached to image and derived particle attribute (e.g., counts, sizes, oblateness, histograms, etc.) files output by the software. Additional code is desired to report individually or by statistical distributions within each summary period defined as above whether hydrometeors are liquid or frozen for each size range indicated by the summary.</p>
<p>Any proposals not meeting the specified requirements must include information as to why different approach is proposed, and why it would be better.</p>
<p>(VII) Delivery of all code, instructions, etc., within 120 calendar days after receipt of contract.</p>
<p>(VIII) NSSL has 30 days to determine if the delivered software, users manual, etc. fulfill the requirements. Contractor then has 10 business days to submit modified documents.</p>
<p>(IX) Provide evidence of contractor's expertise related to requirements of solicitation, specifically:<br />List and provide description of IDL-based image-processing software you have written<br />List and provide brief description of IDL programs (i.e., other than image-processing) you have written<br />List and provide description of relevant IDL program(s) you have written</p>
<p>(X) Place of performance is the National Severe Storms Laboratory, 120 David L Boren Blvd., Norman, OK 73072.<br /><br />(XI) FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors -- Commercial Items (June 2008), applies to this acquisition.</p>
<p>(XII) FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items (Jan 1999), applies to this acquisition. Offers will be evaluated on price and the factors set forth in paragraph (a), and award will be made to the firm offering the best value to the Government. Paragraph (a) is herby completed as follows: Award will be made to (XIII) Contractor whose quote offers the best value to the Government, price and other factors considered. The Government will evaluate quotations based on the following evaluation criteria: 1) Technical capability, 2) Past Performance, and (3) Price.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS <br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p>7. PLACE OF PERFORMANCE: Afghanistan</p>
<p>8. STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local, indigenous partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries by providing fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous local partners such as civil society groups (non-governmental organizations or informal community groups), local governments, private businesses, media groups, and others, through identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public understanding and participation in their country's political process.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>USAID/OTI launched a new program in Afghanistan in July 2009, in line with U.S. Government priorities. The program implements civilian-run stabilization projects in targeted areas, during the shape, clear and hold phases of counterinsurgency (COIN) operations. The program seeks to engage community and government leaders, mitigate conflict and create space for longer term development projects. In addition, the program will support the legitimacy and capacity of the Government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan (GIRoA) to plan for and implement a sustained civilian stabilization response.</p>
<p>USAID/OTI, through its implementing partners manages an operational platform and an in-kind small grants mechanism aimed at promoting the objectives described above. Activities focus on stability assistance, which incorporates a range of sectors, including, but not limited to, irrigation and small infrastructure, potable water schemes, road repairs, repairs to public facilities such as schools, agricultural terraces, and small livelihood activities. All activities are community driven and strive to address sources of instability which often includes increasing the legitimacy of GIRoA.</p>
<p><br />OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>Stabilization programming in Afghanistan is one of the United States Government's (USG) top priorities. This program will actively work to support counterinsurgency operations, development in crisis prone areas of the country, and the Afghan government.</p>
<p>The objective of this recruitment is to hire a qualified individual to support the OTI country team in the monitoring, evaluation, and information outreach of the OTI country program.</p>

<p>BASIS OF RATING: Applicants who clearly meet the Education/Experience Requirements and Selection Factors will be further evaluated based on scoring of the Evaluation Factor responses.

<p>Applicants are required to address each of the Evaluation Factors on a separate sheet describing specifically and accurately what experience, training, education and/or awards they have received that are relevant to each factor. Be sure to include your name and the announcement number at the top of each additional page. Failure to specifically address the Selection and/or Evaluation Factors may result in your not receiving credit for all of your pertinent experience, education, training and/or awards.</p>
<p>The Applicant Rating System is as Follows:<br />Evaluation Factors have been assigned the following points:<br />Factor #1 - 20<br />Factor #2 - 15<br />Factor #3 - 15<br />Factor #4 - 10<br />Factor #5 - 10<br />Total Possible - 70 Points</p>
<p>Interview Performance - 30 points</p>
<p>Satisfactory Professional Reference Checks - Pass/Fail (no points assigned)</p>
<p>Total Possible Points: 100</p>
<p>The Evaluation Factors are worth 70 out of 100 points. Be sure to fully respond to each of the Evaluation Factors and include all relevant experience, training, and/or education in your responses. Sample Evaluation Factors are provided on the GlobalCorps website at www.globalcorps.com.</p>
<p>The most qualified candidates may be interviewed and required to provide a writing sample. OTI will not pay for any expenses associated with the interviews. In the event that a candidate has fully demonstrated his/her qualifications and there are no other competitive applicants, OTI reserves the right to forego the interview process. Professional references and academic credentials will be evaluated for applicants being considered for selection.</p>
<p>APPLYING:</p>
<p>Applications must be received by the closing date and time at the address specified in the cover letter.</p>
<p>NOTE: Applicants must review their experience/education against the required minimum qualifications for both the GS-12 and GS-13 positions carefully. Applicants must submit a separate application for each position for which they wish to be considered. In most cases, this would simply require a small change to the cover page (e.g., indicating an application for the GS-12 or GS-13 position). Applicants must be cautious: those who submit an application for the GS-13 grade level, but do not meet the minimum qualifications as reviewed by the Technical Evaluation Panel (TEC) will not be considered for the GS-12 position if they have not submitted a separate application for the GS-12 position. On the other hand, applicants who apply for only the GS-12 position even though they might meet the minimum qualifications for the GS-13 position will not be considered for the GS-13 position if they have not submitted a separate application for the GS-13 position.</p>
<p>Qualified individuals are required to submit:</p>
<p>1. A complete U.S. Government Optional Form 612 with hand-written signature (including OF-612 continuation sheets as needed) (downloadable forms are available on the USAID website, http://www.usaid.gov/forms, or internet http://www.gsa.gov/Portal/gsa/ep/formslibrary.do, or www.globalcorps.com).</p>
<p>NOTE: Submission of a resume in addition to the required forms is encouraged. A submitted resume, however, is considered supplemental application material. Submission of a resume alone or in lieu of the OF-612 form IS NOT a complete application. All information to be evaluated must be contained in the OF-612 form and must not depend on references to your resume. Failure to provide the required information and/or materials will result in your not being considered for employment.</p>
<p>All applicants must submit complete dates (months/years) and hours per week for all positions listed on the OF-612 or on supplemental OF-612 continuation sheets to allow for adequate evaluation of your direct and related experience. Experience that cannot be quantified will not be counted towards meeting the solicitation requirements.</p>
<p>Dates (months/years) and locations for all field experience must also be detailed.</p>
<p>2. A supplemental document specifically addressing: <br />Each of the Education/Experience requirements shown in the solicitation.<br />Each of the five (5) Evaluation Factors shown in the solicitation.</p>
<p>NOTE: The Evaluation Factors are worth 70 out of 100 points. Applicants are required to address each of the Evaluation Factors on a separate sheet describing specifically and accurately what experience, training, education and/or awards they have received that are relevant to each factor.</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note: Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<DESC>The following is Amendment 1 to the solicitation.  The purpose of the attached document is to answer the questions the government received in response to the RFP.

There are some general notes before you read the specific, attached answers.  

It is expected by the government that the offeror has done similar or the same work in the past OR in lieu of that, knows what is generally expected of this type of work.  Along those lines, the government also expects that the offeror's will use the knowledge gained as a result of their past experience to make certain assumptions without requiring specific guidance from the government.  In cases where your question was not answered (though hopefully that did not happen too frequently) or where you get a short answer, the government will expect your experience in such matters to supply you with a reasonable answer.

Along those lines, such requirements - such as for past performance, page limits, what's to be included in certain page limits, etc., the government expects the offeror to use their past experience in drafting and submitting proposals for review as guidance.  In general, these types of things require each individual offeror to decide on what would benefit them the most to send and how much, and what types, etc.  The government will not "downgrade" an offeror specifically for not having had a certain number of past performance forms sent.  However, if the number sent is too few or does not directly relate to the work called for under this RFP, then you will end up possibly receiving a lower score for that than others might.  If you send too much, we may not be able to look at absolutely everything, and so you have to decide what will be best for you to submit and help you the most.

The government believes the RFP provides enough information for an offer with the relevant experience to submit a quality proposal for the work.

52.233-4703	 AMC-LEVEL PROTEST PROGRAM	05/01/2004
If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible contracting officer.  However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the General Accounting Office or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103.  If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

<DESC>Clarifications: 1. The Government indicates that the Contractor must be fully mobilized by 1 December 2010. What is the expected award date in order to develop a mobilization timeline / gantt chart? - Expected Award Date is NLT 1 November 2010 2. Is there an incumbent Contractor? - There is no incumbent Contractor 3. In box 8 of the SF 1449, the Government indicates that proposals are due at 12:00 PM on 4 October 2010. Is it safe to assume proposals are due at 12:00 PM Kabul time? - The date on the SF1449 is incorrect and the amendment has been posted to FBO. The correct response date and time is the one listed on FBO, 15 October 2010 8:00 A.M. Eastern Standard Time. 4. The Government specifies on page 16 of 91 that the key personnel positions are Site Manager, Supervisors and L/E. Please, clarify if these positions should be filled by U.S. citizens, Local Nationals and/or Third Country Nationals? - Key positions must meet the qualifications of part 6 of the statement of work. There is no specific requirement for any nationality for the key positions as long as they meet the qualifications. 5. The Government sites L/E as a key personnel position. What is an L/E? - L/E is a Liaison Expert to work with the local community to understand local threat levels.

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation No.DTRT57-10-Q-80125 is issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ). This solicitation is being conducted in accordance with FAR Part 13.5 and Part 12. This solicitation document and incorporated clauses/provisions are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-43 dated August 8, 2010 and FAC 2005-44 dated July 8, 2010. The NAICS Code is 33411 and the Small Business size standard is 1,000. The Government intends to award a Firm Fixed-Price Contract on a competitive basis to a Certified Hubzone Small Business. Note: Vendors are required to provide a price for all CLINS 0001-0012. <br />Background
<p>The Volpe Center has supported the FAA Air Traffic Organization - Advanced Technology Development and Prototyping Group (AT0-P) organization for over ten years for development, prototyping and evaluation of air traffic management systems for the airport surface and terminal environments. ATO-P is currently preparing for the installation of a Surface Decision Support System (SDSS) at the FAA William J. Hughes Technical Center in Atlantic City, NJ.</p>
<p>As part of the Volpe Center's continuing support for SDSS evaluation, ATO-P requires the procurement of hardware to build the required SDSS architecture.</p>
<p>The purpose of this requirement is to purchase commercial IT hardware equipment with the salient specifications as stated in CLINs 0001-0012 (listed below) whose quote offers the Government the lowest price.</p>
<p>Equipment Branding Compatibility <br />Each equipment category described in CLINs 0001 through 0008 must be compatible. Equipment family compatibility is important. Each equipment category can be of a different brand, but no mixing of brand will be accepted within each category itself.</p>
<p>The inter-mix of brands within the categories described in CLINs 0001 through 0008 can cause compatibility issues. This situation that can be averted if the equipment proposed for each category is within the same family brand. Also, there are advantages that can be drawn from within a single family of products. Different brands have features that are available only if interconnected with other devices of the same brand.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS <br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904</p>

<DESC>This contract was awarded on 1 October 2010 to the Accrediting Council for Continuing Education &amp; Training, Inc.<br /><br />It is the intent of this agency to award a sole source contract. Numbered Note 22 applies to this notice. This agency intends to award a purchase order to Accrediting Council for Continuing Education &amp; Training, 1722 N St NW, Washington, DC 20036-2907.
<p>USSOCOM requires a purchase order for the purchase of the sustained fees for maintaining Joint Special Operations University's (JSOU) accreditation. A twelve month base year and 4 twelve month option years is requested.</p>
<p>A contract for the sustained fees will be awarded to Accrediting Council for Continuing Education &amp; Training following no response back to this notice of intent. JSOU must interact with other DoD educational institutions in order to perform our mission. Without sustaining accreditation, JSOU will lose all accreditation for their current courses and any new courses that are developed for the Special Operations Forces. The JSOU is an accredited education and training institution through Accrediting Council for Continuing Education &amp; Training (ACCET). JSOU began the process of accreditation on May 12, 2009 and received approval status as an accredited member by the Commission on December 14, 2009, following a rigorous evaluation process that included workshop attendance, submission of an application and extensive self-evaluation report, hosting an on-site visit by a team of evaluators, and review of the subsequent report written following the visit, by the Commission. Accreditation by an accrediting agency recognized by the Department of Education is required in order for JSOU to operate and conduct trainings in its current environment and in its relationship with the United States Government; however, and as accreditation through only one agency is required, ACCET is the only accrediting agency that accredits JSOU at this time. The attempt to seek accreditation through multiple accrediting agencies would be time consuming, expensive, and would serve no useful purpose.</p>
<p>Market research was conducted for the purchase of the sustained fees and Accrediting Council for Continuing Education &amp; Training is the only contractor found able to supply this item as we require. If no response to this notice is received by 9:00 AM EST on Thursday, September 30, 2010, the award for the sustained fees will be made to Accrediting Council for Continuing Education &amp; Training. The POC for this notice is Melissa Robertson, Contract Specialist, Phone: (813) 828-6570; Fax (813) 828-5111, Email: melissa.robertson@macdill.af.mil.

<a href="mailto:shelby.burroughs@us.army.mil">ITEC4, Fort Huachuca DOC (NCR-CC)</a>
<DESC>The Army has developed a reference model for The Army Enterprise Network Operations - NetOps known as The Army LandWarNet NetOps Architecture - LNA providing an objective target for how NetOps will be managed across the Army Enterprise.<BR><BR>The Army LNA is the baseline enterprise NetOps reference architecture for the Armys LandWarNet. As an integrated architecture, the LNA provides an enterprise level Army statement of NetOps requirements through the Operational, Systems, and Technical views. These views together depict a holistic approach to NetOps with functional capabilities designed to support NetOps products, software, tools or systems, evaluation/selection.<BR><BR>Achieving NetOps systems interoperability and integration across the Army Enterprise Infostructure is challenging due to the extraordinarily large and diverse organizations and existing stove-pipe tools and systems. Standardizing a scalable NetOps toolset is an Army priority.<BR><BR>An optimal way to achieve standardization and increase NetOps systems interoperability and integration is to address the acquisition process. As a result, it is the intent of the Army to enforce Compliance of the Armys LNA Capabilities into the NetOps systems selection and acquisition process to enhance and ensure interoperability and integration across the Army Enterprise.<BR><BR>Army Regulation (AR) 25-1 mandates the assessment of NetOps products against the architecture to ensure they meet functional and interoperability requirements within the Army Enterprise. As a part of the Certificate of Networthiness - CoN approval process, all NetOps products - software, tools or systems must be compliant to the LNA.<BR><BR>NETCOM/9th Signal Command has responsibility to ensure all NetOps products are compliant to the LNA, prior to issuing a Certificate of Networthiness - CoN to acquire, field or connect to the Armys Enterprise. NetOps software, tools, and systems are those products - COTS/GOTS utilized on or for the LandWarNet, which monitor and manage the networked devices within the Army Enterprise Infostructure. These NetOps products securely manage, operate and maintain the network; they are not the network devices or elements themselves. NetOps software, tools, and systems are those products - COTS/GOTS which monitor and manage the networked devices within the Army Enterprise Infostructure. <BR><BR>LNA Compliance generally refers to the measurement of a NetOps product in meeting the Army LNA Key Performance Parameters - KPPs and interoperability requirements and standards. The heart of the LNA Compliance process is the initial product assessment mapping to the LNA Capabilities, validation of the products functional capabilities and data flow interaction with other LNA Capabilities within the LNA.<BR><BR>NETCOM/9th Signal Command has developed LNA Compliance Checklists for each of the Armys current LNA Capabilities. Posting of these documents on the FedBizOpps is to provide the criteria required for NetOps products to be compliant to the LNA. These Checklists are available to Industry, providing vendors the ability to review and perform assessments of their NetOps products against the LNA requirements. Vendors desiring to access these LNA documents should MAP their NetOps product to the appropriate LNA Capability(s) identified in the NETCOM/9TH Signal Command LNA Bin Chart.  To access the LNA Bin Chart scroll down to Additional Info located near the bottom of this Synopsis page then place cursor and click mouse on URL text LNA Compliance Checklists/Documents.                                                                                                                       <BR>(Hyperlink to LNA BIN Chart is:  http://www.netcom.army.mil/LNA_Webpage/LNABIN.htm) <BR><BR>Compliance Checklists exist for each of the current LNA Capabilities and are linked via their respective capability block on the LNA Bin Chart identified above. To view LNA material related to any particular LNA Capability, click the text in the respective capability block of the LNA Bin Chart. This links to a Word Document which provides an overview or description of the specific LNA Capability, a graphical representation of the capabilities interface requirements with other LNA capabilities to include data exchanges, and further provides a link to the detailed LNA Compliance Checklists outlining functional and Interoperability requirements.<BR><BR>In order for NetOps products, for use on the Army LandWarNet - LWN, to be considered for selection, Army requiring activities must obtain a Certificate of Networthiness from NETCOM/9th Signal Command, as stated in AR 25-1. See chapters 2-2, 2-15 thru 2-27, and 6-3. As a part of the CoN approval process, all NetOps products software, tools, or systems must be Compliant to the LNA. <BR><BR>Industry is encouraged to utilize these LNA Checklists to perform a self-assessment of their NetOps products to ensure their products compliance with the Armys LNA Compliance requirements. <BR><BR>It is recommended Army requiring activities utilize these checklists, as part of their market research, evaluation and acquisition process, for new or enhanced NetOps products, to ensure the products compliance to the LNA prior to seeking a Certificate of Networthiness - CoN from NETCOM/9th Signal Command.<BR><BR>When reviewing or preparing to acquire COTS NetOps products, for use on the Army LandWarNet, Army Requiring Activities should obtain a completed LNA Compliance Checklist, from the vendor, for the LNA capability to which the NetOps product maps. The completed checklist is the vendors assessment of their products compliance to the LNA and will be viewed as the vendors certification of their NetOps products compliance to the Army LNA functional and interoperability requirements.<BR><BR>Army requiring activities should e-mail completed LNA Compliance Checklist and supporting documentation to the NETCOM/9th Signal Command LNA Compliance Team at compliance.team@conus.army.mil. Vendors should not directly submit their completed checklists to the NETCOM/9th Signal Command LNA Compliance Team.<BR><BR>These LNA Checklists and supporting documentation will be utilized by the NETCOM/9th Signal Command LNA Compliance Team in their assessment of the NetOps products compliance to the Army LNA, prior to a Certificate of Networthiness - CoN being granted by NETCOM/9th Signal Command.<BR><BR>Prospective procurement of such products will be advertised and procured by Army Agencies requiring products. <BR><BR><BR>THIS NOTICE IS FOR INFORMATION ONLY. WE ARE NOT SOLICITING PRODUCTS AT THIS TIME.<BR>

<DESC>Amendment No. 1Paragraph entitled TIMING AND FORM OF RESPONSES, 5th line, change October 11, 2010 to read, Ocotober 25, 2010.
All inquiries concerning this announcement must be directed to Glenn Wilson, Contracting Officer, via email at glenn.a.wilson@faa.gov or at (202) 385-7730. 
This announcement is a Market Survey/Request for Information (RFI) regarding the Meteorological and Aeronautical Planning System (MAPS) program.  The responses to this market survey will be used for information purposes only.  
THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP).  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR OFFER. THIS IS NOT A SCREENING INFORMATION REQUEST (SIR).  The FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals.
INTRODUCTIONThis RFI is an announcement regarding the Meteorological and Aeronautical Planning System (MAPS) Program. The purpose of this RFI is to post a summary table of the MAPS' Preliminary Shortfall Analysis Report and elicit specific information regarding potential solutions that will address the required MAPS enhancements.Flight Services are currently provided by four separate contract vehicles. Preflight assistance and Inflight Advisory services in Alaska are provided by government employees using a leased automation system called the Operational and Supportability Implementation System (OASIS).  Preflight and Inflight support for the Continental United States (CONUS), Hawaii and Puerto Rico are currently provided by contract labor using a vendor-owned automation system called Flight Services through the 21st Century (FS21).  Additionally, there are two internet pilot web portals which enable pilots to self-brief and file/amend flight plans.  These systems are known as Direct User Access Terminal Services (DUAT/S. The term DUAT-Replacement (DUAT-R) is used to refer to the current contracts. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has determined that the best interest of the government and the aviation community would be served by integrating Alaska and CONUS requirements into a single platform to be deployed NAS-wide and the acquisition of this new platform will be best served by conducting a full and open competition.  
This RFI addresses the Flight Service automation requirements, along with the internet capabilities. The first contract delivery release would be deployed in the 2014-2015 timeframe.   
The FAA is especially interested in increased communications capabilities, internet and SWIM compliant systems with shared database technology based on industry experience with previously developed air traffic and flight service automation and voice systems. The FAA seeks to understand current and proposed industry capabilities to meet the requirements, the ability to meet the proposed deployment schedule including the acquisition strategy, and any suggestions that would further enhance safety and service delivery. The FAA also solicits recommendations or opinions as to the CONUS operational labor component and how best to structure the contract or contracts to meet the need for contract operational support in the CONUS. 
At this time, the FAA is not prepared to address service delivery locations.  This information will be provided in later Market Surveys or Screening Information Requests (SIRs).
Based upon the findings of this RFI, the FAA plans to release either a draft SIR for Industry comment or a formal SIR for Industry response or conduct an Industry Day. 
Proposed MAPS ENHANCEMENTS The impact of the service enhancements envisioned for MAPS will be a decrease in the number of general aviation (GA) aircraft accidents.  There is a direct correlation between a general aviation pilot not receiving a preflight weather briefing and/or en route updates and the occurrence of a weather-related aircraft accident.  In addition, this system will enhance post accident survivability by reducing search area and promoting a faster response by emergency services personnel. Currently both initial contact and subsequent contact depend on the pilot initiating the call to the FSS.  If the pilot does not call, important information pertinent to flight safety may not reach them.  This antiquated, customer contact-dependent "pull" model continues today.  As a result, pilots often do not receive safety-related information because they either do not or can not call Flight Service, or they call too late for the information to be of benefit. The MAPS solution is to augment the "pull" model by adding a "push" component, i.e., automatic update capability, to the system.  While pilots would continue to initiate services, automation would "push" critical updates to the pilot in time for them to make rational, safety-related decisions about their flight.  These automatic updates would be provided at no-cost to the pilot.  The system would only send advisory information pertinent to the route of flight, before or during its operation, and would eliminate redundant information.  This system would be built around an integrated global database network to provide NAS-consistent information, relative to current aircraft position, and accessible through Internet connectivity.  Direct contact with Flight Service Specialists will be provided when the system will not accept a specific flight plan or when the pilot requires clarification or technical assistance in preflight planning and filing.  Preflight support will remain available via phone, radio or by the new 'Internet text chat' function.  Flight planning issues will be resolved quickly because the same source information will be seen by both pilot and Specialist, i.e, an integrated, interactive pilot web portal.
As currently envisioned by the FAA, MAPS services will be net-centric, and therefore widely available and with more current data. Not all enhancements are addressed in this document but several significant capabilities should illustrate the anticipated safety benefits of the new system. For example, a pilot could receive a text and/or graphics-based weather brief in the cockpit while warming up their engine on the ramp rather than relying on an hours-old brief obtained before departure. Also many pilots are reluctant to file Visual Flight Rules (VFR) flight plans out of concern that they may forget to close a flight plan and trigger a SAR false alarm.  Since MAPS will include an automatic reminder to close fight plans in addition to other enhancements, it is anticipated that a substantial increase in the number of pilots who file flight plans, receive weather briefings and fly will benefit from the increased situational awareness afforded by MAPS.
The web-based flight planning system, including an identical interface for pilot and Specialist, will ensure a shared situational awareness of the flight and the conditions expected to be encountered for the planned route.  MAPS will also provide applicable airspace restrictions and traffic management information.  Pilots will be able to enter their personal level of risk tolerance for a specific flight, e.g., highest acceptable intensity of turbulence, lowest layer of cloud cover and/or lowest visibility desired, probability of encounter, etc. This decision support tool will enable general aviation pilots and Flight Service Specialists to more accurately determine the impact of weather hazards upon their flight. Shared situational awareness and the integration of weather into decision support tools are key capabilities in the NextGen Concept of Operations.
Frequently-used flight plans, pilot contact  information, pilot preferences and aircraft capabilities will be stored in the MAPS system and may be used to auto populate flight plans.  After specifying the route of flight, aviation weather and aeronautical information will be accessed and provided in a standardized format from the FAA's authoritative sources.  Pilots will also be able to self-brief and/or download meteorological information as part of the flight plan briefing function.  Graphical, textual, and grid formats will be available.  Once the preflight briefing is complete, the pilot can subscribe to receive automatic information updates that occur after flight plan filing or post briefing, including items such as destination airport and alternate airport closures, new advisories for icing, turbulence, thunderstorms, etc.Once the flight plan has been filed in the system, critical changes to current or forecast meteorological and aeronautical information, e.g., urgent PIREPs, a new Significant Meteorological Information (SIGMET), destination and alternate airport changes to/from IFR, TFRs, etc., will be sent automatically to pilots who subscribe to this free service and the condition impacts their planned flight.  These weather deltas will be provided as alerts to the pilot in a format chosen by the end-user. PIREP entry will be simplified, standardized in form, and easily accessed through voice-to-text capability.
Likewise, any critical aeronautical advisory changes in the NAS impacting the route of flight will also be generated automatically and forwarded to the pilot.  These deltas would include new or updated NOTAMs, destination and alternate airport closure, and TFRs that are applicable to the route of flight. Voice-to-text and text-to-voice capability will be available to minimize head down time for the pilot and increase situational awareness.  
Limiting Inflight communications to critical changes in aeronautical and meteorological information will reduce frequency congestion and alleviate the potential repetition of information that a pilot has previously received.  The automation system will also alert the Specialist if an automatic update cannot be sent or if it is rejected as undeliverable. Details of the active or passive acknowledgement processes will be determined after market survey during final requirements development.  
Pilots will be alerted to deviations from the filed flight plan and prompted to either return to the filed route of flight or amend the plan remotely.  This will reduce the number of deviation alerts sent to the Specialist and greatly reduce search and rescue response times.
The system will create a repository of information on VFR flight operations and track the flight planning services provided to those flights.  This transaction tracking capability will also automate the current En Route Flight Advisory Service (EFAS), enhance situational awareness for the support of SAR, and alleviate the necessity of re-transmitting information that has already been received by the pilot.  The system will maintain an accessible log all transactions.
Pilots may request flight plan monitoring. The system would then perform conformance monitoring and generate an alert to the pilot and the Specialist when an aircraft is out of conformance with its flight plan, allowing the pilot to amend the flight plan or return to the original route of flight. The intent is not to develop a separate flight plan tracker, but rather to request Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) information on VFR flights relative to their intended route of flight, using existing interfaces with En Route and Terminal automation.  
When the Specialist has a Radio Contact, he/she will enter the aircraft's Call Sign into MAPS and the system will identify any missing information required for a given flight. MAPS will allow any Specialist to see all information relevant to the flight and the information already provided to the pilot in a distinct format.   A logical outgrowth of the flight plan monitoring capability would be to expedite SAR operations using ADS-B location information. Initiating a SAR operation based on improved location data from aircraft (that are equipped with ADS-B and monitored by MAPS automation) will enable SAR operations to target search areas quickly and efficiently and thus greatly increase the probability of detection.  The search area will be greatly reduced which in turn will allow the search to be concentrated over a smaller area increasing the chances of finding a downed aircraft and improve post-accident survival rates.

<DESC>The Oklahoma City Area Indian Health Service, Office of Environmental Health and Engineering, seeks qualification statements of Architect-Engineer (A-E) firms to provide professional design services for various projects. Qualification Statements submitted in response to this notice must be received no later than November 9, 2010 and will be used to select the highest qualified A-E firm.  The selected A-E firm will then be asked to propose various rates for the eventual award of an Indefinite Delivery - Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract. Individual projects under the IDIQ contract will be negotiated and awarded on separate delivery orders issued after a firm fixed-price is agreed to by both parties based on various applicable rates in the basic IDIQ contract.

Professional services include planning, design and related A-E services including construction contract administration, and post-construction contract services for various federal and tribal health facilities and support facilities located in Oklahoma and Kansas. Health care facilities include hospitals, health care clinics and dental clinics, as well as their support facilities and associated infrastructure.  Buildings range in size from 1,000 square feet to over 111,000 square feet. Under this potential contract, IHS plans to conduct projects to perform major maintenance, periodic repair of building components, and facility improvements.

The work will primarily involve requirements for federally operated Indian Health facilities at or near the following localities but may be at any location the Oklahoma City Area Indian Health Service is responsible for:

Anadarko, OK	Claremore, OK
Clinton, OK	                      El Reno, OK
Haskell, KS                         Lawton, OK
Pawhuska, OK	Pawnee, OK
Watonga, OK	Wewoka, OK

Additional project needs may occasionally be identified at tribally operated health facilities. There are several of these facilities throughout Oklahoma and one in Texas. 

The resultant IDIQ contract will contain negotiated rates to be used to establish firm fixed-prices for delivery order projects and be for a base period of one year from the date of award with four one-year options that may be exercised at the Governments discretion. IHS anticipates awarding a contract to a single A-E firm under this IDIQ requirement.


Required A-E Services

Services that would be required under individual delivery orders include, but are not limited to, the following:

a. Evaluations, Assessments, and Planning Services: facility condition assessments; site development feasibility studies; conceptual designs; cost estimating; space planning and space efficiency studies; energy modeling and investment-grade energy feasibilities studies; building systems evaluations; electrical studies including short-circuit coordination studies and evaluation of power quality problems; pre-design commissioning activities; environmental testing and environmental site assessments; geotechnical and soil investigation and testing; water quality analysis; legal survey work for real property transfers including metes and bounds surveys.

b. Design Services: development of design and construction documents (i.e. drawings, specifications) and associated engineering work in accordance with the most current Indian Health Service Architect/Engineer (A/E) Design Guide.

c. Construction Contract Administration and other A-E related services: participating in pre-construction conferences; responding to construction contractor requests for information (RFIs); reviewing construction submittals and shop drawings; performing construction inspections and preparing field observation reports; advising the project officer regarding deficiencies and actions required or recommended; preparing supplementary drawings or revision drawings; managing document versions and revisions; reviewing contract modification proposals; and, reviewing contractor progress payment requests.

d. Post-Construction Contract Services: commissioning; preparing operation and maintenance manuals; preparing conformed-set drawings; preparing record drawings and as-built drawings; issuing certificates of completion (often required to be prepared and signed by a registered professional engineer); providing training on proper operation, maintenance of equipment, support for building automation, and systems troubleshooting (IHS provides support to tribal utility departments and may identify needs to provide training and troubleshooting of sanitation systems through this contract.) 

e. Integrate Sustainable Features: To the maximum extent possible these scope items shall integrate or include sustainability features that will reduce the energy usage, water usage, reduce emissions, divert solid waste, reduce consumption of toxic materials and chemicals, increase organic waste diversion, ensure retrofitting and renovation promotes buildings long term viability, and other sustainable enhancements.
We estimate there will be 4  8 task orders during the first year with the most common cost magnitude per task order ranging from $25k-$100k. Although it is required that the A-E firm be able to provide the full scope of required services, (a) the Evaluations, Assessments, and Planning Services and (b) Design Services will likely be utilized the most frequently.


A-E Qualification Statement Submission Form and Format

Interested firms must prepare and submit an original plus five (5) copies (identified as such on the face of each) of a recently completed Standard Form (SF) 330, Architect-Engineer Qualifications, pursuant to the instructions contained on the SF330, to the Contracting Officer no later than November 9, 2010. Copies of SF330 may be photocopies of the original except for the copy number identification on each. Address your submission as follows:

SF330 - 11-161-SOL-00001 
Attn: Contracting Officer
IHS Division of Engineering Services - Dallas
1301 Young Street, Suite 1071
Dallas, TX 75202-5433

When completing the SF330, include information on the key team members you would use for projects under this contract, including relevant personnel of sub-consultants and subcontractors. If partnering with another or multiple firms, please submit a single SF330 for the entire team. A fillable-PDF version of the SF330 is an attachment to this Notice. A link to download this form is visible on the right-hand side of the webpage where you are viewing this Notice.

You may submit supplementary information that assists to illustrate your firms ability to meet the evaluation criteria listed below. However, to facilitate review and evaluation, your SF330 submission package should not exceed sixty (60) typed pages unless partnering with additional firms, in which case the maximum pages of your submission may be increased by an additional 10 pages for each additional partnering firm. The submission does not need to be bound. However, if the SF330 package is bound, do not use bulky 2- or 3-ring loose leaf binders for this purpose.

CAUTION: we highly recommend that the actual SF330 be used for your submission, along with any necessary supplemental pages. If you do not use the SF330, your submission must follow the precise format and sequence of the SF330 to facilitate evaluation. SUBMISSIONS THAT DO NOT STRICTLY FOLLOW THE FORMAT OF THE SF330 MAY BE DETERMINED AS NON-RESPONSIVE TO THE REQUIREMENTS OF THIS NOTICE AND NOT EVALUATED FURTHER.

IHS may create a shortlist of A-E respondents from the initial evaluation process for a second evaluation phase that would include a face-to- face interview with the Source Selection Evaluation Board. Respondents will be notified if the Interview Stage will be added to the evaluation process.

<DESC><p><strong>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION</strong><br /><br /><br /><br />We are planning to combine the Installation Support Services (ISS) requirements for Wake Island and King Salmon divert location with Eareckson Air Station, Shemya, AK.&nbsp; The estimated magnitude of the entire contract is between $100M and $250M.&nbsp; We are looking for comments from industry concerning the plan. <br /><br />1. What benefits will be derived from consolidating the requirements? Will there be any cost savings, economies of scale gained, quality improvements, better terms and conditions, etc....? Quantify if possible.<br />2. What are the draw-backs of consolidating the requirements? Will any potential negative impacts substantially exceed the benefits of combining all three locations into one requirement? Quantify if possible.<br />3. What benefits will be derived from a 7-year period of performance vice a 5-year period of performance?<br />4. What impact will the combination of all three locations into one requirement have on small business?<br />5. Is it feasible to expect one contractor to provide effective stewardship of these three locations geographically separated by such great distances? If the answer is yes, is it possible to identify the elimination of redundancies and waste?<br />6. What challenges do you see in the short term and what benefits do you see in the long term?<br />7. What are the communication and management challenges and/or benefits of geographically separated teams?<br />8. <strong>Request responses by COB 12 Oct 2010.</strong> <br />9. <strong>All information received will be considered proprietary. <br /></strong><br />The information is requested for market research and is not a solicitation announcement for proposals.

<DESC>Description/Specification / Work Statement

This shall be done in accordance with all local, state and federal regulations, specifically Chapter 333-MI Public Health Code Part 138; OAC Chapter 3745-27; and all terms and conditions of this contract. All contents of the sharps containers are being discarded by the Government and are considered to be infectious waste. All sharps containers shall be of a vertical drop type.

Definition of Disposal: 
a. For the purpose of this contract, disposal means shredding and steam sterilization of infectious waste.

Manifesting: A waste manifest is required for the removal from the Government premises of all waste in this contract. The Contractor shall obtain and prepare all manifests.

<AWARDEE>ENERCON-CORNERSTONE GOVERNMENT SERVICES, INC.;5100 E SKELLY DR STE 450;TULSA;OK;741356547
<DESC>The Michael E. DeBakey VA Medical Center is interested in acquiring specialized surveying services to Decommission the Nuclear Medicine Department and 22 radioactive material used laboratories. This is a specialized survey to decommission the Nuclear Medicine Department per Nuclear Regulatory Commission guidlines utilizing the Multi agency Radiation Survey and Site Investigation Manuel (MARSSIM). The process is very comprehensive and highly scrutinized by the VA National Health Physicis Program and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. We require a company that is highly experienced for this type of operation and will be able to perfom the functions and provide a final report within our time frame. This procurement was advertised as Sources Sought notice VA256-10-RP-0523, but it is currently VA256-10 RQ-0646.  The new Bid date is September 24, 2010 at 2:00 pm.  Questions were received therefore extending the bid date.

Q and A
 
 1.	Will the VA Hospital provide the historical information for each lab needed for a MARSSIM- and NUREG-1757-based final status survey report? 
a.	Yes

2.	Item 9 in the Scope of Work addresses the need to coordinate access to the various laboratories for the performance of the surveys.  Will this process interfere with the bidders' ability to complete the on-site work within the two-week period specified in the second paragraph of the Scope of Work? 
a.	This will not interfere with the time schedule for the scope of work. The VA Radiation Safety staff will coordinate with Research.

3.	It is not clear what is meant by "Multiple schedules" in Item 9 of the Scope of Work (e.g., work may be performed on back shifts; work may be performed in two labs at once, etc.)
a.	Previously the department was going to be surveyed on different time schedules due to construction issues. This is not an issue anymore and the work will be done in one time frame. The area in Nuclear Medicine will be vacated and ready for surveys. The Research labs will still be occupied but will need to be decommissioned for just radioactive materials.


4.	Are there materials, equipment or other miscellaneous items within each laboratory that will need to be surveyed and released prior to the performance of the final status survey or will all extraneous items already have been removed before the start of the survey? 
a.	There will be no equipment other than fume hoods that need surveys in the Research labs.

5.	In order to determine survey coverage and estimate the time necessary to complete the surveys in each of the labs, kindly provide the MARSSIM classification for the walls above two (2) meters and the overhead areas? 
a.	MARSSIM class 3: Class 3: any impacted area that is not expected to contain any residual radioactivity, or is expected to contain levels or residual radioactivity at a small fraction of the DCGL, based on site operation history and previous radiological surveys.

6.	In order to determine scan speeds, kindly confirm that the DCGLs for the surveys as referenced in the Scope of Work (final item) should be those listed in Table R.1 and R.3 of NUREG-1556 (Vol. 9), which are applicable to operating facilities, as opposed to those in NUREG-1757 which are applicable to decommissioning sites pursuant to 10 CFR 20.1402, "Radiological Criteria for Unrestricted Use". 
a.	This is correct we are using tables R1 & R3 of NUREG-1556 for unrestricted use.

7.	Item 2 of the Scope of Work requires surface scans with 100% coverage for the radionuclides of concern.  For the low-energy beta emitters (i.e., H-3), where measurement instrumentation is not well-suited to the performance of scans (i.e., gas seal required prior to measurement), would the VA Hospital permit the performance of a statistically-determined number of direct (fixed) surveys with the hand-held instruments instead? 
a.	No. Our VA National Health Physics Program has requested a gas flow counter for H-3.

8.	Item 3 of the Scope of Work requires the use of filter paper smears for the performance of removable contamination surveys.  For assessment of removable low-energy beta-emitters, would the VA Hospital permit the use of a different smear type that is specific to the collection of removable H-3?
a.	Yes, that is acceptable.

9.	Has the VA already developed the final survey plan and is the contractor just implementing the final survey plan?
a.	The survey areas are listed in the scope of work. The contractor will develop the final survey plan according to the information in the scope of work

10.	Can you provide the total number of fume hoods, air vents, sinks, and drains that will need surveyed?
a.	9 sinks in Nuclear Medicine; one sink in each of the research labs, 2 fume hoods in Nuclear Medicine, one fume hood in each of the research labs. One air vent in each Research room, one air vent in each of the nuclear medicine rooms.

11.	Are the air vents part of the HVAC system?
a.	Yes

12.	Will the VA provide a liquid scintillation counter for contractor use?  If yes, will the VA also provide the cocktail, vials, and smears?
a.	The VA will provide a liquid scintillation counter for use.  The contractor will provide the cocktail, vials, and smears.

13.	Will the VA be responsible disposal of any generated wastes?
a.	The VA will be responsible for any radioactive waste generated including liquid scintillation vials.

14.	Will the VA provide lockable office space to the contractor?
a.	The VA will provide a lockable room but cannot provide internet access.

15.	Have the class 1 areas already been decontaminated?
a.	The class one areas are not expected to be contaminated.

16.	Will the labs be emptied of equipment and supplies or will the shelves, drawers, etc. still contain items?
a.	No. The labs are still active laboratories but need decommissioning specific to radionuclides.

17.	Will any site specific training be required?  If yes, how much time should we assume as part of our bid?
a.	Yes. Thirty minutes of contractor training will be required.

18.            Will the VA accept electronic proposals or hard copies necessary?
a.              Both methods are acceptable as long as the proposal are here by Friday September 24, 2010 at  2:00 pm.

<DESC>The four Regional Center contractors shall take advantage of the large Women's Health Initiative (WHI) cohort to launch the next generation of critically important cardiovascular research projects that target older women and will study  several important phenotypes in African American, Hispanic, and White women: heart failure, atrial fibrillation, VTE, coronary heart disease, peripheral arterial disease (PAD) and stroke. To achieve these objectives, the renewal will continue full outcomes ascertainment and adjudication in two important sub-cohorts: hormone trial participants, and African American and Hispanic women. Self-reported outcomes data will be collected in the remaining cohort to serve as a platform for ancillary studies and a new generation of clinical trials. The rich resources of data and specimens will be made widely available to the investigator community and for training young investigators. The study structure will be streamlined into four Regional Centers (RCs) and a Clinical Coordinating Center (CCC), which will function in part as an additional Regional Center.

<AWARDEE>Columbia University, 630 West 168th Stree, Box 49
, New York, NY 10032-3702 US
<DESC>The JOFOC supporting these awards is attached for more detailed information.  The Non-Competitive Request for Proposals (RFP) will provide supplemental funding for the five (5) existing contractors in the National Standard for Normal Fetal Growth study. Four are clinical sites of which Columbia University is one, and the fifth contractor is the Fetal Growth Data Coordinating Center (DCC). For the (4) existing clinical site contractors, this supplemental funding for the six/hospitals (two contractors have multiple sites), in combination with new awards under a competitive solicitation, will shorten  the recruitment period to 2 years from 3 years; broaden the scope of the protocol from single pregnancy to twin pregnancy; recruit 500 more women with twin gestation; conduct detailed nutrition surveys on all participants instead of a quarter of the women; have a better representation of race/ethnicity; and, investigate biological and socio-behavioral factors that affect fetal growth (over and under growth). With additional ARRA funding we propose to broaden the research scope for the clinical site contracts to address critical knowledge gaps and accelerate study progress. Specifically, we will (1) broaden the scope from singleton pregnancy to twin pregnancy by recruiting 180 monochorionic and 180 dichorionic twin pregnancies to study population; and (2) conduct a detailed nutrition survey in all study participants in lieu of the original projected one quarter of study participants.

For the Fetal Growth data coordinating center contract, the DCC will be responsible for an increase in:
(1)	data collection activities due to the expansion of the current clinical site contracts for the addition of a twin component as well as the addition as well as the addition of four new clinical sites,
(2)	lab specimen tracking, and
(3)	Statistical support and analysis of data.

Cost reimbursement type contracts are appropriate for these acquisitions because the uncertainties involved in contract performance are great enough that costs cannot be estimated with sufficient accuracy to permit the use of a fixed-price contracts.

Upon the basis of the following Justification and Approval, the proposed contract described below may be established through other than full and open competition pursuant to the authority of 38 U.S.C.  8127(c) as implemented by IL 049-07-08, 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(5), and FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies Or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.

1.	CONTRACTING AGENCY:  The Department of Veterans Affairs, VISN 21, Consolidated Contracting Agency is responsible for the contracting action as described herein and will enter into a contract that requires justification for other than full and open competition.  The solicitation number is VA-261-10-RP-0186.

2.     DESCRIPTION OF ACTION:  The request is being procured exclusive of competition, for         
        specific vendor, on a sole-source basis.  The award will be made to Seimens Healthcare

Siemens Diagnostics 	           provides the Autoblot and Scanner for the Siemens HCV InnoLIPA.  The VA Palo Alto  Molecular Pathology section performs HCV (Hepatitis) diagnostics and long term patient therapy is determined from the results.   For this type of HCV Genotyping test, Siemens is the sole source because Siemens is the only company that has a HCV Genotyping Kit available that does subtyping for the HCV Genotypes. The VISN doctors want HCV Genotype subtype test results. This is the only kit available that will give these needed subtype test results. Siemens is the sole source for this kind of HCV Genotype subtype testing: the Versant InnoLiPA 2.0 assay using the Autoblot 3000 and LiPA Scan software with Scanner.

	5.     AUTHORITY CITED: This service is being procured pursuant to FAR 6.302-1. The            	     	        preceding cited authority provides for purchase from a sole source whenever only one source is 	        available and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  It should 	        be noted that the intended awardee holds the proprietary information necessary to repair and 	  	        maintain this equipment.
              6.     ANNOUNCEMENT OF REQUIREMENT: This solicitation will be advertised in            	  	        Fedbizopps in case any interested firm has a query, however the intent will be to award to 	 	        Intuitive, in accordance with #4 above.

	7.     EFFORTS TO OBTAIN COMPETITION: A presolicitation notice detailing the intended 		        procurement is being posted.  The Contracting Officer will wait 10 days after posting before 		        signing any agreement, in case any inquiry is received from any firms that believe they may 	  	        be able to fulfill the requirement.

      12.    AGENCY ACTIONS TO INCREASE COMPETITION:  VA Palo Alto Pathology advises 	         the life expectancy of the equipment may be no more than the five year period as
              contemplated by this RFP.  This is because the technology is changing so fast the equipment 	 
               may well be obsolete in five years.  In five years the VA will research all available sources to
              determine what competitive means are available to fulfill this requirement.

	13.   CONTRACTING OFFICERS'S CERTIFICATION: I hereby determine that the facts and                                                                                     	        representations under my cognizance which are included in the J&A are accurate and complete 	        to the best of my knowledge and belief.
