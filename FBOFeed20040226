This requirement is being procured under negotiated procedures in accordance with Part 15 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation and is a total small business set-aside.   The North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) code is 541430 and size standard is $6,000,000.00. The work will be accomplished in three (3) phases.

Phase 2 will be final exhibit design and engineering, and Phase 3 will consist of  fabrication and installation. It is strongly recommended that all prospective offerors make a site visit to examine the location of the work.  Access to the work site is very limited and conditions at the site will affect the Contractor's operations.  A formal site visit is tentatively scheduled for March 3, 2004.  The firm date will be included in the RFP. Effective October 1, 2003, prospective vendors must be registered in the Central Contractor Register (CCR) prior to the award of a contract.  Lack of registration in the CCR database may make an offeror ineligible for award. The Central Contractor Registration Handbook and information on the registration process can be obtained via the CCR website, http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423. It is anticipated that a Request for Proposals (RFP) will be issued on or about February 25, 2004, however all dates in this announcement are subject to change.  The RFP will be issued via www.fedbizopps.gov/ but the Government reserves the right to issue the solicitation on paper or CD-ROM if the website becomes inoperable or if the Contracting Officer determines it is in the Government's best interest to do so.  Offerors should register on the website to be included on the offerors list in order to receive notifications pertaining to the solicitation, or visit the web site after February 24, 2004 in order to access the solicitation and any subsequent amendments and/or notices.

<DESC>NASA/LaRC has a requirement for renewal of Unigraphics Solutions annual software maintenance support.  NASA/LaRC intends to purchase the items from Unigraphics Solutions, Inc., who is the only known responsible source that can meet Agency requirements. The renewal of the annual maintenance agreement is required to continue receiving regular updates as new versions of the software are released, access to technical support, and new documentation as it is published. It would take substantial duplication of time and money for another company to offer a similar product that would meet these requirements, and these costs are not expected to be recovered through competition.  The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.  Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on March 8, 2004. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government.  Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.  All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.  An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>The establishment of a new organization, tentatively called the America India Development Alliance (AIDA), is a key component of USAID/India’s five-year strategy (2003-2007).  This is a potentially powerful organizational initiative that will augment the level of human, financial and intellectual capital devoted to India’s development.  This will also provide an avenue for US organizations to learn from India’s development experience and promote cross-fertilization of ideas in the development sector between two leading global players.

In order to achieve the foregoing result, USAID/India seeks the services of a management consulting firm with a strong Indian subsidiary (or a strong relationship with a quality India consulting firm(s)) to create AIDA and provide initial management support during its early years of operations. It is envisaged that the local sub-contractor in India, under the direction of the prime contractor, would be responsible for several aspects of the work.

<DESC>The Clinical Center (CC) at the National Institutes of Health has a requirement for a contractor to provide initial/interim cleaning for the new Clinical Research Center (CRC). The CRC will house inpatient, laboratory and office space to support the mission of the Institutes and Clinical Center at the NIH.  The CRC building will be opened in a phased approach, with laboratories and offices moving into the space between September 13, 2004 and November 15, 2004. Patients will not move into the building until December 4, 2004. As sections of the building are turned over to the NIH for beneficial use, the requirement for initial cleaning and maintaining of the space that is turned over will commence. Once that space is eventually occupied, the space will have to be cleaned on a daily basis, until the building is fully occupied with patients  The initial cleaning of each section (to be performed according to a staggered schedule between April 1-November 15, 2004) will include but not be limited to: scrub floors, clean carpets, finish floors with floor finish, scrub walls, clean sink fixtures and bathrooms, horizontal surface dusting/cleaning, clean interior of external windows, clean interior glass, remove trash to the B-2 dock site.  Each area that has gone through an initial clean will be maintained by cleaning on a monthly basis.  This maintenance cleaning will include all tasks described above, except for floor finishing.  Once an area is formally occupied, daily cleaning is required. As patient care areas will not be occupied within the timeframe of the scope of this contract, only laboratories and office will require a daily cleaning schedule once they are occupied. The first laboratory and office moves are currently scheduled to begin September 13, 2004. The “final hospital clean” is not included in the scope of this contract. The building will be considered an active construction site during the course of this contract, so contractors are required to provide and wear appropriate head, eye and footwear protection while traversing through the building.

Solicitation CC-04-06 is expected to be issued on or about March 9, 2004.  A pre-solicitation walkthrough will be conducted on March 16, 2004. Interested vendors may request a copy of the solicitation via e-mail to: aargaman@cc.nih.gov . This e-mail request should also indicate whether the vendor intends to participate in the walkthrough.  Vendors will be limited to no more than 2 participants each.  No oral requests for the solicitation will be honored. If there are any questions, please contact Mrs. Ann Argaman at (301) 594-5919.

<DESC>PROVIDE CONTINUED NEW EQUIPMENT FIELDING SUPPORT FOR III CORPS and its Major Subordinate Commands (MSCs) at Fort Hood, Texas and in overseas locations.  The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and nego tiate only with the incumbent contractor, Blackhawk Management Inc. under the authority of FAR 6.302.  The Government intends to modify the current contract, DAKF48-02-C-0002, on a sole source basis to incorporate a two-month option for the period 1 April through 31 May 2004 to provide the III Corps G3 with uninterrupted service both CONUS and OCONUS to allow adequate time for the current competitive RFP, DABK15-03-R-0014, to be awarded.  In accordance with FAR 6.302-2(b)(2), this course of action minimizes  duplication of cost and effort associated with soliciting and awarding a separate interim (two-month) contract to maintain uninterrupted services at Fort Hood and overseas locations.  The NAICS Code is 561210/$6 Million, FSC R706.   Interested persons may  identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.

Alicea a t Roberta.Alicea@hood.army.mil or to James G. Martin at James.Martin@hood.army.mil.  See Note 22.

<DESC>This project is an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Design/Build Multiple Award Construction Contract (MACC) at Scott AFB IL 62225-5015.  The MACC is contract for execution of a broad range of maintenance, repair and minor construction and may include design.  Work to be performed under the MACC will be within the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes as follows: Sector 23 – Construction, Subsection 233 – Building Development and General Contracting – size standard $28.5 Million (except dredging and surface cleanup activities;  Subsector 234 – Heavy Construction – size standard $12 Million and Subsector 235 – Special Trade Contractors – Size standard $12 Million. Contractors will be expected to accomplish a wide variety of individual construction tasks, including design/build (ranging from 35% up to 100% level of effort), renovation, additions/upgrades, along with specific work in Heating/Ventilation/Air Conditioning, electrical, mechanical and other major trades.  Description of the work will be identified in each individual task order.  Individual task orders may range between estimated $500,000 - $3,000,000.  The program value is Not-to-Exceed $90,000,000 over a five-year period.  Each contract awarded will contain a basic 12-month period and four 12-month option periods.   
The government may award as many as eight (8) contracts but anticipates awarding approximately six (6) contracts.  The government will evaluate offers and select the awardees utilizing the best value source selection procedures described in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR Part 15.3) and Air Force Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (AFFARS 5315.3).  In using this best value approach, the government seeks to award to those offerors who give the Air Force the greatest confidence they will best meet our requirements affordably.  While the government source selection evaluation team and the source selection authority will strive for maximum objectivity, the source selection process, by its nature, is subjective.  This may result in an award being made to higher rated, higher priced offerors where the decision is consistent with the evaluation factors in the RFP and the selection authority reasonably determines that the technical superiority, and/or overall business approach, and/or superior past performance, of higher priced offerors outweighs the cost difference.  
The RFP will identify a seed project that will be awarded to the highest rated offeror for the first award.  All other successful awardees are guaranteed a minimum of $2,500.

<DESC>The Office of Naval Research (ONR) intends to negotiate with Building Engineering And Science Talent (BEST), 401 B street, San Diego CA 92101-4245 on a sole source basis.  The proposed contract is to provide a four month effort to support the Office of Naval Research in study and assessment of their workforce as it relates to attracting and attaining young and underrepresented science, technology, engineering, and mathematics professionals.  The study may focus on ONR corporate programs such as:  Naval Research Enterprise Intern Program; Science Fairs/Competitions; National Oceanographic Partnership Program; Science and Engineering Apprentice Program; and, Graduate Fellowship Programs including the Historically Black Colleges & Universities (HBCU) Future Engineering Faculty Fellowship Program as well as other ONR sponsored education STEM related programs such as the S&T Revitalization Initiative (now N-STAR) Naval Research, Science and Technology for America’s Readiness.   BEST is uniquely capable due to the fact that they mobilized more than 100 nationally-recognized practitioners, policy makers and researchers to create the first comprehensive assessment across the continuum from pre-kindergarten through higher education and into the workplace of the effectiveness of programs developed to increase participation of women, under-represented minorities, and persons with disabilities in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM).  Following this assessment, BEST now possesses an unparalleled knowledge base of analytical tools, information, and expert insight regarding best practices in this field along with the ability to assess and diagnose existing or new programs created to increase participation of under-represented groups.  This body of information gives BEST the unique capability, without substantial duplication of costs to the government, to study the programs that can best increase ONR's STEM pipeline of  K-12 students to have the greatest return on investment measured by the metrics of attracting and retaining young STEM professionals within the Naval Research Enterprise.  Numbered Note 22:  The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within forty-five days (thirty days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  NAICS code: 541990.

<DESC>NASA/GRC plans to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP)] for research and development of a liquid metal pump.  The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Office of Exploration Systems (Code T) and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) are investigating technology options for potential Nuclear Electric Propulsion (NEP) space missions such as the Jupiter Icy Moons Orbiter (JIMO).  NEP-based spacecraft generally include a fission reactor to produce heat, a power conversion system to convert the heat to electrical power, and an electric propulsion system to generate thrust.  The NASA Glenn Research Center (GRC) at Lewis Field is supporting Code T and JPL in the areas of power and propulsion systems.  The goal is to raise the Technology Readiness Levels of potential NEP components by conducting analytical design studies, hardware development, and laboratory-based performance testing. Liquid-metal (or alkali-metal) fluid systems have been identified as a potential candidate for cooling of the reactor and power conversion systems.  Liquid-metals provide excellent heat transfer characteristics at the operating temperatures anticipated for the reactor power system.  A critical element of a liquid-metal cooling loop is the fluid pump.  Desirable pump characteristics include low mass, long life, and high efficiency. NASA GRC will be soliciting a contract for a two-phase project to advance Liquid-Metal Pump (LMP) technology for nuclear systems.  Phase 1 will consist of analytical studies and conceptual designs encompassing a range of LMP operating regimes, including different fluids (lithium and sodium-potassium), flow rates, pressures, and temperatures.  An optional Phase 2 activity will include the design, fabrication and test of one or more prototype pumps based on design points selected by GRC at the conclusion of Phase 1.  NASA, at its discretion, will determine whether the Phase 2 option will be exercised.  It is anticipated that phase 1 will be firm fixed price and the option phase 2, if exercised, will be on a cost reimbursement basis.  Multiple awards are planned for although budgetary constraints may limit awards to only one firm. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See Note 26. The NAICS Code and Size Standard are 541710 and 500 employees, respectively.   All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. The anticipated release date of the RFP is on or about March 13, 2004 with an anticipated offer due date of on or about April 12, 2004. An ombudsman has been appointed -- See NASA Specific Note "B". The solicitation and any documents related to this procurement will be available over the Internet.  These documents will be in Microsoft Office 97 format and will reside on a World Wide Web (WWW) server, which may be accessed using a WWW browser application.  The Internet site, or URL, for the NASA/GRC Business Opportunities home page is http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/eps/bizops.cgi?gr=D&pin=2222	It is the offeror's responsibility to monitor the Internet site for the release of the solicitation and amendments (if any).

<DESC>For the past 33 years, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has purchased outbred and inbred rats to support researchers at the National Health and Environmental Effects Research Laboratory (NHEERL) from Harlan Sprague Dawley, Inc. on a sole source bases. The circumstance permitting Other than Full and Open Competition Justification is FAR 6.302-1 "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements."  The majority of NHEERL's studies utilizing these strains of research animals are of a continuing nature and will require additional animals of the same strain, sex, age, and microbiologic and virologic history as well as genetic background.  Various published studies by a variety of research organizations, including EPA, Veterans Administration, and the Department of Defense have demonstrated that nominally identical animals from different sources of supply will react differently under identical protocols.  These reactions result from subtle variables in genetic virologic and bacteriologic backgrounds.   The Agency has concluded that where inter-comparability of data is required from one study to another, it is necessary to use a common source of supply to eliminate extraneous variables.  For these reasons, the Agency has decided to solicit Harlan Sprague Dawley, Inc. on a non-competitive basis for this requirement.  The primary basis for limiting competition is the Agency's conclusion that there is substantial evidence that animals that are not identical genetically, virologically, and bacteriologically to animals previously used in our research introduce unquantifiable variables into the research protocol and that such variables cast unavoidable doubt on the significance of variations on research results.   The element of doubt is of such concern to EPA that it would require a definitive and conclusive demonstration of the error of the conclusion before opening this solicitation for competition.   It is anticipated that the contract will be a firm fixed price Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity type.  Contract period of performance will be for 12 months for the base period plus four 12-month option periods.  Anyone wishing to request reconsideration of the Justification for Non-Competitive Procurement must provide such a demonstration to the Agency within 15 days of this notice.  This information will be evaluated according to its conclusiveness.

<DESC>The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) intends to issue a Request for Proposals (RFP) in full and open competition to implement the program described below.  USAID has a long history of promoting justice sector improvements in Honduras since 1985.  For the 1997-2003 strategy period, USAID Honduras initiated the Strengthened Rule of Law and Respect for Human Rights (SROL I) activity.  The SROL I activity was designed to promote democracy in Honduras through support to key justice sector institutions and civil society. The objectives of the SROL I activity were: 1) a new Criminal Procedures Code (CPC) effectively implemented; 2) an independent, apolitical and effective judiciary established; 3) an independent, apolitical and effective Public Ministry established; 4) broader civil society participation in justice sector reforms and monitoring; and 5) a changed mind set in the courts, in universities and elsewhere regarding the rule of law.  The activities under the SROL I activity are now being completed and will end in September 2004.
 
Significant change has occurred in the criminal justice system with the implementation of the new CPC, which introduced oral adversarial trials, more effective and transparent procedures, and greater protections for individual rights.  Nevertheless, the Government of Honduras (GOH) recognizes that numerous obstacles impede the effective functioning of the country’s legal system.  The judiciary in a democratic society must be independent of the Legislative and the Executive branches and therefore, not susceptible to improper political and economic influences from within the government and from private sector interests.  Changes in the institutional leadership that are subject to political interests threaten the reforms achieved to date and undermine the independence of key democratic institutions.  To improve the public’s confidence in its democratic systems and equal protection under the law, the Honduras justice system must strengthen its independence and protect itself from the influence of special interests that challenge the application of the rule of law.  Honduras has taken many important steps in reforming its justice sector, but further progress is required to address the rights of citizens to receive a fair hearing in court through a legal system that respects its own laws and regulations.
 
The current USAID Honduras strategy is entitled “Honduras Country Plan in Support of the Central America and Mexico (CAM) Regional Strategy.”  The Country Plan was approved in August 2003 and sets forth the strategy of the USAID Honduras Mission for the period 2003-2008.  Under the new strategy, USAID/Honduras will build on the successes of the SROL I activity, particularly with regard to promoting inter-institutional approaches and developing a cadre of leadership for reform.  The new, 2-1/2 year SROL II activity will strengthen the momentum for reform within the institutions by improving the capacity of legal personnel, supporting the active engagement of professional associations to sustain justice reform, and focusing on the successful implementation of essential parts of the CPC and critical judicial independence issues.  The SROL II activity intends to increase respect for the rule of law, as well as its sustainability, by helping to deepen and diversify the constituencies that support ongoing reform.  The new activity will also introduce alternative dispute resolution as a means for increasing access to justice for marginalized groups as well as to provide another avenue to dispute resolution for commercial claimants.  Work will also support reform of the Civil Procedure Code, to introduce oral and more transparent and streamlined trial proceedings.  
 
The contractor will work closely with other donors involved in justice sector activities as well as with other USAID Honduras Strategic Objective Teams, particularly the Economic Growth Strategic Objective (SO 2) in implementing activities supporting commercial claimants and civil court reforms.  One performance-based cost-reimbursement contract will be awarded for implementation of these activities.  Implementation will occur over a 2-1/2 year period.  We anticipate issuing the RFP o/a March 24, 2004.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

Subject contract will consist of moving the Behavioral Guidance Structure (BGS) at Low er Granite Lock and Dam, Snake River, Washington,  between stored and deployed positions.  The BGS is a prototype structure that is unique, complex and difficult to mobilize.  The BGS is an 1100-foot long floating vertical steel wall which weighs approxima tely 4 million pounds.  The BGS is located in the reservoir directly upstream of Lower Granite Dam.  The BGS is designed to guide juvenile salmon and steelhead away from the powerhouse to reduce juvenile fish from being drawn into the turbine intakes.  The  BGS can be moved upstream away from the powerhouse during the biological testing and for emergency removal during flood events.    The BGS is moved by 2 winches, both winches have approx 1100 feet of 2 1/4 inch wire rope.  One winch has a capacity of 100 tons and the other is 140 tons.  The Government has no operators trained to move the BGS.  Two moves will occur prior to biological testing to ensure the powerhouse anchor (relocated by others) is installed correctly.  The remainder of the moves will occur  during the fish monitoring season in April thru June 2004, and/or 2005.  Prior to moving the BGS, the Contractor shall complete the necessary maintenance repairs on the BGS.   Maintenance repairs may include but not limited to the following:  recharge and /or replace batteries for the upstream and downstream winches, full service maintenance on running equipment, including changing of all fluids and filters.   Upon completion of the moves, in each year, the Contractor shall winterize the BGS.  This notice o f intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  The size standard for small business conce rns under NAICS 488390 is $6.0 million.

<DESC>UPDATE (2-26-04) CHANGE OF LOCATION FOR THE MARCH 9TH INDUSTRY DAY Due to the increased interest in this program, we have changed locations to  accommodate all those that wish to attend.  The Industry Day to be held on  March 9, 2004 at 8:30 am EST will now be held at the Irvin J. Nutter Center in  the Berry Room Complex.  Please note that this is the same location as the  previous Industry Day held in September 2003. The date, time, and all other  information for this Industry Day remain unchanged.  Additional information and  directions are available at the following website, http://www.nuttercenter.com.  You can also contact Capt. E. Jay Kilpatrick II,  +edwin.kilpatrick@wpafb.af.mil+, Program Manager, 1970 Monahan Way, Bldg 11A,  Room 201-1, WPAFB, Ohio 45433-7211, Phone 937-904-4317, or Mr. James Van Oss  +James.VanOss@wpafb.af.mil+, Contract Specialist, 1970 Monahan Way, Bldg 11A,  Room 201-1, WPAFB, Ohio 45433-7211, Phone 937-904-4192 for more information. ////END OF UPDATE////  UPDATE (02-05-04) NOTIFICATION OF AN INDUSTRY DAY The T-38 Flight Training System Program Office (ASC/YTA) of the Aeronautical  Systems Center continues to analyze and assess industry capabilities to provide  an upgrade to the current T-38C escape system to include the aircraft’s  ejection seats and inter-seat sequencing, as well as escape path clearance. The  Government anticipates conducting another Industry Day on the 9th of March in  Bldg 570, Rm. 102 located on the premises of Wright-Patterson AFB, beginning at  8:30 a.m. (EST).  This will be Industry’s opportunity to meet with Government  representatives and to understand how the Government will measure  anthropometrical values once escape system components are installed in the T- 38C mock forebody located at Wright-Patterson AFB.  This meeting will also  provide Industry and the Government an opportunity to discuss program  developments up to this point.   This is also a call for industry to schedule appointments to see the T-38C mock  forebody in a one-on-one environment with the personnel who will conduct the  anthropometrical analysis of submitted systems.  There will be six half-day  appointments available beginning Wednesday, the 10th and ending Friday the 12th  of March, 2004.  Each half-day session will be scheduled on a first-come, first- serve basis. At the Industry Day, a briefing on the current status of the program will be  given. An open forum of question and answers will follow this portion.   Attendees must indicate their interest in attending by letter NLT 13 Feb 04 to  Capt Jay Kilpatrick Program Manager, 1970 Monahan Way, Bldg 11A, Room 201-1,  WPAFB, Ohio 45433-7211.  The Government limits attendance to no more than 3  persons per interested party.   How to contact this program: POC:  Capt Jay Kilpatrick (Program Manager), 937-904-4317, Ms Sally Meyer  (PCO), 937-904-4304 ////END OF UPDATE//// UPDATE (01-09-04) POTENTIAL IMPACT OF INCLUSION OF ESCAPE PATH CLEARANCE SUB-SYSTEM IN FIRST  ITERATION During our recent Industry Day, as well as in subsequent T-38 ESUP RFI  responses, a phased approach was suggested as a suitable acquisition strategy  for the ESUP.  We are strongly considering such an approach, but would value  your inputs as we formulate such a program.   One consideration is how to “segment/phase” the program.  In particular, we are  evaluating the benefits of not including the upgraded escape path clearance sub- system from the first phase.  It’s the governments position an upgraded escape  path clearance sub-system presents the greatest technical and schedule risk  over a replacement seat or inter-seat sequencing sub-system.   The Government will not define a design solution for the escape path clearance  sub-system. We will require its performance to be such that it will allow the  overall ejection sequence timing to be kept as low as possible so that we get  maximum system capability from replacement seats. Question:  What do you foresee as the schedule impact of including an improved  escape path clearance sub-system in a first phase of the ESUP?  Please provide  your answer as a function of total system design/development/qualification,  specifying to the greatest extent possible the issues you see as of greatest  concern. Request your response be submitted NLT February 9, 2004 to: ASC/YTA, Capt. E.  Jay Kilpatrick II, Program Manager, 1970 Monahan Way, Bldg 11A, Room 201-1,  WPAFB, Ohio 45433-7211, Phone 937-904-4317 or to: ASC/YTA, Mrs. Sally Meyer,  Contracting Officer, 1970 Monahan Way, Bldg 11A, Room 201-1, WPAFB, Ohio 45433- 7211, Phone 937-904-4304 ////END OF UPDATE//// UPDATE (10-10-03) RELEASE OF 29 SEPT 03 INDUSTRY DAY INFORMATION: 1) List of Attendees 2) 3 Presentations (ASC/YTA; AETC/XPRU; T38ANTHRO_DRZEHNER) 3) List of Questions and Answers  Should you have questions or additional concerns about  the ESUP Industry Day info noted above please email them to  Jason.Ortiz@wpafb.af.mil. ////END OF UPDATE//// UPDATE (10-3-03) MEMORANDUM FOR REGISTRANT FOR REQUEST FOR INFORMATION FROM: ASC/YTA  1970 Monahan Way, Bldg 11A, Room 201 I Wright-Patterson AFB, OH 45433-7211 SUBJECT: T-38C Escape System Upgrade Program, Request for Information (RFI)  1.

Both the time and the location have been determined as follows: We will be holding this conference on Monday, September 29th, 2003 from 1:00pm  to 5:00pm (Eastern Standard Time).  We will be meeting at the Ervin J. Nutter  Center in the "Berry Room" conference facility.  It is located within the  Nutter Center at 3640 Colonel Glenn Highway in Dayton, Ohio, 45435-0001, USA.   This link, http://www.nuttercenter.com/berry/index.html, should provide more  information about the conference center.  A tentative agenda and information on  local accomodations is attached.   /////UPDATE END///// The T-38 Flight Training System Program Office (ASC/YTA) of the Aeronautical  Systems Center is analyzing and assessing industry capabilities to provide an  upgrade to the current T-38C escape system to include the aircraft’s ejection  seats, escape path clearance, inter-seat sequencing, as well as the physical  accommodation of a greater range of aircrew personnel.  The Government  anticipates conducting the first Industry Day on 29 Sep 2003 (specific time and  location to be determined).  This will be Industry’s initial opportunity to  meet with cognizant Government representatives and to discuss the known  requirements and intent of the T-38 ESUP.  We are actively seeking Industry’s  inputs in helping us develop the acquisition strategy for this program.  Due to  size limitations, no more than three (3) representatives per company may attend  this meeting. A simulated T-38C cockpit, to be located at AFRL, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH,  will be available to Industry for inspections, measurements, etc. to aid in  Industry’s partnership with the Government in developing the acquisition  strategy.  The modified cockpit mock-up will be available to Industry  approximately late October/November 2003.  Companies interested in obtaining  access to the mock-up must request this in writing through the individuals  listed at the end of this synopsis. At the Industry Day, a briefing on the current status of the program and the  results of a recent Air Force Research Laboratory anthropometrical study on the  T-38C aircraft will be given. This will be followed by an “open forum” of  question and answers.  Following the open forum, Industry representatives may  individually engage with Government representatives for appointments (one hour  or less) to present their capabilities and concepts.  Maximum leverage  of “available technology” in any technical approach is highly encouraged.  This  is the initial step to establish industry’s understanding of the T-38 ESUP and  to allow the Government to determine market capabilities. Attendees must  indicate their interest in attending by letter NLT 10 Sep 03 via the  individuals listed at the end of this synopsis.  Similarly, if you are  interested in having access to the T-38 cockpit mock-up please provide your  request, in writing, to the listed individuals contained at the conclusion of  this synopsis. This is not a Request for Proposal.  The Government does not intend to award a  contract on the basis of this RFI and notification.  Submitting capabilities  and concepts in response to this RFI is voluntary and participants will not be  compensated.

<DESC>The 30th Space Wing, Vandenberg Air Force Base, California intends to extend the Launch Operations and Support Contract (LO&SC) #F04684-98-C-0014 with MCA Engineers Inc, for a period of four month and twelve days (134 Days), commencing 1 Apr 04 and ending 12 Aug 04 to allow for completion of source selection proceedings on the follow-on Launch Operations Support Contract (LOSC) solicitation #F04684-02-R-0024.  By extending the LO&SC, launch critical services will be uninterrupted while the new 6 year LOSC is being competed.  The current LO&SC provides management, maintenance, repair, upgrade, demolition, engineering and on-site support for the Western Range launch, operation, and test facilities, infrastructure and equipment.  Interested firms must have the ability to provide required expertise for launch critical services and the workforce to provide required services and on-site support upon award.  All hiring and training of personnel, learning of mission critical systems, and required security clearances must be accomplished without interruption of the Western Range and launch schedules.  Phase-in will not be included due to the criticality of services to be provided and the impact that would result from interruption of these services.  The incumbent contractor will not provide transition training since this would cause the government a substantial duplication of cost. Interested parties may provide necessary information, including written capabilities statement, and past performance references to Vincent W. Sanford within 5 days of this publication.

<DESC>Amendment #1 -- 
Following is a list of questions with OTS's response regarding the Professional Hacking Class requirements.

QUESTION:  Without setup requirements for the course, and the technical requirements to establish an appropriate training room, it is impossible to prepare an adequate response. The short turnaround time for a response to the solicitation seems to indicate a preferred vendor. 
RESPONSE:  The Government does not have a preferred vendor.  The short turn around time is based on a commercially available class, scheduling time, and workload demand.  
QUESTION: Is there a vendor currently identified for this RFP? 
RESPONSE:  A contractor has not been identified. The purpose of the competitive combined synopsis/solicitation is to award a contract to the offeror whose proposal represents the best value to the Government, price and other factors considered. 
QUESTION:  How many students will there be in the course? 
RESPONSE:  As stated in the combined synopsis/solicitation, approximately six. 
QUESTION: Does the vendor need to supply the training facility or will the government? 
RESPONSE: The Government will supply the training facility. 
QUESTION: Does the vendor need to supply any training equipment (personal workstations for exercises) or will the government? 
RESPONSE: The Government will supply personal workstations. 
QUESTION: How many days of training are requested? 
RESPONSE: The course length is to be determined by the contractor based on the the class requirements specified in the combined synopsis/solicitation . 
QUESTION:  What are the specifications, and desired agenda, for the course? 
RESPONSE:  All requirements are specified in the combined synopsis/solicitation. The contractor is to submit the course agenda based on the Government's requirements. 
QUESTION: When would the course be taught? 
RESPONSE: The course is to be taught in May, 2004.

<DESC>The U.S. Agency for International Development Mission to Pakistan (USAID Pakistan) is seeking competitive proposals from firms or organizations to provide services in support of USAID/Pakistan's program and project monitoring and evaluation responsibilities,in all four provinces of Pakistan.  The previous synopsis is modified to include U.S. as well as Pakistani entities as eligible to compete for indefinite quantity type contracts to provide these services.  Projects currently funded by USAID Pakistan are in the areas of Education, Health, Governance and Economic Opportunity (e.g. Microfinance). The proposal due date in this notice is approximate and will be superceded by the date specificed in the solicitation. At the time of the initial synopsis, a competition between local sources (entities already doing business in Pakistan) was planned.  Since then, there has been a change in planned contract type and estimate of the requirement; these changes increase the overall value of this procurement above the USAID threshold for local procurement. Therefore, proposals from both U.S. and Pakistani organizations may be submitting in response to the the request for proposal (RFP) to be posted March 3, 2004 on this website.

<DESC>The purpose of this notice is to respond to questions received in reference to the draft Performance Work Statement (PWS) for the Human Resources Services and Information Center (HRSIC) Travel (TVL) Branch in Topeka, Kansas released 25 February 2003.  A copy of the Questions and Answers are as follows:  1) Question:  Can monthly workload totals be provided for a minimum of 12 consecutive months (preferably 24 consecutive month) for 5.4.1.1. "Process TDY travel claims", and 5.4.1.2. "Process PCS Military claims"?  Answer: Previously, information was requested from the MEO team on monthly totals to validate peak periods. These monthly totals were provided as an answer to MEO question #7 (Historical data for peak periods, April through October, shows fluctuations during this time period with peaks and valleys.  Historical data reflects total claims processed as:  April 12,402, May 13,411, June 13,628, July 12,574, August 13,342, September 12,940, and October 14,526.  These totals only include supplemental and final military TDY and PCS claims.). The workload output tables contain necessary information to provide travel settlements in all areas of the travel process.  2) Question:  Currently, HRSIC Travel Branch staff states that the HRSIC Customer Servioce Division is performing training in 5.3 to external customers.  Can this work requirement be verified?  Answer: The requirement of the SP to develop and maintain a training curriculum for the purpose of training and familiarizing external customers in the travel settlement process has not changed. The Customer Service Division informally began in March 2003 and no empirical data or direction has been formulated to affect this PWS.  The modification of responsibilities and duties were included under C-5.6 of the PWS.  3) Question:  Currently, the Travel Branch staff states that they DO NOT update the Quick Reference Guide (QRG) in 5.3.1, but the PWS states that the SP will update these guides.  Can this work requirement be verified?  Answer: The requirement of the SP to provide, maintain and continually update training aids to include the QRG is a PWS requirement. Historically this has been an annual change and Travel Branch is responsible for the update.

<DESC>Sources Sought: Related to Requisition number 04-D88290005 purchase of telemetry equipment to study movement and behavior of paddle fish, blue sucker (listed as species of special concern), and sturgeon (listed as species of special concern) at Reclamation sites. Supplies requested include the following LOTEK equipment or its equal: SRX 400 radio receivers with W31CT firmware or its equal AN-4YG- 4 Element Yagi antennas or their equal EE100-2-Solar Powered Environmental Enclosure Kit for remote logging stations. equipment included are 50W solar panels, 98AH gell cell batteries, regulator, cables, mounting hardware, enclosures and connectors or their equal BTRM50 BNC - 50Ohm Terminators or their equal UUCN-150 - Ultra sonic up-converter to be used in conjunction with the SRX400A. 150MHz frequency band or its equal LHP1 - Conventional hydro-phone to be used in conjunction with the SRX400A and UUCN-150 up-converter or its equal Equipment must be compatible with other ongoing efforts along the Missouri River. Specifically we are partnering with USGS and Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks (who are using Lotek equipment).   Fish telemetry equipment is sold by several companies.  However the equipment required must be developed to include a coded system so that the multiple codes (Fish) could be followed on a single frequency. This reduces scan time and thus, optimizes the likelihood of detecting a tagged animal. The required equipment must also be designed to include CART tags (combined acoustic/radio transmitters) for work in dynamic conductivity environments like the Milk and Missouri rivers. The receivers are for use with "Lotek proprietary coded transmitters" and pulsed transmitters that are already implanted in fish by USGS and MFWP. The required receivers must eliminate the need for separate acoustic and radio receivers.   The required receivers must uniquely identify and store multiple codes simultaneously. Perhaps most importantly, we will work cooperatively with USGS and MTFWP whom are currently using Lotek equipment. Thus, we need equipment that can communicate with existing equipment without loosing anything in the electronic translation between existing equipment. Receiver stations are fixed and compatibility between peripheral equipment is a must as we will be using different applications between sites and with other agencies' equipment.  The coded transmitters already in use cannot be decoded with any other receiver except the SRX400A.  The environmental enclosures were specifically designed for the SRX400a data-logging station.  The LHP_1 hydrophones come equipped with a 45* directional baffle and has a specific connector enabling the hydrophone to be connected to the up-converter.  The up-converter also has specific connectors enabling the unit to be connected to the SRX400A receiver.  If you think your company can provide equipment that can meet the above requirements, please contact Bill Holbert in Acquisitions at 303-445-2448 to verify that your equipment will meet the requirements.

The Health and Humanitarian Assistance Program Manager serves as the principal advisor to the Mission in all facets of USAID Health and Humanitarian Assistance activities in Sri Lanka. The position is supervised by the Mission Director and involves participation and work on the Peace Dividend Team.

I.  Background: 

After 20 years, the island nation of Sri Lanka finds itself in transition:  no longer in open, armed conflict with the LTTE but not yet able to enjoy the benefit of a successful reconciliation.  USAID Sri Lanka's strategy for development is similarly undergoing change as the focus of individual programs shifts from working around conflict to working in a post conflict environment.  The adjustment has given rise to several program management and Mission staffing issues which this personnel action is intended to address.  Activities and reporting schedules and new dialogues initiated to identify appropriate responses to the ongoing peace process. USAID Sri Lanka's Humanitarian Assistance Program Manager whose duties and responsibilities are described below will have expanded responsibilities as a result of this transition. 
                      
The authorized position level of USAID Mission to Sri Lanka is 40 positions to be carried out by 3 US DH, 6 USPSCs and 31 FSNs who are organized as follows:

I - Mission Director¡¦ Office=4 (Includes 2 USDH, the Mission Director and a Program Officer and 2 FSNs.)

II - Economic Growth Team =11 (with a USDH Supervisory GDO at Team Leader of 10 FSNs, including 4 USAEP staff).

III - Peace Dividend Team=11 (Consisting of OTI=4 (2 USPSCs, 2 FSNs), DG=4 (4 FSNs) and Humanitarian Affairs=3 (1 USPSC-the position under this recruitment) and 2 FSNs).

IV - Support Services Team = 14 (3FSNs in Financial Mgt., a USPSC EXO and 10 FSN support staff).


Overview of Sri Lanka Health and Humanitarian Assistance Program:

The Health and Humanitarian Program Manager will focus on monitoring and managing activities being implemented under Strategic Objective (SO), ¡§Improved social and economic integration of targeted disadvantaged groups,¡¨ of the Mission¡¦s Country Strategy for FY 2003-2007.  USAID is concentrating on improving the sustainability and institutional capacity of Sri Lankan organizations to provide services for vulnerable groups.  To these ends, USAID is helping selected vulnerable groups to access these services so that they will be able to lead more productive lives.  

These groups include civilian victims of war, orphans and displaced children, people at high risk of contracting infectious diseases, and those people most susceptible to natural disasters and injury.   USAID¡¦s current Humanitarian Assistance portfolio includes:
 
Disability Support:  USAID is supporting programs that will train physical therapy assistants on wheelchair therapy at distribution centers.  This program focuses on advocacy and employment activities  and , importantly, on providing training and technical assistance  on the production of prosthetics, orthotics and wheeled mobility devices, with added emphasis on assessment, prescription, fit, and post fit care needed by users. These activities are implemented by a USAID-funded organization with local partner organizations in Galle, Kandy, Tangalle, Jaffna, and Colombo.

Support for Displaced Children and Orphans:   The USAID is awarding a grant to fund psycho-social services to your children traumatized by war, conflict and other threats to children and your people including sexual abuse.  This will entail child-centered play activities, preschools and week-end camps that will help children come to terms with the pressures and traumas associated with the conflict. 

Support for Torture Survivors:  In the coming year USAID will assist qualified international non-governmental organizations to fund community-based services to improve the lives of persons affected by violence.

The Mission Humanitarian Assistance Program Manager will have line responsibility in the Mission's organizational chart from which he/she will be expected to carry out the functions associated with the position of a USAID Program Manager.  This will include but not be limited to advice and support in program design, identification, coordination, significant implementation responsibilities, promotion and reporting.  At the outset, the Mission's HAP Manager will -- by virtue of extensive experience with other international donor agencies -- in the aforementioned areas be expected to contribute substantively to re-orienting the Mission's humanitarian assistance strategic objective in the emerging post conflict environment.  Later as program funding becomes available, the HAP Manager will be expected to be assigned and take specific management and implementation responsibilities in any new program activities that are undertaken.
  

II. Duties and Responsibilities:

1.  Program Strategy Development:  The USAID Sri Lanka Humanitarian Assistance Program Manager is expected to serve as a resource person in support of Mission management's effort to realign the health and humanitarian assistance portion of USAID Sri Lanka development assistance strategy.

In addition to liaison with appropriate offices in the GSL, this will also entail close and productive working relationships with community-based organizations, local NGOs and international Private and Voluntary Organizations (PVO).  

3.  Mission Disaster Response:  The incumbent serves as the point of contact for organizations, individuals and USAID disaster mitigation support personnel in the event of a disaster response.  This will require conducting immediate assessments with GSL representatives and community-level organization as appropriate, maintaining and revising as necessary the Mission Disaster Response Plan and Early Warning System, coordinating the USG response (including the responsibility for disbursement of funds, procurement of emergency supplies and material, and their distribution) assisting in the reporting requirement and interacting with the Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance (USAID/OFDA) as appropriate.  

4.  Other Responsibilities:  In general, the Mission's HAP Manager monitors the events impacting on the health and social services sector a result of Sri Lanka's post-conflict recovery.  Given the broad nature and close working relationship expect of the HAP Manager's involvement with Mission management, repeated engagement with specific tasks related to the USAID programming cycle is expected and will form part of the incumbent¡¦s continuing duties and responsibilities.

<RESPDATE>031204
<CONTACT>Point of Contact - Oralee Martin, Contract Specialist, 619-553-5347
<DESC>This is a Request for Information (RFI) and/or Sources Sought Synopsis.  The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center San Diego (SSC SD), Navigation and Applied Sciences Department (Code 230) is the principal Navy Research and Development Center for navigation sensors and systems; ocean survey systems for ocean-bottom mapping; and Air C4ISR equipment and systems. The NAICS code is 334220. DESCRIPTION: The purpose of this Sources Sought synopsis is to identify potential sources that are interested in responding to a future solicitation for efforts involving emerging technologies for lightweight, corrosion resistant ground plane for GPS anti-jam antenna mounting on ships.   Potential respondents are requested to submit an Information Statement not more than three (3) pages long that summarizes their experience relative to the following programs/technologies: The U.S. Navy plans to upgrade GPS installations on its sea platforms to enhance jamming resistance through use of available non-developmental-item (NDI) anti-jam antenna systems.  The Navy intends to utilize the existing GAS-1 Anti-Jam Antenna System including the seven-element Controlled Reception Pattern Antenna (CRPA) (AS-3821A/ARN, P/N 01-01664/00,1 NSN:5985-01-352-9676)  and Antenna Electronics (AE) (AS-3820C/AR, P/N 808352/000, NSN 5985-01-447-0682).  The Navy further intends to upgrade system performance by transitioning from analog antenna control to digital antenna control, exemplified by the Advanced Digital Antenna Product (ADAP) currently in development. GPS antenna applications for ships require a ground plane to provide a structural and electrical foundation for the antenna as well as an enclosure for the electronics. The ground plane must have optimal Radio Frequency (RF) characteristics, be lightweight for ship mast mass moment considerations, as well as have robust structural and environmental qualities to survive the harsh maritime environment. SkyDec B.V., a Netherlands company, has designed a composite material ground plane specifically tailored for the GAS-1 system in maritime applications. This ground plane and antenna combination has been integrated on foreign naval ships. As such, they are viewed as the only known company capable of providing production composite material ground planes in time to meet the Navy?s ongoing ship integration and installation schedule. Interested parties are invited to submit a Statement Of Capabilities (SOC) including a technical description of the ground plane sufficient for government evaluation of the system as a candidate alternative solution. Interested offerers must submit an SOC that clearly shows they are qualified to perform the effort and include  (1) physical and functional description of the item being offered (size, weight, and external interfaces); (2) performance specifications of the item;  (3) qualification data, and (5) cost. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS ONLY AN EXPRESSION OF INTEREST. Future requirements and procurements are uncertain. The Government DOES NOT intend to award a contract on the basis of this announcement.   All data received in response to this request for information and/or sources sought announcement that is marked or designated as corporate or proprietary information will be fully protected from release outside the government. The government will not recognize any costs associated with submission of information by interested parties. This is not a request for proposals and a solicitation is not available at this time.   Questions pertaining to this announcement may be directed to the POC, Ms. Oralee Martin at (619) 553-5347 or via e-mail at: oralee.martin@navy.mil The Information Statements are due by 4:00 P.M. local time on 12 March 2003 and should be submitted electronically to the POC e-mail address.  The following information should be included in the submittal: company name and address; company point of contact; company business size - small or large. This synopsis is also posted at the SPAWAR E-Commerce Central Website (https://e-commerce.spawar.navy.mil/). Interested parties are encouraged to review the website regularly for updated information.

<CONTACT>Brenda Fletcher, 410-278-0876
<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. The contractor shall provide a hydraulic control system to be u sed to facilitate the testing of various vehicles for transportability requirements.  Various size hydraulic cylinders combined with a computerized control system will be used to apply a constant load to the lifting or tie-down provisions on various vehicl es.  The loading varies from 200 pounds-force up to 200,000 pounds-force.The overall package shall be ruggedly constructed intended to be used out doors under ambient environmental conditions.  The package shall consist of a hydraulic power unit with a mot or starter/control, cabinet, an operator pendant, and linear actuators.  All cabinets and interface devices shall be of a construction grade that will offer NEMA 4X protection.  The operator interface shall be a pendent configuration that will be tethered to the main control cabinet and connected by an appropriate multi-pin connector offering the same grade of protection.  All cables between the controller and valves\actuators shall be shielded.  The operator interface shall be configured with a protective cover on the face for added protection.  The sequence of operation shall be: The operator will turn the power unit on and cycle the power unit fluid through a bypass valve for a warm up phase if necessary.  The optimum temperature is 125Ã‚Â°.  A temperatur e switch will generate an output to a lamp indicating the system is at operating temperature. The power unit will be controlled by the operator interface after initial start-up. The linear actuators required to provide the appropriate load will be selected  and located in the test bay and all electrical and hydraulic conductors will be connected. The operator will move the actuators, independently if required, to a position that will allow the operator to connect the rigging. Once the rigging is connected to  the actuators the operator will remove slack in the rigging for each actuator via the operator control pendant.  When the load on each actuator is equalized a test button will be activated that will synchronize the motion of the two actuators.  The actuat ors will hold this condition and be readied for the next phase.  During the next phase, the control will be actuated and the actuators will retract at a described velocity slowly and in a synchronized motion.  The actuator velocity will not exceed 3 inches  per second during the retract or extend phase.  The velocity in either direction is a variable control parameter.  Once the actuators meet a pre-selected tension, they will immediately move into a force mode. Once in the force mode, control valves will ge nerate a variable pressure to the annular side to each actuator matching the tension output of each control device (load cell).  The actuators will continue to retract until the pre-selected load is reached, hold the load for the length of time pre-selecte d then release to return to the initial setup position.  If the system becomes out of balance more than a pre-describe tension over a pre-described time period the unit will alert the operator of an impending failure and immediately stop the test and relax  the actuators. When the test has been completed or stopped do to exceeding preset limits, the actuators will move back to their initial setup position allowing the rigging to be removed or to setup another test. Diagnostic details will offer the operator insight as to the possible origin of a pending failure.  The system components shall consist of: Power Unit.  It is estimated that the power unit required to operate the system will contain the following items as a minimum, be trailer mounted with an appro priate cover for environmental protection, and equipped with a military style lunette hitch: L-Shaped 35 Gallon Reservoir and shelf base (suitable for forklift transport) to accommodate the motor and hose reels.  Tank to contain a Tank Heater, 2000 Watt, 230 Volt, Adjustable Temperature setting for outdoor temperature conditioning during cold weather. Piston pump, maximum 6 gpm, 5000 psi, pressure ompensated prov ides hydraulic power for the system.  This pressure permits the use of smaller actuators to achieve higher loads. 15 HP Electric Motor, TEFC, 460/230/60/3 1750 RPM  0-5000 psi gauge with snubber, rapid response relief valve, and a level/temperature switch.  Air Cooled Heat Exchanger with electric motor fan drive appropriately sized to provide adequate cooling during extended periods of operation with outdoor ambient air temperature of 90 degrees. Pressure filter, 3-micron, micro-glass element, non-bypass, an d a return filter, 3-micron, micro-glass, with visual indicator.Four Lifting Eyes located to provide level and stable lifting of the power unit. Desiccant dryer/ breather. Electrical Panel mounted and wired to provide appropriate displays and terminal stri ps for unit operation, such as, Start/ Stop station, fused disconnect NEMA 12 enclosure, miscellaneous relay and terminal strips, setup for temperature control of the hydraulic oil. Storage for the operator interface with100 feet of cable.  The cable has c onnectors on each end to permit routing the cable through small openings approximately 4 inches in diameter. 5000-psi electrical rewind dual-hose reels with 100' of 3/8-hose.  Reels to be approved by the government.  The Operator Interface shall provide a 15-inch touch screen interface that will allow the operator to establish the test parameters for up to 150 various test scenarios that shall include but not be limited to the following: Tension profile, Actuator Bore Size, Single or Dual Axis Test  Switch over pressure, moving from a position based control to a tension based control.
