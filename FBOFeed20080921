D. Introduction and Background:  

The Presidents Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) initiative is the largest commitment ever by a nation toward an international health initiative for a single disease. Its first phase is a five-year, $15 billion, multifaceted approach to combating the disease in more than 100 countries around the world.  The strategy places particular emphasis on 15 focus countries in Africa, the Caribbean and Asia (including Vietnam) that represent approximately half the worlds infections.  In these 15 countries, PEPFAR aims to treat two million HIV-infected individuals, prevent seven million new infections and to provide care and support for ten million HIV-infected individuals and orphans.  

Vietnam became the 15th focus country of the Emergency Plan in June 2004.  Under the Emergency Plan, Vietnam received $18 million in FY04, $28 million in FY05, $34 million in FY06, and $66 million in FY07 to support a comprehensive HIV/AIDS prevention, treatment and care program.   The FY08 budget is approximately $89 million. Funding levels allocated to the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) for this period were $19 million in FY04, $17 million in FY05, $20 million in FY06, $40 million in FY07 and about $47 million in FY08.

The PEPFAR targets established for Vietnam are to prevent 610,000 new infections, to provide care services for 110,000 people and to provide ARV treatment for 22,000 people by fiscal year 2008.

The USG response in Vietnam includes a focus both on communities and on the public sector to:

	Assist Vietnam to develop comprehensive models of HIV/AIDS prevention, treatment, care and support and associated networks to include medicine assisted therapy for IV drug users and substance abuse reduction.
	Support efforts to reduce stigma and discrimination against people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) and people affected by HIV/AIDS and advocate for greater involvement of PLWHA at all levels of HIV/AIDS program development, implementation and monitoring.
	Train Vietnamese clinicians in HIV/AIDS care and treatment, counseling and support, and consistent use of standard operating procedures and routine monitoring.
	Assist the Ministry of Health (MOH) to develop targeted peer outreach for Most-at-Risk-Populations (MARPs), voluntary HIV/AIDS counseling and testing (VCT) sites, and outpatient clinics as part of the referral network.
	Increase the public health management capacity of Vietnamese government workers.
	Assist the MOH to develop a national HIV reference laboratory, including quality assurance and quality control systems. 
	Provide technical assistance on the development of the National HIV/AIDS Law protecting the rights of PLWHA.
	Assist in the development of care and treatment coordination unit within the MOH by funding a care and treatment coordination position in the unit.
	Provide support in establishing one national surveillance and monitoring and evaluation system at the national and local levels.

A consortium of USG agencies is charged with coordinating and managing PEPFAR under the leadership of the U.S. Ambassador.  These agencies include USAID, the Department of State, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (HHS/CDC), and the Department of Defense (DoD).  The goal is to develop and implement one coherent USG HIV/AIDS program in Vietnam combining the comparative strengths and capabilities of all the government agencies.  The Chief of Mission (COM) provides overall guidance to the interagency team and the PEPFAR Coordination Office facilitates complementarities among the various activities by the USG agencies, host government and other HIV/AIDS donors in Vietnam.
