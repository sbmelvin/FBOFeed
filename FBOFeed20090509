<DESC>The contracted  Vessel shall support the following activities:Operations shall be conducted in Dry Tortugas National Park near 24.5 degrees North, and 083.0 degrees West.
Biological data will be collected by SCUBA divers using non-destructive, in situ, fishery independent visual monitoring methods.  The scientific investigators are uniquely qualified to conduct this research base on past research and experience in the study area.  The proposed sampling survey will obtain about 500 visual census point samples over a short period to provide a spatially integrated "snapshot" of the exploited reef fish community four years after the area was impacted by several hurricanes and two years after the no-take marine reserve 'Research Natural Area' was implemented in Dry Tortugas National Park.  This work requires a labor-intensive effort with no shortcuts to ensure that sampling is cost-effective and precise.  At a rate of 4-6 reef fish visual census samples per diver day (depending on depth), 10 field days of ship support are required to provide sufficient spatial coverage of the park.  By sampling both in and out of the new marine reserve, science divers will provide: (1) spatially explicit estimates of population abundance and biomass by sizs (age) groups for both exploited and non exploited species essential for quantitative stock assessments; (2) statistical characterization reef "habitats" in terms of nursery and polulation productivity value; and(3) critical data with which to begin to evaluate the effectiveness of the new no-take marine reserve.
SCHEDULE
Diving operations shall require a single leg of 10 full operational days.  Port days shall occur at the beginning and end of the single trip (two port days total)
Dates of the cruises shall be as follows unless both parties agree to changes:
July 20, 2009  Port day: On-land all personnel and equipment. Set up equipment and conduct personnel briefs,  Vessel to depart for Dry Tortugas at such time as to arrive at first dive site by 0800 hours on July 21, 2009.

July 31, 2009 Port day:  Vessel arrives at port, off-loads all scientific personnel and equipment
Technical tasks and deliverables:
The vendor will provide charter of a research vessel for one research cruise to the Dry Tortugas region (SE Gulf of Mexico) for the dates of July 21 thru 30, 2009, with port days before and after the cruise.  Charter vessel and operations will be in accord with National Park Service Commercial Use Agreement.  The charter will include accommodation and food for a party of 24 researchers  and diving support for researchers including a Nitroix gas compressor systen and scuba tank fills.

Therefore, the vendor shall specify the departure time from the port of embarkation at lease twelve (12) hours prior to departure time and upon returning to allow science personnel to on-load/off load equipment and personal gear.

<DESC>Notice of Intent - SSA Office of Communications needs to replace its 20-year-old studio and field prompter systems in SSA's Broadcast Studio at SSA Headquarters, Baltimore Maryland.  The currently-installed prompter system contains many features that are out of date, or broken and not repairable.  There are newer, easier to use and energy efficient systems available with multiple features that will facilitate the needs of the studio and field production. The newer systems use less energy and at the same time provide more prompter text visibility in the studio and on location. For SSA, a critical feature is the ability to import documents and data from various Windows Office formats in multiple languages.  SSA's current prompter system does not contain character sets for any languages other than English. As SSA's outreach efforts to non-English speaking groups increases, this feature will be quite valuable to the agency in the near future.  SSA intends to negotiate with the York Telecom Corporation of Eatontown, New Jersey for a replacement teleprompting system that meets SSA’s requirement.  York Telecom is uniquely qualified in that SSA currently has a maintenance contract with them for SSA studios.  The Teleprompter system requested will be an integral part of the Broadcast Center’s Studio and Field Production Units.  This system is used to display scripts through the lens of the camera and will be used by all levels of on-camera talent from the Commissioner to professional talent who are paid for their time.  This equipment is installed on the front of the camera.  If a Third Party were to install this equipment on the cameras, it could void the on-going maintenance agreement for the cameras which York Telecom Corporation now maintains.  If the teleprompter failed to function properly, it would be difficult to assess the responsibility.  This could lead to significant downtime which is unacceptable to the Office of Communications and its clients.  See Note #22.

<DESC><p>In the first modification, the solicitation availability date was scheduled to be on or about May 7, 2009. This modification is incorporating a new solicitation availability date of May 20, 2009 with an anticipated date of receipts for quotations to be on June 24, 2009 (2:00 p.m. Central Standard Time). These dates are projected estimates, and thus potential quoters should refer to the solicitation (SF-1449-Block #8) for the actual quotation deadlines. The Contracting Officer anticipates awarding a indefinite-delivery, requirements type contract with firm-fixed unit prices. This solicitation is 100% small business set-aside. This modification maintains all the terms of the original synopsis excluding the change in the availability date. Please ensure your compliance with the terms when providing a quote.</p>
