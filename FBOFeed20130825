(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability.

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This solicitation is being issued in conjunction with FAR Part 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures, as applicable. The solicitation number is FDA-13-223-1120004. This solicitation is issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ).
<p>The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) FAC 2005-69, dated August 1, 2013.</p>
<p>The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is - 541711 - Research and Development in Biotechnology; Small Business Size Standard is 500 in number of employees.</p>
<p>The US Food &amp; Drug Administration (FDA) intends to issue a Commercial Item UFirm Fixed-PriceU purchase order that meets the following specifications below.</p>
<p>SUPPLIES OR SERVICES AND PRICES/COSTS</p>

<p>Background:</p>
<p>The FDA Office of Regulatory Affairs (ORA), Winchester Engineering and Analytical Center (WEAC), has a requirement to purchase coronary stents (bare metal and drug-eluting) and peripheral stents for the simulated-use bench testing phase of ORA's Challenge Initiative Stent Project (for Fracture) in coordination with Academia (i.e., Massachusetts Institute of Technology-MIT).</p>
<p>Over 1.3 million vascular stents are deployed in US patients every year. However, a number of these stent implants are prematurely failing because of material fractures, which affect 3.5% to 4.5% of coronary stents, 28% of carotid artery stents, and up to 37% of peripheral stents. The goals established for this current stent project for stent fractures are (1) to develop multi-mode, simulated-use fatigue test equipment and methods for bench testing post-market vascular stents, (2) to collaborate and work with MIT to develop a basic understanding of the critical parameters and determinants that lead to stent fractures and their consequences on adjacent vascular tissue, and (3) to develop a FDA test method for post-market stents.</p>
<p>ORA has identified the items, to include the manufacturer and part numbers, under the supplies or services and price/costs section that will meet ORA's requirement. However, "or equal" quotes will be accepted and evaluated from all interested parties, but the proposed coronary stents shall be equivalent to the items identified in this solicitation.</p>
<p>Place of Performance:</p>
<p>The delivery address will be: HHS/FDA/ORA/WEAC, 109 Holton St., Winchester, MA 01890.</p>
<p>Period of Performance:</p>

The Contracting Officer is the only person authorized to make or approve any changes in any of the requirements of this contract, and, notwithstanding any provisions contained elsewhere in this contract, the said authority remains solely in the Contracting Officer. In the event the contractor makes any changes at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract terms and conditions, including price. <BR> <BR>Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) (APR 2010) (a) ___________ is hereby designated as the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR).

Any contractor request for changes shall be referred to the Contracting Officer directly or through the COR. No such changes shall be made without the express written prior authorization of the Contracting Officer. The Contracting Officer may designate assistant or alternate COR(s) to act for the COR by naming such assistant/alternate(s) in writing and transmitting a copy of such designation to the contractor. <BR> <BR>Insert the clause 1352.209?73, Compliance with the Laws, in all solicitations and contracts. As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(c), insert the following clause: Compliance With the Laws (APR 2010) The contractor shall comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations which deal with or relate to performance in accord with the terms of the contract. <BR> <BR>As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(d), insert the following clause: Organizational Conflict of Interest (APR 2010) (a) Purpose. The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors: (1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and (2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract. (b) Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as ?contractor?) in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venturer, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both. (c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage.

The terms ?contract,? ?contractor,? and ?Contracting Officer? shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights. (f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507?1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk.
