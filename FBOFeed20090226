<DESC><p>Air Force Research Laboratory, Materials and Manufacturing Technology Directorate, Nondestructive Evaluation Branch, AFRL/RXLP Wright Research Site is soliciting technical and cost proposals for the following research. The objective of the program is to conduct on-site research to bridge the the gaps and accelerate the initial development of selected NDE technology to a level of full feasibility demonstration, to conduct studies of the applicability of selected technologies to a wide variety of potential applications, or development of new technologies to address specific needs. Research is comtemplated to address current operational or maintenance needs.<br />Because the nature and make-up of advanced aerospace materials and structures are diverse and complex, a comprehensive planning and execution of NDE research is anticipated. There are numerous well established NDE tools and techniques for use in NDE research. A partial list includes, but is not limited to: eddy current, ultrasound, X-Ray based methods, liquid penetrant, magnetic particle, boroscopy, laser based methods, terahertz methods, microwave methods, thermography, shearography, acoustic emission, and on-board monitoring methods. It is envisioned that NDE research will also require advances in the state-of-the-art, necessitating the development of new and unique tools and techniques in addition to the tools and techniques enumerated above. Materials that will be the subject of NDE research may include, but are not limited to, the following materials and their associated composites: aluminum alloys; magnesium alloys; titanium alloys; nickel alloys; steels; refractory metals; advanced intermetallic compounds; niobium alloys; ceramics - monolithic; high-temperature structural ceramics based on oxides, nitrides, silicides, carbides, and borides; nanocrystalline and/or multi-layered component systems of metallics, intermetallics, ceramics, and organic materials; structural and nonstructural polymers as well as functionally graded materials, electronic materials, sensor materials, coatings and paint materials. Structures that will be the subject of NDE research will be made of the above materials and may include, but are not limited to the following structures: simple plates; multilayered plate structures; plates with attached stiffeners/structure (bonded, fastened, or integral); plates or structures with rough or irregular finishes; or combinations of the previously mentioned structures.<br />Proposals will maximize the research efficiency and demonstrate relevance by: 1) identifying appropriate material systems and components based on their specific inspection deficiencies, 2) identifying and developing an understanding of the limitations of the inspection method including the physics and mechanics of excitation, interaction with the material, and signal processing, 3) developing, adapting or improving techniques to characterize damage precursors, initiation and accumulation under laboratory or simulated component usage conditions, 4) developing or improving analytical models to simulate accurately the interaction of chosen NDE method with degradation, deformation, and failure mechanisms in laboratory or realistic conditions, 5) verifying the accuracy and applicability of the analytical models using experimental data and demonstrating the improvements in material state awareness capability, 6) transitioning the knowledge obtained, models, experimental data, and testing methods/technologies to appropriate Air Force customers, suppliers and the scientific community, and 7) developing enabling technology for material health, on-board or in-situ monitoring.</p>

<p style="MARGIN: 0in 0.5in 0pt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The Department of Homeland Security Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Individual Assistance Division (IA) mission is to ensure that individuals and families that have been impacted by disasters and major catastrophic events have access to the full range of FEMA programs in the most expeditious and cost effective manner available. FEMA's goal is to provide the highest level of quality in these services as possible to such individuals. In order to accomplish this goal, FEMA has a requirement for contractors to provide comprehensive emergency management, project management and program management services as well as construction, architectural, and engineering capabilities to support the IA mission in four areas:&nbsp; (a) Housing Support&nbsp; (b) Construction Services, (c) Mass Care, and (d) Planning, Staffing and Logistics Services. Contractor support must be available for multiple disaster missions of any size, anywhere within their awarded regional sector to provide disaster relief services to individuals within the United States and its territories.&nbsp; While these contracts are generally intended to support response to an initial recovery from high impact larger Presidentially-declared Major Disaster related missions, the contracts do not preclude FEMA from contracting with others, such as local or small businesses when market research or available information indicates that such entities have the capacity and capability to meet FEMA's requirement(s). FEMA's Acquisition strategy is to divide the U.S. and it's territories into four regional Sectors as follows:&nbsp; Alpha Sector (FEMA Regions 8, 9 and 10); Bravo Sector (FEMA Regions 1, 2 and 5); Charlie Sector (FEMA Regions 6 and 7); and Delta Sector (FEMA Regions 3 and 4).&nbsp;&nbsp; The solicitation will therefore allow for four (4) separate (single) IDIQ hybrid cost reimbursement, fixed priced, and time and materials contracts to be awarded; and each successful offeror will be assigned responsibility for one of the sectors indicated above. Each contract shall be a five (5) year contract. After the award of the four (4) IDIQ contracts to separate contractors for a determined sector, no further competition for subsequent task orders will take place, unless the Government determines that an awardee cannot perform the services and terminates the contract; the impact of a single disaster/catastrophic event is or becomes so overwhelming that it exceeds the ability, capacity, or capability of a sector awardee in a manner that the sector awardee cannot perform the services in the time and at the quality level and quantity required by the Government: in such a case, the Government reserves the right to compete the task order among the other three (3) awardees to meet the shortfall(s), or conduct an other than full and open competition to award a contract for services in that sector, to one of the other three (3) vendors, in a case where a sector awardee's contract has been terminated. The NAICS code applicable to this solicitation is 561210 Facilities Support Services. The small business size standard is $32.5 million.&nbsp;&nbsp; This requirement will be competed using FAR Part 15 procedures. The Request for proposal is anticipated to be released on February 19, 2009.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Any question regarding this pre-solicitation must be in writing and will be answered during the release of the RFP.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Questions/Answers: contractors shall submit all questions regarding this requirement by email to Zahra Hashmi, the Contract Specialist at <a href="mailto:zahr.hashmi@dhs.gov">zahra.hashmi@dhs.gov</a>, and copy <a href="mailto:charles.clemons@dhs.gov">charles.clemons@dhs.gov</a>.</span></p>

<DESC><p>The National Geospatial Intelligence Agency (NGA) has a mission requirement to provide solid three dimensional (3D) terrain models over customer specified areas. These models are physical models, precisely cut in dense polyurethane foam that holds exacting detail giving a realistic rendering of the terrain and image for NGA's customers. Weight, brittleness, and exacting image detail giving a completely realistic rendering of the land formations is critical to meeting NGA's mission. To meet these requirements, NGA's performance standards are: 1. The weight of the finished model must not exceed 10-12 pounds maximum for a 12" x 12" model with 16" of relief; 2. Brittleness - little or no damage can be sustained when a 12" x 12" x 16" model is dropped from a 7-8 foot height; and 3. Image - print resolution to be at 300 dots per inch or greater. NGA owns the equipment and software to produce these models requiring use of patented technology of STM, Inc. In order to continue to meet the NGA's mission, this synopsis is to advertise NGA's intent to procure sole source from STM, Inc. a license to use their US patented technology (US Patent numbers 7216003 and 7291364) of their intellectual property included in the government owned equipment and software for a period of one year commencing 1 April 2009-31 March 2010. All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the Agency.</p>

<DESC>DESCRIPTION: 
The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b) (1), with Zeiss Microimaging, Inc., of Thornwood, New York, for the acquisition of Laser Scanning Confocal Microscope System. 

*** NIST cites FAR 6.302-1(a)(ii)(A) and (B) (see excerpt below) as primary rationale for Sole Source Determination.
(ii) Supplies may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of a follow-on contract for the continued development or production of a major system or highly specialized equipment, including major components thereof, when it is likely that award to any other source would result in --
(A) Substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition, or
(B) Unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency’s requirements. (See 10 U.S.C. 2304(d)(1)(B) or 41 U.S.C. 253 (d)(1)(B).)

This requirement is for a Laser Scanning Confocal Microscope System.  

A major system is being developed by the Polymeric Materials Group of NIST’s Building and Fire Research Laboratory for laser scanning confocal microscopy in order to conduct studies regarding the durability and service life of polymer systems (filled and unfilled).  These studies will involve measuring surface/subsurface morphology, microstructure, and flurorescence using multiple laser lines. 

Sole source justification is based on the fact that only Zeiss Microimaging’s LSCM is the only one in the marketplace that offers fluorescence excitation in laser scanning microscopy using multiple laser lines coming from one source.  This technology is protected by US patent and is not licensed to other vendors.  This ability is critical to NIST’s planned experiments to measure surface/subsurface morphology, microstructure, and fluorescence to determine the durability and service life of polymer systems.  

In addition, the required Zeiss LSCM will be replacing an existing Zeiss LSM.  The LSCM will be completely compatible with all of the peripheral elements currently owned and in use by NIST with the existing LSM, including software, which will save NIST significant replacement time and costs.

Zeiss Microimaging is the only known vendor capable of supplying the required Laser Scanning Confocal Microscope System.  Sourcing this instrument from any other vendor would require the replacement of the existing illumination device, filter, scanning parts, objectives, environment (including floating table), halogen and HBO light sources, as well as software, incurring an unacceptable delay in the development of the LSCM system as well as unnecessary duplication of costs.

***Delivery shall be FOB DESTINATION and be completed in accordance with the Contractor’s commercial schedule. ***

*** As defined in the Federal Acquisition Regulation, (FAR), FOB Destination means: The contractor shall pack and mark the shipment in conformance with carrier requirements, deliver the shipment in good order and condition to the point of delivery specified in the purchase order, be responsible for any loss of and/or damage to the goods occurring before receipt and acceptance of the shipment by the consignee at the delivery point specified in the purchase order; and pay all charges to the specified point of delivery.  The contractor shall deliver all line items to NIST, Gaithersburg, MD  20899. ***

*****The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 333314, and the size standard is 500 Employees.

******A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

*****No solicitation package will be issued.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations.  However, responses received by will be considered by the Government.

Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. In order to receive an award, contractors must be registered and have valid certification in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA).</p>

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center, Weapons Division, Point Mugu, CA intends to negotiate and award a firm fixed price contract, using other than full and open competition.  Negotiations will be conducted with Orbit Instrument Electronics Group, 80 Cabot Court, Hauppauge, NY 11788 in order to procure 32 Airborne Keyboard and Pointing Devices (AKPDs) for the EA-6B ICAP-III aircraft.  Orbit provided all of the AKPDs for the ICAP II to ICAP III modification program which was completed in 2004. Since all of the Navy's known requirements were procured for this program, the government had no need to acquire the technical data package which would have provided the tooling requirements, fabrication instructions and Level III drawings necessary for any other source to produce these items. As the designer and developer of the AKPDs, Orbit Instrument is the only known source capable of manufacturing these items because it alone possesses the technical package and Level III drawings necessary to accomplish this.  The government anticipates a May 2009 award with two separate delivery dates in August and September 2009.  This notice is not a request for competitive proposals; however, any interested firm, other than Orbit Instrument, should respond in accordance with numbered notes 22 and 26.

<DESC>The Naval Explosive Ordnance Disposal Technology Division (NAVEODTECHDIV) is issuing this BAA in support of the Road Side Detection of Explosively Formed Penetrator (EFPs) requirement which is sponsored by the Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Organization (JIEDDO). The purpose of this effort is to identify and demonstrate technologies for vehicle-based applications to improve the detection of road side EFPs; based on the success and feasibility of the technologies demonstrated, follow on work may be pursued.  Although hardware, software, or techniques developed as a result of contracts awarded under this BAA are primarily intended for transition to route-clearance type military activities, developed capabilities may be transitioned or applied to any future joint service combat mission requiring EFP detection.
Paper copies of this announcement will not be issued.  In addition, NAVEODTECHDIV reserves the right to select for award all, some, or none of the proposals in response to this announcement.  NAVEODTECHDIV will provide no funding for direct reimbursement of proposal development costs.  Technical and cost proposals (or any other material) submitted in response to this BAA will not be returned.  It is the policy of NAVEODTECHDIV to treat all proposals as sensitive competitive information and to disclose their contents only for the purposes of evaluation.
This BAA will remain open for approximately two (2) months from the date of publication.  Proposals may be submitted at any time during this period.  
I. General Information    1.  BAA Issuing Agency Name -  Naval Explosive Ordnance Disposal Technology Division (NAVEODTECHDIV)2.  Contracting Agency Name -  Naval Surface Warfare Center, Indian Head Division (NSWC-IHD)3.  Sponsoring Agency Name - Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Office4.  Program Name -  Road Side Detection of Explosively Formed Penetrators (EFPs)5. Research Opportunity Number - BAAN0464A09016.  Response Date -  27 April 2009Vendors responding to this BAA may begin submitting responses on 27 February 2009, 0800 hours Eastern Standard Time (EST).  Final submissions to this BAA are due by 27 April 2009, 1600 hours Eastern Standard Time (EST).  In addition, NAVEODTECHDIV reserves the right to award contracts for a period of approximately one (1) year from date of this announcement.  7. Description of Opportunity - The intention of NAVSEA, through issuance of this BAA, is to solicit full proposals for the Road Side Detection of EFPs initiative sponsored by the Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Organization (JIEDDO)  Full proposals are sought that address hardware, software, techniques, or technology developments for EFP detection; specific requirements are identified below.  Successful demonstration of a capability for Roadside EFP detection during this demonstration phase may lead to follow-on development work. Vendors are responsible for ensuring that their proposals are complete and submitted in a timely fashion.   
A.  Definition of Problem/Threat:  An Explosively Formed Penetrator (EFP) is a class of Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) with a shaped warhead designed to effectively penetrate armor at stand-off distances. An EFP is composed of three major components: 1) an arming device, 2) a trigger device and 3) the explosive device.  The explosive device component consists of four elements: a concave metal liner, case, base plate and explosive charge. The case holding the explosive is generally cylindrical, fabricated from commonly available materials (PVC or steel pipe), with the forward end closed by a concave copper or steel disk-shaped liner to create the penetrator. Generally the military grade explosive is loaded behind the metal liner to fill the casing. A blasting cap initiator is placed through a hole centered in the base plate. Upon detonation, the explosives propel the liner to form a projectile in a direction in-line with the EFP at speeds well over one kilometer per seco! nd, depending on the design and type of explosive used. Detonation is controlled by command wire, radio control or remote arming with trigger. EFP's can be deployed singly, in pairs, or in arrays, and camouflaged in painted foam to look similar to natural rocks or man-made artifacts. 
B.  Vendor Test Requirements:  Vendors shall provide proposals for system demonstrations to detect and discriminate road side EFPs from a moving vehicle, modifications and/or minor development to enhance system capability after data acquisition activities, performing a blind testing and processing of the data. All data must be gathered by a moving platform (provided by the vendor) capable of maintaining the required speeds. The end-goal of this effort will be to integrate the technology/system on a vehicle capable of performing route clearance operations. Systems may include, but are not limited to: RADARs, IR and acoustics detecting one or several EFP components. NAVEODTECHDIV will convene a special board of subject matter experts to review all proposals, taking into consideration, the techniques proposed. NAVEODTECH DIV may choose to award one, none or several contracts. NAVEODTECHDIV may also reissue the BAA if no proposals are found to be acceptable. Systems must meet th! e following criteria:
a)	Ready to demonstrate a data acquisition capability within one month of contract award. b)	Vendors must attend a one day pre-testing in-brief and a one day post-testing out-brief at either NAVEODTECHDIV, Indian Head, MD or JIEDDO - Crystal City (dates TBD).c)	System testing: The vendor will be required to participate in two events: Phase I - data acquisition/demonstration and Phase II - blind testing.a.	Phase I data acquisition event will occur approximately one month after contract award. Phase I supports the vendor by allowing the calibration of instruments on four scenes over the course of two days; these two days will include system set-up, data acquisition/testing, and system tear down. The vendor is encouraged to collect all possible information, during the allotted timeframe, that supports training of sensors and algorithms to detect EFPs and reject clutter. NAVEODTECHDIV will record the location of all emplaced threat items and clutter in UTM coordinates and provide that information to the vendor. It is NAVEODTECHDIV's hope that providing the vendor the opportunity to examine the threats, acquire data under realistic conditions and understand threat scenarios, that technologies/systems with better performance characteristics will be developed. It is NAVEODTECHDIV's intent to hold Phase I testing, if at all possible, on the East Coast of the United States, BUT if ! specific technical system specifications prevent this data acquisition and testing from being performed at local ranges, Yuma Proving Ground, Arizona; NSWC China Lake or other suitable West Coast government facility may be used.b.	Phase II testing will occur approximately six (6) weeks after completion of Phase I data acquisition activities. Phase II will be a blind test in an operationally relevant environment. Testing will consist of two days at the range; this includes system set-up, testing and system tear down. The vendor will be given no information on size, type, location of EFPs or clutter etc. Phase I and Phase II, for each vendor, will be performed at the same government test range. d)	Data Requirements (Phase II):a.	The vendor will provide NAVEODTECHDIV a truth table within 14 days of completing Phase II testing. The table shall identify all detections found (EFPs and clutter) and the locations, in the test area, in UTM coordinates.b.	The vendor will provide the following information for all detections (EFP and clutter):i.	UTM coordinates of all detected objectsii.	Time of detections (GMT)iii.	UTM coordinates of sensor at time of detectionsiv.	Vehicle speed in mph at time of detectionsv.	Bearing of the vehicle relative to true north at time of detections.c.	Vehicles will be supplied by the vendor as part of their system and will be tested at speeds: 1.5 mph, 3.0 mph, 5.0 mph, 10 mph, and 15 mph (with the faster speeds being the more relevant). Data provided will be recorded and evaluated at those speedsd.	The vendor will be required to acquire and store at least 1000 meters worth of test data at the required speeds in a single pass.e.	The vendor must have a sufficiently accurate means of providing both vehicle and ground truth data such that detections are within 2 meters of the threat.
C.  Follow-on Work Evaluation Criteria:Potential for follow-on work will be based on successful performance during Phase II testing as described by the evaluated criteria below:a)	Calculated probability of detection and false alarm rates.b)	Detections calculated in real-time will receive a more favorable consideration than those that require post-processing.c)	Detections that occur at speeds equal to or greater than 15 mph, alert the driver and allow stopping of the vehicle before entering the kill zone will receive more favorable consideration than those that cannot.d)	Reported detections that are within two meters of ground truth will be counted as detections; remaining detections (outside the two meters) will be considered false alarms.
NAVEODTECHDIV may choose none, one or several vendors for follow-on development based on the outcome of Phase II testing specified by the criteria above.
D.  Other Unspecified Capabilities and Solutions:Offeror(s) possessing any additional technology, information, or recommendations that would enhance counter EFP prediction, detection, neutralization, mitigation systems and training solutions are encouraged to submit proposals to this BAA.

NOTICE TO PROSPECTIVE SUPPLIERS (Apr 1999) (a) This procurement is subject to the Navy's Red/Yellow/Green (RYG) Program. RYG is authorized by the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Acquisition) for use in the acquisition of supplies and services used to build, maintain and operate the fleet. (b) The Government reserves the right to award to the supplier whose quote represents the best value to the Government. As such, the basis for award will include an evaluation of each supplier's past performance history for the Federal Supply Class(s) or Service Code (FSCs) of the supplies and services being purchased. The price to be considered in determining best value will be ! the evaluated price after application of the Technical Evaluation Adjustments (TEAs). (c) The procedures described in the clause entitled "Additional Evaluation Factor for Consideration of Past Performance - Navy Red/Yellow/Green Program (APR 1999), will be used to assist in determining the best value for the Government. ADDITIONAL EVALUATION FACTOR FOR CONSIDERATION OF PAST PERFORMANCE-NAVY RED/YELLOW/GREEN PROGRAM (APR 1999) (a) This procurement is subject to the Navy's Red/Yellow/Green Program, authorized by the Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Research, Development and Acquisition) for use by participating activities during the acquisition of supplies and services used to build, maintain and operate the Fleet. (b) The purpose of RYG is to assist contracting personnel during source selection to determine the best value for the Government. The program uses accumulated supplier past performance data to classify each supplier's performance by Federal Supply Class(es) or Ser! vice Code(s) (FSCs) as either red (high risk), yellow (moderate risk), green (low risk), or neutral (no risk established). (c) To assist in source selection a monetary assessment in the form of a Technical Evaluation Adjustment (TEA) is added to each supplier's quote having a red or yellow classification for the FSC involved. The dollar amount of the red or yellow TEA assessment is based on the cost to the Government of effecting additional actions required to assure performance by a supplier with an unsatisfactory performance history for the FSC involved. No TEA is assessed for a supplier having either a green or neutral FSC RYG classification. For purposes of the RYG program, a neutral classification is assigned to suppliers who are first time quoters to the Government for the FSC(s) involved; suppliers otherwise having no past performance data in the RYG database for the FSC(s) involved, and suppliers who past performance data in the RYG data for the FSC(s) involved are over three years old. After consideration of any other pertinent, price!  related factors (e.g., transportation charges, first article testing, and discount terms), the adjusted price becomes the basis for determining award. A supplier's FSC RYG classification may change over time as new or revised performance data becomes available. (d) RYG classifications are summarized as follows: (1) Green is low risk. No performance assurance actions are considered necessary. No TEA will be assessed. (2) Yellow is moderate risk. Additional performance assuring actions are considered necessary. A TEA will be applied to the prospective supplier's price to reflect the Government's estimated additional costs. (3) Red is high risk. Significant additional performance assurance requirements are considered necessary. A TEA will be applied to the prospective supplier's price to reflect the Government's estimated additional costs. (4) Neutral is no risk established. No TEA is assessed; nevertheless, additional performance assurance requirements may be considered nece! ssary to assure quality and on-time delivery. (e) RYG classifications for all applicable FSC(s) are established monthly for each supplier and provided to them. Suppliers may address questions about the program or their FSC RYG classifications to the Naval Sea Logistics Center (NSLC) Portsmouth Detachment, Federal Building, Room 400, 80 Daniel Street, Portsmouth NH 03801-3884, telephone number 603-431-9460, ext 464, FAX 603-431-9464. Suppliers may also access their individual FSC RYG classifications through the automated vendor access program. To obtain automated access, a written request must be submitted on company letterhead to NSLC at the above address. The request must include the requester's name, title, company name, address, telephone number and Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code. The CAGE code is mandatory. In response, NSLC will provide each supplier, at no charge, an individual password, all required software, and information on accessing their individual data. REQUIREMENTS FOR ACCESS TO NNSY Contractors' representatives mu! st be United States citizens. Representatives are to provide the NNSY Security Office proof of U.S. citizenship (i.e. DHS I-9 FORM. "Employee Eligibility Verification Form.")  The I-9 is based on presentation of appropriate documentation that both verifies the employee's eligibility for employment and denotes his citizenship status. Contractors can go to http://www.nnsy1.navy.mil/Security/docs/i-9.pdf to acquire the required form and completion guidance. NOTE: (1) The I-9 must be provided before a badge will be issued for unclassified contract work, for access to the shipyard. (2) If the contract requires access to classified material, a visit request identifying the employee's clearance status may suffice depending on the employee's status within the JPAS database. (3) In the case of contractor truck drivers, knowing some are owner operators, if they are carrying proof of citizenship they can be issued a badge for access to drop off/pick up material. (4) If the truck drive! r does not have sufficient documentation and the sponsor is willing to escort the driver to/from the desired location, a by-escort badge may be issued. VENDORS/CONTRACTORS SHALL FORWARD ALL VISIT REQUESTS ON THEIR COMPANY LETTERHEAD SIGNED BY AN AUTHORIZED COMPANY OFFICER. Vendors/contractors shall provide FULL name, FULL SSN, Date of Birth, Place of Birth and a specific statement attesting that the person(s) for whom they are requesting access are citizens of the United States. By so stating, the vendor/contractor is certifying that they have positive documentation of that person's citizenship on file (i.e. a signed and verified EEVF I-9 form). The request shall also state the specific reason for the visit request and the specific date(s) for which they are requesting access to Norfolk Naval Shipyard (i.e., date of delivery). Material Shipments: Upon completion of the above documentation, vendors/contractors shall fax the letter to the Material Division (phone: 757-396-3141 and fax: 757-396-1029). Service contractor: Upon completion of the ab! ove documentation, vendors/contractors shall fax the letter to Technical Point of Contact listed in the contract. IF THE PERSON FOR WHOM THE VENVOR/CONTRACTOR IS REQUESTING A BADGE WAS BORN IN A FOREIGN COUNTRY, THAT PERSON SHALL BRING POSITIVE DOCUMENTATION OF UNITED STATES CITIZENSHIP TO THE NORFOLK NAVAL SHIPYARD PASS OFFICE IN ADDITION TO THE COMPANY LETTER. The additional documentation can be a birth certificate, passport or other official military documentation of United States citizenship. Once presented, it will be entered in the database and be available for future use so this step will not be required to be repeated. If the person for whom the vendor/contractor is requesting a badge is a naturalized United States citizen, that person SHALL BRING THEIR ORIGINAL NATURALIZATION papers with them to the pass office in addition to the aforementioned company letter. Once presented, it will be entered in the database and be available for future use so this step will not b! e required to be repeated. ******* End of Combined Synopsis/Solicitation ********

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

BULGARIA: NATIONAL ICT NETWORK PROJECT.

The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study ("Study") on a proposed project to link pre-existing local and national government networks in Bulgaria.

In 2002, the Government of Bulgaria launched a formal e-government program aimed at modernizing the country's public administration system. This program has promoted the development of IT services and systems designed to improve the functionality of government systems, improve government services, and create a more efficient and transparent state administration. The Grantee, which was established in 2005, is solely responsible for telecommunications network management, ICT-related policy implementation, and public-sector ICT synchronization and coordination throughout Bulgaria. Its goals are closely attuned to wider Bulgarian e-government goals, since it has identified severe limitations in the capabilities of its systems due to insufficient telecommunications infrastructure and IT systems-hosting technology. 

In order to begin addressing these limitations, the Study will examine the economic and technical requirements of developing a single National ICT Network that is to connect all local and national government entities. Specifically, the Study will contribute to the full unification of Bulgaria's two current core networks – that of the SAITC (national coverage) and of the Council of Ministers (local loops) – into a single, Grantee-managed infrastructure. It will also plan the convergence of further currently separate networks into the unified national infrastructure, including those run by the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Labor, the National Statistics Institute, and other government entities. It will also define the precise topology of the integrated network structure, develop an implementation plan and prepare the Grantee for upcoming procurements.

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $390,180 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission/desk study report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901. To request the RFP in PDF format, please go to:

https://www.ustda.gov/businessopps/rfpform.asp

Requests for a mailed hardcopy version of the RFP may also be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009. In the fax, please include your firm's name, contact person, address, and telephone number. Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response. Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP. Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored. Please check your internal fax verification receipt. Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification. Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day. Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day. Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity. Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity. All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country. The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount. Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP. 

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by 

4:30 PM LOCAL TIME, APRIL 10, 2009.

Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP. Requests for clarification on any aspect of the RFP should be directed to POC John Kusnierek, USTDA, 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901, Tel: (703) 875-4357, Fax: (703) 875-4009. Any such request must be received no later than 4:30 PM, March 27, 2009 in order to be honored. Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted. The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals. The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project. The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<SUBJECT>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION - SYSTEM INTEGRATOR FOR BAO KIT INCREMENT II
<SOLNBR>BAOKITII
<RESPDATE>031909
<CONTACT>Nancy G. Leggett, Contracting Officer, Phone (937) 255-1696, Fax (937) 255-8351, Email nancy.leggett@wpafb.af.mil - Major Joshua McAllister, BAO Kit Program Manager, Phone 937-255-3832, Email joshua.mcallister@wpafb.af.mil
<DESC><p>
<p>1. The Aeronautical Systems Center (ASC) 670 Aeronautical Systems Squadron (670 AESS), Wright-Patterson AFB OH, is submitting a Request for Information (RFI). The Air Force requests information on the feasibility of using a systems integrator for the Battlefield Air Operations (BAO) BAO kit increment II.</p>
<p>A. The 670 AESS in support of Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC) is interested in reviewing concepts for implementing a systems integrator for increment II of the BAO kit II. The BAO system will greatly improve Special Tactics Terminal Control applications of effects; directly related to Special Reconnaissance, Unconventional Warfare, Direct Action, Counter Terrorism, and Close Air Support, mission areas by improving individual Situational Awareness (SA). Additionally, the enhanced standoff range, and precision provided will mitigate the risk to ground forces while improving their SA. This improved SA will be translated to better SA for aircraft/ C2 assets, and in turn improve targeting efficiency, accuracy, and survivability resulting in actionable precise information and control of effects. The BAO kit II will enable targeting and SA technology to meet AFSOC mission requirements. The system will be capable of employment day or night, in adverse weather, and in a variety of threat spectrums from terrorist attacks to Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) threats. The BAO kit II will be designed as a safe, reliable, available, and maintainable system. Joint interoperability, compatibility, and connectivity with Joint Force command and control infrastructure and supporting agencies and assets are essential to the execution of the mission. The BAO kit II will address all command, control, communications, computer and intelligence (C4I) requirements and other standardization considerations. C4I systems acquired will comply with all applicable Global Information Grid (GIG), Mission Area (MA)-Interface Control Document (ICD) and Net Ready (NR) Key Performance Parameter (KPP) requirements. All electromagnetic effects on BAO kit II equipment, supporting systems, and operations environment will be mitigated, minimized, or countered, to avoid mission degradation. In addition, the BAO kit II system of systems (SoS) aids the operator by reducing the risk of fratricide, substantially reducing weight carried, and significantly reducing the time required to find, fix, track, target, and engage the enemy. The BAO kit II SoS will maximize the use of scarce resources, and increase combat power on the battlefield for the Combatant Commander. The current, increment I BAO kit Family of Systems (FoS) consists of the three programs: Battlefield Air Operations Human Machine Interface (BAO HMI), Battlefield Air Targeting Micro Air Vehicle (BATMAV) and Integrated Targeting Device (ITD). Each of these programs will be combined into a single BAO kit II requirement. Additionally, BAO kit II will have additional interface requirements with the Guardian Angel Operations kit, to include interoperability with certain sensors.</p>
<p>B. The systems integrator would simultaneously design, incorporate, and/or develop systems products and processes to satisfy the needs of the BAO kit II Capability Description Document (CDD). Working from the BAO kit Increment I baseline, the systems integrator will engineer the enhanced operational capabilities into an integrated system design through concurrent consideration of all lifecycle needs. As the BAO kit II system becomes more complex, the design, development, and production of a system or system-of-systems require the integration of numerous activities and processes. The systems integrator will coordinate and integrate all acquisition lifecycle activities. Systems engineering integrates diverse technical management processes to achieve an integrated systems design that satisfy customer needs and enhance human systems engineering. The systems integrator would be the integrating mechanism across the technical efforts related to the development, manufacturing, verification, deployment, operations, support, disposal of, and user training for systems and their life cycle processes. System integrators develop technical information to support the program management decision-making process. Systems integrators would ensure systematic set of processes to help coordinate and integrate activities throughout the life cycle of the system are accomplished. They offer a technical framework to enable sound decision making relative to trade studies among system performance, risk, cost, and schedule. The systems integrator must be agile enough to field early some components as they mature. Additionally, the systems integrator must be flexible enough to incorporate additional funding on short notice (such as end of year "fall-out" funds).</p>
<p>Factors indicating a good systems integrator would be:<br />* Robust to changing technical, production, and operating environments; <br />* Adaptive to the needs of the user; and <br />* Balanced the multiple requirements dealing with design and budgets.</p>
<p>This RFI initiates a concept call for leveraging a proven and experienced systems integrator for emerging technologies in fielding the BAO kit II capability by Sept 2012. Of interest are systems integrators who are experienced in working with commercial contractors, vague interfaces and specifications, subcontracts, working with AFSOC and ASC, systems or family of systems concepts achieving significant capability enhancements over existing systems with measurable life cycle cost improvements.</p>
<p>2. This notice is part of Government Market Research, a continuous process for obtaining the latest information on the "art of the possible" from industry with respect to their current and near-term abilities. The information collected may be used by the Government to explore future strategies and implementation for the BAO kit. Information received as a result of this request will be considered as sensitive and will be protected as such. Any company proprietary information contained in the response should be clearly marked as such, by paragraph, such that &lsquo;publicly-releasable' and &lsquo;proprietary' information are clearly distinguished. Any material that is not marked proprietary will be considered publicly-releasable. Any proprietary information received in response to this request will be properly protected from any unauthorized disclosure. The Government will not use proprietary information submitted from any one firm to establish the capability and requirements for any future systems acquisition, so as to not inadvertently restrict competition.</p>
<p>3. The submitted documentation becomes the property of the U.S. Government and will not be returned. No solicitation documents exist at this time. This is NOT an Invitation for Bid (IFB) or Request for Proposal (RFP). The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this announcement. This is a request for information/market research announcement for planning purposes. The Government will not reimburse any costs associated with the documentation submitted under this request. Although the word "proposed" may be used in this inquiry, your response will be treated as information only and will not be used as a proposal. Responders are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this inquiry. This announcement is not to be construed as a formal solicitation. It does not commit the government to reply to information received, or to later publish a solicitation, or to award a contract based on this information.</p>
<p>4. Submissions should include:</p>
<p>A. A system integrator concept overview with descriptions of roles, responsibilities, challenges, risks of dealing with a diverse system such as the BAO kit.<br />B. Attributes of the concept to include assumptions, rough order magnitude of cost (to include annual costs), and any other significant attributes the RFI submitter deems appropriate to differentiate military utility of the submitter's concept.<br />C. A discussion on the concept's architecture approach. It should be noted whether an open systems approach is utilized.<br />D. A discussion of the concept's scalable approach. The concept should recognize that the 670 AESS works with limited, and sometimes fluctuating, funding resources which may constrain or expand the scope of this effort.<br />E.

<p>5. When determining your response to this RFI, please be aware of the government's constraints:</p>
<p>A. BAO Kit Increment II Initial Operating Capability (IOC) of the second quarter of FY13.<br />B. It is the government's intention to acquire BAO Kit systems complete with sufficient design, technical data, and other intellectual property rights sufficient to allow for subsequent full rate production of the system(s) selected to be competed among multiple sources as well as to sustain the systems for the full projected designed life span of the systems and to pursue spiral development of important capabilities. Respondents are requested to describe what package(s) of data rights could be sufficient to accomplish this purpose and the relative effect(s) on total ROM price.<br />C. The program office will likely utilize an evolutionary acquisition strategy. "Evolutionary acquisition is the preferred DoD strategy for rapid acquisition of mature technology for the user. An evolutionary approach delivers capability in increments, recognizing, up front, the need for future capability improvements. The objective is to balance needs and available capability with resources, and to put capability into the hands of the user quickly. The success of the strategy depends on consistent and continuous definition of requirements, and the maturation of technologies that lead to disciplined development and production of systems that provide increasing capability towards a materiel concept." DODI 5000.2, 12 May 2003. <br />D. The Air Force workforce is supplemented by contracted support personnel and any proprietary data submitted may be handled by contract support services personnel who have signed the same Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) as organic AF personnel.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Army Yuma Proving Ground (USAYPG) is conducting a sources sought for an Improved Realtime Trajectory Solution. This sources sought notice is for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of USAYPG. The purpose of this notice is to identify potential sources that may be interested in and capable of performing the effort described here. USAYPG does not intend to award a contract on the basis of responses, nor otherwise pay for the preparation of any information submitted. The Government is seeking qualified sources with specific and recent experience reengineering complex information systems, developing network distributed applications for hardware control, customizing OS configurations, and testing and certifying networked system performance, to include analysis, evaluating software and hardware, and preparing test documentation.  Relevant technology includes, for example, commercial off-the-shelf COTS Intel PC hardware, (COTS) OS's (Linux and Windows), realtime OS extensions, COTS network components (CISCO and ATM, various ancillary network devices), COTS peripherals (Symmetricon time standards, Digi serial interfaces), COTS and non-COTS protocols (TENA, CORBA, INET, SQL, ODBC, TCP/IP, ethernet, SONET), complex range instruments and telemetry sources and protocols, and a variety of COTS, Government off-the-shelf (GOTS) and customized user applications.  Skills in software architecture design, software development, hardware/software integration, performance and reliability testing and certification, system administration and network administration will be emphasized. All contractors are invited to explain: (1) the contractor's specific and unique experience with regards to the technologies listed above; (2) any anticipated teaming arrangements; (3) a reference list of related contracts within the past three years, to include contract number, dollar value, a brief description of services, and points of contact with phone number; (4) information related to the contractor's business size and socioeconomic status; (5) a copy of the GSA Federal Supply Schedule if the contractor has a GSA contract identifying the applicable labor categories; and (6) a statement as to the capability of providing contractor employees with the required security clearances.   DRAFT PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT: SECTION I.  SCOPE.Introduction.  This statement of work delineates requirements for several subtasks of the Improved Realtime Trajectory Solution.  The tasks are to (1) eliminate and/or replace a proprietary digital interface for commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) PC/ATX architecture computers; (2) rearchitect a distributed system of COTS PC/ATX architecture computers to reduce the number of computers; (3) reengineer a realtime instrumentation communication and control system to transmit and receive data via IP rather than various proprietary protocols; (4) enhance a realtime instrumentation communication and control system to accept additional instruments; (5) incorporate into the system of realtime modeling and simulations, external triggers, and Kalman filters. Overview of the system.  The Realtime System is a complex system of data processing hardware and software, plus numerous complex peripheral systems and devices.  The data processing hardware is largely commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) commodity hardware; the peripheral systems are mostly specialized test range instruments or COTS network devices. A major subsystem of the Realtime System is the Integrated Range Tracking System (IRTS).  It consists of paired computers that together provide range input, analysis, output, archiving, and distributed OS images.  The IRTS is composed of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) PC/ATX architecture computers and ancillary devices. The software applications use mostly standard operating systems, programming languages, and tools.  There are approximately 60 user interface (UI) applications.  Most applications display a substantial amount of complex data, with a small number of user interface actions and options.  A few applications have significantly more complex user interface actions and options. Range of activities.  Range of service provider activities are described in requirements for individual tasks below. SECTION II.  APPLICABLE DOCUMENTS. To Be Determined. SECTION III.  REQUIREMENTS. Task A. Rearchitect a distributed system of COTS PC/ATX architecture computers to reduce the number of computers. 1. Identify, implement OS and network configuration changes required to eliminate one of the paired computers of the IRTS. 2. Test the changes implemented above. 3. Document the changes implemented above. 4. Provide necessary information and perform all actions required by the existing configuration management system procedures. Task B. Reengineer a realtime instrumentation communication and control system to transmit and receive data via IP rather than various proprietary protocols. 1. Rearchitect the IRTS analytical software to accept data from existing range instruments via IP rather than RS-232 serial channels. The scope of the envisaged architectural changes is currently fluid.  Changes might be limited to a simple encapsulation of existing data blocks within IP packets.  Or, the system may be evolved to an architecture of distributed objects, for example using TENA or CORBA.  The architecture could feature object portability, redundancy, generic instrument classes and abstracted range functions.  The service provider will work with government stakeholders to evolve architectural requirements and decisions. 2. Redesign existing software and design new data structures and program control flows to embody the new architecture. 3. Implement changes to IRTS software to materialize design changes. 4. Test the changes implemented above. 5. Document the changes implemented above. 6. Provide necessary information and perform all actions required by the existing configuration management system procedures. Task C.  Enhance a realtime instrumentation communication and control system to accept additional instruments. 1.  Rearchitect IRTS analytical software to receive and analyze new instrumentation types over IP.  Types might include Weibel radar, telemetry antennas, Mortan Tracking System, generic TENA TSPI objects. 2.  Redesign existing software and design new data structures and program control flows to embody the new architecture. 3. Implement changes to IRTS software to materialize design changes. 4. Test the changes implemented above. 5. Document the changes implemented above. 6.  Provide necessary information and perform all actions required by the existing configuration management system procedures.Task D.  Incorporate into the system of realtime modelling and simulations, external triggers, and Kalman filters.The RTOPS data input and analysis is currently limited to realtime system under test (SUT) information, or replay of same.  The system will be enhanced to accepted simulated SUT information.  The system will also be enhanced to perform advanced target position optimization, based on multiple simulated and/or realtime SUT data sources, using software Kalman filters or other similar processes.The system will use external digital signals, together with simulated and realtime SUT data and Kalman position solutions, to control instrument orientations. Interested sources shall email all questions and feedback no later than12 March 2009 to the POC listed below or sent by fax to (928) 328-6849.<BR><BR><BR>

Installation Description

The electric distribution system being privatized is described as follows: 

Located in the Salt Lake Valley west of the Wasatch Mountains and overlooking the Great Salt Lake to the west, Hill Air Force Base (AFB) is 7 miles south of Ogden, Utah, and 35 miles north of Salt Lake City. The Main Base occupies approximately 6,689 acres – 6,641 fee and 48 leased (primarily railroad). Outlying installations include the Little Mountain Test Annex (approximately 26 miles northwest of the Base) and the Utah Test and Training Range (UTTR; approximately 50 miles due west of Hill AFB). In addition, Hill AFB supports five smaller satellite areas within approximately 200 miles of Hill AFB.
The Main Base has 827 buildings occupying 12.6 million square feet of floor space, not including the privatized housing.  The Base has a 13,500-foot runway that handles more than 40,000 takeoffs and landings annually. It also has 228 miles of roadway and 28 miles of railroad.  Electrical power for the Main Base is supplied by two Rocky Mountain Power (RMP)-owned 46-kilovolt (kV) transmission feeders and one RMP-owned 138-kV transmission feeder. The Air Force owns the entire Hill AFB electrical distribution system downstream of these three RMP delivery points. The Air Force system consists of one 46-kV switching station and approximately 6.8 miles of overhead 46-kV transmission line supplying four 46-12.47-kV distribution substations, one 138-12.47-kV distribution substation, and approximately 132 miles of 12.47 kV primary distribution line.  There are approximately 6.8 miles of 12.47-kV primary distribution line under-built on the transmission towers that support the 46-kV transmission line.  The distribution system is a 12.47/7.2-kV, 4-wire configuration throughout Hill AFB.  The primary distribution system consists of a total of twenty-nine 12.47-kV circuits. It is composed of overhead, pole-line construction (conventional, cross arm/pin insulator, open wire construction practices) with pole-mounted transformer banks, and underground construction (utilizing duct-type construction practices) with both outdoor pad-mounted transformers and indoor primary unit substations.  The overhead primary system is principally composed of bare ACSR conductors of various sizes, with #6, #4, #2, and 4/0 being the most common. The underground primary system is principally composed of shielded copper conductors of various sizes, with #2, #1, and 4/0 the most common. It is further noted that more than 90 percent of the #1 conductors are lead-sheathed.  The majority of the distribution circuits are configured with loop tie switches to neighboring circuits. The pad-mounted transformers are principally conventional, dead-front units. All polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB)-contaminated transformers were replaced around 1992.
Electrical power for Little Mountain Test Annex is supplied by a RMP-owned 46-kV transmission feeder that is routed to the Air Force-owned Little Mountain Substation, where it terminates on the Air Force-owned structure. The Air Force owns the entire Little Mountain electrical distribution system downstream of this RMP delivery point. It consists of one 46-4.16-kV distribution substation, one emergency generator, and approximately 1.2 miles of 4.16-kV primary distribution line. The distribution system is a 4.16-kV, 3-wire (with static ground) configuration throughout the Little Mountain Test Annex.  The primary distribution system is composed of overhead, pole-line construction (conventional, cross arm/pin insulator, open wire construction practices) with pole-mounted transformer banks, and underground construction (utilizing duct-type construction practices) with pad-mounted transformers. 

Electrical power for Utah Test and Training Range is supplied by a RMP-owned 46-kV transmission feeder that is routed to the Air Force-owned UTTR Substation, where it terminates on the Air Force-owned structure.  The Air Force owns the entire UTTR electrical distribution system downstream of this RMP delivery point. It consists of one 46-12.47-kV distribution substation, one emergency generator, and approximately 76.5 miles of 12.47-kV primary distribution line. The distribution system is a 12.47 kV, 3-wire (with static ground) configuration throughout the UTTR.  The primary distribution system is composed of overhead, pole-line construction (conventional, cross arm/pin insulator, open wire construction but incorporating special raptor protection features) with pole-mounted transformer banks, and underground construction (utilizing both duct-type and direct burial construction practices) with pad-mounted transformers.

The water distribution system being privatized is described as follows: 

Located in the Salt Lake Valley west of the Wasatch Mountains and overlooking the Great Salt Lake to the west, Hill Air Force Base (AFB) is 7 miles south of Ogden, Utah, and 35 miles north of Salt Lake City. The Main Base occupies approximately 6,689 acres – 6,641 fee and 48 leased (primarily railroad). Outlying installations include the Little Mountain Test Annex (approximately 26 miles northwest of the Base) and the Utah Test and Training Range (UTTR; approximately 50 miles due west of Hill AFB). In addition, Hill AFB supports five smaller satellite areas within approximately 200 miles of Hill AFB.  Hill AFB has 827 buildings occupying 12.6 million square feet of floor space, not including the privatized housing.  The Base has a 13,500-foot runway that handles more than 40,000 takeoffs and landings annually. It also has 228 miles of roadway and 28 miles of railroad.
Hill AFB receives water from two sources: on-Base deep wells and from the off-Base Weber Basin Conservancy District (WBCD).  The Delta aquifer is the major source of water for Hill AFB.  The principal water-bearing zone varies from 50 to 150 feet in thickness at a depth ranging from 480 to 520 feet below ground surface. Although acceptable for consumption, water tends to be “hard” and contains iron, calcium, sodium, and magnesium.  Nine deep wells, depth ranging from 627 to 1,500 feet, provide potable water for the Installation.  Wells 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 are supplied backup power from emergency generators or diesel engine drives.  Some of the emergency generators are interconnected to one or more water wells or pump stations.  Water treatment at the Base consists of chlorination, fluoridation, and phosphate added to the water at the well site with unmanned injection systems.  Wells 4 and 8 are not currently operated.  Well 4 is not currently used for potable water production because of its extremely high iron content.  Well 8 is not currently used for potable water production because of its arsenic content; it is currently disconnected from the water distribution system. Wells 4 and 8 require re-drilling before they can be fully integrated into the potable water system.  Hill AFB is permitted to pump a maximum of 7,820,434 gallons per day from deep wells on the Main Base.  The supplemental water source (WBCD) supplies treated water to the Base at a single point near the South Gate entrance.  A contract between Hill AFB and WBCD, dated 12 December 1952, requires WBCD to provide 1,018.79 acre-feet per year (approximately 333 million gallons).  The contract also requires that WBCD have available 2,500 gallons per minute (gpm) at the point of delivery and that not less than 1.5 million gallons per day (gpd) be available.  The WBCD water allocation is a very important resource and must be used every year.  If the allocation is not used, WBCD water may be reallocated to other users in this water-starved region.  The WBCD allocation is used primarily between mid-May and December (peak usage months) to reduce the demand for well water.  Historically, WBCD provided approximately one-third of the potable water used in the Main Base area.  A vital feature of the WBCD water allocation is related to total annual consumption and the longstanding, very favorable sales rate.  If the allocation quantity were to be exceeded for three consecutive years, then WBCD would have the right to renegotiate the “grandfathered” sales rates.  Hill AFB manually operates the valves that control the use of WBCD water.  If the water system is privatized through this solicitation, the UP Contractor is expected to support Hill AFB to ensure Hill AFB’s continued compliance with their 1952 Contract with WBCD.  In the older areas of the Base, water pipe material is mostly cast-iron pipe with leaded joints or asbestos cement. Water lines installed after the mid-1980s have been polyvinyl chloride (PVC) class C-900 with tracer wire and warning tape. Average depth of burial of water mains is approximately 8 feet.  Water is stored in six reservoirs with total capacity of 8.3 million gallons; the three steel tanks each have a cathodic protection system.   A supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system is used to monitor water levels in the various tanks, and is used to control well pumps, booster pumps, and treatment processes in either automatic or manual modes.  The SCADA system is included in the Utilities Privatization solicitation of the water distribution system.  A separate fire-protection system (not included in the Utilities Privatization solicitation) is operated to furnish water to large buildings requiring fire flows greater than can be provided by the potable water system. 
The water system at Little Mountain Test Annex is supplied with potable water from WBCD through a 16-inch (WBCD-owned) supply line.  The enormous size of this water main is related to a long-past mission requirement.)  Water purchased from WBCD is piped and distributed under pressure directly into the Little Mountain system.  The water used at Little Mountain is included in the total water allotment from WBCD.  An Air Force-owned chlorination station, also located at the annex entrance, maintains chlorine residuals.   The Air Force-owned distribution system is comprised of 8-inch and 6-inch PVC pipe (C-900) mains and smaller building service lines. The distribution system is approximately 12 to 13 years old and is in very good condition. 
All potable water for Utah Test and Training Range is supplied by two wells located in the Oasis cantonment area. Well 1 produces water at the rate of 300 gpm, with Well 2 producing water at the rate of 160 gpm. A relatively new PVC pipeline moves raw water from the wells to a reverse-osmosis treatment plant, rated at 6,000 gallons per hour. Because of the inferior quality of the water in Well 1, normally only Well 2 is used for potable water while Well 1 water is used primarily for dust control. (Well 1 water could be treated and used for potable water but it would require frequent recalibration of the treatment processes.) Treated water is pumped to two 500,000-gallon water-storage tanks situated on a hill overlooking the complex; the tanks are cathodically protected. The water distribution system, with the recent doubling of water storage capacity and the replacement of some of the major transite mains, is in very good condition.

The wastewater collection system being privatized is described as follows: 

Located in the Salt Lake Valley west of the Wasatch Mountains and overlooking the Great Salt Lake to the west, Hill Air Force Base (AFB) is 7 miles south of Ogden, Utah, and 35 miles north of Salt Lake City. The Main Base occupies approximately 6,689 acres –6,641 fee and 48 leased (primarily railroad).  Outlying installations include the Little Mountain Test Annex (approximately 26 miles northwest of the Base) and the Utah Test and Training Range (UTTR; approximately 50 miles due west of Hill AFB).  In addition, Hill AFB supports five smaller satellite areas within approximately 200 miles of Hill AFB.  Hill AFB has 827 buildings occupying 12.6 million square feet of floor space, not including the privatized housing.  The Base has a 13,500-foot runway that handles more than 40,000 takeoffs and landings annually. It also has 228 miles of roadway and 28 miles of railroad.
The Main Base area wastewater system west of the runway consists of collection lines and lift stations.  The wastewater system east of the runway consists of relatively small collection systems mostly from individual buildings.  Some of the buildings have been connected to the main system via a line across the south end of the runway.  However, the majority of facilities east of the runway are connected to septic tanks and drain fields or to one of five holding tanks.  In the case of the five holding tanks, the UP Contractor is responsible for periodically transferring that wastewater from the holding tanks to a manhole on the Base collection system.    With the exception of the sewage that flows to the septic tanks, all other sanitary sewage generated on Hill AFB is transported to the North Davis Sewer District (NDSD) for treatment.  There are approximately 15 sanitary wastewater lift stations with associated force mains located throughout the Main Base area.   None of the lift stations have installed emergency generators.  All are equipped with high-water alarms (local flashing red lights; no remote annunciation).  The Hill AFB wastewater collection system consists of approximately 258,620 feet of wastewater collection lines, varying in size from 3 to 15 inches, and approximately 662 manholes. The wastewater collection system dates back to the 1940s.  In the older areas of the Base, the wastewater lines are vitrified clay pipes and the manholes are constructed of brick.  Since the 1990s, as lines were replaced and new lines added, the replacement piping has been PVC and the new manholes have been constructed of pre-cast concrete.  Depth of burial for wastewater collections mains ranges from 6 to 30 feet.  Average depth of building service laterals is approximately 6 feet.  Base technicians advise that Hill AFB does not experience significant infiltration and inflow (I/I) problems, nor are there recurring problems with overflows.
The wastewater system at the Little Mountain Test Annex consists of a gravity collection system where flows move to a septic tank and drain field for treatment. The septic tank and drain field are not included in the Utilities Privatization solicitation; the point of demarcation is the septic tank inlet. The original system was installed in 1960, and contains approximately 3,000 feet of wastewater lines.  The collection mains are primarily 6- and 8-inch PVC pipe, while service laterals are older cast-iron pipe.  The original septic tank, installed in 1960, has been abandoned; the new tank and drain field was installed in 1987 at a different location.  The new system is very large and includes a 27,000–gallon tank, sized for approximately 300 people.  With a daylight population of only 80 people and only three persons remaining on site round-the-clock, the system has more than enough capacity for any foreseeable growth. Long-range plans for Little Mountain call for replacing the septic tank and drain field with a package treatment plant.
The wastewater system at Utah Test and Training Range consists of two lift stations, which move flows to wastewater lagoons for treatment.  The piping systems that feed and leave the lift stations are approximately the same age as the lift stations. Twelve manholes are shown on the utility map. Treatment lagoons are an integral part of the system and are included in the Utilities Privatization solicitation. The lagoon treatment system is a zero discharge treatment system consisting of two main ponds and three overflow ponds. All ponds are lined.  In the spring of 2000, the sewer lagoons were upgraded and enlarged as well as being modified to act as a mini-wetlands area.   Other remote facilities on UTTR with septic tanks and drain fields are excluded from this solicitation.

<DESC><p>United States Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Central Region Acquisition Division, (CRAD) is seeking sources capable of administering the annual Facility Inspection Program for the Real Property, Facilities and Logistics Office, located in Silver Spring, MD.<br /><br />The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) currently use an Integrated Facilities Information Program (IFIP) software solution designed and developed by Vanderweil Facility Advisors (VFA) under a delivery order against the GSA MOBIS contract. The software is designed to maintain an accurate assessment of the condition of NOAA facilities nationwide. Historically, the IFIP software has been available from only one known source, Vanderweil Facility Advisors (VFA). Interested firms shall provide, in writing, the company name, address, point of contact, telephone number, and business size; Firms shall also demonstrate their understanding of the requirement, describe their capabilities to provide COTS software that will perform the functions as described; outline the functionality of its software; and provide references for other Government agencies using the same software to provide the services that meet or exceed the below mentioned requirements. Responses can be faxed to Charlene Yaple @ 816-274-6977 or sent via email to Charlene.A.Yaple@noaa.gov.
<p>Current Process</p>
<p>Each Fiscal Year (FY), facility inventory data from NOAA's Federal Real Property Management (FRPM) database is imported into the current service providers system. This facility data includes attributes such as property name, property address, asset type, construction type, square footage, etc.</p>
<p>There are two types of users within the existing software structure, (1) Respondents and (2) Approvers. Respondents are Government facility occupants that are tasked with accessing the software in order to complete building condition surveys. The surveys contain specific question sets for each of the following types of NOAA facilities.</p>
<p>1. Owned or leased buildings that are maintained by NOAA (also referred to as Triple-Net Facilities),<br />2. Owned buildings that meet the NOAA criteria for Warehouses, Equipment and Storage, and <br />3. GSA-owned, or leased, buildings.</p>
<p>When the surveys are completed, the Approver reviews and approves the Respondent's answers. The approved answers are used to calculate a variety of measures that allow NOAA to assess the condition of its facilities. Three of these measures are:</p>
<p>1. Deficiency Costs: A deficiency is an item requiring corrective action to satisfy a desired level of maintenance. The current software derives the deficiency costs using the survey as well as up-to-date calculated deficiency costs provided by RS Means.</p>
<p>2. Estimate Replacement Costs: The Replacement Cost (also referred to as the Replacement value) is the cost to replace a facility of like-kind based on current labor and materials costs. This cost is calculated by the software by multiplying the Department of Defense (DOD)'s unit cost for various types of construction by the square footage of the building.</p>
<p>3. Facility Condition Index (FCI): FCI is a measurement of a facility's condition and may be used as a benchmark to compare the relative condition of a group of facilities. The FCI is calculated by one minus the cost to correct a facility's current deficiencies divided by the facility current replacement value.</p>
<p>The current software also customizes RS means values based upon location indices and provides an ability to identify, utilization rates and mission criticality to comply with Executive Order 13327 reporting</p>
<p>NOAA's existing contract includes the administration of the annual survey, the tabulation of the survey results and the storing of historical data for a minimum of four years. The next survey period begins in June 2009.</p>
<p>NOAA does not know of other sources that can provide a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) product that will provide the functionality to generate the same results of the existing without significant customization and redesign. This is a key factor in determining the feasibility of conducting a competitive acquisition. In order to eliminate the potential disruption to the program and the potential for a degradation of historical data which would prohibit NOAA from doing trend analysis from prior year data, it is NOAA's intent to negotiate a follow-on contract with VFA to continue to maintain and manage the software and data. The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR Part 6.302.</p>
<p>Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirements or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within 30 days of this announcement will be considered by the government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive acquisition.</p>
<p>Solution Requirements</p>
<p>Interested Solution Providers must demonstrate that they can provide a web-based COTS software solution that possesses each of the capabilities of NOAA's current solution without modification or re-design to match the functionality of the current software as well as the following:</p>
<p>1. Compliance with Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.<br />2. Generation of usernames and passwords for Contractor administrators, Government respondents and approvers. The usernames and passwords shall be compliant with NOAA and Department of Commerce (DOC) standards. Access to specific software objects shall be based on the role that is tied to the username (e.g., respondents should not be able to access screens that would allow them to perform tasks specifically designated to approvers). <br />3. Conversion of the previous 4 FY's data from NOAA's existing solution and the uploading of data from excel spreadsheets into the new solution's database. This is required to allow NOAA to perform historical analysis.<br />4. Initialization of each FY by populating Basic Building Information (BBI) with the most recent data available at the previous fiscal year's end.<br />5. Modification of all survey question sets so that each question begins with a non-applicable choice. The purpose of this choice is so that deficiencies are not calculated for questions that do not pertain to facilities being surveyed.<br />6. User notification when a respondent provides an answer to a question that does not fall within predefined parameters. Also, the user shall be notified when a survey is completed and submitted for approval.<br />7. Updating of all industry specific data, formulas and analysis tools based on current standards. This includes updating the most recent RS Means data and DOD cost calculations. This ensures that all assessments and reports are current and useful.<br />8. Storage of all responses to surveys, deficiencies, and FCI data. A user-friendly functionality, agreed upon by NOAA, shall be included that allows users to view and generate reports against prior year's data.<br />9. Export of current FY and previous FY data. The previous FY data shall be for an individual FY or an aggregate of multiples FY's data. The exports shall be provided in the following formats:</p>
<p>a. Microsoft Excel<br />b. Crystal Reports<br />c. Portable Document Format (PDF)<br />d. Microsoft Word and <br />e. Microsoft Rich Text File (RTF).</p>
<p>Support Requirements:</p>
<p>The Contractor coordinates with NOAA to ensure that its solution's results (i.e., derived costs, indices, etc.) are consistent. The Contractor works in conjunction with NOAA to research and justify any noted discrepancies to NOAA's satisfaction.</p>
<p>The Contractor is responsible for all aspects of the surveys' administration and ensures that surveys are completed by the end of each FY. The Contractor provides user support by the following:</p>
<p>1. Provide training to all users<br />2. Operating a help desk support. The help desk must be available Monday through Friday between 9:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m. Calls made to the help desk from users shall be responded to within 2 hours. Routine maintenance access shall be provided by the help desk year round; however, the provider shall staff additional help desk resources during the execution of annual surveys,<br />3. Be available for unlimited NOAA conference calls upon request, and <br />4. Distribute unlimited bulk e-mails to respondents upon request.<br /><br />NOAA Provisions: NOAA provides the following resources to assist the Contractor's performance.</p>
<p>1. Facility access where NOAA personnel, equipment, or other necessary resources are located. If security clearances or other approval processes are required, the provider will supply personnel that maintain, or are capable of obtaining, such clearances.<br />2. Designated office workspace for time spent by the provider's personnel at NOAA locations.<br />3. Extracts of data residing in either the current IFIP software solution or any additional system that may contain information on NOAA's Real Property or related assets.<br />4. Technical assistance in planning and executing the data mapping from the current NOAA solution into the new solution's database.</p>
<p>Timeline for Requirements</p>
<p>NOAA's FY09 Survey is required for distribution by June 1, 2009, to approximately 600 respondents. Any potential vendor(s) would be required to demonstrate the COTS product which meets the above requirement with minimal changes and be ready to begin conducting the surveys by June 1, 2009. In addition, the vendor(s) must demonstrate the methodology for transitioning the current four FY's of data and highlight how the data would be stored, retrieved for reporting and processing of future surveys.</p>

<DESC><p>The Government intends to solicit and negotiate on a sole source basis with Wartsila Defense, Inc, 3617 Koppens Way, Chesapeake, Virginia for the following requirement: One (1) Set VCM Control Card Upgrade Set with 2 Rail Mounting Drive Cards; One (1) each Spare Valve Drive Card; One (1) each Printcard (P/N W006927856; One (1) Printcard, LMM Plus Software P/N W006927731; two (2) each Dimmer, R15 P/N W006912301; two (2) each Pressure Gauge, P/N T003000749; two (2) each Printcard, EXP, P/N W006927796; and One (1) job Service Technician to accomplish VCM Control Card Upgrade for the NOAA ship RONALD H. BROWN, 1050 Register Street, Charleston, South Carolina 29405. In order to comply with the debt collection improvement act of 1966, all contractors must be registered in the central contractor registration (CCR) to be considered for an award of a federal contract. For information regarding registration in CCR contact the CCR website at www.ccr.gov/index.cfm. The FSC for this is 1990 and the NAICS Code is 336611, small business size standard is 1,000 employees. The government intends to award a firm-fixed price purchase order for this requirement. The NOAA Ship Ronald H. Brown has two (2) each LIPS thrusters for main propulsion. The controls for these units were designed and built by Lips, Inc (now Wartsila Defense, Inc). These controls contain printed circuit cards that also made by Wartsila Defense, Inc. Wartsila is the only source for these control cards. These control cards control the steering of the ship. If NOAA were to pay to have the control cards replacements designed by another vendor just for the NOAA Ship Ronald H. Brown, NOAA would bear the that entire additional cost. If the control cards fail and replacement cards are not available the ship would be dead in the water, resulting in the loss of valuable sea days and the safety of crew and vessel would be in jeopardy. The proposed contract action is for supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302(c)(1). Interested parties may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency. However, all proposals received by 2:00 P.M., Eastern Standard Time, March 6, 2009 will be considered by the government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in the future. Evidence must be provided of ability to provide the required control cards. Responses to this notice, if any must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the government. Inquiries will only be accepted via email to Robin.Resweber@noaa.gov.</p>

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Training Systems Division - Orlando (NAWCTSD-Orlando) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity Contract (ID/IQ) with the Bell Boeing Joint Program Office located in Amarillo, TX under authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1, "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements".  The anticipated ceiling amount for this contract is $300M.  The supplies to be procured under this ID/IQ include the acquisition of Air Force (CV) Flight Training Device (FTD) Serial Numbers 5 and 6, CV/MV Aircraft Maintenance Trainer (AMT) Device Serial Number 4, CV Cabin Operational Flight Trainers (COFT) Device Serial Numbers 2 and 3, CV Wing Part Task Trainer (WPTT), Marine Corps (MV) Cabin PTT Device Serial Number 1, MV AMT Device Serial Number 4, and MV Containerized Flight Training Device (CFTD) Serial Numbers 7 and 8.  Aircraft driven concurrency revisions and technical refreshes will be incorporated on these devices, as well as the Landing Gear PTT, Mechanical PTT, Airframes PTT, Sponson PTT, Power Plant Training Article, Consolidated V-22 Electronics Maintenance Trainer, MV FTD Device Serial Number 1, MV FSS Device Serial Numbers 1, 2 and 3, CFTD Serial Numbers 1 - 8 and MV AMT Device Serial Numbers 1, 2, & 3. Also, Aircraft Common Operational Equipment (ACOE) and provisioned items (spares), as required for operational support, will be procured.  The Bell-Boeing JPO has been the sole designer, developer, weapons system integrator, and producer of the MV-22 and CV-22 type/model/series aircraft.  As such, Bell Boeing is the only responsible source possessing the engineering data, technical skills, requisite knowledge of the design, fabrication, performance, and operational characteristics of the V-22 aircraft.  As part of the aircraft procurement program, BB JPO has developed and built all V-22 aircrew and maintenance trainers acquired to date.  BB JPO creates V-22 aircraft systems software and modifies the aircraft’s System Configuration Set (SCS) to include Operational Flight Programs (OFPs) (eg JASS) software. BB JPO provides software for design, engineering simulations, and operational evaluation that are used in the redesign of the V-22 aircraft.  These redesigned subsystem models are used to develop and test the SCS/OFP and are an essential element used in the development of V-22 aircraft and training systems.  The complexity and evolving nature of the V-22 aircraft requires that training systems and training are developed and implemented concurrently with the aircraft.  Aircrew and maintenance training systems need to provide a robust, dynamic and accurate representation of the delivered aircraft and associated subsystems prior to or when delivered to the fleet.  BB JPO needs to replicate the performance of the aircraft systems and enable the production, revision, test, evaluation and acceptance of the training capability in order to deliver the required training capability concurrent with the aircraft development/production.  The V-22 training system is designed and developed based on parallel and spiral efforts contracted under the aircraft procurement program resulting in training devices that are unique stand-alone and concurrent with the aircraft.  These devices essentially represent exact replicas of the aircraft or portions of the aircraft.  This requirement to accurately and concurrently represent the aircraft and aircraft systems necessitates a sole source relationship with the aircraft OEM.  This synopsis is not a request for competitive proposals.  Interested sources may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirements.  Interested sources must submit detailed technical capabilities, and any other information, which demonstrates their ability to meet the needs of the Government. Detailed capabilities must be submitted by email to Lisa Nelson lisa.l.nelson@navy.mil in an electronic format that is compatible with Word 2000, no later than 16 March 2009 at 1600.  All information shall be furnished at no cost or obligation to the Government.  Responses shall be limited to no more than five (5) pages.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No solicitation document is available.  If no affirmative written response is received, the ID/IQ contract for the V-22 Training Aircraft Program will be awarded without further notice.

<SUBJECT>Health Information Technology (HIT) to assist  the Social Security Administration (SSA) to obtain and manage structured electronic medical record (EMR) data.
<SOLNBR>SSA-RFI-09-0331
<RESPDATE>033109
<CONTACT>Kathleen I. Jackson, Contract Specialist, Phone 4109659513, Email Kathleen.I.Jackson@ssa.gov
<DESC>The Social Security Administration (SSA) is conducting MARKET RESEARCH into use of Health Information Technology (HIT) to obtain structured electronic medical records (EMR) data. 	NO FORMAL SOLICITATION IS BEING ISSUED AT THIS TIME. 

Background

In 1995, the Social Security Administration launched an effort to eliminate the paper processes being used at the agency.  SSA goal is to store all unstructured data in repositories residing on the SSA mainframes.  SSA currently receives medical information, in the form of images (paper scanned to TIFF images), from integrators and from our agency offices. This TIFF format electronic medical records (EMR) data is stored in our enterprise content repository for unstructured data and is used in processing SSA Disability Determination workloads. SSA applications supporting these workloads have limited ability to interpret and extract medical information from the TIFF EMR data. SSA and associated state employees must therefore view the TIFF EMR data in order to make a disability determination.

In the past three years, the unstructured repository growth has accelerated, data access has been extended to Internet, and support for unstructured data has greatly expanded. SSA now operates one of the largest document management systems in the world, and unlike most other major enterprises, data captured or created throughout the history of Social Security is still critical to today’s business processes.

Description

The Social Security Administration is currently involved in a pilot with the health care community to explore the SSA use of Health Information Technology (HIT) to obtain structured EMR data.  SSA will be obtaining HIT data primarily from Nationwide Health Information Network (NHIN). SSA is interested in receiving EMR data in structured text format, such as XML, to conform to HIT plus improve the efficiency of our disability processing. SSA believes the use of structured EMR data, as opposed to the use of unstructured (TIFF) data, has potential to improve the functionality of applications that process disability determinations. SSA anticipates that there will be a long period (years) when the Agency will be handling both old (unstructured) image data from legacy sources and the new structured EMR data from sources such as NHIN.  As HIT data standards improve, SSA ability to make automated decisions using structured EMR data will increase. 
  
SSA is seeking to identify firms able to provide software and integration solutions that will allow the Agency to obtain and manage structured EMR data in our repositories. SSA seeks information on firms with demonstrated experience in the use of both structured EMR data and image EMR data in the same business processes and applications. 

Specifically, SSA is interested in software products and/or integration companies that have experience in the marketplace with structured EMR data both:
    •from the storage side (Repository), and 
    •for the use of structured EMR data in business applications that need to interpret EMR data.  

Vendor Responses

IT integrators that have assisted large, geographically dispersed organizations develop, deploy and operate an Enterprise Electronic Medical Records Repository architecture involving very large unstructured data environments supporting large numbers of end users are invited to submit information concerning their capabilities and past experience in performing those services.  Software vendors with capabilities and experience integrating their solution into an existing system are also invited to submit information in response to this notice. 

All vendor responses should provide detailed accounts of:

1) The name of the customer company/organization to which the vendor provided the services. 
2) A reference contact at the customer company/ organization (name, title, email, phone number).
3) A description of the customer company/ organization’s repository architecture prior to the vendor’s engagement
4) A description of what services the vendor provided to the customer company/ organization.
5) A description of the complexities, challenges, and duration of the engagement.
6) A description of the customer company/ organization’s current repository architecture and how the customer company/ organization uses the current repository architecture to deliver services
7) A description and make up of the team that provided the services.
8) A rough order of magnitude (ROM) of the cost of the engagement.
9) If possible, information such as redacted copies of strategy documents and other deliverables which were produced during your engagements.  Where Client agreements preclude providing even redacted copies of the requested information, vendors may substitute topic outlines or tables of content for the restricted deliverables. 

Respondents should indicate whether their services/products are available on GSA Federal Supply Schedules or any other Government-wide Agency Contract (GWAC).   

All responses must be submitted in an electronic format (compatible with MS Office 2003) via e-mail to the Contract Specialist. Faxed information will not be considered. The file size limitation for e-mail attachments is 5 megabytes. Simple marketing information, incomplete responses, or references to vendor websites will not be considered by the Government.  Electronic responses must be received by March 31, 2009. Questions concerning this notice must be received in writing via e-mail to the Contract Specialist no later than March 13, 2009. 

Again:  NO FORMAL SOLICITATION IS BEING ISSUED AT THIS TIME. 

The Government will not return any information submitted in response to this notice, nor will the Government pay for any information submitted in reply to this notice. Information submitted will be used in SSA market research efforts and for procurement planning purposes. The Government reserves the right to contact, or not contact, any party responding to this notice in order to obtain further information for market research purposes.

<DESC><p>The Office of the Federal Detention Trustee (OFDT) in support of the United States Marshals Service (USMS), is conducting a Sources Sought synopsis for information purposes only. This is not a solicitation announcement. Currently, no solicitation is available. This request for information does not commit the Government to pay any cost incurred in preparation of any submission to this Sources Sought Notice. The purpose of this request for information is to gain knowledge of potential qualified sources. Responses to this sources sought synopsis will be used by the Government to make appropriate acquisition decisions. After review of the responses to this sources sought synopsis, and if the Government still plans to proceed with the acquisition, a solicitation announcement will be publicized in FedBizOpps. All interested offerors will be required to respond to the solicitation announcement in addition to responding to this sources sought synopsis. It is the potential offeror&rsquo;s responsibility to monitor this site for the release of any solicitation or synopsis.

<DESC>PRE-QUALIFICATION NOTICE AND REQUEST FOR QUALIFICATIONS

This notice serves as public announcement that United States Postal Service (USPS) is seeking to pre-qualify sources for participation in future competitive acquisitions for selection of contractors to provide, operate and manage Mail Transport Equipment Service Centers (MTESC).  Mail Transport Equipment (MTE) is used to transport mail in and between postal processing facilities.  MTE consists of mailbags, various metal containers, plastic and corrugated fiberboard trays and sleeves, canvas hampers, and pallets.  The MTESC functions are to process and repair MTE and return it to service within the postal system.  These sites are designed to provide for the processing and repair of MTE and are part of an established network formed to ensure that adequate, timely, and high quality MTE is available to USPS Processing and Distribution Centers, Bulk Mail Centers and their customers. 

Prequalification is the process of up-front identification of top-quality suppliers able to compete for specific types of contract opportunities. Selection of the right suppliers is critical to the Postal Service's success.  Having the right suppliers augments the Postal Service's ability to deliver high-quality and innovative services to its customers and reduces operational risks.  Pre-qualifying suppliers enhances competition, ensures quality performance, and can also shorten cycle time and strengthen relationships between the Postal Service and its suppliers.  
The USPS intends to pre-qualify an adequate number of suppliers whose record of performance in the marketplace (commercial or governmental or both) have demonstrated their ability to consistently perform to high standards of quality and reliability.  All qualified suppliers need not be placed on the pre-qualified list if the purchase team determines (1) that a smaller group will provide adequate competition or (2) that some suppliers are considerably more qualified than others, thereby precluding purchase opportunities for the less qualified. It is the intent of USPS to use this pre-qualified suppliers list for future solicitations for certain MTESC contracts over a 3 year period following the completion of this prequalification.  
Pre-qualification Criteria: The USPS will evaluate a firm’s pre-qualification submission against each of the Prequalification Evaluation requirements listed in the document titled Prequalification Request/Criteria (Exhibit -1). Interested parties must download the pre-qualification package from FedBizOpps.  Pre-qualification responses will be due by 1:00 PM (EST) March 17, 2009.  All questions and comments regarding any aspect of this notice or the enclosure must be sent by email at the address above or by facsimile at 202-268-8111 by 03/05/09 not later than 1:00 PM (EST).  Pre-qualification does not constitute a contract award.  Any interested firms and incumbent suppliers who have previously been pre-qualified must submit a response to this notice in order to be considered for this prequalification opportunity.  This announcement does not in any way commit the USPS to the reimbursement of any proposal cost or expense, or otherwise create an obligation on the part of the USPS.  The USPS is not obligated to award any contract as a result of this announcement. 

EXHIBITS

1.	Pre-Qualification Request / Criteria
2.	Description of the MTESC operational requirements.
3.	Estimated Volume for each MTESC site.
4.	Estimated Frequency of trips to the customer base in each MTESC location.

<DESC>Description<BR><BR>This is a Request for Information and does not constitute a solicitation or request for proposal. This market survey will be used to provide information on a flashlight evaluation effort under the Family of Flashlights (FoF) Program and introduce a revised Approved Family of Flashlight List (AFFL).  Once the revised AFFL is released, all candidates on the pre-existing AFFL will no longer be valid.  All interested vendors, including those on the current AFFL, must submit flashlights for revised AFFL testing.  The U.S. Army Product Manager, Clothing and Individual Equipment (PM-CIE) is currently seeking qualified sources to provide  commercially available flashlights  that satisfy the Buy American Act, Sec. 25.101, (a) (1), and (2), and to Sec. 25.103. All submissions shall be provided by the vendor at no cost or obligation to the Government.Any information collected shall not be disclosed outside the Government. Test data for all submitted items will only be provided to the designated Vendor.  Interested parties should provide the following to the points of contact by 30 June 2008: product literature, product specification, and cost information (both GSA and MSRP prices). All products will be tested as submitted. All factors, to include cost, will be considered for inclusion on the AFFL using a systematic approach.  The AFFL will consist of three categories of flashlights: 1) Hands Free Helmet Light (HFHL), 2) Tactical Handheld Light (THL), and 3) Basic White Lights (BWL) (non aftermarket filters (red, blue, IR) are acceptable and encouraged). Limit 3 items for each category per company.  <BR><BR>Selection Process<BR><BR>The selection process for the AFFL will use a down-select process. This process will consist of 3 Phases: Phase I  Physical Characteristics/Lumen Testing, Phase II  Technical Testing, and Phase III  User Evaluation. A scoring system will be used for Phase II and III.  No external lab testing conducted outside of the Army for any phases of testing will be acceptable. All flashlights will be tested to the same procedures through Aberdeen Testing Center (ATC). A scoring conference will be held to determine which lights will be selected for the AFFL. Metrics will be weighted where Technical Testing is most important of all the areas and is significantly more important than the Physical Characteristics Testing. Physical Characteristics Testing is more important than the User Evaluation, which is more important than Cost. <BR><BR>Physical Characteristics/Lumen Testing --Phase I<BR><BR>All candidates must meet all of the threshold performance criteria (Phase I) listed per category in its entirety in order to proceed to Phase II.<BR><BR>The threshold performance criteria for the HFHL are: 1) Must be compatible with the Advanced Combat Helmet (ACH) and side mountable with no helmet modification, 2) Highest power setting must provide a minimum of 5 lumens for 24 hours, 3) Dimensions of entire system with all attachments must not exceed 3x 3x 2, 4) Power source must be AA or Lithium 123 batteries, 5a) Must provide white light color and integrated secondary color of red or blue, 5b) and IR capability, 6) Must weigh no more than 4 oz. with power source and mounting accessories, 7) Must be subdued in color (Foliage Green, Desert Sand, Black, and Urban Gray).  <BR><BR>The threshold performance criteria for the THL are: 1) Must provide a clip for secure fastening, 2) Highest power settings must provide a minimum of 40 lumens continuous for 60 minutes, 3) Dimensions of entire system with all attachments must not exceed 6 in length, 4) Power source must be AA or Lithium 123 batteries, 5a) Must provide white light color and integrated secondary color of red or blue, 5b) and IR capability, 6) Weigh no more than 6 oz. (with power source), 7) Be subdued in color (Foliage Green, Desert Sand, Black, and Urban Gray).  <BR><BR>The threshold performance criteria for the BWL are: 1) Must provide a clip for secure fastening, 2) Highest power settings must provide a minimum of 40 lumens continuous for 60 minutes, 3) Dimensions of entire system with all attachments must not exceed 6 in length, 4) Power source must be AA or Lithium 123 batteries, 5) Weigh no more than 6 oz. (with power source), 6) Be subdued in color (Foliage Green, Desert Sand, Black, and Urban Gray).  Note: Non-aftermarket filters (red, blue, IR) are acceptable and encouraged<BR><BR>Lumen Testing Procedure<BR><BR>This test will be performed in a darkened room using a Labsphere Uniform Source System (USS), model USS-2000V, 20-in. integrating sphere with an internal Silicon Detector Assembly (SDA), model SDA-060-P.  A calibration conversion factor will be calculated by holding one of each flashlight type in the 8-in. input port of the sphere while all three internal sphere lights are on and the flashlight is off. The front of the flashlights will be fitted to custom templates cut from white foam backing board to seal the opening of the input port of the integrating sphere for both calibration and testing.  A total of three flashlights will be tested by holding the flashlights in the input port with the internal sphere lights off and the flashlight on after operating for one hour. The output of the SDA will be recorded and then converted to lumens using the calibration conversion<BR>factor determined for each flashlight type. <BR><BR>A total of three flashlights per candidate model will be tested for lumens; all three flashlights must pass to advance to Phase II of the selection process. If any of the three flashlights fail the lumen test, the failing light(s) shall be allowed one retest with new batteries.  Failing a second time will be deemed a failure for that flashlight candidate model.<BR><BR>Phase II<BR><BR>Only candidates which have successfully satisfied Phase I requirements, will then advance to Phase II, Technical Testing. Phase II will consist of 5 environmental tests listed below.  5 new flashlights shall be subjected to each of the tests (25 flashlights total).  A minimum of 4 of the 5 flashlights must achieve the testing requirements for each environmental test for the flashlight system to receive a qualifying score.<BR><BR>1.

<DESC><p>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. This is a notice of intent to award a sole source contract under statutory authority 10 USC 2304(c)(1), set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1(a)(1), Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.
<p>Joint Communications Support Element (JCSE), 8532 Marina Bay Dr., MacDill AFB, FL 33621, requires two (2) 40KW generators to use for spare parts. The 6th Contracting Squadron intends to make an award to Fischer Panda Generators, Inc., 4345 N.E. 12th Terrace, Oakland Park, FL 33334. Interested parties may e-mail Joyce Wright at joyce.wright@macdill.af.mil or fax 813-828-5111, no later than Monday, 9 March 2009, 9:00 a.m. EST.</p>
<p>Per FAR Part 5.207-13(i) Fed Biz Ops Numbered Note 22 applies and is modified to read:</p>
<p>22. The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received by Monday, 9 March 2009, 9:00 a.m. EST will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>V. DEMONSTRATION THAT THE CONTRACTOR'S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS OR NATURE OF THE ACQUISITION REQUIRES THE USE OF THE AUTHORITY CITED ABOVE (APPLICABILITY OF AUTHORITY)</p>
<p>Fischer-Panda originally designed and built these 40KW generators specifically to meet Joint Communication Support Element's (JCSE) tactical requirements. Due to the unique mission that JCSE has and the specific power and air conditioning requirements needed, JCSE purchased these manufacturer specific generators. JCSE is constantly staying abreast of new technologies and manufacturers in order to distribute Department of Defense funds to other companies but the Fischer Panda generators that we currently have in our inventory are in need of repair. JCSE currently has 19 of these generators in service and needs to purchase replacement main generators in order to repair two that are broken. The purchase of new generators to replace current stock would cost the government approximately $227,999.81 - $321,100.00. There would also be additional costs to have them adapted. This is would be an unnecessary expense for the government since the generators we are currently using are in good working condition. It is in the best interest of the government just to purchase two Fischer Panda generators than to resoliticit for a brand new requirement.</p>

<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%"><span style="color: #000000;">Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL) is the sixth most common cancer. It is the cancer of lymphoid tissue and lymph nodes of the lymphatic system, derived from B-cell or T-cell lymphocytes, two types of white blood cells. Lymph nodes produce and store lymphocytes as part of a process that generates an immune response against infections. In 2008, an estimated 66,120 new diagnoses were made and 19,160 people died of NHL in the United States.<a style="mso-footnote-id: ftn1" name="_ftnref1" href="https://www.fbo.gov/index?tab=ndet&amp;id=844141acc92549899f337fbe9cef196b&amp;#_ftn1"><span><span style="mso-special-character: footnote"><span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">[1]</span></span></span></span></a></span></p>

<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%"><span style="color: #000000;">The current treatment of NHL, which varies depending on the progression of the disease, involves radiation, chemotherapy or a combination of chemotherapy and immunotherapy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Recently, radioimmunotherapy using the radionuclide-tagged Lym-1 monoclonal antibody has been used in clinical trials to selectively deliver cytotoxic radiation to the disease. While this approach has shown considerable success, one disadvantage of radioimmunotherapy is the long residence time of the antibody in the body. This leads to the irradiation of sensitive, normal cells. Antibodies have also been observed to provoke a serious immune response in the patient. </span></p>

<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%"><span style="color: #000000;">Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) and University of California, Davis have developed a synthetic ligand<sup>2</sup> with a similar affinity and specificity to the antibody Lym-1,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>which binds to the HLA-DR10 receptor on the surface of B-cell lymphocytes. The HLA-DR10 marker is present on the lymphoma cells of over eighty percent (80%) of patients diagnosed with NHL. Using small molecule screening techniques and engaging with synthetic chemists to produce the compound, we have created a small molecule that mimics the binding of the Lym-1 antibody to NHL cells. The selective high affinity ligand (SHAL) binds specifically to cells that have the HLA-DR10 cell receptor and exhibits minimal uptake by other organs<sup>3</sup>, such as the kidneys and liver. The compound has been shown in animal studies to have improve pharmacokinetic properties when compared to antibodies and is less likely to elicit an immune response. The compound is selectively cytotoxic to cultured cells expressing HLA-DR10<sup>4</sup> and has been shown to induce the regression of xenograft tumors in mice<sup>5</sup>.<a style="mso-footnote-id: ftn2" name="_ftnref2" href="https://www.fbo.gov/index?tab=ndet&amp;id=844141acc92549899f337fbe9cef196b&amp;#_ftn2"><span><span style="mso-special-character: footnote"><span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">[2]</span></span></span></span></a></span></p>

Derivatives of the molecules have been produced with biotin, fluorochrome or metal chelating tags for use in staining cells/tissues or charging with radionuclides for targeted radiotherapy. Modifications have been made to enhance uptake and selective retention of the molecules in tumor cells. Pharmacokinetic studies have revealed the molecules exhibit tissue uptake and blood and body clearance rates characteristic of small molecule therapeutics. Other experiments have been conducted to assess the efficacy of two of the compounds in killing tumor cells. Both compounds are selectively cytotoxic to tumor cell lines expressing HLA-DR10; these molecules have no adverse effect on cell lines lacking HLA-DR10 (normal or tumor). One of these compounds has also been observed to induce the regression of tumor xenografts in mice. </span><span style="font-weight: normal; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000; line-height: 150%;">Two patent applications have been filed.</span></p>

<DESC>The Minneapolis Veterans Affairs Medical Center will host a Market Research Information Session for non-motorized general transport stretchers and stretchers to be used for eye surgery on March 16, 2009 at the Minneapolis VA Medical Center, Room 1S-126, One Veterans Drive, Minneapolis, MN 55417. If you plan to attend and present please contact, Nancy Kirchner @nancy.kirchner@va.gov or 612-629-7016. The Objectives are to familiarize staff with commercial off-the-shelf stretchers and the  accessories available; conduct market research to understand clinical features and functions commonly available in modern commercial offerings. Vendors can bring in procedural stretchers to demonstrate more options. Vendors may have two options for reducing the push force and wanting to demonstrate this capacity would be another reason to bring in more than one transport stretcher.  The accessories include, but are not limited to IV poles, IV pole transporters, O2 tank holders, leg extensions, chart holders, & side rail pads.  Attendees will identify functional requirements for the Minneapolis VAMC systems.THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) Cost Department (AIR-4.2) needs an Excel add-in with probability distribution goodness-of-fit testing and Monte Carlo simulation capabilities for as many as 325 analysts in order to conduct cost risk analyses, an essential component of all our products.  The Modeling and Simulation FAM has approved (with restrictions), and NMCI has tested and is preparing for RADIA “push” Palisade Corporation’s @RISK Professional version 5.0.1 as a replacement for @RISK 4.0.5 which no longer functions properly on NMCI machines.  @RISK, a proprietary commercial software product from Palisade Corporation incorporates a number of algorithms for generating random variates from 39 different probability distributions, conducting simulations using either the Monte Carlo or Latin Hypercube algorithms, and generating both tabular and graphical output laden with useful statistical analysis.  Additionally, @RISK incorporates the chi-square, Anderson-Darling and Kolmogorov-Smirnov procedures for testing a probability distribution’s goodness of fit.  Excel alone does not provide any of these capabilities.  The requirement will be negotiated as a sole source with Palisade Corporation, 798 Cascadilla Street, Ithaca, NY 14850.  Palisade Corporation’s @Risk software has the edge in price, ease of use, and capability.  A Firm Fixed Price contract, with a base and four (4) option years, will be issued with the anticipated delivery date of 8 April 2009 in the total estimated dollar value of $170,985.23.  For questions or concerns please contact Erica Finch by phone: 301-757-8952 or email: erica.finch@navy.mil.  Numbered Note 22 applies.

<RESPDATE>031209
<CONTACT>Glen Seipp, Contract Specialist, Email glen.seipp@fema.gov - Matthew Manning, Contracting Officer, Email matthew.manning@dhs.gov
<DESC><p>This is a combined commercial synopsis/solicitation, (HSFEEM-09-Q-0017) supplemented with additional information included herein (SOW Attached). This announcement constitutes the only solicitation for quotes, as a separate written solicitation will not be issued. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS)/FEMA has a requirement for hotel/motel rooms for up to a total of 980 "room nights" for participants attending the FY 2009 HSGP Peer Review Conference. DHS/FEMA has tentatively scheduled the conference for May 3-8, 2009, with access to meeting rooms required on Sunday for setup before the conference begins. The preferred conference pattern is to have meeting days Monday through Friday with participants divided into 25-30 panels of 10; plenary sessions for the entire group will also take place, most likely Monday morning and Thursday morning. The meeting adjourns by Friday with teardown no later than Friday afternoon. The room block pattern is attached in the SOW/Details. Meeting room, breakout facilities, lunch service, and business office accommodations are also required (See Attached SOW/Details). The Government procures lodging to insure the availability of rooms for a large number of people at the same location in order to receive at a minimum, the Government rate in accordance with the GSA Federal Travel Regulations. The hotel/motel shall be in compliance with the Hotel/Motel Fire Safety Act. The hotel/motel must be within 20 miles of the Dallas, TX central business district and must be capable of offering facilities capable of accommodating up to approximately 250 attendees considering guest rooms and all other business associated conference facilities (See Attached SOW/Details). The hotel/motel shall honor any standard cancellation policy regarding any cancellations, and any billing policy for no-shows, meaning that no-shows will be billed for the date that would have been the date of check-in only. Participants will call the hotel/motel at least 21 days prior to the conference date to reserve their room. Callers will identify themselves as participants (attendees) in the "FY 2009 HSGP Peer Review Conference," and give the hotel/motel the dates for which they will require lodging. Conference attendees will make their reservations by individual call in; rooms will be reserved on each caller's personal credit card. If the hotel/motel is contacted by a Federal Government employee, the caller will be required to pay for their lodging using their personal Federal Government Travel Card. Any state or local participant (attendee) requesting an earlier arrival or later departure than listed below, shall be personally responsible for payment. The "Grand Total" quoted price shall represent the total cost for the entire period for which the conference will be held. The "Grand Total" is a Not-To-Exceed price - whereby the hotel/motel shall only invoice the Government for, and the Government shall only pay for, conference facilities/space and audio-visual costs if separately quoted cost items, and the actual number of guest rooms not occupied and paid for by anticipated conference attendees during the period of the conference in accordance with the hotel's standard contract terms and conditions. The quote for blocking the number of guests rooms should be structured in a format that indicates if the break/snack costs are included as part of the quoted room costs, whether or not the conference facilities/space are included as part of the package covering the cost of the guest rooms to be blocked, or if this will be a separate charge in accordance with the offeror's standard contract terms and conditions. Additionally, offerors must clearly indicate the cost of the audio-visual requirements if not included as part of the conference facilities/space. If the break/snack cost, the conference facilities/space and the cost of the audio-visual are not provided as an integral part of the cost of guest rooms to be blocked in accordance with the hotels standard contract, the price of the conference facilities and audio-visual requirements must be clearly listed as separate cost items. If the break/snack costs are not or cannot be included in accordance with the Federal Travel Regulations guest room cost, please clearly indicate this cannot be done as the break/snack requirement and cost will then be deleted in its' entirety from the resulting order. Offerors should also provide a copy of their standard contract listing all terms and conditions upon which the quote is based. A purchase order in the amount sufficient to cover all quoted costs will be issued to the lowest cost offeror representing the best value to the Government. Upon conclusion of the conference and final determination of final costs such as costs expected to be but not covered by the attendees, conference facilities/space, and costs associated with audio-visual requirements if not included with package quote, will be covered under the commercial purchase order to be issued by the Government in accordance with the hotel's standard contract terms and conditions. Upon final determination and payment of all pending charges payable by the Government in order to satisfy the terms of the hotel's accepted contract, all remaining funding on the purchase order will be de-obligated. The per night lodging cost shall not exceed the cost listed in the Federal Travel Regulations. If possible without exceeding the Federal Travel Regulations maximum nightly room rate, it is highly desired that offerors include the cost of the refreshments as part of the per night room cost (See Attached SOW/Details Discussing Refreshments). Additionally, in order to insure competitiveness, additional discounts are encouraged. It is requested that the Federal Government be granted a general tax exemption for all rooms to be paid for by the Federal Government. Quotes shall be inclusive of the per-night cost per room, a sub-total cost indicating the cost for each of the three (3) night periods separately, and a Grand Total for the entire period. In order to be considered for award, the offer must be determined to be the "best-value" to the Government. The quotation packages will be evaluated as a best value award using trade-offs between technical and cost factors in determining which offeror best meets or exceeds the Government's needs. The evaluation factors are as follows:
<p>(1) The offeror must demonstrate ability to provide the requested number of guest rooms/nights and associated conference facilities as described in the SOW on the dates indicated; (2) The offeror must be within (20) geographical miles of the Dallas, TX central business district; (3) The offeror must be in compliance with the Hotel/Motel Fire Safety Act. The following Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) provisions apply to this procurement: FAR 52.212-1 Instructional to Offeror-Commercial Items, 52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items. In compliance with FAR 52.212-5, the following additional clauses are incorporated as part of and apply to this acquisition: 52.203-10 Price or Fee Adjustment for Illegal or Improper Activity, 52.219-8 Utilization of Small Business Concerns, 52.222-6 Equal Opportunity, 52.222-35 Affirmative Action for Special Disabled and Vietnam Era Veterans, 52.222-36 Affirmative Action for Handicapped Workers, 52.222-37 Employment Reports on Special Disabled Veterans and Veterans of the Vietnam Era, 52.225-3 Buy American Act-Supplies. The clause at 52.215-1 Instructions to Offerors-Competitive Acquisitions also applies to this acquisition.

Answers to all questions will be provided to all respondents at the same time via electronic posting to the FedBizOpps site.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This solicitation, TIRNO-09-Q-00B04, Provisions and clauses in effect through FAC 2005-29 Amendment 1 are incorporated into this RFQ. This procurement is a set-aside for Small Business. The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 423430. The small business size standard is 100 Employees. 

CLIN 0001 Annual Maintenance for TEDS development, test and production environment including Dongle Keys 242863, 706306, 908510, T-7854, T-7849, T-7803, 102078, T-8529, and T-8526. Period of Performance is 1/01/2009 - 12/31/2009.

The IRS is seeking competitive RFQs for the following brand name requirement. EMC Captiva software annual maintenance"" the rationale is that this requirement is for the maintenance of critical EMC Captiva SW components that must be fully functional for the project to provide the designed functionality. The EMC Captiva SW must work with the Kodak & Fujitsu document scanners and provide the CSPC operators & data entry teams the ability to transcribe the information received. The Tax Exempt Determination System (TEDS) is a production system used by Employee Plans/Exempt Organization (EP/EO) Determination Specialists & Managers. TEDS was delivered with new COTS SW technology and significantly enhanced functionality. TEDS Release 2 provides functionality that will facilitate the processing of determinations with image scanning, electronic case management, and automated business rules. The EP/EO personnel involved in the determination process will be able to review cases through desktop or portable computing systems, replacing the current practice of hardcopy review only. Routing of cases between district and regional offices will be greatly enhanced as electronic data and images will be routed instead of paper. The EMC Captiva SW is already installed and operating in the IRS environment as described above. It would be too costly to procure new software, install and test the software, and have it operational immediately for use by the Service during tax season. This is an RFQ and brand name justification to procure EMC Captiva software annual maintenance. The IRS is not requesting information from resellers of other brand name but manufacturers that can perform the brand name equivalent. All manufacturers that can perform the equivalent function/services should submit their technical qualifications and literature.

<CONTACT>Stuart T Hitchings, Phone 301-837-0310, Email stuart.hitchings@nara.gov
<DESC>The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) intends to award on a sole source basis in accordance with FAR Clause 6.302-1 with Hispanic Associates of Colleges and Universities, 8415 DataPoint Dr, Suite 400, San Antonio, TX 78229 to participate in the Hispanic Associates of Colleges and Universities National Internship program for the period of June 8, 2009 through August 14, 2009.


The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) has a critical need to expand its recruitment presence in the Hispanic community.  Indeed, NARA’s Strategic Plan calls for NARA to strive toward increasing the percentages of NARA employees in underrepresented groups to match their respective availability levels in the civilian labor force.  Currently, Hispanics comprise only 1.3 percent of NARA’s workforce, as compared to 7.0 percent of the Federal workforce and 6.9 percent of the total civilian labor force.  Traditional recruitment methods alone are not enough to address this problem, and the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) has instructed Federal agencies to look to alternative sources for Hispanic applicants.  One source that is specifically recommended by OPM is the Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities (HACU).  HACU is the only national education association that represents collectively those U.S. colleges and universities designated as Hispanic-Serving Institutions.  As such, HACU can provide NARA with a unique level of access to highly qualified Hispanic students, thereby increasing NARA’s visibility within the Hispanic community.


The supplies and services to be provided are commercial within the meaning of FAR Clause 52.212.1. This statutory authority for other than full and open competition is USC 2304 (c) (1). Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.   Oral communications are not acceptable. The contract will be issued on or about March 16,2009 and will be for a period of 2 months .  The Government will not be responsible for any costs incurred in responding to this notice. Refer to Note 22 in Fedbizzopps. This contract is estimated to be awarded for a Base performance Period of 12 months and one twelve-month Option Period.


The following clauses and provisions are incorporated and are to remain in full force in any resultant fixed price purchase order:  FAR Clause 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors Commercial Items (Nov 2007); FAR Clause 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications- Commercial Items (Nov 2007); offerors shall complete only paragraph (k) of this provision if the offeror  has completed the annual representations and certificates electronically at http://orca.bpn.gov. If an offeror has not completed the annual representations and certifications electronically at the ORCA website, the offeror shall complete only paragraphs (b) through (j) of this provision – a copy of the provision can be found at http://www.arnet.gov/far/: FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Terms (Feb 07); FAR 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial Items (Dec 2007). Paragraph (b) of this clause incorporates by reference the following FAR clauses: 52.222-3 Convict Labor (Jun 2003), 52.222-19 Child Labor- Cooperation with Authorities and Remedies (Aug 2007), 52-222-21 Prohibition of Segregated Facilities (Feb 1999), 52.222-26 Equal Opportunity (Mar 2007), 52.232-33 Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer—Central Contractor Registration (Oct 2003) 52-217-9 Option to Extend the Term of the Contract (Mar 2000)

Statement of Work
Rent Comparability Studies
HUD Mark Up to Market (MU2M) Program

A.	Background & Objectives

	Section 8 laws and administrative procedures require HUD obtain & review Rent Comparability Studies (RCSs) when initially renewing most Section 8 contracts and when processing some rent increases using the Annual Adjustment Factors.  The market rents resulting from these studies determine the rents owners can receive and, hence, greatly influence whether an owner will renew & continue providing assisted housing or opt-out of the Section 8 contract and convert to unassisted, market rent housing.  The market rents set in these studies also drive HUD's outlays for Section 8 project-based subsidy.

	In most cases, owners hire the appraiser and submit the RCS to HUD.  However, in some cases HUD must directly contract for the RCS.  HUD is required to purchase a study when the owner elects to mark rents up to market under Option I of HUD's Section 8 Renewal Policy Guide.  This request seeks appraisers to prepare RCSs on these mark-up-to market (MU2M) cases.

B.	Scope of Services

1.	The contractor shall prepare Rent Comparability Studies for Section 8 contracts identified by the GTR/GTM.  The contractor shall prepare the study in accordance with the procedures set forth in Chapter 9 of the HUD Section 8 Renewal Policy Guide (the HUD Guide), the Guide can be found at 

http://www.hud.gov/offices/hsg/mfh/exp/guide/s8guide.cfm

It can also be accessed through the following procedure: hud.gov; click on multifamily industry; click on Section 8 expiring contracts; click on Section 8 Renewal Policy Guidebook; click on entire Section 8 Renewal Policy Guidebook; go to Chapter 9.

2.	The contractor shall furnish all personnel, material, supplies, equipment, transportation and facilities necessary to provide the services required by this contract.

C.	Tasks Required in Preparing a RCS

	The contractor shall comply with the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice (USPAP) in the manner discussed in the HUD Guide, particularly Section 9-9.  The contractor shall perform the tasks required by Chapter 9, Section 9-7, of the HUD Guide.  These tasks include, but are not limited to:

1.	Analyzing the subject Section 8 property as required in Section 9-9 of the HUD Guide, including:

•	identifying unit types the RCS must cover and classifying unit types as primary or secondary.

•	inspecting and photographing the property and documenting the project's condition, appeal and other characteristics

•	identifying the property's market area and assessing, the neighborhood surrounding the property

2.	Selecting comparables.  For each primary unit type, the contractor must try to locate five comparable units that meet the six conditions in Chapter 9, Section 9-10, of the HUD Guide.  If the contractor cannot locate five properties that meet all six conditions, the contractor shall select comparables in accordance with the guidance in Section 9-10 of the HUD Guide.

3.	Collecting & documenting data on comparables.  The contractor must collect data as required by Sections 9-11 of the HUD Guide and document the data as required by that section of the HUD Guide of the Notice.  For each primary unit type, the contractor must prepare a Comparable Property Profile and a Rent Comparability Grid (HUD 92273-S8) as set forth in Section 9-11.C and Appendix 9-2.  The profile must contain at least the information required by Appendix 9-4 of the HUD Guide.  The contractor must prepare the Rent Grid in accordance with the instructions in Appendix 9-8 of the HUD Guide.  The appraiser should use HUD's Excel form to prepare the Grid, unless the GTM agrees to another method of filing in the Grid.

4.	Computing an adjusted rent for each primary unit type as directed in Section 9-12 of the HUD Guide.  The contractor must take care to comply with that Section’s direction on non-shelter services.

5.	Using the adjusted rents to derive a market rent for each unit type as directed in Section 9-13 of the HUD Guide.

6.	Preparing the report in the format required by the HUD Guide.  The report must comply with Section 9-14 and Appendix 9-10 of HUD Guide.  Narratives required in the report must be concise but contain enough information that a person not familiar with the properties and market areas involved can understand how the appraiser arrived at his/ her conclusions. It is strongly suggested that the appraiser use Appendix 9-3, the Rent Comparability Study enclosed in the HUD Guide as a model for their report.

D.	Who Can/Can't Perform The Work Requested.

1.	The RCS must be prepared by, or under the direction of, a state- certified general appraiser who meets all of the qualifications in Section 9-8 of the HUD Guide.  That appraiser must sign and take full responsibility for the report, but an appraisal assistant may contribute to any of the tasks if. 1) the assistant is employed by the same firm as the appraiser; and 2) the report identifies the roles the assistant appraiser performed.

2.	The contractor shall not employ or subcontract with any person who is a current or former civilian employee of the U.S. government if the employment of that person would create a conflict of interest, an appearance of any conflict, or otherwise conflict with Federal or FIUD ethics rules.  The contractor shall be responsible for resolving any actual or appearance of a conflict of interest and shall not rely on HLJD to resolve the issue through reassignment of workload or any other means

E.	Deliverables and Schedule Requirements

Within 30 calendar days of receipt of HUD's RCS order or within any alternate time agreed to by the GTR the contractor shall submit two sets of the following, in hard copy, to the GTM.  Each of these materials must meet the applicable requirements of Chapter 9 of the HUD Guide.  If the GTM requests it, the contractor must submit the Rent Comp Grid in Excel on disk or via email.  At a minimum, the deliverable must contain the elements set forth in Section 9-14 of the HUD Guide:

1.	Appraiser's Transmittal Letter
2.	Scope of Work
3.	Description of Subject Property (including color photographs)
4.	Identification of the Subject's Market Area
5.	Description of Neighborhood
6.	Narrative Describing Selection of Comparables
7.	Locator map for Subject and Comparables
8.	Rent Comparability Grid (HUD 92273-S8) for Each Primary Unit Type
9.	Narrative explaining adjustments and market rent conclusions (one set of explanations for each Rent Grid)
10.	Comparable Property Profile for each Comparable (including a color photograph)
11.	Appraiser's Certification
12.	Appraiser's License (only if relying upon temporary license)

F.	Disclosure of information.

Except as specifically authorized elsewhere in this contract or as directed by the GTR or Contracting Officer, the contractor shall not disclose any information about the conditions or management of properties to any party.

G.	Professional Liability Insurance:  Minimum coverage requirement of $250,000.

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. §6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.

Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause, or with any subsidiary of such an entity. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of national security.

Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for at least 80 percent each place it appears.
Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)—
(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held—
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.
Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.  (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.
(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:
(i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.
(d) Special Rule for Related Partnerships.

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights.
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:
(i) warrants;
(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.

FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation—Commercial Items (Jan 1999)
The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the government, price, and other factors considered.  The Government intends to evaluate quotes and award a contract without discussions with offerors (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a)). Therefore, the offeror’s initial proposal should contain the offeror’s best terms from a cost or price and technical standpoint. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offerors are listed in order of importance: (1) Technical Conformance to Specifications, (2) Price including Freight/Shipping Costs. The evaluation factor for award of this requirement will be based on lowest price technically acceptable quote obtained from a responsible offeror. The technical evaluation will include examination of the product literature and technical features for conformance with the requirements of the Specification Document. Evaluation of products will be on the basis of information furnished by the offeror or identified in the offer and reasonably available to the Contracting Officer.  The Contracting Officer is not responsible for locating obtaining any information not identified in the offer.  An offer that does not provide sufficient information which describes their capacity to meet the RFQ’s technical evaluation criteria can result in failure of this evaluation factor. Quotes may be submitted on company letterhead stationary and must include the following information: Solicitation Number, Nomenclature, Part Number, Unit Price, Extended Price, Payment Terms and discount offered for prompt payment.

(iii) The Government will evaluate offers in accordance with the policies and procedures of FAR Part 25. For line items covered by the WTO GPA, the Government will evaluate offers of U.S.-made or designated country end products without regard to the restrictions of the Buy American Act. The Government will consider for award only offers of U.S.-made or designated country end products unless the Contracting Officer determines that there are no offers for such products or that the offers for such products are insufficient to fulfill the requirements of the solicitation. 
(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals— 
(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; 
(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; 
(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and 
(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. 
(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: 
(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. 
(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. 
(ii) Examples. 
(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. §6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. 
(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. §6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. 
(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. §6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. 
(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. §362 (the Bankruptcy Code). 
(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).]

(2) o Outside the United States. 
(k) Certificates regarding exemptions from the application of the Service Contract Act. (Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.) [The contracting officer is to check a box to indicate if paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) applies.] 
[  ] (1) Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror o does o does not certify that—

(iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers. 
(3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies— 
(i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and 
(ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause. 
(l) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) (26 U.S.C. 6109, 31 U.S.C. 7701). (Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to a central contractor registration database to be eligible for award.) 
(1) All offerors must submit the information required in paragraphs (l)(3) through (l)(5) of this provision to comply with debt collection requirements of 31 U.S.C. 7701(c) and 3325(d), reporting requirements of 26 U.S.C. 6041, 6041A, and 6050M, and implementing regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.  Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.
(c) Special rules.  The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.
(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:

(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.

(i) warrants;
(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.     It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.     Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.     Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; 
(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property;

(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: 
(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. 
(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. 
(ii) Examples. 
(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. §6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. 
(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. §6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. 
(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. §6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. 
(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. §362 (the Bankruptcy Code). 
(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).]

(iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers. 
(3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies— 
(i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and 
(ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause. 
(l) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) (26 U.S.C. 6109, 31 U.S.C. 7701). (Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to a central contractor registration database to be eligible for award.)

Pacific Time on the day identified for closing herein. Point of Contact is: Dennis Riches, Contract Specialist, Portland VA Medical Center, 5115 NE 82nd Avenue, Vancouver, WA 98662, Phone 360-852-9882. Requirement Details:This requirement is to provide all of the labor, materials, equipment and services necessary for the construction of 3 sound-attenuated enclosures and development of computer programs & software (graphical interface software for delivery of a hearing loss prevention education program) for our Joint Incentive Fund (JIF) project (a collaboration between the Department of Defense and the Department of Veteran Affairs - specifically the National Center for Rehabilitative Auditory Research at the Portland VA Medical Center). The National Center for Rehabilitative Auditory Research (NCRAR) located at the Portland VAMC is the only auditory research and development center of its kind in the nation specifically dedicated to rehabilitation and hearing loss prevention. The NCRAR is leading efforts to discover new knowledge and develop useful technologies that optimize auditory rehabilitation services for hearing impaired veterans and the nation. The NCRAR is conducting a special non-research project titled "A Joint DoD-VA Hearing Loss Prevention Program (HLPP}." The project is financed as a Joint Incentive Fund (JIF) Health Care Sharing Initiative by the VA/DoD Sharing Office, a collaborative program between the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and the Department of Defense (DoD). The program's goals are to enhance access to, cost-effectiveness and quality of health care resources for military personnel and veterans. The goal of NCRAR's JIF project is to create a self-administered, interactive, multimedia Hearing Loss Prevention Program (HLPP) that can be delivered at military bases, primary care clinics, and other medical settings. Sound-attenuated enclosures (Hearing Education Centers) will be designed, fabricated and used to accommodate one participant at a time to interact with the program. Inside the enclosure, participants will receive instructions via headphones and will able to adjust the volume of the audio. Participants can then select from the following activities using a non-networked computer touch screen that will not request or save personal (identifiable) health information: 1} take a self-administered screening test of their high-frequency hearing; 2} learn why, when and how to protect their hearing; 3} learn how hearing works and how loud sounds damage hearing; 4} learn how sound intensity is measured and which sounds are too loud; 5) listen to demonstrations of simulated hearing loss; 6} learn how to select and use hearing protective devices; 7} evaluate the fit of their own ear plugs; 8} learn what they can do about tinnitus (ringing in the ears); and 9} learn about hearing health care services available to them. A printer inside the enclosure allows participants to receive a copy of their hearing screening results and other helpful information. Initially, one of these Hearing Education Centers will be installed at each of the following locations: Portland VA Medical Center, Madigan Army Medical Center (Fort Lewis, Washington) and Womack Army Medical Center (Fort Bragg, North Carolina). The project's long-term goal is to disseminate an effective hearing loss prevention education program that will help to reduce the prevalence and associated costs of noise-induced hearing loss and tinnitus in the veteran population. Ultimately, it is our intention to make the program available to all veterans, military personnel and other members of the general public by making the program accessible through the internet and medical center facilities throughout the country. Specific requirements for the enclosures include:Specific requirements for the enclosures include:  (see also attached drawing)"	Wheelchair accessible."	Exterior dimensions: 8 feet long, 6 feet wide, 7 feet high"	Meets or exceeds American National Standards Institute (ANSI) standards for conducting high-frequency hearing screening."	Hospital grade interior electric lighting and power supplies."	Large, double pane sound attenuating plexi-glass windows in walls and door to optimize natural lighting while mitigating extraneous external noise contaminants."	Ventilation system that does not cause detectable noise interference."	Customization, such as installation of a large plasma video screen on the exterior; locking interior cabinetry to securely house the non-networked personal computer, touch screen monitor and printer interfaces; interfaces between the interior computer, exterior plasma video screen, and "IN USE" sign near the door; and a large selection of color schemes and designs for the interior and exterior. "	Constructed in a way that allows them to be readily shipped, assembled, and disassembled multiple times without a loss of integrity or functionality.  Constructed to withstand excessive wear and tear brought about during utilization by thousands of unsupervised participants.  Specific requirements for the computer programs & graphical interface software include:"	Development of a computer program that will enable participants to conduct a self-administered screening test of their high-frequency hearing according to standards of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI)."	Development of a computer program that will enable participants to assess the attenuation and fit of their own ear plugs."	Development of computer graphical interface software that will enable participants to access and interact with all components of the educational program, including the hearing screening test and ear plug evaluation via touch screen monitor.  The interface must be attractive and intuitive, easy to use, and must encourage participants to interact with the program.  Features such as user prompts and timed reboots must be included to ensure smooth operation of this unsupervised, computer-based educational program."	Development of computer programs that will allow participants to print results of their hearing screening results and other information."	Development of computer programs that will control the exterior plasma video screen displayOther requirements:"	Development and fabrication of the enclosures, computer programs, graphical interface software and all associated components needs to take place in the vicinity of Portland, Oregon so that the NCRAR JIF Program Manager and Project Coordinator are able to direct and oversee every stage of the project closely, and to meet with the production team as often as needed."	The contractor must integrate physical components of the environment with the computer, graphical interface, touch screen monitor and printer modulesPrice Schedule:Item No.	Description	Qty	Unit	Unit Price 	Total Price0001	Sound Booth	3	Each	$	$0002	Software Creation and Installation	1	Copy	$	$0003	Project Management	3	Jobs	$	$0004	Installation of Booths	3	Jobs	$	$0005	Custom Made Crates for Shipping	3	Each	$	$Delivery:"	Complete fabrication of enclosures, computer programs, graphical interface software and all associated components within 6 months after receipt of order (ARO)"	Delivery of enclosures and all associated components to Fort Lewis (Washington), Fort Bragg (North Carolina) and Portland VA Medical Center

<DESC>AOO1:

Question:

What is meant by "legal conditions in Algeria"?  Does it mean "regulatory requirements for Quad Play in Algeria"? 
What is meant by "design model"?  Does this refer to a high level concept of what it would take to deploy Quad Play services in Algeria?  Or does it refer to the development of a network design? 
What is meant by "implementation plan"? Is this a high level plan identifying key tasks required for successful implementation of Quad Play services in Algeria?  Or does it refer to a Project Plan? 

Answer:

Your questions are referring to the specific project proposals received from Algeria.  The background information in the scope of work is derived from the request for support from the Algerians.  It is expected that the Contractor will address and clarify these issues upon award and contact with project sponsor.

Question:

I understand this to mean that the Contractor is required to visit each of the three countries concerned (Algeria, Tunisia and Libya) on two separate occasions (although the rationale for this requirement is not apparent to me).  Is this correct? 
 Additionally, assume a situation in which the Contractor team consists of two persons, capable to some degree of operating independently of one another.  Assume, furthermore, that each member of the two-person Contractor team spends 5 business days in Country X, the two stays being coterminous.  For purposes of the DM, would such a stay be equivalent to 5 business days or 10 business days, or perhaps something in between? 

Answer:

The contractor is required to visit Algeria, Tunisia and Libya once.  It is not required to visit each country twice.  The Contractor can determine how best to split up their time.  For example, they may choose to visit all three countries on the first trip and then only visit Tunisia on the second trip.  Or, they may choose to visit Algeria and Tunisia on the first trip and then only visit Libya on the second trip. It is up to the contractor’s discretion and this may be based upon preliminary research performed by the contractor upon reward.  
The situation outlined below would be equivalent to 5 business days.

<DESC>Please note the modified language in paragraph one.

The Defense Security Service (DSS) plans to award a firm fixed price level of effort contract for counterintelligence analyst services.  The award will be for a base year with options for increased level of effort and for additional analyst positions.  DSS intends to make award not later than January 30, 2009.   The NAICS code for this solicitation is 541990.  This requirement is a small business set aside.

The proposed acquisition is for seven counterintelligence analysts to provide technical and analytical intelligence/counterintelligence support to supplement the DSS Counterintelligence Office federal workforce.  Work will include analyzing and evaluating raw data collected from established sources to produce finished intelligence on geographic or functional areas, identification of intelligence gaps in collecting information and making recommendations for corrective action.  Contractor employees must have a top secret/SCI clearance prior to beginning work on the contract.  The place of performance for this contract will be at DSS headquarters in Alexandria, VA, Columbus, Ohio and Linthicum Md.  However, due to the agency’s anticipated BRAC moves, these locations will change, respectively, to Quantico, VA, Fort Meade, Md. and Quantico VA sometime in 2011.  DSS will make award to the responsible offeror who conforms to the solicitation and provides the best value to the Government. 

Contractors must be registered with the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) prior to doing business with DSS.  For additional information and to register in CCR, please visit www.ccr.gov.  

Interested offerors may submit a request for the solicitation to Karen.Oettinger@dss.mil by referencing solicitation number HS0021-09-P-0004.  Telephone inquiries will not be entertained.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal.

<DESC>Please find the RFP attached.  Proposals are due no later than 1:00 PM, Friday, January 23, 2009.

The Defense Security Service (DSS) plans to award a firm fixed price level of effort contract for counterintelligence analyst services.  The award will be for a base year with options for increased level of effort and for additional analyst positions.   The NAICS code for this solicitation is 541990.  This requirement is a small business set aside.

The proposed acquisition is for seven counterintelligence analysts to provide technical and analytical intelligence/counterintelligence support to supplement the DSS Counterintelligence Office federal workforce.  Work will include analyzing and evaluating raw data collected from established sources to produce finished intelligence on geographic or functional areas, identification of intelligence gaps in collecting information and making recommendations for corrective action.  Contractor employees must have a top secret/SCI clearance prior to beginning work on the contract.  The place of performance for this contract will be at DSS headquarters in Alexandria, VA, Columbus, Ohio and Linthicum Md.  However, due to the agency’s anticipated BRAC moves, these locations will change, respectively, to Quantico, VA, Fort Meade, Md. and Quantico VA sometime in 2011.  DSS will make award to the responsible offeror who conforms to the solicitation and provides the best value to the Government. 

Contractors must be registered with the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) prior to doing business with DSS.  For additional information and to register in CCR, please visit www.ccr.gov.

Offerors should verify in writing which items are listed on their GSA schedule contracts and which items are "open market" items. For an offer to qualify as an offer based on a GSA schedule contract, the value of "open market" items included in the offer may not exceed the applicable micro-purchase threshold as defined in FAR 2.101.In order to notate which items are open market, in accordance with FAR 8.402(f)(3), Seller must write "open market" in the Line Item Description for any item not currently active on the cited contract, or list in the Seller Bid Description field all open market line numbers (e.g. "Open Market Items: Lines 1, 2, 3.")<BR><BR>This Justification is on a Brand Name basis for the purchase of (1) Hewlett-Packard brand server and components. The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 41 USC 253(c)(1). . As this justification is issued on a brand name basis, no one contractors unique qualifications are used as the basis for this justification. Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Departments requirements. 
The Global Financial Service Center currently has a server farm with all Hewlett-Packard servers similar to the server being requested. The HP servers requested fit into current rack/space configuration, and substitutions will cause problems with space and compatibility (e.g. different hardware configurations, different baseline installation/bios/hardware anomalies, etc).. These servers are also already approved by the Department's IT Change Control Board and fit their baseline requirements. By purchasing an HP server only, GFSC has the ability to use interchangeable parts/drives from current HP servers, allowing for greater redundancy and potential uptime. This allows for a single set of spare parts for maintenance which helps control costs, and a single vendor point of contact for on-site maintenance thereby reducing administrative and operational overhead when maintenance is required.  By restricting the servers to a minimal number of models and manufacturers, the Department can leverage the availability of spare parts for these mission critical assets and minimal cost to the government. Similarly, this configuration control gives the Department to rapidly replace and provision servers utilizing server software imaging technology, as the source and target systems contain the same hardware. This capability is crucial to the effective remote administration of facilities at great distance from GFSC.<BR><BR>This repost amends the solicitation to correct part numbers and configuration data to ensure that items are fuly integrated/configured prior to shipment.<BR><BR>

<p style="MARGIN: 0in 0.5in 0pt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The Department of Homeland Security Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Individual Assistance Division (IA) mission is to ensure that individuals and families that have been impacted by disasters and major catastrophic events have access to the full range of FEMA programs in the most expeditious and cost effective manner available. FEMA's goal is to provide the highest level of quality in these services as possible to such individuals. In order to accomplish this goal, FEMA has a requirement for contractors to provide comprehensive emergency management, project management and program management services as well as construction, architectural, and engineering capabilities to support the IA mission in four areas:&nbsp; (a) Housing Support&nbsp; (b) Construction Services, (c) Mass Care, and (d) Planning, Staffing and Logistics Services. Contractor support must be available for multiple disaster missions of any size, anywhere within their awarded regional sector to provide disaster relief services to individuals within the United States and its territories.&nbsp; While these contracts are generally intended to support response to an initial recovery from high impact larger Presidentially-declared Major Disaster related missions, the contracts do not preclude FEMA from contracting with others, such as local or small businesses when market research or available information indicates that such entities have the capacity and capability to meet FEMA's requirement(s). FEMA's Acquisition strategy is to divide the U.S. and it's territories into four regional Sectors as follows:&nbsp; Alpha Sector (FEMA Regions 8, 9 and 10); Bravo Sector (FEMA Regions 1, 2 and 5); Charlie Sector (FEMA Regions 6 and 7); and Delta Sector (FEMA Regions 3 and 4).&nbsp;&nbsp; The solicitation will therefore allow for four (4) separate (single) IDIQ hybrid cost reimbursement, fixed priced, and time and materials contracts to be awarded; and each successful offeror will be assigned responsibility for one of the sectors indicated above. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Each contract shall be a five (5) multiple-year contract (one base plus four one-year each options.)</span></strong> After the award of the four (4) IDIQ contracts to separate contractors for a determined sector, no further competition for subsequent task orders will take place, unless the Government determines that an awardee cannot perform the services and terminates the contract; the impact of a single disaster/catastrophic event is or becomes so overwhelming that it exceeds the ability, capacity, or capability of a sector awardee in a manner that the sector awardee cannot perform the services in the time and at the quality level and quantity required by the Government: in such a case, the Government reserves the right to compete the task order among the other three (3) awardees to meet the shortfall(s), or conduct an other than full and open competition to award a contract for services in that sector, to one of the other three (3) vendors, in a case where a sector awardee's contract has been terminated. The NAICS code applicable to this solicitation is 561210 Facilities Support Services. The small business size standard is $32.5 million.&nbsp;&nbsp; This requirement will be competed using FAR Part 15 procedures. The Request for proposal is anticipated to be released on February 19, 2009.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Any question regarding this pre-solicitation must be in writing and will be answered during the release of the RFP.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Questions/Answers: contractors shall submit all questions regarding this requirement by email to Zahra Hashmi, the Contract Specialist at <a href="mailto:zahr.hashmi@dhs.gov">zahra.hashmi@dhs.gov</a>, and copy <a href="mailto:charles.clemons@dhs.gov">charles.clemons@dhs.gov</a>.</span></p>

<DESC>Pursuant to the notice of intent to compete released on January 27, 2009, the Ground-Based Midcourse Defense (GMD) Joint Program Office will conduct an Industry Day Kick-Off in Huntsville, AL on 12 March 2009 to provide an overview of operations and sustainment of the GMD system. In addition, MDA/GM will be hosting site visits at GMD Element locations at Huntsville, AL (the Advanced Research Center (ARC)); Fort Greeley, AK, Vandenberg AFB, CA and Colorado Springs, CO. Industry one-on-one discussions will also be held in the early May timeframe.

The purpose of these visits, one-on-one discussions and fact-finding sessions is to engage industry to identify and mitigate risk related to the competition and assist the government in developing the optimum approach to operating and sustaining the weapon system. MDA/GM will also develop a request for information that will lead to definition of scope for release of a request for proposal, delivery of proposals and award of a contract based on the competitive responses. 

A schedule of events and locations is as follows:

a. Industry Day Kick-Off in Huntsville, AL, 12 March 2009
b. Site Visit at Huntsville, AL, the ARC, 13 March 2009
c. Site visit at Fort Greely, AK, 23-27 March 2009
d. Site visit at Vandenberg AFB, CA, 6-10 April 2009
e. Site visit at Colorado Springs, CO, 20-24 April 2009
f. Industry One-on-One discussions at Huntsville, AL, 4-8 May 2009

Contractors are requested to provide names of attendees along with contact information, via email entitled “Industry Day Kickoff Attendees”, not later than March 4, 2009 to GMDPBLCompetition@MDA.mil. Additional instructions and registration information will be provided to all attendees based on initial contact information provided.  Following the Industry Day Kickoff, a list of all attendees and contact information will be posted as part of the Bidder’s Library to facilitate any teaming discussions by industry. 

Contractors are further requested to provide names of attendees at each of the site visits listed above along with contact information, via email entitled “Site Visit Attendees”, not later than March 4, 2009 to GMDPBLCompetition@MDA.mil. Additional instructions and registration information will be provided to all attendees based on initial contact information provided.

Visits require U.S. citizenship, a security clearance and may require site specific pre-visit training. Attendance at the industry day is not presently being constrained; for the site visits, each vendor will be limited to 5 personnel.  

A bidder’s library will also be made available for industry review and comment. We plan to add technical data and other information to the bidder’s library as they become available throughout the pre-solicitation phase. The bidder’s library will contain classified and export-controlled data; therefore, access will be restricted to personnel who have been pre-cleared by MDA contracting and security officials. Send all requests for access to the bidder’s library, via email entitled “Bidder’s Library Access”, to GMDPBLCompetition@MDA.mil and further instructions will be provided.  

Contractors are requested to provide names and contact information of attendees at the Industry One-on-One discussions planned in Huntsville, AL, the week of 4-8 May 2009, via email entitled “One-on-One Discussions Attendees”, not later than April 3, 2009, to GMDPBLCompetition@MDA.mil. Additional instructions and registration information will be provided to all attendees based on initial contact information provided.

Due to national security considerations, this acquisition will not be open to participation by foreign firms at either the prime or subcontract level.  The Government does not intend to limit either the number or types of teaming arrangements entered into by the potential offerors (i.e., any given contractor could propose as a prime contractor and/or participate as a subcontractor on one or more other proposing teams).  Further, we do not intend to impose any restrictions on team membership after award, except as necessary to prevent organizational conflicts of interest between this requirement and advisory and assistance contracts in support of the GMD Joint Program Office.

This special notice is informational only and is NOT a solicitation of information, request for proposals (RFP) or an invitation for bids (IFB), nor is it a commitment by the Government.  Requests for a solicitation will not receive a response. The Government will not pay for any costs incurred as a result of this notice.

PURPOSE: 
The purpose of the ASDRS Demonstration is to show the technical maturity of an actively stabilized drogue system for use in probe and drogue aerial refueling operations.  Following sufficient build up test flights, this demonstration will culminate in one or more flight tests of the ASDRS as part of the Navy’s X-47B Unmanned Combat Air System (UCAS-D) Autonomous Aerial Refueling (AAR) demonstration program.  The ASDRS shall be compatible with the current ARS design and operating envelope, including the transfer of fuel, demonstrating system performance and robustness in various probe and drogue (P&D) aerial refueling scenarios.

SCHEDULE
Award of an ASDRS demonstration program contract is expected 2nd QTR FY 2010, with the goal of successfully completing Safety of Flight/Airworthiness qualification no later than the 4th QTR FY 2011 (earlier is preferred).  It is anticipated that the integration asset(s) will be delivered no later than 3rd QTR FY 2011.  Following that, the program is expected to successfully demonstrate the stabilized drogue operation with manned F/A-18 receiver aircraft no later than 1st QTR FY 2012 and be ready for demonstration with the X-47B receiver no later than 4th QTR FY 2012.  The Government will require the delivery of a Technical Data Package (TDP) to support Flight Clearance in the 2nd QTR FY2011 timeframe.

DEMONSTRATION OBJECTIVES
1)	Develop and integrate an Airworthy ASDRS into the existing ARS system on the F/A-18E/F platform that will support both manned and unmanned refueling demonstrations.  
2)	Demonstrate reduction of drogue motion bandwidth (frequency and amplitude) as compared to a standard drogue at representative F/A-18 E/F aerial refueling altitudes and airspeeds under normal atmospheric conditions. Under these conditions, the ASDRS shall support repeated, successful plugs by surrogate and X-47B receiver aircraft.  Moderate turbulence conditions, if not demonstrated in flight, shall be demonstrated via analysis.
3)	Demonstrate accuracy, integrity, continuity and availability of the drogue position sensing function relative to the tanker (integrity, continuity and availability are demonstrated by analysis with verification of assumptions via flight test).
4)	Demonstrate ability of the drogue stabilization function to hold the drogue relative to a predetermined point (nominally the natural trail point of the drogue), including compensating for biases such as those caused by receiver forebody effects and other disturbances such as turbulence, tanker-induced motion, etc.
5)	Support safe and effective demonstration with multiple probe and drogue refueling systems/ operations (manned and unmanned), to include the transfer of fuel with: 
•	Probe-equipped Navy aircraft (piloted refueling)
•	Probe-equipped UAS Surrogate such as an F/A-18 C/D (automatic control refueling)
•	X-47B (autonomous refueling)
6)	Optional Objectives
•	Ability to integrate the ASDRS into other drogue-equipped tanker systems (such as commercial Omega tankers) to support demonstration
•	Consideration of stabilization modes for the ASDRS (e.g., inertial vs tanker body stabilization, considerations of wing-mounted systems, compensation for tanker motion)

DESIGN/ TECHNICAL OBJECTIVES
1)	Integration Objectives
a.	Adapts to ARS hose end and tailcone (stowage tunnel) without modification to the ARS.  Minor modifications to the stowage tunnel (for drogue stowage) and to the ARS exterior (for sensor apertures) may be allowable, if the impact is minimized. 
b.	Supports integration of the ARS with the F/A-18E/F, including additional data interface and control functions as required to support the demonstration
c.	Equivalent aerodynamic performance (drag, stability, extension, retraction) over the same or greater envelope as the current ARS.  ARS system shall not require design/performance modifications to incorporate stabilized drogue.
d.	Capable of providing relative drogue positioning information at the receiver aircraft via installation of sensors on the receiver aircraft (design capable; not part of this effort)
2)	Performance Objectives
a.	Design capable of continuous operation – neither mission endurance nor turnaround time shall be limited by power available on the ASDRS. 
b.	Reduced drogue motion bandwidth to less than 10 cm, 2 sigma at frequencies of 0.7 Hz or less at altitudes of 1500 to 30,000 ft in conditions up to and including moderate turbulence.
c.	System availability (via analysis and demonstration) of 98% or greater
d.	Maintain constant receiver sight picture
e.	Drogue position sensing technique supports Low Probability of Intercept/ Low Probability of Detection.
f.	Maintainability and reliability shall be an inherent consideration in the design.  Although the demo design is not intended to be production-representative, there shall be a clear path from the demo design to an operational system.
3)	Interface Objectives
a.	Architecture shall be compatible with manned receiver aircraft and X-47B receiver.   
b.	Data from drogue position sensing system and integrity information shall support network interface at the tanker for transmission to the receiver
c.	External data interfaces support open architecture, non-proprietary data exchanges
d.	Design shall meet North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Standardization Agreement STANAG 3447 requirements for the probe/drogue interface
4)	Safety Objectives
a.	Operation of the ASDRS should reduce probability of failed engagement and drogue fuselage strike for manned and unmanned operations
b.	The controlling mechanism and sensor package (actuators, sensor apertures, etc) shall minimize susceptibility to strike/impact damage
c.	The ASDRS shall be designed to minimize Foreign Object Debris/Damage (FOD) probability.  
d.	Integrity to detect when the system should not be used with the control system enabled
e.	Integrity to detect when the drogue positioning information is invalid (Performance estimation and Fault detection functions) 
f.	Capability to be safely used in a system off state for both manned and unmanned receivers.
g.	Capability to be used with the position sensing function only (active stabilization disabled)
h.	Safe failure/ degraded modes of control system operation
i.	Indication shall be made to the external interface (tanker) when the ASDRS system determines the refueling operation should be discontinued.

TASKS
1)	Offeror shall provide design products for, and participate in, a tailored Systems Engineering Technical Review (SETR) process for the ASDRS as part of the overall X-47B AAR demonstration program.
2)	Offeror shall provide review of, and input to, an ASDRS system specification for government approval.
3)	Systems analysis shall be provided to predict overall system reliability.
4)	The Offeror shall develop, conduct and deliver analysis with the necessary models and simulations to characterize the system performance of the ASDRS.  Safety of Flight clearance / Airworthiness analysis shall be based on a system model as verified during testing.  Analysis should include factors that contribute to drogue instability and the effectiveness of the ASDRS to counteract each of these contributing factors.
5)	The Offeror shall provide a six-degree-of-freedom (6DOF) model(s) to support integration with Government analysis tools.  The model(s) shall consist of:
a.	Drogue aerodynamic model (including hose and hose reel response dynamics as appropriate)
b.	Mechanical dynamic model of system components
c.	Receiver effects
d.	Atmospheric gusts/turbulence
e.	Inner loop and outer loop control law model(s) as implemented for the ASDRS.  
f.	The characteristics of relative state sensing/ positioning functions to include transport delay, output resolution, noise/ error models and geometry (all locations if multiple sensors).
6)	The Offeror shall provide system, segment, subsystem, and component level engineering data to support airworthiness certification activities.

THIS SYNOPSIS IS SOURCES SOUGHT REQUESTING INFORMATION ONLY.  IT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL.  It is a market research tool being used to determine the availability and adequacy of potential business sources prior to determining the method of acquisition and issuance of a Request for Proposal including the use of any appropriate small business programs.  The Government is not obligated to and will not pay for any information received from potential sources as a result of this synopsis.  This synopsis is for informational and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation for bid or proposals, and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  The information provided herein is subject to change and in no way binds the Government to solicit for or award a competitive contract.  
If a solicitation is released it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities website located at http://www.fbo.gov/. It is the potential Offeror's responsibility to monitor this site for the release of any follow-on information.

1.	Are questions submitted to the Navy during this RFI period shared with all potential bidders or kept between the asking company and the Navy? 

Questions submitted to the government during the RFI period shall be posted to the Federal Business Opportunities Website.  

2.	What is the response due date?  In one spot it says March 5, in another it says TBD.

Per modification to the RFI dated February 18, 2009, the response due date is March 5, 2009. However see below Question Three and revised response due date.

3.	If it is March 5th, can we extend this by a couple of weeks? 

The revised response due date is now March 12, 2009.

4.	This seems like a very different effort than the previous drogue RFI? 

Yes, this is a different effort than RFI (N00019-09-RFI-0024), and any other FBO postings specific to drogue efforts.

5.	If there are questions/concerns about the objectives/ tasks, how should we address them? 

Any and all concerns about the requirements set forth in the RFI are welcomed and encouraged to be addressed in the RFI response. As stated in the RFI, other comments and suggestions regarding the Government's course of action and/or alternatives you may offer are encouraged and appreciated. This includes comments or concerns specific to objectives, tasks, schedule, and any other information set forth in the RFI.

6.	Will face to face meetings with the government be permitted any time before or after the RFI responses are submitted to discuss requirements in more detail? Would it be possible to provide a face to face briefing of our RFI response? 

Based on the RFI responses, a pre-proposal conference may be held. 

7.	Regarding the 25 page limit. Are Appendices allowed which would not count towards the limit - such as test results, photos, Video tapes, etc..?  

Per the RFI, 25 pages is the limit for all written responses. A 5 minute video and/or up to four (4) photos are also acceptable. The page count has been kept limited in order to make responding feasible in the time frame allotted. The purpose remains to gather top-level feedback that will help refine the acquisition strategy.  

8.	Does the Government anticipate releasing an Request For Proposal (RFP) following the RFI and if so what would be the timeframe for the RFP release?  

As stated in the RFI, NAVAIR intends to use the information provided in response to this RFI to aid in refining its acquisition strategy, budgeting assumptions, statement of work, and performance specifications for a potential Actively Stabilized Drogue Refueling System (ASDRS) demonstration.  Any and all timeframes are to be determined. Any potential subsequent releases to the RFI specific to this buy will be posted publicly on the FBO website.

9.	Is it possible for the Government to award off of the RFI responses?  

No.  As stated in question #5 the basis of the RFI is to refine the government’s potential future release of a solicitation, not to down select or award a contract action

10.	Can we receive a copy of the F/A-18 E/F NATOPS or at least the section which is referenced in the RFI under Demonstration Objectives, item 2?  

The referenced objective will be revised as follows: Demonstrate reduction of drogue motion bandwidth (frequency and amplitude) as compared to a standard drogue at representative F/A-18 E/F aerial refueling altitudes and airspeeds under normal atmospheric conditions. Under these conditions, the ASDRS shall support repeated, successful plugs by surrogate and X-47B receiver aircraft.  Moderate turbulence conditions, if not demonstrated in flight, shall be demonstrated via analysis.

There is no need to have access to F/A-18E/F NATOPS to respond to the RFI.

11.	We understand NAVAIR is formulating the acquisition strategy for this program, if known could you tell us which NAVAIR PMA or office will be leading/sponsoring this program? 

NAVAIR

12.	What organization/program will serve as the source of funding (or example PMA-xxx, UCAS, etc...) if it is known at this time? 

NAVAIR

13. Is this RFI open to small businesses only or everyone? 

As stated in the RFI, NAVAIR intends to use the information provided in response to this RFI to
aid in refining its acquisition strategy, budgeting assumptions, statement of work, and performance specifications for a potential Actively Stabilized Drogue Refueling System (ASDRS) demonstration.  All businesses are welcome to respond.

<DESC>Description<BR><BR>  This is a Request for Information and does not constitute a solicitation or request for proposal. This market survey will be used to provide information on a flashlight evaluation effort under the Family of Flashlights (FoF) Program and introduce a revised Approved Family of Flashlight List (AFFL). The U.S. Army Product Manager, Clothing and Individual Equipment (PM-CIE) is currently seeking qualified sources to provide  commercially available flashlights that satisfy the Buy American Act, Sec. 25.101, (a) (1), and (2), and to Sec. 25.103, and Berry Amendment. All submissions shall be provided by the vendor at no cost or obligation to the Government.Any information collected shall not be disclosed outside the Government. Test data for all submitted items will only be provided to the designated Vendor.  Interested parties should provide the following to the points of contact by 30 June 2008: product literature, product specification, and cost information (both GSA and MSRP prices). All products will be tested as submitted. All factors, to include cost, will be considered for inclusion on the AFFL using a systematic approach.  The AFFL will consist of three categories of flashlights: 1) Hands Free Helmet Light (HFHL), 2) Tactical Handheld Light (THL), and 3) Basic White Light (BWL) (non aftermarket filters (red, blue, IR) are acceptable and encouraged). Limit 3 items for each category per company.  <BR><BR>Selection Process<BR><BR>The selection process for the AFFL will use a down-select process. This process will consist of 3 Phases: Phase I  Physical Characteristics/Lumen Testing, Phase II  Technical Testing, and Phase III  User Evaluation. A scoring system will be used for Phase II and III. No external lab testing conducted outside of the Army for any phases of testing will be acceptable. All flashlights will be tested to the same procedures through Aberdeen Testing Center (ATC). A scoring conference will be held to determine which lights will be selected for the AFFL. Metrics will be weighted where Technical Testing is most important of all the areas and is significantly more important than the Physical Characteristics Testing. Physical Characteristics Testing is more important than the User Evaluation, which is more important than Cost. <BR><BR>Lights will be categorized according to capabilities. An integrated light that offers a basic white light, secondary color(s) and IR, does not constitutean addition to multiple categories. If it does not possess integrated color and IR, it will be tested under the BWL category. Should an item offer secondary color but no IR, it will be listed under BWL with an added capability. Only lights that offer integrated color and IR will be tested under the THL category. <BR><BR>Physical Characteristics/Lumen Testing --Phase I<BR><BR>All candidates must meet all of the threshold performance criteria (Phase I) listed per category in its entirety in order to proceed to Phase II.<BR><BR>The threshold performance criteria for the HFHL are: 1) Must be compatible with the Advanced Combat Helmet (ACH) and side mountable with no helmet modification, 2) Must provide a minimum of 5 lumens for 24 hours, 3) Dimensions of entire system with all attachments must not exceed 3in.x3in.x2in., 4) Power source must be AA or Lithium 123 batteries, 5a) Must provide white light color and integrated secondary color of red or blue, 5b) and IR capability, 6) Must weigh no more than 4 oz. with power source and mounting accessories, 7) Must be subdued in color (Foliage Green, Desert Sand, Black, and Urban Gray).  <BR><BR>The threshold performance criteria for the THL are: 1) Must provide a clip for secure fastening, 2) Must provide a minimum of 40 lumens continuous for 60 minutes, 3) Dimensions of entire system with all attachments must not exceed 6in. in length, 4) Power source must be AA or Lithium 123 batteries, 5a) Must provide white light color and integrated secondary color of red or blue, 5b) and IR capability, 6) Weigh no more than 6 oz. (with power source), 7) Be subdued in color (Foliage Green, Desert Sand, Black, and Urban Gray).  <BR><BR>The threshold performance criteria for the BWL are: 1) Must provide a clip for secure fastening, 2) Must provide a minimum of 40 lumens continuous for 60 minutes, 3) Dimensions of entire system with all attachments must not exceed 6in. in length, 4) Power source must be AA or Lithium 123 batteries, 5) Weigh no more than 6 oz. (with power source), 6) Be subdued in color (Foliage Green, Desert Sand, Black, and Urban Gray).  Note: Non-aftermarket filters (red, blue, IR) are acceptable and encouraged<BR><BR>Lumen Testing Procedure<BR><BR>Flashlights will be tested in a Labsphere FS2 Flashliht Spectral Flux Measurement System.  Flashlights will be tested in a field operational configuration by holding the flashlight in the four inch input port of the 20 inch sphere.  The area between the flashlight and the edge of the input port will be filled with a reducer to prevent ambient light from leaking in and flashlight light from leaking out.  A calibration will be performed for each flashlight type by turning the integrating sphere calibration light on while the flashlight is held in position and off.  This calibration will be used for all flashlights of this type that are measured in the FS2 Flashlight Spectral Measurement System.<BR><BR>A total of three flashlights per candidate model will be tested for lumens; all three flashlights must pass to advance to Phase II of the selection process. If any of the three flashlights fail the lumen test, the failing light(s) shall be allowed one retest with new batteries.  Failing a second time will be deemed a failure for that flashlight candidate model.<BR><BR>Phase II<BR><BR>Only candidates which have successfully satisfied Phase I requirements, will then advance to Phase II, Technical Testing. Phase II will consist of 5 environmental tests listed below.  5 new flashlights shall be subjected to each of the tests (25 flashlights total).  A minimum of 4 of the 5 flashlights must achieve the testing requirements for each environmental test for the flashlight system to receive a qualifying score.<BR><BR>1. Hot/Cold Operational Testing  MIL-STD-810F Test Method 501.4, Procedure II (Hot Env. 90 to120 deg F cyclic) and 502.4, Procedure II (Basic Cold -6 to -24 deg F) <BR>2. Salt Fog  MIL-STD-810F Test Method 509.4 <BR>3. Humidity  MIL-STD-810F Test Method 507.4<BR>4. Drop Testing   MIL-STD-810F Test Method 516.5, Procedure IV <BR>5. Immersion  MIL-STD-810F Test Method 512.4<BR><BR>Phase III<BR><BR>Only candidates which have received a qualifying score for Technical Testing, will then advance to Phase III, User Evaluation. New flashlights will be supplied for the User Evaluation.   <BR><BR>1.

MOLLE (FLC) and mission compatibility<BR>3. Warfighter Subjective Assessment  TOP 1-2-610 Human Factors Engineering Procedure 5.18, Questionnaires and interviews and final questionnaire (6 point Likert scale) for each candidate <BR><BR>Placement on the AFFL at the conclusion of technical and User testing will be determined by the members of the PM-CIE IPT board based on best value, performance, and overall user acceptance.   <BR><BR>Please submit a total of 48 flashlights to be retained by PM-CIE along with instructions to the following address by 30 July 2008:<BR><BR>US Army Aberdeen Testing Center (ATC)<BR>ATTN: CSTE-DT-ATC-WC-S (A.McClung: 410-278-4147)<BR>400 Colleran Road, Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD 21005-5059<BR>A re-evaluation is scheduled in the summer/fall 2008.  All vendors must submit flashlights for AFFL certification and re-certification. Once the new list of AFFL is released, all candidates on the pre-existing AFFL will no longer be valid. <BR>Requests for extensions need to be submitted formally no later than 30 July 2008, and are considered on a case by case basis. <BR>Points of Contact<BR>Richie Frondoso, 703-704-2323, richie.frondoso1@conus.army.mil, fax (703) 704-3837 or Stella Lee, 410-436-6083, stella.y.lee@us.army.mil , fax 410-612-5497 <BR><BR>Questions and Answers<BR><BR>If a light providing different color (red, blue, yellow, green, etc.) options is  selected for the updated AFFL list, would all options be acceptable for addition to the list? <BR><BR>We would like to remind you that we will not be going out for procurement on any of the items selected for the AFFL. It is the Soldiers/Units choice of color options if they choose to purchase your item. Should a light qualify for the updated list, only red, blue, and/or IR will be annotated in the fact sheets. No more than 48 samples need to be submitted for one model if the item offers different color options.<BR><BR>How does the PMO determine what category the lights fall under for testing? Does the BWL category allow for integrated colors? <BR><BR>Lights will be categorized according to capabilities. An integrated light that offers a basic white light, secondary color(s) and IR, does not constitutean addition to multiple categories. If it does not possess integrated color and IR, it will be tested under the BWL category. Should an item offer secondary color but no IR, it will be listed under BWL with an added capability. Only lights that offer integrated color and IR will be tested under the THL category. <BR><BR>Would it be acceptable to submit accessories, not including the clip, that fall outside of the weight requirement?<BR><BR>Yes, other items can be packaged along with your product. If the light, along with the standard clip and battery, weighs less than 6oz for BWL/THL and less than 4 oz for HFHL.,then any other accessoriesare added capabilities. <BR><BR>Are you planning on creating an approved accessories list? <BR><BR>No plans have been made to establish an approved accessories list.<BR><BR>The solicitation states that for both the THL and BWL, the Highest power settings must provide a minimum of 40 lumens continuous for 60 minutes. Does this require that the lights being evaluated must have more than one power setting (outside of the Highest Settings)?<BR><BR>No. The lights being evaluated do not require more than one power setting. Please disregard Highest power settings. Thisshould read, Mustprovide a minimum of 40 lumens continuous for 60 minutes. The same applies to all categories. This has been updated.<BR><BR>Will items manufactured outside of the US territories be acceptable for testing?<BR><BR>Yes. These lights will be used for testing purposes only. If the samples pass all phases, the items should adhere to the Buy American Act and Barry Amendment 30 days prior to the release of the updated AFFL. Should these items continue to be manufactured outside of the US prior to AFFL release, those models will not be included in the AFFL.<BR><BR>Where is the lumens to be measured from? Is it directly at the physical end of the flashlight or 5 lumens at a specific distance away from the device? Conversely, in your Lumen Testing Procedure, while the test criteria is described quite well there is no distance established for measurement of lumens other than at the light source itself.<BR><BR>We will  use FS2 Flashlight Spectral Flux Measurement System from Lapsphere to measure the lumens. The reason for using an integrating sphere is to spatially integrate the light flux , which bounces the light around in an attempt to create uniform illumination on the interior surface of the sphere.  Then the illumination in lux (lumens/meter^2) of a representative area inside the sphere can be measured,  which should approximate the illumination throughout the interior of the sphere.  A calibration from a source with known luminous flux (lumens) can then be used to convert the illumination levels into output in lumens.  <BR>  <BR>When it comes to measurement distance, if the integrating sphere is used all of the geometry is dictated by the size of the integrating sphere, any baffling, and the location of the measurement area relative to the input port so we don't think that discussion of measurement distance is meaningful since it is all set.  Items are tested in its operational configurationand will not be altered in any way to measure lumens.  Please refer to Lumen Testing Procedure.<BR>What are the wavelengths of the red and blue colors for the Revised AFFL?<BR><BR>We dont have requirement for the wavelength of red and blue color. <BR><BR>Can you explain Non aftermarket filter?<BR><BR>It means filter must be packaged with the flashlight. <BR><BR>Can interested parties continue to make plans to submit lights even though they did not submit literature by 30 June 08?<BR><BR>Companies that have not submitted literature to the Points of Contact on the Sources Sought are no longer eligible to submit lights as candidates for the AFFL certification.<BR><BR>
