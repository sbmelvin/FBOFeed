<DESC>The Health Resources and Services Administration intends to negotiate on a SOLE SOURCE basis with the American Association of Poison Control Centers, 3201 New Mexico Ave., NW, Ste 330, Washington, DC 20016.  The purpose of the contract is to Continue Management of the Poison Control Center Toll Free Telephone Number.  The toll-free number was established in 2002 and a national campaign was implemented to educate the public about the number.  This number has become identifiable across the country as the means by which a PCC can be reached.  Approximately 50 percent of calls going to PCCs come through the toll-free number.  This contract will be a sole-source award to the American Association for Poison Control Centers because they established, own, and manage the 1-800 number.  The anticipated period of performance is for a one-year base and two one-year options.   The statutory authority is 41USC 254 (c)(1), only one responsible source, and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  A Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition has been prepared by the Government.  This notice of intent is for informational purposes only, and is not a request for competitive proposals.  See Numbered Note 22.

Hard copies of the BAA document will not be available. The site provides downloading instructions.  All future information about this acquisition, including amendments, will also be distributed solely through the FBO site.  Interested parties are responsible for monitoring the FBO site to ensure that they have the most up-to-date information about this acquisition. This acquisition is being issued as BAA-0163340.  The FBI Laboratory is recognized as a world leader in the application of scientific methods to the examination of physical evidence in criminal investigations.  Since its inception in 1932, the FBI Laboratory has striven to enhance its services to the law enforcement and criminal justice communities through the research, development, and deployment of new or advanced forensic techniques and protocols.  The FBI Laboratory conducts research to develop new techniques of forensic analysis.  The FBI Laboratory must be in a position to provide prompt, accurate, and thorough responses to the thousands of requests it receives annually.  However, as the scientific, technical, and legal aspects of forensic science continue to become more complex, it has become increasingly challenging for the FBI to stay on the cutting edge of technology.  In order for the FBI Laboratory to continue to serve as the technical leader in the criminal justice community, it turns to outside expertise to address advanced forensic applications and initiatives.  A more detailed description of each area of interest and format of submissions is included in the Proposal Information Packet.  The Proposal Information Packet describes the process for proposal submission/evaluation.  There will be no formal Request for Proposals or other solicitation with regard to this BAA, nor does the issuance of the BAA obligate the Government to neither fund any subsequently invited proposals nor pay any proposal preparation costs.  Although no portion of this announcement is set aside for Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) or Minority Institutions (MI) participation, the Government encourages applications from these institutions.

<SUBJECT>A -- Technology for Agile Coherent Optical Transmission Architecture (TACOTA)
<SOLNBR>BAA05-36
<RESPDATE>072205
<ARCHDATE>04262006
<CONTACT>Steve Pappert, DARPA Program Manager, MTO, Phone (571) 218-4679, Fax (703) 696-2206, Email spappert@darpa.mil
<DESC>The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is soliciting innovative research proposals in the areas of coherent optical transmitter/receiver technology and phase preserving wideband nonlinear optical mixer technology in support of next generation tactical free-space optical communications.  This development addresses the need for waveform, wavelength and symbol rate agile digital optical links providing increased capacity on demand, receiver sensitivity, link availability, and physical layer security.  Proposed research should address novel transmitter/receiver and wavelength translation approaches for high-capacity coherent digital optical communications that enable revolutionary advances in science, devices or systems.  Specifically excluded is research that primarily results in evolutionary improvement to the existing state of practice.  

The objective of TACOTA is to develop and demonstrate the coherent optical modem and coherent band translation infrastructure necessary to produce robust high-capacity free-space optical communication links over multiple spectral bands.  A key imperative is to advance optical communications in terms of (1) its use of phase information for providing scalable channel capacity and enabling digital channel compensation techniques and (2), offering a wide spectral range of operation for increased link availability and security and (3), easily providing for adaptive modulation formats (e.g. M-ary Phase-Shift Keying (PSK) and signaling rates depending on dynamically changing link requirements and channel conditions (e.g. link range, capacity, security, power and signal-to-noise (S/N) requirements).  The anticipated optoelectronic component and module development attempts to lay the foundation for realizing the concept of a software-defined optical radio, similar in scope/features and compatible with the military software-defined Radio Frequency (RF) radio, i.e. the Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS).  The realization of this dynamic wideband optical transmission architecture will radically transform the military’s tactical and last mile communications capabilities as well as impact a number of high-resolution optical sensing and imaging missions of interest.  However, communications is the principal focus of this development.

Advances in high-speed mixed-signal electronics, digital signal processing (DSP) and the general field of RF communications are key enablers for the practical realization of high-capacity coherent optical communication systems.  Increasing electronic clock speeds and real-time DSP capability allows for high-speed multi-level phase/amplitude decision circuitry and real-time channel compensation algorithms to be implemented completely in the digital domain.  This is true provided absolute phase and amplitude information is retained throughout the optical detection process, i.e. coherent detection.  The RF communications community has long exploited the use of phase information for increasing and adaptively controlling link/network capacity as well as mitigating deleterious channel effects.  TACOTA explores the potential for mimicking these RF communication capabilities within the optical domain.

Pushing further towards RF communications compatibility and flexibility, a multi-stage optical heterodyne architecture with Intermediate Frequency (IF) processing is of interest.  Capitalizing on the wealth of high-speed optoelectronic infrastructure currently available, the 1550 nm telecommunications band is preferred for what will be termed the optical IF, where all In-Phase (I) and Quadrature (Q) baseband information (e.g. multiplexed voice, video and data) is optically processed.  To provide the “optical IF” functionality, a dual-polarization high-speed 1550 nm I/Q optical transmitter and polarization-diverse coherent receiver are required complete with high-speed encoder/decoder electronics (i.e. embedded Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC), Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC) and DSP).  The 1550 nm high-speed I/Q transmitter and balanced coherent receiver integrated with their associated driver electronics and DSP are highlighted in TACOTA.  Successful offerors shall provide innovative integrated transmitter/receiver design concepts allowing for agile waveform/baud rate capability and real-time digital link calibration/compensation. 

In addition to 1550 nm transmitter and receiver development, coherent band-translation technology allowing fast, high power intra-band (1530-1630 nm region) and inter-band (from 1550 nm to 500 nm and from 1550 nm to 3800 nm regions) wavelength translation for transmission channels well suited for these wavelengths is to be pursued.  Employing phase-sensitive heterodyne mixing techniques for wideband optical frequency up-conversion and down-conversion, high-speed coherent optical modulation and demodulation is only required at a single 1550 nm wavelength, not at the channel transmission wavelengths.  The development of efficient, phase-preserving optical mixers decouples the 1550 nm coherent modulation (common IF) from the optical transmission channel characteristics.  To demonstrate this capability, complementary transmitter and receiver side (i.e. both up-conversion and down-conversion) nonlinear optical mixers for the selected wavelength bands of interest are highlighted in TACOTA.  If properly implemented, this coherent wavelength hopping approach can provide increased link availability and physical layer security over conventional fixed wavelength free-space optical transmission approaches.  To implement this multi-stage heterodyne architecture, phase-preserving, high-power wavelength conversion technology capable of translating I/Q modulated 1550 nm channels to visible or mid-IR wavelengths with high conversion efficiency is required.  The 1550 nm, 500 nm and 3800 nm wavelength transmission bands have nominally been selected to demonstrate the utility of this unified RF/optical communications architecture representing fiber, water and air transmission channels, respectively.  TACOTA solicits creative technical solutions with maximum optical modem flexibility and agility with real-time dynamic wavelength selection based on link/application requirements and channel characteristics.     

To demonstrate the utility of TACOTA for high-capacity free-space optical communications, top-level link performance goals have been established.  The targeted end-of-program link performance goals are to provide increased spectral efficiency and capacity (greater than100 Gb/s in less than50 GHz optical bandwidth) over application-driven tactical free-space links (up to 100 km ranges) at wavelengths near 1550 nm, 500 nm and 3800 nm.  Receiver sensitivities at 1550 nm of 10 photons/bit (without coding gain) using Binary Phase-Shift Keying (BPSK) signaling and spectral efficiencies of 4 bit/s/Hz or better using M-ary multi-level complex signaling are to be demonstrated.  Wavelength-translated optical transmitter output powers of 1 Watt per polarization with highly coherent spectral characteristics are desired.  Novel photonic and electronic device/module approaches are required to meet these challenging requirements. Phase I bench-top demonstrations and Phase II range/simulator link demonstrations are to be conducted for the primary development focuses:  high-speed (to 40 Gbaud) dual-polarization 1550 nm complex signaling optical transmitters with integrated  DAC/DSP drivers; polarization diverse 1550 nm balanced coherent receivers with integrated ADC/DSP demodulation circuitry; and high power nonlinear mixer modules.  Nonlinear mixers providing phase-sensitive translation within the 1550 nm region, and addressing the 500 nm and 3800 nm wavelength regions are to be considered based on military application emphasis.  Offerors can address any or all of these wavelength transmission bands based on expertise and application interest.  The steering, focusing and collimating aspects of the tactical optical communication link are not to be addressed in this development.

As part of TACOTA, DARPA seeks innovative proposals in support of all of the following three areas of interest:

I.	1550 nm Coherent Optical Transmitter and Receiver Technology
TACOTA solicits coherent optical transmitter and receiver technology capable of providing free-space communications links utilizing high-speed spectrally efficient coherent waveforms.  A dual-polarization transmitter and polarization-diverse balanced homodyne receiver are required.

Transmitter Technology
Successful transmitter approaches shall allow for integration of single frequency 1550 nm laser(s), polarization optics, I/Q optical modulator(s), and mixed signal I/Q driving electronics with DSP control.  The photonic and electronic ICs capable of producing adaptive high capacity waveforms from ultra-sensitive BPSK to highly spectrally efficient M-ary PSK or Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM) at signaling rates of up to 40 Gbaud at program end are solicited.      

Receiver Technology
The coherent receiver should include integration of the necessary electronic demodulation circuitry and DSP.  For example, the receiver module will integrate the 1550 nm local oscillator (LO) laser(s), polarization diversity optics, 90 degree optical hybrid, balanced high-speed detectors, mixed signal I/Q demodulation electronics and DSP for link control and calibration.  The spectral region of interest for the receiver is the 1550 nm communications band to match the coherent transmitter.  The development of the high-speed photonic and electronic ICs capable of demodulating dual-polarization adaptive high capacity waveforms at signaling rates of up to 40 Gbaud are solicited.  The availability of high-speed electronic ADCs will dictate the signaling rates and spectral efficiency of the pursued waveforms.  

Innovative material platform and integration techniques producing compact high-performance transmitter modules and high-speed balanced I/Q receiver modules that can meet the challenging system link performance specifications are solicited.  In addition, optical channel compensation using novel DSP techniques shall be pursued and integrated into the receiver design.  Successful offerors will demonstrate and deliver the 1550 nm transmitter and receiver performance to realize the TACOTA free-space tactical link performance.

The goal at the end of Phase I of the program (see Program Scope below) is to fabricate and demonstrate functional 10 Gbaud coherent optical transmitter and receivers capable of BPSK and QPSK communication.  Spectral efficiencies of 2 bit/s/Hz for QPSK transmission are desired, as well as BPSK receiver sensitivities of 10 photons/bit.  A design path to increased performance levels is required.  The Program goal, at the end of Phase II, is to fabricate and demonstrate the components with full performance specifications (e.g. greater than100 Gb/s data rate in less than 50 GHz optical bandwidth; agile signal rates up to 40 Gbaud; 4 bit/s/Hz or better spectral efficiency using complex M-ary signaling; 10 photons/bit sensitivity for BPSK) enabling the targeted link adaptive capacity goals to be achieved in conjunction with the other TACOTA technical areas of interest.  A robust digital channel compensation capability must also be demonstrated.

II.	Phase-Sensitive Wavelength Translation Technology
In parallel with the 1550 nm coherent optical transmitter/receiver development, TACOTA is interested in nonlinear optical mixer technologies for 1550 nm intra-band, 500/1550 nm and 3800/1550 nm inter-band coherent band translation.  Demonstration of highly efficient, phase- sensitive translation with quasi-CW high-power output for the three wavelength regions of interest is required.  Techniques and devices for providing fast, high-power, high-efficiency translation within the 1550 nm wavelength region, and even more challenging and interesting, phase-sensitive inter-band translation to and from the 1550/3880 nm and 1550/500 nm regions are solicited.  Parametric amplification in bandgap engineered photonic crystal fibers and periodically-poled crystals (e.g. Lithium Niobate or Gallium Arsenide) are two candidate approaches.  Other novel approaches that can meet the aggressive performance goals will also be considered.  Translated wavelength phase noise characteristics and scalability of the proposed wavelength translation approach in terms of output power and its ability to address multiple 1550 nm channels simultaneously will be important differentiators.  Successful offerors will develop and demonstrate one or more of the following three wavelength translation scenarios:

	(1) phase-sensitive translation (greater than10 nm) within the 1530-1630 nm band;
	(2) phase-sensitive translation between the 1550/500 nm bands; and
	(3) phase-sensitive translation between the 1550/3800 nm bands.

For each of these coherent band translation cases, fast (approximately 20 ps), high power (greater than 1 W converted optical power per polarization), highly efficient (greater than 50 percent conversion of pump photons) wavelength conversion is desired.  In all cases, offerors will deliver the coherent band translation performance required to realize the multi-spectral free-space optical link performance that is to be demonstrated in conjunction with the other TACOTA technical areas of interest.  

For all proposed approaches and implementations, fully functional band translation modules for both up-conversion and down-conversion, and the required pump sources are to be demonstrated.  Leveraging existing high-performance pump sources and technology is highly desirable.  The goal at the end of Phase I of the program (see Program Scope below) is to fabricate and demonstrate functional coherent band translators, and to demonstrate a design and integration path to increased performance levels.  The Program goal, at the end of Phase II, is to fabricate and demonstrate the complimentary coherent band translators (up- and down-conversion) with full performance specifications enabling the targeted free-space optical link performance goals.

III.		Application-based Link Demonstration

The goals and metrics for components developed in TACOTA are designed to achieve free-space tactical links in dynamic military environments that have dramatically improved system performance over existing technology.  Aggregate data rates exceeding 100 Gb/s with uncorrected bit error rate (BER) of less than .001 are targeted for air-based transmission links of up to 100 km and exceeding 100 m for challenging underwater links.  Offerors should identify their targeted applications and ensure that their proposed development goals are adequate for successful demonstration.  Militarily useful applications that mandate increased performance over that cited in TACOTA are encouraged.  Offerors should be cognizant that TACOTA is primarily a component development effort.  As such, it is not anticipated that a large percentage of funding will be dedicated towards the technology demonstrations.

TACOTA offerors are strongly encouraged to submit innovative proposals that address the entire scope of the interest areas (i.e. coherent transmitter/receiver, nonlinear mixer(s), and an application based system demonstration).  Teaming arrangements to cover this entire scope of TACOTA is highly encouraged, although not a requirement.  Offerors that propose only transmitter/receiver concepts or only band-translation concepts will be considered, although a strong technology integration plan must be provided.  In developing this technology integration plan, it is important to keep in mind that a primary objective of TACOTA is to show how coherent transmitter/receiver technology, in combination with phase-sensitive wavelength translation technology, can greatly enhance tactical military communication capabilities.

The selected performers will be required to deliver individual devices and modules that form transmitter, receiver and conversion blocks at appropriate intervals (Phase I and Phase II points) within the program to a DARPA-designated facility.  Offerors are asked to submit a list and timetable of deliverables. 

Additional information on these technology areas is provided in the Areas of Interest section of the BAA 05-36 Proposer Information Pamphlet referenced below. 

PROGRAM SCOPE

The TACOTA program will consist of two Phases with Go Ahead critical milestones at the end of Phase I.  This will be followed by a Phase II option to achieve the full performance targets.  The length of Phase I and Phase II are left up to the offeror to propose based on time required to meet desired performance goals.  Clearly stated, quantitative milestones at the end of each Program Phase are required.  Offerors are strongly encouraged (Evaluation Criteria (3)) to pursue aggressive development schedules towards meeting the program goals in a most timely manner.  Organizations wishing to participate in Phase II should include it as an option in their proposal.  Multiple awards are anticipated.  Collaborative efforts/teaming including different expertise such as, but not limited to, design, fabrication, integration and applications are encouraged, but not required.  Cost sharing is not required and is not an evaluation criterion, but is encouraged where there is a reasonable probability of a potential commercial application related to the proposed research and development effort.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Education (ED), Institute for Education Sciences (IES) National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) requires technical assistance and expert advice to support its national survey collections, methodological research, and statistical product preparation. The work assigned to NCES, which serves as the statistical agency of the U.S. Department of Education, is typically complex and long term with most of its data collections extending over many years or recurring on a periodic basis.  At the same time, the needs of data users change and NCES must be able to adapt rapidly to changing priorities and policy foci.  NCES also must incorporate the latest scientific advances in how data are designed, collected, and analyzed and reported.  The functions of ESSI must mirror and extend the work of NCES.

The assistance must be provided to NCES through a long-term commitment to, or in collaboration with, the agency and its programs.

During the period of performance NCES anticipates the need for ESSI to carry out a wide variety of activities. The expected work falls into the four broad project categories described below.  The individual tasks may require more than one or a combination of all four types of work to be performed.

1.  Statistical methodology research

Statistical methodology work will support the continuous improvement of both the conduct of NCES data collections and the analysis of data from those collections.  Priority is placed on methodological work and related theoretical underpinnings that are relevant to both the state of the field and to the particular needs of education statistics.

2.  Statistical analyses

Such work will include both the most commonly used statistical procedures and novel statistical techniques to guide and ensure that analytic studies are designed in such a way as to be valid and data collected are recorded and reported systematically and objectively.  The ESSI's statistical analyses activities will employ the most commonly accepted statistical procedures in accordance with NCES' statistical standards (http://nces.ed.gov/statprog/2002/stdtoc.asp).  The focus will be primarily on analysis and report writing, ongoing monitoring and reporting on data quality and timeliness across NCES data collections, and on an examination of alternative report designs and an evaluation of user services that are best suited for the full range of audiences for education statistics.

3.  Development

Such work will have as primary objectives to (1) focus on identifying education data needs, based on a comprehensive understanding of education issues and trends (both domestic and international and across all sectors of education); (2) identify appropriate information sources and technologies for addressing education data needs; and (3) design or adapt improved statistical procedures.

4.  Project management

Such work will include technical support for NCES' operations through planning and implementation of project procurement, survey collection, and monitoring activities.  Work will be characterized by its comprehensive response to central data needs, both current and anticipated; continuity, where appropriate, to permit analyses across surveys; cost effectiveness; timeliness; and reasonableness of respondent burden.

The Department of Education estimates a period of performance of a 12-month base year and four 12-month options.

The opening date is on or around May 11, 2005; the closing date is close July 5, 2005 at 2:00 p.m. EST.  Copies of the solicitation will be available for download on httd://ww.fedbizopps.gov/.

<DESC>The Library of Congress intends to negotiate non-competitively with Media Matters LLC, 500 W 37th Street, New York, New York, 10018. The Library has identified the System for the Automated Migration of Media Archives (SAMMA), a system developed by Media-Matters, LLC, as the only system available that combines automated migration of the media with creation of metadata describing the condition of the materials.The Library of Congress needs to acquire a complete system in order to do prototyping projects and test this systems performance and applicability. 

This system has two (2) parts. The SAMMA Accessioning Station is hardware and software engineered for rapid accessioning and ingest of tapes.  The system provides a means to record the results of tape inspection, maintains a database of collection condition, creates unique identifiers for each tape, and enables additional information (such as accompanying documentation) to be associated with the original videotape. The SAMMA Robotic Migration System is hardware and software for the physical handling and processing tapes, the creation of digital files, and the creation of metadata from logs of information gathered during processing.  The Robotic Migration System will enable the Library of Congress to perform fully automated migration of a number of video streams on a near continuous 24/7 schedule.  The automated process ensures consistent quality metrics over the entire collection because inconsistencies in quality control are eliminated and detection and logging of tape and signal problems are fully automated. Since the SAMMA Accessioning Station and Robotic Migration System are meant to be used together, the Library of Congress needs to purchase them together.   The Library of Congress would like to acquire the SAMMA Accessioning Station in June 2005, about 3 months before acquiring the SAMMA Robotic Migration System in order to prepare a sufficient number of tapes so that the robotic system can be tested working at a full production load
. This is a non-competitive requirement. NO SOLICITATION EXISTS.  No telephone calls will be accepted. No award will be based on any offer or proposal received in response to this notice. For further information, please respond via email to jwalker@loc.gov.

<DESC>The NAVY EXPERIMENTAL DIVING UNIT, Panama City, FL, intends to procure via SIMPLIFIED AACQUISITION: Sole Source to Noptel of Oulu Finland, at the request of the United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM), the Mission-Related Performance Measures System (MRPMS) was developed to evaluate performance decrements in Special Operations Forces (SOF).  A component of the MRPMS is the shooting skills test, which involves an M-16 modified with the Noptel ST-11 laser.  The laser functions as both a transmitter and receiver, simulating a shot fired and recording a hit when the target is engaged with the laser.  The information from the ST-11 is then recorded by the data acquisition system and the information used to assess decrements in shooting skills.  As the system is designed to evaluate the mission-related performance of SOF personnel, the integration of a pistol as a component of the shooting skills test has been a goal from the beginning of development of the MRPMS.  The Noptel ST-15 Defender pistol provides the same type of evaluation tool as the ST-11 mounted on the M-16.  Unlike the ST-11, the ST-15 Defender is delivered as an already modified weapon ready to be integrated into the current data acquisition platform of the MRPMS.  Both the ST-11 and ST-15 Defender provide unique capabilities that enhance the ability to evaluate performance decrements in SOF personnel.  Phone and Fax request are unacceptable. E-mail request to louis.diehl@navy.mil. NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE.

<DESC>The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center, San Diego, intends to award an indefinite delivery - indefinite quantity type contract with a cost plus award fee pricing arrangement to BAE SYSTEMS, Information and Electronic Warfare Systems, of Nashua, NH.  The contractor will provide full scale engineering development, integration, and testing of an Engineering Development Model (EDM) Compact Low Frequency Active (CLFA) Transmit Subsystem (CLTS) using a previously developed and demonstrated transducer projector design including transmit array group and power amplifier group components to accommodate the transducer projector characteristics.  The estimated period of performance is five years.  This effort is a follow-on to contract # N66001-01-C-0002 with BAE SYSTEMS.  Use of any other contractor would result in substantial duplication of costs and delays for the Government based on the specialized knowledge and experience acquired by BAE SYSTEMS under the prior contract.  This notice supercedes previous announcements for this requirement under solicitation # N66001-04-R-0056.  This notice of intent is not a request for proposals.  See notes 22 and 26.

<DESC>The Naval Facilities Engineering Command Southwest Division is seeking Small Business Administration (SBA) certified 8(a) “Developmental Stage” (first four years of the 8(a) program) firms from one of four SBA Districts (San Diego, Santa Ana, Los Angeles, California and Phoenix, Arizona) to participate in a Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) program.  The Navy is targeting the issuance of an indeterminate number of BOAs.  Previous BOA holders must reapply and meet all stated requirements of this announcement.  The estimated period of performance for the BOA will be one year with the government reserving the right to exercise options up to four years, with no single option exceeding one year, in accordance with DFARS 216.703(c).  The purpose of the BOA is to enhance contracting opportunities to qualified 8(a) Developmental Stage firms that are serviced by a specified SBA District Office.  The BOA is not a contract, but a written instrument of understanding negotiated between the Naval Facilities Engineering Command Southwest Division and the 8(a) firm to facilitate the expeditious acquisition of covered services, if and when ordered.  The BOA provides a framework of contract clauses, provisions, certifications, terms and conditions which will apply, to the extent referenced therein and according to the dollar amount of each order, to any firm order for services issued pursuant to the agreement.  Each order issued under this BOA shall constitute a separate contract.  Under the BOA, firms with an applicable NAICS code compete on task orders for requirements within the designated SBA District where the work is to be performed.  If adequate competition cannot be obtained within the designated SBA District, the Government reserves the right to open the area of competition to include BOA holders in adjacent districts.  The anticipated types of construction may include emergency repairs (broken and leaking water lines, roof leaks, HVAC, and other mechanical projects), minor construction projects (exterior and interior renovations, demolition, painting, and installing pipelines), and design assistance (on-site design solution for emergency calls and design/build services for minor construction items).  NAICS Codes 236, 237 and 238 pertain to this BOA.  Each firm will identify their primary NAICS and a secondary NAICS (if applicable).  There is no guaranteed minimum dollar amount or volume of work that will be ordered under the agreement, however there is a maximum dollar amount of $3,000,000 per firm over the life of the agreement.  Individual task orders will range between $2,000 and $500,000.  The Contractor will be required to furnish a Bid Bond or Surety letter (as applicable) with each proposal over $25,000 with Performance and Payment Bonds required on each Task Order.  Annually the Navy and the SBA will review the continued need for this agreement in light of a) usefulness and need for service and b) the effectiveness of individual contractors.  The Contracting Officer will open /advertise the BOA program for new entrants once a year.  Options will not be exercised for firms that do not continue to meet all BOA requirements and will be removed accordingly.  No new orders will be issued to the Contractor and this agreement will terminate.  Termination of the BOA under these circumstances shall have no effect on any orders previously issued.  The BOA can only be changed by modification of the agreement itself and not by individual orders issued hereunder.  Modification of the BOA shall not retroactively affect orders issued prior to the time of the modification.  This agreement may be cancelled by either party by mailing or otherwise transmitting 30 days prior written notice to the other party.  Any such cancellation shall have no effect on any orders issued prior to the effective date of the cancellation, which shall be 30 days from the date of mailing or otherwise transmitting the written notice of cancellation.  Prior to the effective date of cancellation, the Navy may continue to place orders under the BOA.  Firms that demonstrate that they meet the following qualifications will receive a BOA.  Upon submission of the following information, the Government will review the documents and the firm will be determined to be either Eligible or Ineligible.  To qualify for receipt of a BOA, each firm must meet all the following criteria: (1) Be a certified 8(a) developmental stage participant (Joint Venture/Mentor Protégé firms are not allowed) prior to the submission date of 1 April 2005; be assigned to a SBA Business Opportunity Specialist from one of four SBA Districts (San Diego, Santa Ana, Los Angeles, CA and Phoenix, AZ); and have a bona-fide address within the same district as the Business Opportunity Specialist; (2) Be registered in the DoD Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database http://www.ccr.gov/, including the new SBA Dynamic Small Business Listing; Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) http://www.bpn.gov; and VETS-100 http://vets100.cudenver.edu/ (if not applicable, provide statement that the firm has not had contracts subject to this requirement); (3) Be licensed/bonded and fully capable to perform construction work within a range of $2,000 - $500,000; and (4) Demonstrate technical experience/past performance (including safety) of similar size, general scope, and complexity of construction project(s) within the last three years.

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A  PROPOSAL.  A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.   The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) intends to negotiate and award  a purchase order on a noncompetitive basis to Mr. .Robert R. Carlsen, 4237 Sandcastle Lane, Olney, Maryland 20832, to provide consultation services to the Directors of the NHLBI’s Intramural and  Extramural Divisions.  STATEMENT OF WORK: Specifically, the Contractor shall provide consultation services to the NHLBI required the services of an acquisition expert  familiar with the structure of the NHLBI’s, programs, and staffing to assist in the development of a plan to solicit  contractor(s) to provide the service to the Institute in such areas as recruitment, staffing support, and an analysis of the current and future staffing needs.  Assistance in human resources supports services for health-related and/or scientific professionals are needed to target, acquire, and secure a skilled workforce for NHLBI.  Mr. Carlsen will work with NHLBI staff to develop a statement of work for the solicitation.  He will also be involved with the market research aspect of identifying firms who have the appropriate capability to perform the required tasks.  A review of organizations on the GSA schedule will also be conducted.  This project is expected to required 256 man hours during the period of performance, beginning the date of award and for approximately four (4) months for an average of two (2) days (16 hours) per week.  The sole source determination is based upon the knowledge, skills and expertise associated with Mr. Carlsen’s 25 years of employment with the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI).  This source is intimately familiar with the wide variety of occupations at NHLBI and is sensitive to the employment needs of both the intramural and extramural communities.  He was an active member of the NHLBI Executive Staff and was familiar with and understood the long term strategic planning and goals of the Institute.  This knowledge base, coupled with his expertise in all phases of contracting, makes Mr. Carlsen an ideal individual to facilitate an effective contract to support NHLBI recruitment activities and marketing an NHLBI image.  An award to any other source would affect NHLBI’s anticipated outcome based upon Mr. Carlsen’s experience, and would not provide cost savings to the Government.

<DESC>This notice is a COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION for other than commercial items. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; offers are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) set forth in FAR Part 13. This notice is being issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP) support the discovery and demonstration of proof-of-concept of prodrugs or alternative (oral, inhalation, or transdermal) formulations of DTPA that deliver plasma levels sufficient to decorporate systemic transuranyl compounds for use by the general public in case of radiation emergencies.

Background

The potential for radiation exposures to occur from terrorist acts, radiation accidents or nuclear detonation mandates that the health care system develop and implement preparedness plans that include the stockpiling of radioprotective drugs and therapeutics. Radiation exposure can occur from external irradiation, external contamination with radioactive materials, and internal contamination by inhalation, ingestion or absorption through skin or wounds. The removal of internal radioactive contaminants can be accomplished by administering chelating agents that can preferentially complex with radionuclides in the body and increase their rate of clearance, thereby decreasing radiation exposure.

Pentetate (diethylenetriaminepentaacetate) calcium trisodium (Ca-DTPA) and pentetate (diethylenetriaminepentaacetate) zinc trisodium (Zn-DTPA) have been shown to be effective in treating internal contamination with radionuclides such as plutonium, americium, or curium. DTPA increases the rates of elimination of these substances from the body through the exchange of calcium or zinc ions with the transuranium element. The transuranium-DTPA complex is stable and is excreted in urine. The calcium salt is 10X more effective than the zinc salt of DTPA in the first 24 hours following internal contamination, but after 24 hours, the salts are similarly effective. 

DTPA has been available for distribution from the Radiation Emergency Assistance Center/Training Site under an IND and formulations of Ca-DTPA and Zn-DTPA suitable for intravenous administration, or inhalation via nebulizer, were approved by the FDA in August 2004. Other formulations (for example oral, inhalation or transdermal) would be more easily administered than the injectable formulations, making DTPA easier to use in a mass casualty situation; however, because of its hydrophilicity, DTPA is poorly absorbed when administered by these routes. The NIAID is interested in facilitating the discovery and demonstration of proof-of-concept of prodrugs, alternative formulations, or alternative delivery methods of DTPA that provide for plasma levels sufficient to decorporate systemic transuranic compounds for use by the general public in the case of a radiation emergency. In addition, the NIAID is interested in facilitating the development of prodrugs, alternative formulations, or alternative delivery methods that provide for lung clearance of transuranic compounds and that can be used in a mass casualty situation. The ultimate goal of the DTPA development effort is to identify effective candidates that could be evaluated for inclusion in the Strategic National Stockpile. 

The NIAID anticipates awarding up to three (3) contracts based on technical merit, available funds, scientific priority, and programmatic balance. The NIAID estimates that the average total cost (direct and indirect cost combined) for these contracts will be greater than $1 million per contract; however, it is anticipated that the total cost for each award may vary depending upon the scope of the project and the technical objectives of the award. The length of time for which funding is requested should be consistent with the nature and complexity of the proposed research.  The period of performance is expected to be a total of twenty-one (21) months.  The anticipated base contract period (Phase 1) will be fourteen (14) months with Option 1 (Phase 2), if exercised, being seven (7) months.      

Statement of Work

Independently and not as an agent of the Government, the Offeror shall furnish the necessary service, qualified personnel, material, equipment and facilities not otherwise provided by the Government as needed to perform the work described below. The Offeror is expected to develop and execute a plan for the development of an alternative structure (specifically a prodrug which can be metabolized to yield DTPA), formulation or delivery method of DTPA that does not require intravenous injection in order to achieve sufficient levels in plasma and sufficient decorporation of systemic transuranic compounds, or improved clearance of transuranic compounds or ease of use in the case of inhaled transuranic compounds.

This contract will provide for initial discovery of lead compound(s) or formulations to the proof-of-concept stage (demonstration of adequate pharmacokinetics and effective elimination of transuranic compounds) and will be funded in two phases; therefore, funding for Phase 2 is contingent upon acceptance of progress by the NIAID Project Officer and program staff in consultation with the Offeror. Phase 1 will include the planning, synthesis, assay development and screening of drug candidates or formulations. Phase 2, which will be funded after successful completion of Phase 1 and selection of lead candidates in consultation with and after approval of the NIAID Project Officer, will include the evaluation of pharmacokinetics and decorporation efficacy of lead candidates. The results will be evaluated to select the best candidates for further testing and development under a separate contract. The ultimate goal of the DTPA development effort is to identify effective candidates that could be evaluated for inclusion in the Strategic National Stockpile.

Specifically, the Offeror will:

Phase 1:

1.	Design a strategy and technical approach to develop effective DTPA prodrugs, formulations or delivery methods that allow for the rapid absorption and bioavailability of DTPA at rates and quantities equivalent to intravenous administration or improved ease-of-use in the case of lung clearance of inhaled radionuclides. The strategic plan should include how cGMP manufacture would be accomplished. The Offeror should be aware of the patent licensing and exclusion issues regarding their product innovation(s) and describe the steps that the Offeror has taken to ensure that the resulting product may be developed for use as nuclear contamination countermeasures.

2.	Synthesize and formulate quantities of DTPA drug candidates for evaluation of physiochemical properties, in vitro and/or in vivo absorption kinetics, bioavailability in vivo and radionuclide chelation efficiency.

3.	Develop and conduct a screening strategy to select appropriate DTPA prodrugs and formulations for further testing (such as partition coefficients, in vitro absorption models, in vivo absorption models, in vitro chelation models).

4.	Develop analytical methods for the detection and measurement of DTPA both in product formulations and in biological fluids. If DTPA has been covalently modified to form a prodrug, a method for the discrimination of native and modified DTPA shall be included.

5.	Provide a Phase 1 Milestone Report including strategy and technical approach for Phase 2.

Phase 2 (Option – Funding contingent upon acceptance of Phase 1 DTPA prodrugs, formulations or delivery method.):

1.	Conduct in vivo studies in rodents to compare absorption kinetics, bioavailability and decorporation efficacy of DTPA administered intravenously and selected lead candidate(s) of modified DTPA administered by appropriate route (such as oral, inhalation or transdermal). These studies will include general observations to assess toxicity of the formulation and an estimate of the Maximum Tolerated Dose. Offeror must have or have access to facilities licensed to perform in vivo chelation experiments using appropriate transuranic elements or their equivalents.

2.	Provide Phase 2 and Final Reports.

Review and Award Criteria

Selection of an Offeror for contract award will be based on an evaluation of proposals against three factors. The factors in order of importance are: (1) technical merit and (2) cost and (3) past performance. Although technical factors are of paramount consideration in the award of the contract, cost is also important to the overall contract award decision; however, all evaluation factors other than cost or price, when combined, are significantly more important than cost or price. In any case, the Government reserves the right to make an award to that Offeror whose proposal provides the best overall value to the Government. In accordance with FAR 15.3, the award will be subject to a cost realism analysis by the Government.  The NIAID reserves the right to make an award without discussions.

The evaluation will be based on the demonstrated capabilities of the prospective Offerors in relation to the needs of the project as set forth in the RFP. The merits of each proposal will be carefully evaluated. Each proposal must document the feasibility of its plan to successfully achieve the objectives of the RFP. Offeror must submit information sufficient to evaluate their proposals based on the detailed criteria listed below. 

2. TECHNICAL EVALUATION CRITERIA

The technical evaluation committee will use these evaluation criteria when reviewing the technical proposals. Proposals will be judged solely on the written material provided by the Offeror. The criteria below are listed in the order of relative importance with weights assigned for evaluation purposes.

The Government reserves the right to perform a pre-award site audit, if necessary.  

																						Total:	100 Points

3. EVALUATION OF PAST PERFORMANCE 

An evaluation of Offeror’s past performance information will be conducted subsequent to the technical evaluation. However, this evaluation will not be conducted on any Offeror whose proposal would not be selected for award based on the results of the evaluation of factors other than past performance. 

The evaluation will be based on information obtained from references provided by the Offeror, other relevant past performance information obtained from other sources known to the Government, and any information supplied by the Offeror concerning problems encountered on the identified contracts and corrective action taken. 

The government will assess the relative risks associated with each Offeror. Performance risks are those associated with an Offeror’s likelihood of success in performing the acquisition requirements as indicated by that Offeror’s record of past performance. 

The assessment of performance risk is not intended to be a product of a mechanical or mathematical analysis of an Offeror’s performance on a list of contracts but rather the product of subjective judgment by the Government after it considers relevant information. 

When assessing performance risks, the Government will focus on the past performance of the Offeror as it relates to all acquisition requirements, such as the Offeror’s record of performing according to specifications, including standards of good workmanship; the Offeror’s record of controlling and forecasting costs; the Offeror’s adherence to contract schedules, including the administrative aspects of performance; the Offeror’s reputation for reasonable and cooperative behavior and commitment to customer satisfaction; and generally, the Offeror’s business-like concern for the interest of the customer. 

The Government will consider the currency and relevance of the information, source of the information, context of the data, and general trends in the Offeror’s performance.
		
4. PRE-AWARD SITE AUDIT 

An evaluation of the adequacy of the facilities and resources provided by the Offeror may be conducted at the discretion of the Government prior to award. When assessing the facilities and resources, the Government will focus on the adequacy and availability of appropriate laboratories, equipment and animal care facilities and will include an audit of the Offeror’s radiation licensing and safety procedures.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center for Cancer Research (CCR), plans to procure an Axon Genepix 4000B Microarray Scanner or equal.  This acquisition will be conducted under the procedures for acquiring commercial items authorized in FAR Part 12 as the authority to use simplified procedures for commercial requirements provided in FAR Part 13.5.  The North American Industry Classification System Code is 334516 and the business size standard is 500 employees. The following salient characteristics apply to the Genepix 4000B microarray scanner or equal: 1) Ability to scan standard microscope slides bearing in-house-printed microarrays or commercial microarrays, especially those from NimbleGen Biosystems, with non-confocal technology, 2) Ability to accurately and reproducibly scan at 10 micron or 5 micron resolution, to accommodate the above-mentioned arrays' formats,  3) Ability to scan two channels (laser excitation wavelengths of 532 and 635 nm) simultaneously and at high speed, 4) High dynamic range of detection, 5) Ability to acquire and save single or double-wavelength images of the array for analysis on NCI web-based software, 6) Must fit in a small footprint, not to exceed 16" Wide,  24" Long and 24" High, 7) Must come with software to run scanner, 8) Scanner software must enable on-the-fly feature visualization and histogram generation, for PMT optimization during scanning, and an option for automated PMT gain setting, 9) Machine software must be able to export color images in 24-bit JPEG format for analysis on NCI web-based software, 10)  Microarray analysis software must be able to recognize features that are circular, square or irregular, with some flexibility for imperfect spotting, and to align the spots in terms of row, column and block, 11)  Software must be able to import GAL files that identify the genes represented in all features, 12)  Microarray analysis software must have user-defined manual as well as automatic flagging features for quality control and normalization and, 13) Microarray analysis software must have ability to visualize background pixels and to perform multiple methods of background subtraction.  Justification: The Axon Genepix 4000B microarray scanner is required for the use of the NimbleGen arrays, which are being used in current studies, are very specialized in that the size of the oligonucleotide features (5 microns) are so small that only certain scanners have the resolution to allow acceptable imaging and quantification of the signals produced.  The existing scanner currently used in house for microarray service core is the Axon Genepix 4000B along with NimbleGen arrays.  Changing from NimbleGen microarrays will change the variables with already existing data and will interrupt correct interpretation of the studies being currently performed. Likewise changing to another scanner type will also affect study variables.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<SUBJECT>A--Joint Heavy Lift Concept Design Analysis
<SOLNBR>W911W6-05-R-0004
<RESPDATE>062705
<ARCHDATE>08262005
<CONTACT>Pat Hagginbothom, 757-878-4818
<DESC>DESC:  Section I.  The Aviation Applied Technology Directorate (AATD) is soliciting technical and cost proposals for conduct of Joint Heavy Lift (JHL) Concept Design and Analysis (CDA) described below. Proposals are required to be submitted in accord ance with the guidelines set forth herein. This Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) constitutes the total solicitation. There will be no formal Request For Proposals (RFPs), other solicitation requests, or other information regarding these requirements. INTROD UCTION: The JHL is an advanced Vertical Take-Off and Landing (VTOL) capable aerial system that is intended to overcome enemy anti-access strategies, execute operational maneuver, leverage sea basing in order to expand Expeditionary Maneuver Warfare capabil ities, conduct mounted and dismounted vertical envelopment; and perform aerial delivery and sustainment operations.  The ability to achieve military objectives in future combat environments requires the rapid delivery of Joint-Interagency-Multinational for ces and distributed tailored support packages.  A joint force capable of full spectrum dominance must possess unmatched speed and agility in positioning and repositioning tailored forces from widely dispersed locations to achieve operational objectives qui ckly and decisively.  With the ongoing transformation of joint forces to be lighter, more lethal, and capable of deploying from multiple dispersed locations worldwide, the need for a JHL solution has been recognized by the services and documented in the form of a draft JHL initial capabilities document (ICD).  The JHL Concept Refinement (CR) phase will support a Milestone A decision.  The CDA portion of the overall JHL CR shall not exceed 18 months beginning in September 2005.  The CDA focus is on the ide ntification and technical substantiation of viable design concepts that not only populate the desired trade space, but have a reasonable chance of achieving a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of 6 by 2012.  CDA will identify the program and technical risks , cost, schedule, and critical path technologies.  TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION:  The purpose of the JHL CDA is to first and foremost inform the requirements trade process with valid performance and design options that are achievable within the projected time env elope.  It will assess the impact of trade parameters affecting total system suitability and affordability and define any technology hurdles requiring dedicated science and technology investments.  Lastly it will establish credible cost, schedule and risk estimates for the most probable options within the selected design envelopes.   Three design cruise speed bands of 160-200, 200-250 and 250-300+ knots will be addressed by the CDA.  A model performance specification has been developed to provide a represen tative example specification that is to be refined and expanded by the JHL CDA contractors to reflect the details of their concept design as its evolves.  To the extent that the document contains descriptions of JHL expectations, design criteria, standards , guidelines, allocations, environmental conditions, and definitions, it also serves the purpose of providing an initial, common design reference framework for all the CDA contractors and the Government Design Team. DELIVERABLES: All awards under this soli citation will require delivery of the following data items: (1) Management Plan; (2) Quarterly Technical Progress Report and Update of the Model Performance Specification; (3) Quarterly Baseline Aircraft Description/Capability Data; (4) Quarterly Substanti ation of Baseline Aircraft Capability; (5) Quarterly Design Excursion Data; and (6) Final Report.  Submission by electronic means will be required.  Portions of the data may be in the format selected by the contractor while other data requirements will be in tables and formats specified by the Government. Additionally, a CDA kick-off meeting, three design reviews, and participation in two operational Map Exercise s are required. Section II. Award Information:  ANTICIPATED FUNDING LEVEL AND PERFORMANCE PERIOD: The Government intends to make multiple awards; however no award will be for more than $3.45 million of Government funding.  Period of performance shall not exceed 18 months.  Proposals must follow the guidelines described in this announcement and the supplemental package. TYPE OF FUNDING INSTRUMENT:  The Government seeks to maximize industry participation and anticipates making multiple awards.  The Government anticipates awar d of firm fixed price contracts or cost-shared Technology Investment Agreements (TIAs).   Due to the commercial application of the preponderance of this technology, the Government considers award of a TIA (Cooperative Agreement under 10 U.S.C 2358) or Othe r Transaction for Research (10 U.S.C. 2371) appropriate and of potential interest.  See, http://www.aatd.eustis.army.mil/Business/Divisions/Contracting/docs/tias.doc, for more information.  This BAA will remain open until 1:00 p.m. Eastern time June 27, 20 05. Awards under this announcement are anticipated to be made by September 15, 2005. The Government reserves the right to make staggered awards.  However, unless the offeror specifies a different expiration time, proposals will be considered valid for Gove rnment acceptance through December 31, 2005. The Government reserves the right to select for award any, all, part or none of the proposals received. Further, the Government reserves the right to select for award only a portion of an offeror's proposal (i.e ., certain tasks vs. total program). Multiple proposals from the same offeror will be accepted and evaluated independently (See Section V).  Section III.  Eligibility Informations:  This BAA solicits proposals from all interested and qualified sources. For eign participants and/or individuals may participate to the extent allowed under the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) statute providing that such participants do not serve in a prime contractor role and such participants and/or individuals comply with such rules, regulations, and laws governing the participation of foreign participants and/or individuals. Due to the complexity and technical considerations of the JHL CDA, this announcement is not set-aside for small businesses although they a re encouraged to propose.  Section IV. Submission Information:  This BAA is the only solicitation that will be issued. The information contained in this announcement is insufficient to produce a meritorious proposal.  Specific submission instructions and e ssential other information are contained in the supplemental package available to qualified sources who have certification via DD Form 2345. GENERAL: The technical proposal shall be limited to 75 content pages except as otherwise stated in the supplemental  package.  The technical proposal shall contain a statement of work to which the offeror proposes to be bound, program milestones, a description of facilities to be employed in the effort and a program management section. Resumes of key personnel shall be provided. The Cost Proposal should include a funding profile (a cost breakout by month), cost breakdown providing man-hours and monthly costs by task, all pricing rates used, and equipment and materials listings, if applicable. Subcontractor proposals, if applicable, including pricing rate details, should be provided concurrently with the prime contractor's submission.  A pre-proposal conference will be held from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. on May 13, 2005, at Pearl Young Theatre, NASA Langley Research Center, Hampton , Virginia.  The purpose of the conference is to provide a clear description of the role of the JHL Concept Design and Analysis (CDA) efforts within the Concept Refinement activity and to describe the expected interplay between the Government and the CDA c ontractors.  The various elements of the BAA Supplemental Package will be described and written questions will be answered to resolve any ambig uities concerning the Government's approach to conduct of the CDA and selection of most meritorious CDA proposals.  It is anticipated that the conference will involve disclosing technical data that is subject to export controls under the ITAR.

EVALUATION CRITERIA/BASIS FOR AWARD: The selection of one or more sources for award will be based on a scientific and/or engineering evaluation of pr oposals (both technical and cost as it relates to technical effort) in accordance with the criteria set forth in this section.  The Governments basis for selecting proposals for acceptance will take a two-tiered approach.  This two-tiered approach is desi gned to achieve maximum coverage of the tradable design space for potential JHL concepts and to obtain broad industry participation and diversity in the concept  refinement of JHL   The Government intends to make a minimum of one award in each defined cruise speed band.  These selections of proposals for acceptance are considered the first tier.  If there is not a meritorious proposal in a given speed band, then t he Government reserves the right to make no award for that speed band.  The most meritorious or best value proposals will be determined by applying the following evaluation criteria:  (1) is substantially more important than (2) which is more important tha n (3).  (1) The scientific, technical, and programmatic ability to satisfy the JHL CDA requirements as specified in the supplemental package.  Each of the following criteria, listed in descending order of importance, will be evaluated:  (a) Viability of th e aerial concept, the validity of the substantiating data to support performance claims, and the merit of the overall technical approach. (b) The likelihood of the proposed concept to achieve a TRL 6 by 2012. This includes the likelihood of achieving both an appropriately scaled flight demonstration and required demonstrations of individual critical major components.  (c) Availability, experience and qualification of the proposed personnel and the suitability and availability of proposed tools and facilitie s to accomplish the effort.  (d) Intellectual property restrictions placed on the results of the effort.  (e) The offerors proposed cost to the Government and realism of the proposed man-hours, materials, and other costs to accomplish the proposed effort,  including whether they reflect a clear understanding of research objectives, and their consistency with the various elements of the offerors technical proposal.  (2) The maximum suitability of the concept across the DoD missions and environments identifi ed in the draft ICD.  (3) The credibility of and the projected cost for development, acquisition and O&S of the aerial concept.  After the most meritorious proposals are chosen from each of the speed bands in the first tier, the Government may select addit ional meritorious proposals.  These are the second-tier selections.  Second tier selections will be determined through application of the above criteria.  However, the Government reserves the right to bypass an otherwise more meritorious proposal when doin g so would significantly improve the Governments understanding of the performance trade space, assess additional operational suitability issues, or provide greater diversity among CDA participants.   Furthermore, the Government may accept greater risk in a proposal to meet these objectives.  SECURITY REQUIREMENTS: Preaward access to or generation of classified information is not authorized.  Some work to be performed under resulting efforts may be classified. Offerors shall address any perceived necessity to access or generate classified information in the proposal.

This procurement is an unrestricted procurement with the HUBZone Price Evaluation Preference Provision 52.219-4.  The Bureau of Reclamation, Mid-Pacific Region, intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) firm-fixed price construction contract for the Lauro Dam Project.  Lauro Dam and Reservoir are located on Diablo Creek, on the northern edge of the city of Santa Barbara, California.  The dam, which was constructed in 1952, is a zoned earthfill embankment with a structural height of 137 feet, a crest width of 30 feet and a crest length of 540 feet at elevation 567.5.  Lauro Reservoir is a regulating reservoir on the South Coast Conduit.  Inflow to the reservoir occurs via a turnout from the South Coast Conduit at a baffled drop structure located on the left side of the reservoir rim.  Its primary purpose is to meet the peak water demand for the City of Santa Barbara.  Lauro Dam is classified as a high-hazard facility due to the potential for downstream loss of life in the event of failure.  The proposed construction work on Lauro Dam consists of a structural modification that incorporates a downstream filter and drain.  The work will require dewatering and excavation of the downstream face and toe of the dam, placement of layers of sand filter and gravel drain materials over the core material within the excavated area where an existing foundation fault exists.  Original embankment material will be placed over the drain materials, resulting in a significant portion of the crest and downstream face of the dam being wider than the original configuration.  The work will require the contractor to excavate at the toe or downstream portion of the dam with an active reservoir (reservoir elevation will not be lowered for construction).  The dam and associated land has limited work areas, staging areas are small, and limited stockpile areas.   The work requires over 4000 truck trips through residential areas to get material to and from the jobsite.  The contractor will be required to work limited hours due to city noise and work ordinances.  The value of the work is estimated in excess of $10 million.  The contract duration is contemplated for 12 months.  It is anticipated that award of the work will occur in September 2005.  This procurement will require 100% performance and payment bonds.  Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and Annual Representations and Certifications, as required by FAR 4.1102, applies to this procurement.  Prospective contractors must be registered prior to award.  Lack of registration in the CCR database will make an offeror ineligible for award.  Information on CCR registration can be obtained via the Internet at http://www.ccr.gov.  Information on Annual Representations and Certifications can be obtained via the Internet at http://www.orca.bpn.gov.  All inquiries and concerns must be addressed by e-mail to the Contract Specialist/Margaret Kirkpatrick at mkirkpatrick@mp.usbr.gov.  The solicitation will be available on or about May 13, 2005.  The NAICS code is 234990 (All Other Heavy Construction) 18.  N/A 19.  N/A

<DESC>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS.
The Solicitation posted appears to be incomplete.  Specifically:
The cover page states there should be 148+ pages.  There appears to be only 34 pages in the
posted solicitation.  The organization of the solicitation does not follow the outline provided on the cover page.  Portions of the document are missing; for example, Section L starts with L.7 rather than L.1, and Section M seems to be incomplete and was swapped with Section K. 
In Section L, there are no instructions for providing past performance; the cost volume
information is not detailed; and page limitations are not included, etc. Will these sections be made available and if so when?

We originally intended to include Section J; however, Section had to be uploaded separately.  This is the reason for the miscount of the pages.

Item 9 of the cover page does not specify the number of copies of the offer required.  Please specify.
An original and 3 copies.

Item 9 of the cover page does not specify a location for hand-delivery of the offer.  Please specify.

The Adams Building
2nd Street, SE
Room LA 325

Item 9 of the cover page specifies delivery of the bid by 03:00 on 5/02/2005.  Please clarify whether this is a.m. or p.m.

Will there be an extension to the response date granted based upon the corrections to the solicitation?
Not planned at this time.

Section B:

Section B requests a cost for photoduplication.  However, Section C does not specify the requirements for photoduplication. What is being photoduplicated and delivered by the contractor?

What type (or types) of photoduplication is required?  There is a wide range of duplicating

<DESC>The VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System intends to negotiate on a sole source basis pursuant to FAR 6.302-1 with Galvanon, Inc., 2500 Maitland Center Pkwy, Suite 100, Maitland, FL 32751 for a MediKiosk Patient Check-In Kiosk solution that will provide an interface from VA Pittsburgh Healthcare Systems existing scheduling, registration and patient accounting systems for a central outpatient registration area. The solution will consist of MediKiosk Hardware, Professional Services and MediKiosk Software with capability to address the increasing need of a rapid and reliable automated method to check-in of patients arriving for appointments at the VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System.  The VA primary method for self check-in was determined to be through the use of a computerized kiosk and the patient veteran identification card.  The patient would swipe their card and their appointment information as well as financial and insurance information would be matched to any updates or other actions required during that visit.  Based on predetermined responses to questions answered by the patient they would either be referred to a Business Service representative for further processing or directed to their first appointment. The patient will be provided their itinerary and directions to the various clinics.  Upon arriving at the clinic patient would then use a similar kiosk to check-in with the clinic.  Galvanon provides the hardware and software in an integrated system that meets or exceeds VA proposed self service check-in process and the system will support patient activity monitoring to track and graphically display workflow and patient wait times. Galvanon MediKiosk System also has developed a process for managing appointment reports, co-pay collection, patient check-in, way finding and positive patient identification.  The North American Industry Classification System (NACIS) Code is 334119. If your firm has a comparable Patient Check-in Kiosk System which you would like us to consider, please submit manufacturer's literature and documentation that the system meets or exceeds VA requirements in writing no later than 4:00 PM on Tuesday, May 3, 2005 to Kathleen.Grundza@med.va.gov or mail to Kathleen Grundza (04A1-H), VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System, 7180 Highland Drive, Pittsburgh, PA 15206. Technical questions can be directed to Angelo Baiocchi, at (412) 688-6476 or Angelo.Baiocchi@med.va.gov. This is not a request for quotations or proposals. The VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System will make a determination whether to issue a competitive solicitation based on any responses received.

<DESC>Landing Gear Prime Vendor Contract request for information.  The Landing Gear Commodity Council (84 MSUG/OBL) is investigating concepts to support the length of the contract period for this procurement.    This RFI initiates a concept call for a 10-year, award-term, multiple award, IDIQ contract vehicle.   Approximate ceiling:  $1.6B, $1.5B of which is for procurement of landing gear spares.    Approximately $100M is for modifications, upgrades, engineering services, and remanufacture.   The contract is a total small business set aside and envisioned to function as a “prime vendor contract”.  Up to six prime vendors will be selected.   Prime awardees will receive additional award terms, to follow the basic award period, based upon their continually improved performance in the areas of cost, schedule, and quality.
      This RFI requests, specifically, the opinion of industry with regard to the length of the overall proposed contract period of ten (10) years.  The basic contract period (length up to three years) will be firm fixed-priced with a prospective price redetermination.  All subsequent award periods will include a ceiling price at the time of basic award.   Prior to award of the next period, contractors will propose updated fixed prices along with the explanation of the original and updated prices.  Upward adjustments are allowable only if  the cost of the material has increased by more that 10% over the amount included in the original ceiling prices.    The responsibility of demonstrating that this increase has occurred will rest with the contractor; any resultant upward price adjustments will be limited to the amount of the actual material increase and will only be applied to the base cost of materials without adjusting for increased indirect cost rates or profit.

<DESC>In response to a directive specified in Homeland Security Presidential Directive #8, the Office for State and Local Government Coordination and Preparedness (SLGCP) has developed a National Exercise Program (NEP). The NEP provides leaders and their staffs at all levels of Government the opportunity to periodically train and exercise together focused on critical homeland security procedures. The NEP has four principal objectives: 1) To provide national (as defined by the National Strategy for Homeland Security) leaders and their staffs with the opportunity to periodically train and exercise together, identify key policy issues, and refine key incident management processes/procedures relating to prevention, response, and recovery mission areas against the range of probable threats; 2) To enhance existing and develop new exercise and evaluation common doctrine and methodology, such as the Homeland Security Exercise and Evaluation Program, and provide annual Program planning guidance for the benefit of all levels of government and the private sector; 3) To establish collaborative management processes, supporting systems, and multi-year scheduling to meet short and long term goals, monitor all budget activities and performance expectations as required by the Program Assessment Rating Tool (PART), as well as influence program and system requirements and to provide accurate predictability in spending and program requirement forecasting; and 4) To formalize a system for collecting, reporting, analyzing, interpreting, and disseminating qualitative as well as quantitative exercise lessons and exemplary practices, and monitor the implementation of improvement actions from both exercise and real-world experiences._____________________________________________________________________________To obtain contractor services to further enhance and manage this program, DHS plans to conduct a full and open competition, with the selected firms being awarded indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity ID/IQ contracts. The actual program implementation would be through a competitive task ordering process among the selected firms. It is intended that all selected firms would then be eligible to compete for all tasks to the greatest extent possible. Tasks will be developed by the Government based on requirement and funding. Generally, tasks will consist of a grouping of service delivery activities of similar purpose. The Government’s intention is to award tasks through competition which guarantee initial phases of task delivery and maintain options for delivery of all remaining activities. It is requested that capable companies provide comments on the draft requirements for the NEP._____________________________________________________________________________Note that this is not a formal request for proposal. There are currently no funds available for this project and the Government will not make award or develop a source list based on responses to this draft solicitation. DHS will not reimburse any preparation costs associated with responses to this draft solicitation._____________________________________________________________________________Sources are encouraged to review the draft documents and provide comments and recommendations for addition, change, or deletion. It is the Respondent’s responsibility to periodically review either of these websites for notices, amendments, updates, questions and answers and changes to the posted information._____________________________________________________________________________This award is planned to be made on an unrestricted basis. In addition to the contracts that are being addressed by this draft solicitation, an additional acquisition is being planned to provide related support services. It is planned that this acquisition would be set-aside for small business. The specific requirements for this action are currently under evaluation by SLGCP, and would be addressed as a separate announcement._____________________________________________________________________________The following attachments are available under this draft solicitation: Attachment 1: Draft Solicitation HSHQPC-05-R-00006

<DESC>Project Title: Development and Estimation of Models for Forecasting Supply and Demand for Registered Nurses

The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) is conducting a sources sought/market survey to locate small business, HUBZone, and/or 8(a) firms under NAICS Code 541990 ($6M) capable of developing and estimating models for forecasting supply and demand for registered nurses (RNs) for the Bureau of Health Professionals (BHPr). The main objective of the models is to forecast the supply and need for RNs in the health care industry given expected requirements for services to be provided.

The purpose of this contract, authorized by the Public Health Service Act, as amended, Title VII, Section 951, is to develop and estimate models for forecasting the supply and requirements (or demand) of RNs, using the latest nursing and demographic data available. This project includes preparing user-friendly software and documentation.  The project shall also provide mechanisms for updating the estimates over time.  The models developed through this project shall allow States to estimate state-specific supply and need estimates.  Additionally, this project shall provide for the maintenance and operation of the models as well as provide a publication-quality paper addressing the adequacy of the future RN supply in meeting the needs of the U.S. population.

The tasks to be carried out under any resultant contract require the contractor to:

(1)develop and test a model to estimate the supply of RNs year by year from 2005 to 2030 for the 50 States and DC.

(2)develop and test a model to estimate the requirements of RNs year by year from 2005 to 2030 for the 50 States and DC.

(3)document all completed work, including methods and procedures used in developing the Nurses Supply Model (NSM) and the Nurses Requirements (Demand) Model (NRM); documentation shall include source and parameter data used and trial runs of the models as well as methods for updating and applying policy scenarios; documentation shall include 5-7 page executive summary containing capsule summary descriptions of both models, key data elements used, and summary inputs and outputs.

(4)provide software in a user-friendly, menu-driven system that operates within Windows upper level environments accompanied by appropriate documentation; users should have the ability to interface with the models, for example, by changing policy assumptions (e.g. growth rates of RN wages, substitution of licensed practical nurses (LPNs) and nurses aides, managed care saturation, percent of population uninsured, Medicare reimbursements, nursing facility daily rate reimbursements, etc. and/or demographic changes; software should allow the models to be adapted for use at the State level.

(5)provide complete documentation about the data, assumptions, and use of the models; methods and procedures for interfacing with the models, changing policy and demographic assumptions, and etc. should be well articulated.

(6)update, operate, and maintain the models for the duration of contract.

(7)submit monthly status reports.

(8)participate in conference calls at least once a month.

(9)produce a final report and publication-quality journal article.

Interested parties shall submit their capability statements demonstrating their capability to perform this work in sufficient detail to assess their ability. Potential contractors must have thorough understanding of estimating the supply and demand for RNs in the United States.

THERE IS NO SOLICITATION DRAWING PACKAGE AVAILABLE.

This is a request for information only as defined in FAR 15.201(e).

The government does not presently intend to award a contract, but wants to obtain information on commercially available software database applications.  Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  

The Air Warfare Battlelab (AWB), Mountain Home Air Force Base, Idaho, is planning to conduct a study that will evaluate commercial options to solve the following problem:  

United States Air Force aircraft maintenance units require the capability to bend tube material for the manufacture of pneudraulic lines while at a deployed location.  Current forward located maintenance units have to ship aircraft pneudraulic lines to home station for repair and/or manufacture. The AWB is interested in Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) products that could be used as-is or slightly modified to solve this problem.

These attributes are desired requirements by the USAF:

1.	A tube bender capable of bending 3/8in to 2in Outer Diameter tubing
2.	Capable of bending Titanium, Stainless Steel, and Aluminum tubing
3.	Easily portable and capable of operating at deployed locations
4.	Accepts input of bend angles in 0.1 Degree increments 
5.	Have the option of manual or semi-automatic operation
6.	Total weight less than 2500lbs
7.	Ability to be shipped on standard Air Force cargo pallet (108inX88in)
	
The AWB is seeking the following specific information from industry representatives:

1.	The manufacturers suggested retail price and/or a schedule of lease pricing for the commercial product.
2.	The name of distributors who could sell to the Government.
3.	The degree to which the product can meet or exceed the above desirable and beneficial attributes of the USAF.


Requested information must be submitted NO LATER THAN 01Jun 05 to Major Cathy Blacklock, Air Warfare Battlelab, 360 Gunfighter Ave, Suite 1, Mountain Home AFB, ID 83648 or Email cathy.blacklock@mountainhome.af.mil.  Major Blacklock can be reached at (208) 828-3542.  A formal solicitation MAY NOT BE ISSUED as a result of this RFI.  Information provided may or may not be included in a formal solicitation.  The USAF will not release any information -- marked with a Proprietary legend -- received in response to this RFI to any firms, agencies, or individuals outside the USAF without written permission in accordance with the legend.

<DESC>The C-E LCMC Acquisition Center Washington is seeking sources on behalf of U.S. Army RDECOM CERDEC, Army Power Division for carbon dioxide (CO2) compressors suitability for testing by the U.S. Army for use in future Environmental Control Units (ECUs) . The U.S. Army requires advanced heating and cooling technology for a variety of equipment applications. One of these is the military family of Environmental Control Units (ECUs). High performance systems with reduced logistics support requirements and en vironmentally responsible working fluids are desired. Of specific interest is implementing technology for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. The transcritical carbon dioxide cycle offers these possibilities. The U.S. Army RDECOM CERDEC, Army Power Division, is applying for approval from the Department of Defense to initiate the Foreign Comparative Testing Program for Transcritical CO2 Cooling and Heating Technology Compressors in Fiscal Year 2006. The Army intends to identify the 4 most promising fo reign (non-U.S.) compressor models and procure 2 of each for testing and evaluation. In addition, domestic compressor models will be considered for testing and evaluation. Technical requirements: (1) Capable of compressing CO2 gas for military cooling and heating applications; (2) Power type: 208V, 3-phase, 50/60Hz and/or 115V, single-phase, 50/60Hz; (3) Air Cooling outdoor temperature range: 32 deg F to 125 deg F (0 deg C to 51.7 deg C); (4) Range of desired cooling capacities at 125 deg F outdoor, 90 deg F/50%RH indoor: 6,000 Btu/h to 120,000 Btu/h (at 51.7 deg C outdoor, 32.2 deg C/50%RH indoor: 1.8 kW to 35 kW); (5) Heat Pump capability desired. The U.S. Army is interested in receiving white papers outlining the following: (1) Self-assessment (by the compressor manufacturer) of the technology maturity level -- find the Technology Readiness Table through the following website: http://akss.dau.mil/jsp/default.jsp ; (2) Whether and where item is in commercial use; (3) Production rates (current and potential); (4) Technical data (e.g., rated cooling/heating capacity at industry/specified conditions, burst pressure, electrical power limit, etc.); (5) Test and evaluation data; (6) Terms offered for use of compressors by the U.S. Army in testing (no-cost loan, lease, purchase, etc.), including cost estimates; (7) Terms offered for vendor support of this testing program (maintenance, repair, etc.), including cost estimates; (8) Unit cost or estimated cost for full production items; (9) Summary of related corporate experience; (10) Other data that may be useful for Army consideration. The most mature technology is desired. Most desired is in production. The next most desired is fully developed not in production. At a minimum, the compressor must be in development and will be fully developed by 30 March 2006. Emphasis will be placed on prospective sources with proven experience in building full-scale compressors for transcritical CO2 systems. There is no funding available to procure materials that meet t he above requirements at this time.  In addition, the government does not plan to pay for any information received from this request for information (RFI). The data received in response to this RFI will be used for information purposes only and does not, i n any way, mandate or impose requirements.  It is highly desirable for the government to receive unlimited rights to the data provided, however, it is recognized that proprietary data may be included with the information provided.  If this is the case, pro prietary data must be  clearly marked as such and separated from the unrestricted information as an addendum.  Proprietary information will be protected.  White papers excluding test data shall not exceed 5 pages in length per compressor model; test data s hall have no page limit. White papers should be submitted electronically to the Contracting Officer at pat.davis@cacw.army.mil no later than close of business (4:00 pm E DST) on by 26 May 2005.  All requests for further information must be submitted via email to the Contracting Officer; telephone requests for additional information will not be honored.

Ms. Matiella was one of the first health professionals in the country to develop the fotonovela as a health education tool.  Her first fotonovela was produced in 1983 for the National Arthritis Foundation.  Since then, Ms. Matiella has produced dozens of health fotonovelas targeting bilingual and multicultural audiences making her the most experienced fotonovela producer in the United States. Ms. Matiella is bilingual and bicultural.  Her expertise is in social marketing for Latinos, she is also bilingual and bicultural. Her expertise is in developing easy to read pictorial materials and fotonovela production. The Program Development Branch, Division of Diabetes Translation, CDC, strives to support its state- and territorial Diabetes Prevention and Control Programs (DPCPs) and NDEP partners to use a model of influence to strengthen essential public health services to help communities promote diabetes prevention and control.
The Branch wants to develop entertainment education tools for diabetes education and community mobilization to target special populations and to help address the gaps in health disparities in Latino communities. Develop a plan for reviewing the literature on health promotion with fotonovelas and integrate with own experience to provide diabetes professional community and community leaders with a guide for this educational venue.
Conduct a summary review of research findings on fotonovelas, the proven principles of entertainment education that will guide this project, and collect relevant information that combines the power of the telenovela medium with that of the fotonovela. Conduct focus group interviews with the target population who are Hispanic/Latino Families living in: California with Mexicans, New York with Puerto Ricans and Columbians and Venezuelan, Miami with Cubans and Columbians and Venezuelan, and New Mexico with Mexican Americans; before the development of the story.  The contractor will use the formative research that both CDC and Ana Consuelo Matiella and Associates has conducted to strength this project with science-based evidence.  To produce an entertaining and gripping fotonovela about diabetes self-management targeting Hispanics in the United States.

<SUBJECT>--Market Survey - Commercially available off the shelf (COTS) speech recognition technology.
<DESC>The US Army CERDEC is conducting a market survey to determine if any commercially available off the shelf (COTS) speech recognition technology, which can meet the specific stringent requirements set forth below exists.  The technology in question is being considered for application to select Army programs, and must demonstrate the required performance in the harshest tactical environments.  To be considered the candidate technology must meet the following requirements: 1.  The candidate technology must be capable of recognizing natural speech, where natural speech is defined as:  The ability to recognize co-articulated (no pauses between words) speech phrases, containing up to 8 words (5 words on average) per phrase, wit h a phrase recognition rate of 95% (a phrase is considered in error if there is an error in any part of the phrase) for a minimum of 100 phrases.  However, the phrase recognition rate must be unaffected if arbitrary pauses of indefinite length are inserted  between words. 2.  The candidate technology must be speaker independent:  where speaker independence is defined as the ability of the speech recognizer to achieve the required phrase recognition rate (as set forth in 1. above) for 98% of a statistically significant porti on of the user population.  The user population shall be defined as:  that population that reflects the same statistical diversity in ethnic and regional accents as represented in today's Army. 3.  The candidate technology must be capable of maintaining the required phrase recognition performance (as set forth in 1. above) for the entire user population (as set forth in 2. above) during the following noise environments:    a.  Impulsive noise produced by typical user weapons fire (M-16), which can achieve peak levels of 150 dB.    b.  Continuous noise produced by various track vehicles (M113, M1A1, Bradley and Stryker), under all operating conditions, which will cause a variation in intensity from 100-120 dB, and shifts in spectral content. All potential offerors must provide documented evidence of actual tests that confirm that a candidate technology can meet the requirements set forth above.  The CERDEC reserves the right to determine the acceptability of the documented evidence reflects th e requirements above in the judgment of the CERDEC. This announcement is an expression of interest only and does not commit the government to pay for proposal preparation costs.  Interested parties should be alert for subsequent announcements that may be published in the Commerce Business Daily. Vendors capable of furnishing a COTS product that will satisfy the above specified requirements must so indicate by responding in writing to US Army CERDEC, Fort Monmouth NJ 07703, ATTN:  AMSRD-CER-C2-BA (Lockwood Reed).  Further information can be obtaine d by contacting Mr. Lockwood Reed at (732) 427-2559 or by E-mail response at Lockwood.Reed@us.army.mil.  The deadline for response to this notice is 30 days from the date this notification is published.

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

<DESC>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS:  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests(OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office(GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award or performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (CG851), 2100 Second Street, SW, Washington, D.C. 20593, Telephone:   (202) 267-2285, FAX: (202) 267-4011  This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; a quote is being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation Number N00019-05-T-0011 is issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ). The incorporated document and provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-02 and Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) Change Notice (DCN) 20050323. This action is not set aside for a small business. The applicable NAICS is 334419 and the small business size standard is <500 employees. This is a DO rated order with an assigned rating of A70. This requirement is being procured sole source through Honeywell Defense and Space Electronic Systems, Albuquerque, NM.  Required delivery date: within 45 days of contract award.  The Naval Air Systems Command Headquarters (NAVAIR HQ), Patuxent River MD has a requirement to protect the production repair capability of the Advanced Mission Computer and Displays (AMC&D), the mission system for the F/A-18 aircraft.  A commercial part component of the Advanced Mission Computer (AMC) Image Processor Module (IPM), A/D Converter part number AD9071BR is to become obsolete.  The requirement to protect F/A-18E/F Lot 30 production and repair support necessitates the procurement of approximately 578 A/D converters.  There are no other known parts that meet form, fit, function replacement requirements.  In accordance with FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or servies will satisfy the agency requirements.  Honeywell is the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) of the AMC IPM and the AMPD, as well as the designated repair facility, and as such is the only source capable of procuring these parts to protect forward-fit production and repair.  It is anticipated that a firm-fixed price type purchase order will be awarded.  All hardware items will ship-in-place at the contractor’s facility; FOB Origin with Inspection and Acceptance at Origin applies.  Inspection and Acceptance of the supplies and services to be furnished hereunder shall be performed at the suppliers plant, Albuquerque, NM by the cognizant Administrative Contracting Officer (ACO) or their duly authorized representative.  The contract line item number and description is:  CLIN 0001 A/D Converter, p/n AD9071BR; period of performance:  45 days after contract award.   The contractor shall extend to the Government full coverage of any standard commercial warranty normally offered in a similar commercial sale.  Acceptance of the warranty does not waive the Government’s rights under any Inspection clause that may be in the contract, nor does it limit the Government’s rights with regard to the other terms and conditions of this purchase order.  In the event of a conflict, the terms and conditions of the contract shall take precedence over the warranty.  The warranty period shall begin upon final acceptance of the applicable deliverables listed in the schedule.   The Statement of Work for this effort is provided as an attachment to this synopsis/solicitation.  Award is expected to be on or before 13 May 2005. The supplies to be furnished hereunder shall be preserved, packaged and packed in accordance with best commercial practices to assure safe delivery at destination.  FAR 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors -- Commercial Items (Jan 2004) is incorporated by reference and applies to this acquisition, except that there is an addendum to paragraph (h) in that this will be a single award.

STATEMENT OF WORK - GENERAL:  The United States Border Patrol is tasked with detecting, deterring from entering and arresting those who violate the immigration laws of the United States.  Since its inception the Border Patrol has utilized horses in support of the mission to which it is assigned.  Occasionally these service mounts need to be replaced due to injury, disease, age or death.  In replacing service mounts, certain minimum requirements have been established and the successful contractor/seller is expected to comply with the established parameters when supplying horses for service mounts.  REQUIREMENTS:  Breeds- Quarter Horses are the desired breed.  Crossbreeds may be accepted on a case-by-case basis, as determined by the government.  Age- the horse shall have a documented age between five (5) and ten (10) years of age.  (Exceptions to purchasing an older horse will be made on a case-by-case basis.).  Weight- the horse shall weigh no less than 900 pounds and no more than 1250 pounds.  Size- the horse shall measure not less than 15 hands and not more than 16.5 hands in height.  Sex- All service mounts will be altered male horses (Geldings).  SELECTION CRITERIA:  The following shall be considered in selecting a horse for service:  Most riders have little or no experience.  The horse must be capable of carrying 200-250 lbs. of weight for long periods of time (6-8 hours/Day).  Horses will be subjected to high desert/low desert; mountainous terrain; loose rocks; thick brush; extremely hot temperatures in the summer and drastically cool winters.  A certified Border Patrol Instructor and the Coordinator or a designee for the Tucson Sector will administer a series of tests to determine whether the horse has the capability of working in the Border Patrol environment.  Each horse will be required to pass these tests for acceptance into the program.  SELECTION EXERCISES/TESTS:  A candidate horse must be sound and well proportioned in conformation.  The horse shall be gentle and calm with a good disposition.  Following are a series of tests that the agents will conduct to determine whether or not a horse will meet the minimum requirements for purchase.  Approach- When approached, the horse should turn and face, standing quietly, especially in a confined area.  Halter- The horse should be easily haltered without giving any indications of head-shyness or resistance to “catching”.  Leading- The candidate horse should exhibit good ground manners and should remain calm when being handled.  Saddling- The candidate horse should stand still and calm while being saddled.  He should show no signs of aggressiveness of being “cinchy” during this process. Mounting- The candidate horse should stand still and calm during this evolution.  Reining- The candidate horse should demonstrate a proper understanding of stopping, turning and backing with only a light to moderate touch of the reins.  Excessive force should not be necessary during this process.  Dismounting- The candidate horse should stand quietly while the rider dismounts.  Loading/Unloading- The candidate horse should load and unload from a variety of trailers without difficulty.  Balking will be a disqualifying factor when considering the purchase of a candidate horse.  Shoeing- The candidate horse should stand quietly and calmly while being shod or having his feet worked on.  TEMPERAMENT:  All candidate horses should exhibit the “proper temperament” during the entire selection process.  The candidate horse should be calm when any number of people or equipment are moving or standing around him.  He must display confidence in any number of environments, including areas of unsure footing, tight enclosed or narrow spaces, moving vehicles/equipment, loud noises and/or bangs and popping sounds.  Although the flight or fight response is always prevalent, the candidate horse must remain calm or quickly recover and not run off with the rider when startled.  The candidate horse must possess a gentle and calm demeanor during the hours of darkness and around large groups of people.  DOCUMENTATION REQUIRED:  Current vaccination/Quarantine records.  Health certificate issued by a certified/licensed veterinarian.  Registration certificates, breed surveys and other related paperwork, as applicable.  PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  A certified veterinarian will perform a full physical examination of the candidate horse as a prerequisite to completing the selection process.  MISCELLANEOUS:  The Government retains the right to return a candidate horse to the contractor/seller, if after 45 days, the animal is deemed not suitable for service.  This determination will be based on the selection criteria or the horse is discovered to have a pre-existing medical problem, chronic disease or a hereditary defect that could render the horse unsuitable for service.  The vendor will replace the horse within thirty days of receipt of notice that any of the aforementioned conditions exist.  This animal shall be replaced with a suitable horse that meets all the selection criteria.  The Government retains the sole right to make any and all determinations as to the acceptability/unacceptability of the candidate.  The contractor/seller shall not, in any case, hold the Government responsible for the disposition of a medically or physically defective horse.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6 as supplemental and additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be used.  This solicitation is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation number is SAZ-RO-05-05.  The solicitation and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-03.  The applicable North American Industry Classification Systems 325320 and size standard is 500 employees.  The USDA, Forest Services is soliciting for the acquisition of the following herbicides/pesticides:  Item no. (1a) – Glyphosate 4#/gallon (no surfactant) 1550 gallons (2.5 gallon containers - 2 per box) OR Item no. (1b) Glyphosate 5.4#/gallon (no surfactant) 1150 gallons (2.5 gallon containers - 2 per box) OR Item no. (1c) a mix of the 2 formulations yielding the equivalent poundage of ai (6200 lbs).  Item no. (2) – Velpar L (product specific; no substitutions) 830 gallons (2.5 gallon container, 2 per per box).  Item no. (3) – Arsenal Applicators Concentrate (4 lb a.e./gal; product specific; no substitutions) 420 gallons (2.5 gallon containers - 2 per box).  Item no. (4) – Arsenal (2 lb a.e./gal; product specific; no substitutions) 100 gallons (2.5 gallon containers - 2 per box).  Item no.

Products 2-4 are product specific (to meet Environment Protection Agency (EPA) labeling requirements), and package sizes are specific to meet desired storage and safety standards during use. While other products or packaging is available they are unacceptable due to either regulatory or safety constraints.  
Products 1a and lb are equivalent products, calculations reflecting the fact that different formulators package at different rates of active ingredient per gallon.  Either rate per gallon is acceptable if tendered product is labeled for forestry use and the formulation contains no surfactant.  Packaging other than 2 per box is acceptable but 2.5 gallon/container is the maximum volume container acceptable.  Quoters may submit a quote on Items 1a, lb or lc.   (Separate listings are given to allow purchase of existing 4# a.i./gal stock or to procure appropriate 5.4# a.i./gal products).  
Product 5 is triclopyr amine formulated in water solution.  A total of 2000 gals of the 3# a.e./gallon formulations (traditional formulation = 6000 lbs a.e.) is estimated for need.  This may be filled as 3# a.e./gal formulated product or as the equivalent poundage of a.e. in any product formulated at a different rate of a.e./gal.
Product 6 is triclopyr ester formulated in appropriate solution (and potentially including surfactant).  A total of 1700 gallons of the 4# a.e./gal formulation (traditional formulation = 6800 lbs a.e.) is estimated as needed.  This may be filled as 3# a.e./gal formulated product or as the equivalent poundage of a.e. in product formulated at a different rate of a.e./gal.
EPA requires that products be labeled for "site" of application.  Any product purchased from proposed contract must have appropriate labeling to permit forest, right-of-way, or wildlife site use.

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington, D. C. 20593, Telephone (202) 267-2285, Fax: (202) 267-4011.
Award will be based on the following criteria:  Past Performance experience will be evaluated.  Offerors are cautioned that the government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussion with offerors.  Therefore, the offeror’s initial offer should contain its best terms.  The contract will be awarded as a firm fixed price contract using simplified acquisition procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13.5.

<DESC>This is the final set of questions and answers. Final Set of Questions and Answers: 11.     Given the need to fill in scope specifics, is it possible to get an extension on the submission deadline?  A:     Based on feedback received thus far from potential offerors, that is not necessary.  Requested Clarification:  How many offerers are there?  Is it possible to get a list of them? A:  There is no way to confirm who or how many responses the Government will receive. The JPMO does not have a current list. 41. Will pricing be determined once the government's testing period is completed, as there are no quantities listed in the solicitation?      A:     The application will belong to the government after it is developed.  Requested Clarification:  We do not understand this response.  Price is a critical aspect of the proposal.  The lack of specificity and quantification in the proposal requires numerous assumptions, making it difficult to price accurately, and for evaluators to easily compare competing proposals.  Clarification:  The contract will be for development and enterprise license, up to 500 users. 44     Are there specific items that the government requires as part of the requested project plan?  A:     The project plan will include all major milestones leading up to the delivery for acceptance testing as well as all minor milestones and associated dependencies.     A final project plan will be required after contract award.  Requested Clarification: As for price, our response will have to be based on numerous assumptions.  We will provide the required plan, with the understanding that milestones and associated dependencies may change, contingent on specifications provided at contract award.  A:  The contract will be for development and enterprise license, up to 500 users. Q1.  Based on your answers to questions 42 and 44 in the responses you provided to the questions submitted by potential offerors, you indicated that the delivery to the government is by October 1, 2005 and that the project plan should include all milestones leading up to the delivery for acceptance testing.  Based on your responses, is it correct to assume that October 1, 2005 is when your 30-day test and acceptance period begins?  Is the 30-day test period based on calendar days or business days? A:  Test and acceptance period will begin with the delivery on 01 Oct 05.   As previously posted, the test period will not exceed 30 calendar days. The Offeror should plan to spend a significant amount of time with the Joint Program Management office developing this product.  Contractor will conduct liaison with Procurement Desktop-Defense in order to ensure SF 44 tool feeds selected information to PD2.  Contractor will meet with a joint panel in late June for a product review and critique, with a follow-up panel in mid-August.  The focus of the joint panel critiques is for the contractor to receive direct input from service representatives on the finished product. Q2.  Will the resultant contract be time and material?  If it is not a T&M contract award, please clarify what type of contract you will award the winning offeror?   A:  The JPMO prefers FFP, but offerors may submit other contract types  consistent with FAR Part 12 as part of their proposal. Q3.  Will your acceptance be based on price alone or best value? A:  Best value.  Offerors are encouraged to demonstrate any value-added growth potential of their SF 44 tool.  The evaluation criteria listed in the  posted requirement is: The SPS JPMO shall use the following evaluation criteria to determine the best value to the Government and Demonstration of value added to the JPMO, including price, specical qualifications, and admistrative costs IAW FAR Part 12. ·	Product Demonstration and compliance with the Governments requirement ·	Price ·	Past Performance  - Please provide 3 references for si milar contracts
