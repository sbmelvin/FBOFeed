<DESC>NAICS Code: 541380   	The  U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Research Triangle Park, North Carolina is responsible for procuring, testing, and distributing quartz and glass fiber filters of high purity to the State/local air pollution control agencies.  The quartz filters are used with a size selective sampler (SSI) to collect PM-10 (particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to a nominal 10 micrometers) samples.  The glass fiber filters are used to collect Total Suspended Particulates (TSP), and these filters are also used for lead and trace metal  analyses.  This process assures filters with uniform characteristics and known quality assurance testing for the national particulate networks. 	EPA obtains the filters from a filter manufacturer and has them shipped to EPA for acceptance testing.  If the acceptance testing confirms that the  filters meet EPA's specifications for physical and chemical properties, the EPA instructs the independent laboratory to ship the filters to the State/local air pollution control agencies.  	NAICS Code 541380 applies and the size standard is $4 million in average annual receipts over the last three  years.  This requirement is a follow-on to purchase order 1D-6598-NTLX with TRC Environmental Corporation which expired October 17, 2001.

<DESC>The Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation), Pacific Northwest Regional Office, intends to award a contract to the Shoshone-Bannock Tribes to conduct a Class III level (on-the-ground) cultural resources inventory in the vicinity of (and including) the Fort Hall National Historic Landmark, Fort Hall Indian Reservation, Idaho.  The inventory is the first step in achieving Section 106 cultural resource compliance for future actions designed to reduce the adverse effects of bank erosion that currently threatens the historic fort.   Information derived from the Class III inventory relating to sensitive cultural resource sites and their protection needs  will serve as a basis for planning and implementing future bank stabilization efforts in accordance with Reclamation's Congressionally mandated 2001 bank erosion study report.  Information about the nature and location of properties of traditional cultural and religious value to Indian peoples is confidential, sensitive, and unavailable to the public.  Tribes are very concerned about information from these types of sites getting into the wrong hands.  Only the Shoshone-Bannock have knowledge about the nature and location of their traditional cultural properties and sacred sites and, thus, are the only entity that can reasonably conduct an inventory of these places for Reclamation.  The NAICS is 541720 and the size standard is $5 million.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 5413   	The  U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Research Triangle Park, North Carolina is responsible for procuring, testing, and distributing quartz and glass fiber filters of high purity to the State/local air pollution control agencies.  The quartz filters are used with a size selective sampler (SSI) to collect PM-10 (particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to a nominal 10 micrometers) samples.  The glass fiber filters are used to collect Total Suspended Particulates (TSP), and these filters are also used for lead and trace metal  analyses.  This process assures filters with uniform characteristics and known quality assurance testing for the national particulate networks. 	EPA obtains the filters from a filter manufacturer and has them shipped to EPA for acceptance testing.  If the acceptance testing confirms that the  filters meet EPA's specifications for physical and chemical properties, the EPA instructs the independent laboratory to ship the filters to the State/local air pollution control agencies.  	NAICS Code 541380 applies and the size standard is $4 million in average annual receipts over the last three  years.  This requirement is a follow-on to purchase order 1D-6598-NTLX with TRC Environmental Corporation which expired October 17, 2001.  It is estimated that the RFQ will be issued approximately 15 days after the date of this notice.  Quotes will be due approximately three (3) days after the RFQ  issuance date.  The complete Statement of Work (SOW), Request for Quotation(RFQ)and any RFQ amendments will be available via the Internet at http://www.epa.gov/oam/rtp_cmd.  Firms are encouraged to access the SOW and RFQ via the Internet.  If you will be obtaining a copy of the RFQ via Internet, it  will be your responsibility to frequently check the same site where the RFQ is posted for any  amendments.  Firms who do not have the capability to obtain the documents from the Internet, may submit a written request for a FAX copy of the SOW and RFQ from the contact point at the address above;  however, only those firms who do NOT have the capability to obtain documents from the Internet should request a FAX.  FAXes will not be sent to those firms who have Internet access.  If you request a FAX of the RFQ, you will receive amendments by mail, unless you notify us otherwise.  Telephone and  fax requests will not be honored.  Only one copy will be FAXed to a corporate entity, regardless of the number of requests from one or more different geographic locations.  All responsible sources may submit a quotation which shall be considered by the Agency.

SCOPE OF SERVICES FOR CONTRACTOR'S PREFERRED PRICING PROGRAM A. Purpose of Preferred Pricing Program (PPP) The purpose of the PPP is to assist the VA in meeting their economic objectives. The VA will not endorse or refer eligible veterans to individual physicians or PPO networks. When eligible veterans receive their healthcare from providers in the private sector through the VA Fee Basis, the PPP allows participating VAMCs to share in the savings available through the discounts in managed care networks. The program allows savings for a variety of health care services through Contractor's provider networks including hospitalization, outpatient care, ambulatory surgery, behavioral health, ancillary and other services. B. Preferred Pricing Program Processes The contractor will perform preferred pricing services. This includes making health care provider networks available to the VA and providing the preferred price to the VA so the VA can then pay the provider. 1. When eligible veterans use PPP providers for hospitalizations, inpatient services, outpatient care, ambulatory surgery, dental, professional services, ancillary, and other services; discounted rates will be available to VAMCs participating in the PPP.' 2. All PPP providers will submit their claims to the individual VAMC. The VAMC establishes eligibility, that the service is a covered benefit, and determines the VA allowable (the amount the VA will pay on that particular claim). The participating VAMC will document the VA allowable amount on the claim and forward claims greater than $150 to the contractor. The contractor will verify the providers participation with the contractor's PPO and annotate their best price for the services claimed, returning the information to the VAMC. The VAMC will determine the best value to the government and make payment on that basis. Reporting and invoicing protocols assume the VA will select the lesser of the two prices. 3. The contractor will provide monthly reports detailing the price the VAMC would have paid comparing it to the Contractor preferred price. These reports must be provided within 10 days of the end of the calendar month in which the service was provided. Contractor will calculate the amount saved and use that amount for invoicing. C. Preferred Pricing Program requires activities from four different entities. The VA will exercise oversight of the contractor and will have responsibilities for some portions of the claims flow. The VA will issue the payments to providers from VA funds. D. VA Responsibility: 1. VAMCs will appoint a liaison to assist in coordinating with internal VAMC assets. 2. VAMCs must: copy claims; forward and receive copied documents from the PPP contractor; track and reconcile claims; reconcile and certify monthly invoices. 3. The VA will retain responsibility for payment to providers submitting authorized claims. 4. VAMCs will retain the responsibility for making payments to the contractor for certified savings in accordance with Section V. Participating Medical Centers may provide a No Charge (N/C) purchase order to the contractor to initiate this BOA. E. Contractor Responsibility: 1. The contractor will serve as the prime contractor with overall responsibility for program management. The contractor will integrate all subcontractor activities. The contractor will ensure access to and adequacy of a discounted network to achieve savings from VA Allowable rates. The contractor's payment administrator will process the claims from receipt up to, but not including, issuance of payment. 2. Provide VAMCs access to managed care provider networks offering discounts. 3. Working with internal and external claims personnel. 4. Re-pricing and returning claims within 6 business days for paper or fax claims and 3 business days for EDI claims. Invoices not processed within the designated turnaround time will be treated as non-discountable and processed by the VA accordingly. The contractor fee will be paid only when the network price is used - claims not meeting the turnaround time will not be considered for reimbursement unless the PPP is utilized. 5. Contractor will prepare an individual pricing form for every claim and return it to the VA with the discounted price clearly written on it. 6. Provide opportunity for future EDI transmission of claims. 7. Submit standard reports in a timely manor. Quarterly reports to VISN 1 shall include a summary of each participating facility's demonstrated cost savings. Monthly summary reports for each VAMC's Contracting Officers Technical Representative (COTR) will be provided with the invoice for fee reimbursement. ( See Paragraph I B 3 and Section III.) 8. The contractor will pay for overnight or second day shipping when it is used. II. PROJECT PLAN A Project Plan will be developed that includes the following: 1. Implementation Meeting (Representatives from the contractor, VAMC fee or business office, and the COTR) a. Review process b. Review responsibilities c. Identify key contact personnel d. Develop timeline estimates e. Gather claims volume estimates f. Identify known problem areas 2. Agree upon post-payment adjustment protocol. 3. Discuss interface with Claims staff (internal and external). 4. Schedule meeting with Claims staff for implementation. The contractor personnel will travel to and from implementation meetings at the contractor' expense. 5. Gather provider contract information. 6. Make recommendations for modifying provider contracts as needed. 7. Perform preferred pricing. 8. Review Medical Center and COTR reports. 9. Conduct savings review with COTR. 10. Monitor preferred pricing process. 11. Establish ability to download claims electronically 12. Make recommendations to improve the effectiveness of preferred pricing. III. VALIDATING SAVINGS The individual VAMCs will retain the right to review and otherwise audit any part of the preferred pricing process at any time. The contractor will submit monthly reports to the VAMC showing claims submitted and claims with savings. This report will list the VA price and the contractor price. The contractor will use this savings report to generate invoices to each VAMC. IV. PRIVACY AND CONFIDENTIALITY The contractor will comply with all statutory, regulatory, and VA policy requirements related to patient privacy and confidentiality. Reference FAR 52.224-1 Privacy Act Notification (Apr 1984) and FAR 52.224-2 Privacy Act (Apr 1984) of this agreement. V. PRICING The contractor will provide preferred pricing services to the Department of Veterans Affairs. If there is no savings, there is no fee. The contractor fee is a percentage of savings on a per claim basis. The VA pays nothing until savings are realized. There is no additional fee beyond the percentage of savings fee. The fee for the contractor' preferred pricing services will be incurred only when cost savings are recognized. The contractor fee shall be a percentage of the savings per claim. Savings are defined as the difference between the VA allowable (the amount the VA was would pay) and the contractor PPP. Pricing Examples: Example 1 Claim value from provider (billed charges): $ 350.00 VA priced amount: $ 200.00 Contractor Network amount: $ 100.00 Savings: $ 100.00 Contractor Fee (25% of savings): $ 25.00 Example 2 Claim value from provider (billed charges): $ 1,500.00 VA priced amount: $ 975.00 Contractor Network amount: $ 325.00 Savings: $ 650.00 Contractor Fee (20% of savings): $ 130.00 Example 3 Claim value from provider (billed charges): $ 15,000.00 VA priced amount: $ 8,000.00 Contractor Network amount: $ 999.00 Savings: $ 7,001.00 Contractor Fee (15% of savings): $ 1,050.15 VI. PAYMENT Payment will be made to the contractor in arrears, based on the agreed upon rates as applied to the reconciled and certified monthly invoices, by modification to the initial purchase order VII.

<DESC>On December 17, 1999, the President signed legislation (P.L. 106-170) establishing the Ticket-to-Work and Self-Sufficiency Program. Under the Program, the Social Security Administration (SSA) has a requirement to contract with vendors to become employment networks (ENs), with responsibility for the coordination and delivery of services necessary to prepare and place beneficiaries in employment.  The purpose of the Ticket Program is to provide disability beneficiaries more choices for receiving employment services and increase provider incentives to serve these individuals. Under the program, SSA will provide disability beneficiaries with a Ticket they may use to obtain employment services, Vocational Rehabilitation (VR) services or other support services from an EN of their choice.  The Ticket-to-Work and Self-Sufficiency Program will be phased-in nationally (including the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico) over a 3-year period.  The Ticket Program was originally implemented in 2001 and tickets were distributed beginning in February 2002 in the following Phase 1 Ticket States: Arizona, Colorado, Delaware, Florida, Illinois, Iowa, Massachusetts, New York, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Carolina, Vermont, and Wisconsin.  This solicitation will implement the following Phase 2 Ticket States: Alaska, Arkansas, Connecticut, Georgia, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota, Tennessee, Virginia, and the District of Columbia.

Offerors will be evaluated in accordance with the Statement of Work, accompanying Response Pages, and required documentation.  It is anticipated that each contract will be for a five-year term, with one five-year option.

<DESC>NA As many as 4 firms may be selected for a development of a concept design for an innovative erosion control measures for the Gulf Shores State Park, Alabama.  After evaluation of the final designs, only one product or process may be selected for full protot ype development.  The projects are to be designed, constructed and monitored through the authority of Section 227 or WRDA 1996, National Shoreline Erosion Control Development and Demonstration Program.  The erosion control measures must as a minimum includ e a permeable groins system, and initial placement of suitable beach fill material.  The groins cannot totally block the transport of material in the littoral zone, but must allow sufficient sediment to pass through, over, or around the feature to maintain  the pre-project littoral supply to adjacent beaches.  The groin features can have no detrimental effects to down drift beaches.  The site is a highly used public recreational area, so any shore protection structures need to be unobtrusive, and cannot inte rfere with the public’s use of the beach.  The design should include methodology and estimated cost for construction and for removal of the demonstration groin features if any detrimental effects are observed. The goal of the permeable groin system is to s tabilize the shore and dune line and retain a placed beach fill volume.  NAICS Code is 541690, SIC Code is 8999, FSC Code B510.  This acquisition is unrestricted.  A pre-proposal conference/site visit is planned.  This is a commercial item acquisition.

<DESC>Required: Construction Management Services for Foley Federal Building and United States Courthouse, 300 Las Vegas Boulevard South, Las Vegas, Nevada - Solicitation Number GS-09P-02-KTC-0059, Presolicitation Notice Response Deadline: May 30, 2002 at 2:00 PM. 
Project Owner: General Services Administration, Public Buildings Service, 450 Golden Gate Avenue, 3rd Floor West, San Francisco, California 94102-3434.   Point of Contact: GSA Contracting Officer, Elisa Sanchez, Telephone (415) 522-3162, Facsimile:  (415) 522-3316; e-mail: elisa.sanchez@gsa.gov
The General Services Administration (GSA) announces its intention to renovate the Foley Federal Building and United States Courthouse and have the building ready for occupancy by September 2004.   
The Foley Federal Building and United States Courthouse is a 205,000 GSF reinforced concrete building of early 1960s vintage.   It consists of a basement, four floors, and a penthouse.   Surface parking is provided in the rear of the building.   The building will be vacated for construction.   Upon completion of construction, USBC, USMS, Probation, Trustee, HUD, and SSA will permanently occupy the building.   USBC will operate five bankruptcy courtrooms in the building.   Renovation will include asbestos abatement, lead-based paint removal, structural blast protection, protection against progressive collapse, interior space realignment, interior tenant improvements, courtroom renovation, chamber renovation, lobby renovation, functional and aesthetic enhancement of entrance and first floor lobby to improve first impression, code compliance for handicap access throughout the building, waste recycling and reuse, energy-conservation, and roof replacement.   
The selected Construction Manager (CM):
1.	Will professionally monitor, coordinate and manage the activities of the General Contractor (GC) and its subcontractors.
2.	Will systematically trace and document all project activities.
3.	Will exert all that is required to obtain an above average quality facility for the Government.
4.	Will always work within the framework of the approved project.
5.	Must possess effective management ability.
6.	Must also possess a thorough knowledge of construction technology and process, design-engineering and in-place work.
7.	Must be able and willing to proactively manage the project to successful completion.      
Tetra Design, Inc., the Architect-Engineer for the project, will finalize and issue the final Construction Documents on April 29, 2002.   GSA is advertising the position of the General Contractor (GC) for the project.   During construction, GC, AE, CM and GSA (and the tenants through GSA) will be the project team working on different aspects of the project toward a common goal.   The selected CM must, therefore, create a construction management plan that would consider achieving the project objectives through coordination among the team members.   The CM strategy must fully comply with the approved budgetary and scheduling framework of the project.   On a daily basis, the CM will interface with the GC, AE, tenants and others, and will monitor, coordinate and resolve all project issues.   On a routine basis, the CM will deal with issues related to contractor labor, site safety, work-in-place inspection, budgeting, scheduling, tenant requirement, daily reports, work related meetings and conferences, payment of contract invoices, record keeping, observation of material sampling and testing, and preparation of change order estimates.   Additionally, the CM will review, analyze and recommend solution for contractor requests-for-equitable adjustment.   When required, and primarily as a post-construction function, the CM will support the GSA Contracting Officer (CO) in handling contractor claims.
The Construction Price at Award is estimated by GSA to be in the range of $19-$21 million.   The Construction Management at Award price is estimated to be within $1.2-$1.4 million.   The negotiated figure for each category would be contingent upon level-of-effort proposed by the Offerors.   
The CM services will be in accordance with the Competitive Acquisition under the Part 15 procedures.   
Step 1 is a presolicitation notice to identify potential offerors technically qualified to perform the CM services for the Foley project.   Potential offerors are invited to attend a presubmittal conference to be held at the Foley Federal Building and Courthouse, Las Vegas, NV on May 15, 2002 at 9:00 AM.  Attendees must submit a letter of intent in response to this notice by May 10, 2002, either by FAX (415) 522-3316 or sending e-mail to elisa.sanchez@gsa.gov.   Each CM Offeror will submit a concise statement of its corporate background, resources and capabilities, past performance on similar projects, technical and managerial qualifications of the firm, and professional levels of individuals proposed for the project.   Specific names are not required during Step 1.  The offerors must submit information that allows the Government to advise offerors about their potential to be viable competitors and participate in step 2.  Each offeror will be evaluated for the quality and thoroughness of its qualification in response to this notice.  All responses will be evaluated in accordance with the criteria stated in this notice.  The Contracting Officer shall advise respondents considered not viable competitors of the general basis for that opinion.  All respondents considered to be viable competitors will be advised that they may participate in the resultant acquisitions.  
Step 2 will use the Reguest for Proposals (RFP) to communicate Government requirements to prospective contractors and to solicit proposals.  During Step 2, the viable competitors will be required to submit a fully developed Technical and Price proposals.   The RFP will thoroughly describe the Government's requirements.   The RFP will be issued to the prospective offerors by June 10, 2002.   The Government does not provide any stipend for the preparation of proposals to the Offerors.  The Offerors for this project may be a joint venture, partnership, corporation, association or any other legal entity with collective contractual responsibility to successfully perform the project.  If the offeror is an entity comprised of more than one firm, the identity and credentials of the firms will be evaluated separately and as a whole.  

Selecting a CM Offeror is not restricted to any specific geographic area.  However, at least fifty percent of the construction work must be performed within the State of Nevada.  The Construction Management Firm must have a functional office in Southern Nevada.
In response to the Presolicitation Notice, the potential offerors must submit the following by May 30, 2002 at 2:00PM:
1.	Submit a letter of intent for the advertised project.
2.	Submit summary level information for three to five projects previously performed by the Offeror resembling the advertised project.
3.	Submit description and a picture for each previous project.
4.	Submit information on building configuration, size, usage, and final cost for each previous project.
5.	Submit names, addresses and telephone numbers of the owner representatives for each previous project.
6.	Submit explanations for delays and liquidated damages for each previous project.
7.	Submit a construction organization chart explaining generic positions proposed for the advertised project.
8.	Identify minimum level of education and experience proposed for each generic position.
9.	Certify that specific individuals proposed later, would meet or exceed the minimum generic standards set in the presolicitation notice.                                  
10.	Submit a two-page maximum management plan for the advertised project;
11.	Provide proof of Offeror?s financial stability for the advertised project;
12.	Provide release forms authorizing GSA to obtain performance related information for the previously completed projects, from the owners of the projects;
Each potential offeror will be evaluated in accordance with the following criteria:   
I.	Past Performance: This parameter evaluates level of similarity between the advertised project and projects managed in the past by the Offeror.   Each project will be evaluated for quality, budget, schedule compliance and owner satisfaction.  The input for evaluation will be based on the Offeror?s response to the presolicitation notice and information obtained from the owner representatives who dealt with the Offeror on the project.   The owner representatives will be those identified by the Offeror in response to the notice.   Any comparable project indicated by the Offeror, must be at least 75% complete in order for it to be considered for this evaluation.
II.	Proposed Corporate Organization: This parameter evaluates the corporate side of the CM Offeror?s organization.  It will examine and rate the firms overall experience, track record, credentials, management philosophy and approach to projects, and managerial level qualification.   Other parameters considered would be the corporate ability to complete construction management of projects on time and within budget, current corporate workload, and projected workload coinciding with the timing of the advertised project.

III.	Proposed Construction Teams: The construction team proposed by the CM Offeror will be generic, meaning it would signify generic positions with minimum envisaged level of experience, education, length of service, geographic availability, and assignment within the Offeror?s organization chart for the project.   Specific names are not required until Step 2, to give the Offerors enough time to be short-listed and then plan and organize a certain group of individuals to the project team.      
Offerors having qualifications to meet the requirements specified herein are invited to respond and submit the specified forms and documents required by the Presolicitation Notice.  All submittals must identify with this announcement and solicitation number.  Hand deliver or mail six copies of submittals to Ms. Elisa Sanchez, General Services Administration, Property Development Division (9PCS), 3rd Floor West, 450 Golden Gate Avenue, San Francisco, California 94102-3434.  All submittals for the Presolicatation Notice are due on May 30, 2002 at 2:00 PM, Pacific Standard Time.
Upon completion of the Step 1 process, the Government will notify the prospective offerors of the Step 2 procedures including oral presentation (if any), schedules and the final selection criteria.  The RFP package will be available only to the prospective offerors.  This procurement is being made under the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program.   
Although this procurement is open to large businesses, small and minority businesses are encouraged to participate.  All interested contractors are reminded that the successful contractor will be expected to place subcontracts to the maximum practical extent with small and disadvantaged contractors as part of their original submitted teams.  Before award of the contract the Offeror (if not a small business having an average gross receipts of $4M during each of the past three fiscal years) is required to submit an acceptable Subcontracting Plan in accordance with Public Law 95-507.   
All potential offerors are invited to attend a pre-submittal conference to discuss project requirements and the selection process.  The conference will be held at the Foley Federal Building and United States Courthouse in Las Vegas, NV on May 15, 2002 at 9:00 A.M.  Although mandatory attendance is not required, potential offerors are requested to notify the Contracting Officer, Elisa Sanchez by calling (415) 522-3162 or sending e-mail to elisa.sanchez@gsa.gov, of the names of attendees by May 10, 2002.  A walk through of the project site will be held after the conference.
GSA reserves the option to cancel this solicitation at any time should funding sources and/or availability of funds fail to materialize.   This is not a request for Fee Proposal.   For more information, please contact Ms. Elisa Sanchez at (415) 522-3162.

<DESC>The U.S. Trade and Development Agency (TDA) wishes to announce an opportunity for small business to bid on a Competitive Total Set-Aside to conduct a definitional mission to analyze proposed desalination projects for Algeria and Jordan.  In Algeria, the state-owned electricity and gas utility has requested TDA assistance for the construction of a desalination plant at its 120 MW steam cycle power plant located at the Port of Algiers.  In Jordan, the Aqaba Special Economic Zone (ASEZ) has requested TDA assistance to establish a desalination plant in the Southern Industrial Zone.
The contractor will be required to travel to Algeria, spending 3 full business days, and spend 2 full business days in Jordan to review the proposed projects.  The contract must be qualified to evaluate the economic, financial and technical viability of the proposed projects. The contractor will be required to prepare a final report to TDA that consists of a full review of all potential projects, paying particular attention to the likely interest of U.S. firms in these markets, and the project's likelihood for financing and producing U.S. exports.

The estimated cost for this work does not exceed $30,000.

TDA, located in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area, promotes American private sector participation in developing and middle-income countries, with special emphasis on economic sectors that represent significant U.S. export potential. Through the funding of feasibility studies, orientation visits, specialized training grants, business workshops, and various forms of technical assistance, we help U.S. businesses compete for infrastructure projects in emerging markets.  We assist in building mutually beneficial partnerships between American companies and overseas project sponsors, which result in increased U.S. exports and jobs, and the completion of high quality, successful projects in host countries.  

The Small Business Act, at 15, U.S.C. 252, authorizes procuring agencies to aside procurements or portions of procurements for the exclusive participation of Small Businesses Concerns.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for this procurement is 541330.

Definition: ?Small business concerns? for purposes of TDA award of this total set aside contract means a concern, including its affiliates, that is independently owned and operated, not dominant in the field of operating for which it is bidding.  In determining whether dominance exists for TDA?s purpose for this contract, consideration is given to annual gross receipts.  Any concern that is annual gross receipts above $5 million dollars, averaged over a three year period, is not considered small and is therefore, NOT eligible for award under this contract.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with Hysitron, Inc., of Minneapolis, MN, for acquisition of one (1) Atomic Force Microscope (AFM) and Microindentor System, to be used in the Manufacturing Metrology Division, at NIST.*****
Installation and training at the NIST laboratory shall be included.  In addition, a one-year on-site warranty on parts and labor, with next-business-day service, shall be included.*****Sole source determination is based on the Division's need to be able to perform high accuracy instrumented indentation and atomic force microscopy with one instrument.  Hysitron is uniquely qualified to meet the Government's needs, as it is the only vendor that has developed the interface hardware necessary to perform this integration in a seamless fashion; i.e., they have demonstrated the ability to integrate the indentation technology with the AFM in a fashion that is structurally rigid enough to achieve the desired performance.  In addition, the Hysitron instrumented indentation system uses a unique capacitive sensor and electrostatic actuator technology that enables (1) varying load times from 0.1-2000 seconds; (2) measured displacement noise floor below 0.2 nm; (3) force generation and displacement measurement combined in one sensor/actuator; (4) high bandwidth force modulation (up to 300 Hz); (5) load resolution less than 1 nN; and (6) low noise floor less than 100 nN rms. The low noise floor, 2000 second stability, and high bandwidth are critical for the Manufacturing Metrology Division's force calibration experiments.  Furthermore, this proprietary technology has a small form factor that Hysitron has successfully integrated with existing atomic force microscope platforms.*****Delivery shall be FOB Destination, Gaithersburg, MD, and is required within 30 days or less after receipt of order (ARO).*****
The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334413, and the size standard is 500 Employees.*****No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations.  However, responses received by May 10, 2002, will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.*****

<RESPDATE>061702
<ARCHDATE>07172002
<CONTACT>Dale Wilkerson Contracting Officer 6626804009    ;
<DESC>The National Park Service is seeking a contractor to provide all services necessary to clean and conserve ten pieces of wood furniture for public exhibit inside the second floor of the William Johnson House in Natchez, Mississippi. The Johnson House is one unit of Natchez National Historical Park and this project is part of phased plan to conserve museum objects at the Park. Most of the objects have spent the past several decades in a non-environmentally controlled warehouse setting and have deteriorated as a result. The primary goal of the conservation of these objects is to preserve their historic, scientific, or esthetic identity, as embodied in surviving features of composition, structure, form, appearance, and workmanship. The project will consist of five separate components: 1)Packing the objects in Natchez, Mississippi, and transporting them to the conservation lab for treatment; 2)Performing an independent assessment of each object's condition and creating a detailed object treatment proposal to submit to park staff for review and approval; 3)Carrying out the treatment as proposed in the approved object treatment proposal; 4)Creating a treatment report for each object, including photographic documentation, detailing exactly what treatment was carried out; and 5)Packing the objects and delivering them back to the museum storage facility in Natchez.  All conservation treatment must be carried out in accordance with the principles and practices specified in the Code of Ethics and Standards of Practice of the American Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works.  In addition, National Park Service policy calls for a "minimal intervention" treatment strategy of doing the least possible to the object that in any way alters its significant characteristics.  Magnitude of this project is $25,000 to $50,000.  NAICS code for this project is 711510.  Procurement is being conducted as a Request for Proposals under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures of FAR Part 13.  The government will use a tradeoff approach in selecting a contractor to perform this project, with price being approximately equal to all other selection factors combined. The Request for Proposals will require contractors to provide information on the following selection factors as a part of their proposal: 1)Resumes that indicate education and experience in conservation treatment and references; 2)A description of the approach to the general treatment process for each object type; 3)Evidence of past experience in comparable types of treatment work (e.g., sample treatment reports/photographs); 4)Information indicating the technical capacity to accomplish the work required and ability to meet required dates of completion; and 5)Information describing proposed method of transportation of objects, security of facility where work will be accomplished, and proper insurance coverage. Solicitation package will be available on or about May 17, 2002. This solicitation will be issued electronically on the Department of Interior's National Business Center (NBC) web site at http://ideasec.nbc.gov and offerors desiring to conduct business with DOI are requested to register at the web site.  Documents will be available in Microsoft Word, HTML and Adobe PDF formats.  Paper copies of this solicitation will be made available upon request.

<DESC>The Defense Distribution Depot San Joaquin, California plans to offer the privatization of utility systems (electric, natural gas, water and wastewater) at Tracy and Sharpe Sites, California.  Privatization is defined as the transfer of ownership and responsibility for the operation, maintenance, repair, future upgrades and future utility system replacements.   The conveyance of the utility distribution systems is authorized and conducted under 10 USC 2688.  It imposes certain economic tests that must be met prior to award of a contract(s).   The resulting contract(s), if awarded, will require the Contractor(s) to furnish all necessary labor, management, supervision, permits, equipment, supplies, materials, transportation and any other incidental services for the complete ownership, operation, maintenance, repair, upgrades and improvements to these utility systems.  The Contractor(s) will be required to manage, control and perform its operations, maintenance, repairs, replacements and incidentals of its utility system(s) to provide firm, reliable and dependable utility service to each Government or tenant connection within the service area 24 hours each and every day.  The utility systems will be conveyed by way of a Bill of Sale upon award of contract(s) and real property interests will be conveyed in the form of Easements.  The Contractor(s) proposal and plans may become a part of the contract upon decision to award.  The Government anticipates awarding a Fixed-Price with Prospective Price Redetermination Utility Services Contract(s) for a term of 25 years to the Best Value offeror(s). The ability to award individual systems to individual firms will exist.    This requirement is unrestricted.  All responsible sources may submit an offer  which will be considered.  To be eligible for contract award, a firm must be registered in the DOD Central Contractor Registration (CCR).  You may register via the Internet at http://www.ccr2000.com.   Large businesses are required to submit a subcontracting plan which meets the requirements of FAR 52.219-9.  The request for proposal will be available on or about 20 September 2001 by downloading from the FedBizOpps Internet site-no paper copies or CD's will be provided.  Interested parties are required to self-register their firm or office on the website.  It is the proposer's responsibility to check the website for amendments and other information related to the request for proposal.  Proposals shall be submitted by mail or hand carried in accordance with the time, date and location specified in Block 9 of the SF33.   Questions on the RFP shall be submitted electronically to Beverly Lanier at the email address listed below.

<DESC>The Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) plans on awarding multiple indefinite-delivery indefinite-quantity (IDIQ) contracts for architectural/engineering (A&E) support services in the areas of passenger rail programs and high-speed rail programs.  FRA has broad authorities and responsibilities delegated by Congress to oversee, support, and regulate all forms of rail operations, to include undertaking numerous activities in support of passenger rail programs and high-speed rail developments.  These activities may range from feasibility studies and environmental assessments to monitoring construction projects receiving public funding.  Task orders may be awarded, on an as-needed basis, to provide engineering and other professional services to assist FRA in developing standard methodologies and requirements to evaluate passenger rail programs and high-speed rail projects, conducting technical and/or programmatic and financial evaluations of existing or proposed passenger rail and high-speed rail operations and/or improvements, conducting review and oversight of the implementation of specific passenger rail or high-speed rail improvements, and evaluating the feasibility of developing passenger rail and high-speed rail in various corridors.  Task orders may also be issued to prepare various supporting documentation for passenger rail and high-speed rail to include such items as financial analyses, project or program management assessments, railroad master plans, environmental impact statements/assessments, or schedules and budgets to accomplish a series of projects sponsored by Federal, state, or local governments, Amtrak, freight operators, commuter agencies, or similar entities.  Interested firms must demonstrate professional qualifications in the following disciplines:  civil, signal, electric traction, railroad, structural, electrical and mechanical engineering; ridership demand; environmental analysis; financial and economic analysis; project management; program administration; construction cost estimating and accounting; architecture; and transportation and urban planning.  Effort is expected to be performed in two separate areas of consideration.  These areas of consideration include the Eastern Region and the Western Region.  The Eastern Region is defined to include the following states and geographic regions:  Alabama, Connecticut, District of Columbia, Delaware, Eastern Canada, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Mississippi, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Vermont, Virginia, West Virginia, and Wisconsin.  The Western Region is defined to include the following states and geographic regions:  all U.S. states not listed in the Eastern Region definition, Western Canada, and Mexico.  Any taskings defined as national in scope would be performed by the Eastern region contractor(s).  If a contractor is found to have a conflict of interest involving a project in his region, the FRA may authorize the contractor(s) from the other region to perform the necessary work.

This requirement is being announced on an unrestricted basis.  FRA anticipates award of a primary contract for each of the two regions specified above, but reserves its right to make multiple awards to ensure contractor support in the event of a rare conflict of interest situation that might affect both primary contract awardees.  Each primary contract to be awarded will be for a base period of one year and four one-year option periods.  The estimated ceiling of each primary contract is $15 million over the five-year period of the contract.  Task orders are expected to be issued on a firm-fixed-price, time-and-materials, or a cost-plus-fixed-fee basis.  Interested firms must submit four (4) copies of completed SF 254 and SF 255 forms by May 31, 2002.  Selections are to be made in a two-phase process.  The first phase shall be evaluations of the SF 254's and SF 255's.  Those firms short-listed from the initial evaluations will then be invited for oral presentations at FRA Headquarters, 1120 Vermont Ave., NW, Washington, DC.  Short-listed firms will be given a number of hypothetical tasks and asked to give an oral presentation describing how the firm would perform these tasks.  Short-listed firms will be provided additional instructions after the initial rankings to explain the expectations and limitations of the oral presentation phase.  The oral presentations are expected to be held on or about July 29-August 2, 2002.  Evaluation criteria for both phases in descending order of importance include:  (1) professional qualifications necessary for satisfactory performance of work in the areas of railroad operations and engineering; architecture; transportation and urban planning; environmental documentation; and ridership demand and revenue analysis; (2) specialized experience and technical competence in the areas of railroad operations and engineering; architecture; transportation and urban planning; environmental documentation; and ridership demand and revenue analysis; (3) capacity to perform multiple tasks and complete the work in the required time, while potentially sustaining loss of key personnel; (4) past performance on contracts with Government agencies and private industry in terms of cost control, quality of work, and compliance with performance schedules; (5) location in the general geographical area of the project and knowledge of the locality of the project; (6) demonstrated success in prescribing the use of recovered materials and achieving waste reduction and energy efficiency in any facility designs; (7) project office located within a total trip time of two hours from FRA Headquarters; and (8) for large business firms, a subcontracting plan is required in accordance with FAR requirements to be submitted with the SF 254's and SF 255's.  An NAICS of either 541330 or 541310 applies; therefore, the small business size standard is $4.0 million.  The anticipated award dates may be impacted by the period of performance and/or cost ceilings in the current FRA A&E IDIQ contracts.  These contracts have a period of performance expiration date of February 28, 2003; however, cost ceilings are expected to reach maximum levels by the end of this fiscal year (September 30, 2002), necessitating award of new contracts by the beginning of October 2002.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

SUBJECT:  REQUEST FOR INFORMATION -- SCREENING AND MONITIORING EQUIPMENT FOR THE DETECTION OF BIOHAZARDS IN NAVAL POSTAL OPERATIONS IN WASHINGTON, D.C.

RFI #:  N00600-02-I-1656

DUE:	May 31, 2002

POC:  Steven Clark, Contract Specialist

DESC:   This Request for Information (RFI) is issued by the Department of the Navy's Fleet Industrial Supply Center (FISC) Norfolk, Detachment Washington, to solicit information from potential sources of industry on alternative approaches that will assist the FISC Washington Postal Operations Division (POSTOPSDIV) in formulating a smarter, better, and more cost effective method to meet the following requirements in the screening, testing, and monitoring of incoming mail for potential biohazard threats.  

*This RFI is for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a request for proposal (RFP) or as an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any products or services.  Additionally, the Government may utilize any information submitted by interested parties to assist in developing a statement of work and/or statement of objectives that could potentially result in a competitive solicitation.  We advise offerors not to submit any information that they would not want to be used for this purpose.*  

FISC Detachment Washington is formulating requirements for the development of a Statement of Objectives to acquire (by purchase or lease) equipment and/or services that will continuously screen, test, and monitor mail and related packages to provide a high level of confidence against a wide variety of pathogens and biohazard threats.

Background and Current Mail Evaluation Procedure

Before September 11th, mail, packages and other materials were delivered to the Navy's consolidated mail facility, in Washington, D.C., with no screening for pathogen/chemical toxins.  Because of the recent mail-borne biohazard attacks, Naval addressees, visitors, and other personnel receiving or handling mail could be unknowingly subjected to hazardous pathogens/chemical toxins from materials introduced into the mail distribution system.  Much of the Naval District Washington (NDW) mail comes from the United States Postal Service (USPS) Post Offices that have received and dispatched mail contaminated with biological hazards (i.e., Anthrax). New procedures have been implemented for receipt, screening, testing, and distribution of mail. Mail for all NDW facilities is now only being received at the main postal facility at the Anacostia Annex (Bldg. 94), in Washington, D.C.  All incoming mail is x-rayed and tested for the presence of biological toxins (Anthrax) before sorting and distribution.  A temporary Mail Evaluation Facility (MEF) has been erected next to the FISC postal facility at Building 94 at the Anacostia Annex to screen and analyze mail for hazardous pathogens/chemical toxins.  The MEF contains a x-ray machine, a paint spray booth Evaluation Chamber (EC) for air sampling, and a conveyor belt to agitate the mail within the sampling area.  Air and surface samples taken from mail lots are analyzed using a R.A.P.I.D. analyzer, manufactured by Idaho Technology, which is government owned equipment.  The use of the R.A.P.I.D equipment does not have to be part of any proposed solution under this RFI.  Contractor personnel who process the mail within the MEF are currently clothed in full biohazard suits.  However, we are interested in solutions that may not require this level of PPE.  The current screening process is a passive testing regime.  It is a 2-hour process that involves a 30-minute test of samples by the PCR method to verify that no biohazards are present. 

Incoming mail from off-base locations is usually delivered to the POSTOPSDIV during the morning hours and it is delivered from several different trucks and locations.  As the mail is deliveredit is segregated from postal trucks into batches of All-Purpose Containers (APC) for evaluation at the MEF before entering the mail facility in Building 94.  Each batch of APC is evaluated and cleared before the next batch being received and evaluated.  Operations to date have averaged about 19,000 pieces of mail per day with peak daily loads of 38,000 pieces per day, and we are estimating that the daily average could grow to 25,000 per day based on expanding this process to other local commands.  Mail consists of standard letters, flats, magazines, and packages. 

Requirement

The FISC Washington POSTOPSDIV is interested in determining alternatives to its current mail screening, testing, and evaluation process.  This division is seeking information from industry to screen, test, and evaluate incoming mail faster, more reliably, and more cost effectively.   This RFI seeks solutions that will detect, in more real-time, the presence of bio-contaminant threats as the mail passes through a screening process.  If a chemical or biological contaminant is detected, the system should have the capability to immediately stop the flow of mail through the screening process and isolate the suspect mail for further evaluation and proper emergency HAZMAT response.    Either purchasing or leasing such monitoring equipment could satisfy this requirement. This RFI also requests that respondents consider and describe the manning and estimated costs associated with the full-time operation and maintenance (O&M) of any proposed screening equipment/process in the existing MEF.  This RFI is seeking solutions to address and satisfy the mail evaluation procedure described herein.   Respondents should also state whether any PPE is recommended for operators using the proposed solution. While Anthrax is the specific biohazard we are currently concentrating on, the POSTOPSDIV is interested in learning of commercially available equipment/protocols/services that could be set up to test and evaluate a variety of pathogens and other potential biohazards that could be delivered via the mail system. Samples may also be collected during the process to ensure that the mail is not contaminated with pathogens or biohazards, specifically Anthrax, but the POSTOPSDIV is interested in screening/testing solutions that would identify a wide variety of pathogens.  Respondents should describe their process, detailing the staffing and procedures to be utilized in accomplishing the requirements of this section.  These plans must identify the pathogens it can reliably detect and provide documented evidence of the confidence levels of the testing regime.  The Government is interested in understanding what additional supplies are necessary for conducting the screening and analysis during the operation of the proposed mail screening.  Responses to this RFI should include estimated prices for purchase, lease, installation, and operation & maintenance of any proposed solution.

Potential Available Government Equipment

? Mail Evaluation Facility structure
? One (1) X-ray machine
? One (1) R.A.P.I.D. analyzer unit for sample analysis

The Government prefers that no proprietary or confidential business data be submitted in response to this RFI.  All information in response to this RFI, questions/concerns, data packages, suggestions, etc. . . , and requests to be informed of the status of any possible solicitation resulting from this RFI shall be sent, via e-mail to the Attn: Steven Clark, contract specialist @ steven_t_clark@fmso.navy.mil, or by  fax: 202-433-5414 (phone: 202-433-6135).  We would prefer any attachments you use to be in Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, and/or Microsoft Power Point.   Also, hard copies of your responses to this RFI can be submitted to: Fleet Industrial Supply Center Norfolk, Detachment Washington, Attn: Steven Clark, 1014 N Street, SE, Suite 400, Washington Navy Yard, D.C. 20374-5014.  Responses should be received here no later than May 31, 2002.  Responses should include the name and telephone number of a point of contact having authority and knowledge to discuss responses with government representatives.  All correspondence concerning this RFI should reference and refer to RFI No. N00600-02-I-1656.

Lastly, we strongly encourage contractors to use the information provided herein as reference information.  We are looking for innovative ways to fulfill this requirement in a more cost effective and efficient manner.  A contractor may have an idea that does not fit into the framework of our current way of doing business, but it may open our eyes to a totally new and more effective way to do business.  Contractors are encouraged not to feel confined by the current way the Navy is doing business, but to suggest any and all ideas they have that can add value to the way the navy handles this part of its overall mission.  We are looking very forward to your ideas and feedback.

SOLICITATION NUMBER TDA 02-Q048

Expanded Definitional Mission for Desalination Projects in Algeria and Jordan

The U.S. Trade and Development Agency (TDA) wishes to announce an opportunity for small business to bid on a Competitive Total Set-Aside to conduct a definitional mission to analyze areas of potential TDA support in the port sectors in Jordan and Tunisia.  In Tunisia, two major priorities for Office de la Marine Marchande et des Ports (OMMP) concern the establishment of a cruise terminal complex at La Goulette and the development of vessel traffic management systems for the ports of Birzerte, Sfax, and Gabes.  In Jordan, Aqaba Special Economic Zone (ASEZ) has requested feasibility study assistance for the port relocation as well as desalination plant for the future.

Due to the lack of English language capability on the part of the Tunisian project sponsor, the selected consultant will be required to have working-level proficiency in French.  The contractor will be required to travel to Tunisia and Jordan to review the proposed projects.  The DM consultant will spend one week researching the Tunisian and Jordanian port sectors, as well as additional project information that may be identified.  Upon approval by TDA, the consultant will then travel to Tunisia and Jordan, spending at least four (4) full business days in Tunisia and two (2) full business days in Jordan.  The contract must be qualified to evaluate the economic, financial and technical viability of the proposed projects. The contractor will be required to prepare a final report to TDA that consists of a full review of all potential projects, paying particular attention to the likely interest of U.S. firms in these markets, and the project's likelihood for financing and producing U.S. exports.

The estimated cost for this work does not exceed $30,000.

TDA, located in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area, promotes American private sector participation in developing and middle-income countries, with special emphasis on economic sectors that represent significant U.S. export potential. Through the funding of feasibility studies, orientation visits, specialized training grants, business workshops, and various forms of technical assistance, we help U.S. businesses compete for infrastructure projects in emerging markets.  We assist in building mutually beneficial partnerships between American companies and overseas project sponsors, which result in increased U.S. exports and jobs, and the completion of high quality, successful projects in host countries.  

The Small Business Act, at 15, U.S.C. 252, authorizes procuring agencies to aside procurements or portions of procurements for the exclusive participation of Small Businesses Concerns.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for this procurement is 541330.

Definition: ?Small business concerns? for purposes of TDA award of this total set aside contract means a concern, including its affiliates, that is independently owned and operated, not dominant in the field of operating for which it is bidding.  In determining whether dominance exists for TDA?s purpose for this contract, consideration is given to annual gross receipts.  Any concern that is annual gross receipts above $5 million dollars, averaged over a three year period, is not considered small and is therefore, NOT eligible for award under this contract.

All participating organizations involved with supplying professional services must be incorporated or chartered in the United States.  Consultants planning teaming arrangements must be U.S. citizens or resident aliens.  In accordance with FAR 19.301, offerors will be required to submit self-certification relating to business size.  The competitive proposals method of solicitation as set forth in Part 15 of the FederalAcquisition Regulation (FAR) (48 CFR Chapter 1) shall be utilized for this procurement.  This solicitation in no way obligates TDA to award a contract, nor does it commit TDA to pay any cost incurred in the preparation and submission of the proposal.  Any explanation desired by an offeror regarding the meaning or interpretation of this solicitation must be requested in writing and with sufficient time allowed for reply to reach the offerors before submission of their offerors.  All oral explanations or instruction, given before award of this contract will not be binding.  Any information given to a prospective offeror concerning the solicitation will be furnished promptly to all prospective offerors as an amendment of the solicitation, if such information is necessary to offerors submitting proposals or if lack of such information would be prejudicial to uninformed offerors.

The contractor must be in the position to present fair and unbiased information pursuant to the statement of work. 

The Request for Proposal (RFP) will be issued on/about (15) fifteen days after the publication date of this synopsis.  Because of the urgency of this request, the closing date for receipt of proposals will be twenty-one (21) days thereafter.  Only written requests for the RFP that indicate the company?s size will be honored.  U.S. eligible small businesses interested in receiving the RFP should preferably send an email to contract@tda.gov. Requests by fax requesting it may be sent to Della Glenn at (703) 875-4009 or a letter by U.S. mail to the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (TDA), Contracts Office, Room 200, 1621 N. Kent Street, Arlington, VA. 22209-2131.  Telephone requests will not be honored.

A portion of existing Building 8, including an old plating shop, an engine paint shop, a mailroom & blank forms building, plus the existing engine disassembly, depreservation & container repair shops, and nearby miscellaneous structures (storage sheds, concrete pads etc.) will be demolished. A new engine depreservation area, engine disassembly and cleaning facility will be constructed within the footprint of the old plating shop and the existing engine disassembly shop. The existing functions of engine depreservation and engine disassembly will have to be relocated into a nearby area in the existing Building 8 to allow the construction of the new facility.  The new facility will be attached to Building 8. Flow of materials including engines, engine parts and other power train parts must be efficient and automated to the maximum extent possible utilizing a combination of conveyors and overhead monorails to minimize labor required.

There will be 180 days for the option to be exercised.  Except when it is determined in accordance with FAR 17.206(b) not to be in the government?s best interest, the government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement.

<DESC>Request for Proposal F23606-02-R-0004, Architectural and Engineering Requirements, 
questions and responses concerning the request for proposal are as follows:

The page limit has been changed from 50 to 100. 

Question #1:  Paragraph A and B:  MIS technician ? this term means different things to different people.  Please elaborate on this requirement.  

Response:  The MIS technician refers to a Management Information System (digital communications) Technician.

Question #2:  Paragraph A:  What is the ?price proposal? referenced at the end of this paragraph for?  Will this be a fee proposal for a specific project?

Response:  The ?price proposal? is the bid line items that the selected top three A-E firms will be proposing prices on (i.e. all of the individual disciplines, travel and reproduction costs).

Question #3:  Paragraph B:  Selection Criterion #5.  Please explain ? I don?t understand the sentence.

Response:  ?History dollar value and magnitude of requirements performed?  refers to both the dollar amount of the projects and diversity/complexity of your projects performed.

Question #4:  Paragraph C reference the SF 254.  I assume you require an SF 254 for each sub-consultant as well as for the prime.  This ?eats? deeply into the 50 page limit at about 5 pages for each SF 254.

Response:  An SF 254 will be required for each sub-consultant.  We will allow the 50 page requirement to be adjusted to a total of 100 pages.

Question #5:  Paragraph C (50 page limit).  Does a sheet of paper with printing on both sides count as 1 page or 2? We include a table of contents for the convenience of their review agency, I assume this is counted as a page.  Are divider sheets (tables) with the submittal counted as pages?  Comment:  Considering the number of subconsultants anticipated (such as environmental, surveying, etc.) and the subcontracting goals and the usual 5 pages per SF 254, the 50 page limit is real tight.

Response:  A sheet of paper with printing on both sides count as 2 pages.  A table of contents is included as a page in the 100 page limit.  Dividers will not be counted as a page.

Question #6:  Paragraph C (Block 8, Relevant Projects):  Although the standard Block 8 form shows the 10 relevant projects on one page, just about every agency allows (and prefers) one per page (see attached example).  This facilitates a meaningful description of each project.  Please comment.  The 50 pages limit may make this impossible.  Most agencies allow 10 projects for each firm making up the team.  Do you?

Response:   We normally do get one project per page.  We only ask for 5 projects so you will have to make the determination of how to show appropriate projects yet stay within the 100 page limit.

Question #7:  Paragraph C (?Contractors shall state of their SF 254 and SF 255s all businesses, Federal, State, or Local government agencies for whom the contractor has been awarded a contract during the past three years.?):  This sounds like you want a list of our federal, state and local government clients over the last three years - presumable in Block 10. Is this correct?  Do you also require this for each subconsultant?

Response:  Yes.

Question #8:  Paragraph C (List at least five designs ? etc.) is this list to be part of Block 8, or a separate list in Block 10?

Response:  This should be a part of block 8.

<DESC>The General Services Administration, Federal Technology Service, Region 8, Denver and its client, the United States Air Force, SMC DET 11/MTLS, Peterson AFB, Colorado intend to procure on a Sole Source basis from Industrial Power Systems, Inc., 3233 Oakland St, Aurora, CO 80010, 1-800-678-3673 the following portion of a required Information Technology Solution: Product: Six (6) 3-Phase Diesel Power Generators, specifically modified for the Air Force prototype application; Purpose: Industrial Power Systems has previously supplied the same modified generator in use with the Air Force project/operations. IPS designed the required generators. The units are highly factory modified custom generators to meet the extremely tight space requirements to re-power the first of 11-mobile trailers with existing generators that have exceeded their useful life. The basic units start with six (6) pairs of new Kohler Model 60-REOZJ diesel fuel generator sets. Each pair of generators shall be designated as IM60REOZJ USAF set T which consists of one IM60REOZJ USAF set C in a curbside oriented configuration and one IM60REOZJ USAF set S which is a street side oriented configuration as modified, tested, warranted, and delivered by Industrial Power Systems, Inc. of Aurora CO during prototype development.  Equivalent products will not be considered unless meeting all specifications contained herein, and defined as part of the AN/MSQ-118 PGU-R design Mobile Ground Terminal Power Generation Unit- Replacement Technical Data Package as it pertains to this procurement. 
These units after modification are rated at 55kW, 68.75-kVA prime power when operating at 120/208V, .8 power factor. The generator set shall be capable of this rating while operating in an ambient condition of 77? F (59.2?C) and 600 feet above sea level. The generator set shall be capable of starting motor loads of 125 KVA inrush, with a maximum voltage dip of 35%. Vibration isolators shall be provided between the engine-generator and heavy duty steal base. Units are factory and field modified as follows: (1) Oversized Kohler model 4S9 generator installed equipped with a solid state, volts-per-hertz regulator capable of 0.25% voltage regulation from no load to full load; (2) Standard coiling system is deleted to shorten the overall length
and further modified to interface with the existing horizontal core, vertical discharge radiators; (3) High oil temperature sensing device is installed; (4) Fuel pressure gauge is installed; (5) 200-Amp 3-phase line circuit breaker w/24V shunt trip is installed. One unit must face left and one face right; (6) Kohler DEC-340 solid-state controller is installed. One unit must face left and one face right; (7) overall length is reduced by shortening the front end of the generator skid; (8) Overall length is reduced by shortening the rear end of the generator skid (final length must not exceed 72-inches); (9) Generators will be setting side by side and must be arranged so that only center aisle access is available for service, requiring additional modifications as follows: (a) remote mount the oil filters, (b) remote mount the fuel filters, (c) install remote oil drain extension, one on left, one on right, (d) mount one jacket water heater on left side and one on right, (e) mount one starter on the opposite side, (f) move one oil dipstick to the opposite side; (10) Generators must operate continuously in parallel while load sharing from 0% load to full load; (11) Generators must interface properly with a custom designed duel generator paralleling switch gear designed for the application; (12)  Prototype units will prove the capability of field retrofitting these model units with new state of the art generators to extend the useful life of these mobile trailer units.  (13) Warranty service shall be provided for no less than five (5) years, including any and all modifications as specified herein. Impact: The government has fully researched other options and has found Industrial Power to be the only provider with key knowledge and expertise for the development and modification of the generators.  Not using this source can be detrimental to the completion of the mission and hinder the development of all systems involved in the Air Force effort. Concerns having the ability to furnish the above supplies are requested to give written notification (including telephone number for a point of contact) to the acquiring office listed in this notice within 15-calendar days from the date of this synopsis. THIS IS NOT A FORMAL SOLICITATION. Companies should clearly show their ability to furnish the supplies without compromising the quality, accuracy and reliability of this requirement. Companies should furnish detailed data concerning their capabilities at no cost or obligation to the Government.

<DESC>The National Telecommunications & Information Administration (NTIA) has a requirement for the development of multiple software measurement modules and script language capabilities for 4th generation radio spectrum measurement system per the following Statement of Work:  
For over twenty five years, the U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC) Radio Spectrum Measurement System (RSMS) program has kept track of radio spectrum usage and resolved interference problems involving Government radio systems in the United States. The RSMS is a state-of-the-art spectrum measurement and analysis capability that incorporates automated, semi-automated, and manual techniques for the measurement and analysis of radio emissions from the following types of transmitters:  high-power radars; mobile radios and associated base stations; navigation beacons and transponders; point-to-point  microwave links; earth station transmitters; and low power device emissions, such as those generated by FCC Part 15, FCC Part 18, and Industrial, Scientific, and Medical (ISM) units. The RSMS is currently in its third generation of design and operation by NTIA's Institute for Telecommunication Sciences (ITS) in Boulder, CO.  Although the RSMS-3rd generation system is a powerful measurement tool, its status as a state-of-the-art spectrum measurement system is threatened by rapid advances in radio technology. Therefore, a fourth-generation upgrade has been proposed and approved: RSMS-4. New broadband measurement and calibration capabilities are needed to assess the effects of emerging technologies such as time-domain-based ultrawideband (UWB) and spread-spectrum systems. Other capabilities needed include signal identification, direction-finding, operation at higher frequencies, and remote control. Challenges that await in the near future include measurements of adaptive systems that can very rapidly change their channel usage, modulation bandwidths, or antenna pattern.  Fourth generation RSMS upgrade is divided into three areas of development: Hardware, Software, and Vehicle; of those three, software development consists of designing and implementing code for equipment control, data acquisition, and data analysis.  The software is being developed for a Windows 2000 operating system using an object oriented approach to programming in Visual Basic 6.0.  Specifics of the software requirements are posted at the ITS web site:   http://www.its.bldrdoc.gov/home/programs/rsms-4/
The current need is for outside contract help to generate specific measurement code modules that will integrate with existing code or code simultaneously being developed by ITS staff.  There are two primary areas of development as described below:
TASKS:
1. The contractor will develop, using object-oriented techniques, multiple measurement software modules for the RSMS-4G software.
   A. Measurement class modules will consist of the following:
      1. Stepped measurements for pulsed and non-pulsed emitters 
      2. Swept/Swept M3 measurements for pulsed and non-pulsed emitters  
      3. Measurements to build distributions (e.g. amplitude probability distributions)
      4. Magnitude calibration
   B. The individual measurements (except calibration) are described in the Functional Measurement Requirements posted on the RSMS-4G web site: http://www.its.bldrdoc.gov/home/programs/rsms-4/
   C.  Magnitude calibrations consist of procedures for automatic diode calibrations.
   D. Measurement class objects will communicate with other class objects developed by ITS team members in the following manner:
    1. Other modules will request the execution by the specified         measurement module and will designate the necessary parameters.
    2. The measurement modules will in-turn issue the appropriate generic control commands via an instrument virtual panels or instrument interface class.
    3. Data will be sent to the appropriate file output module for storage
    4. The contractor will, inaddition, give feedback to ITS staff in order to fine tune the software architectural layout pertinent to the measurement modules.
2.  The contractor will develop a built-in script language capability that implements compiled modules of the RSMS-4G software for execution of custom tailored measurement algorithms.
    A.  The purpose is to provide the user with a user-friendly language that has direct access to internal software system components.  This will allow for development and prototyping of new software capabilities without the need for re-compiling.
    B.  The contractor will provide input to the software architectural design so that the script language capability can be fully integrated with the software package.
REQUIRED KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS:
1. Intimate knowledge of techniques for performing measurements as described in the Function Measurement Requirements (see website address above).
2. Strong working knowledge of RF systems, spectrum analyzers, and digital scopes.
3.  Working knowledge of object oriented programming using Visual Basic 6.0.
4.  Work knowledge of Unified Modeling Language (UML)
5. Intimate knowledge of Script Language development and the ability to integrate it with measurement software.
6. Strong understanding of the principles of analog and digital signal processing.
7.  Strong aptitude for statistical analysis. 
Technical merit as well as price will be used to evaluate offers.  As the technical merit becomes more equal, price becomes a greater factor.  Procurements under Simplified Acquisition Procedures ($25,000-$100,000) are set-aside for small business unless small business cannot meet the need at a reasonable price. Terms and Conditions and agency level protests can be found on web site http:\\netsite.esa.gov/oam/conops/#REFERENCE.  Hard copy in full text available from office address and phone number listed in notice.  All technical questions shall be addressed to Randy Hoffman of NTIA at (303) 497-3582.  Bid responses are due by May 17, 2002.

<DESC>DESC: New sources sought: During the calendar quarter ending
  MAR 2002, the Defense Information Technology Contracting
  Organization-Pacific (DITCO-PAC) contracted with suppliers
  of communication services (generally common commercial carriers)
  on behalf of Department and Agencies within the Department
  of Defense, the Federal Aviation Administration and various
  other Government agencies for lease of communication services
  and equipment at locations within the State of Hawaii and within
  the Pacific area. The service requirements include a wide spectrum
  of communication services, ranging from narrow band (voice
  grade) to wide band (56kbps and greater), voice and data, switch
  and dedicated services, and equipment. These leased services
  are generally point-to-point dedicated private line communication
  with two (2) service terminals located on military or other
  Government property. To the maximum extent possible, DITCO
  leases all components of each individual telecommunications
  service requirement (including transmission facilities and
  customer premise equipment) from a single source. During the
  past quarter approximately 11 services were awarded. The average
  monthly recurring charge per award was $818.00.  Based on
  an average life of 60 months the average life cycle cost of
  each award was $49,080.00.  DITCO-PAC desires to expand its  
  current list of available sources having the experience and 
  resources necessary to successfully compete for and perform under 
  new contracts for delivery of these types of services. If your  
  company is interested in competing for DISA-DITCO awarded contracts,

<DESC>Request for Proposal

Background

The Administration has made the decision to supply 1,000 copies of the Afghan legal codes in local languages and 200 copies of the Afghan legal codes in English on an urgent basis to support the Afghan Interim Administration (AIA).  The requirement is to duplicate the codes and deliver to Kabul in time for the Loya Jirga (the traditional Afghan consultative mechanism that loosely approximates a parliament), which convenes June 10, 2002.  The purpose is to support the existing AIA as well as give the new Transitional Administration chosen by the Loya Jirga process complete set of laws to work from as they move forward to rebuild Afghanistan.  After more than 20 years of conflict, few, if any complete copies of the Afghan legal codes exist in Afghanistan.  A first step in beginning the process of reestablishing the rule of law will be having a complete set of codes for the Ministries in the AIA, the 32 Afghan provinces, and the courts of Kabul.

Scope of Work

This statement of work will require both services and product.

1. Compile Documents for Camera-Ready Duplication

Collect all of the Afghan legal codes and put all of them in a camera-ready form.  Work with Afghan legal experts to ensure codes are the correct and most widely accepted set of codes and ensure the codes are presented in the volumes in the correct order.  Compile as complete as possible the Afghan penal, criminal procedure, civil, and commercial codes in Pashtu, Dari and English and produce a clean, camera-ready version of the codes.

2. Duplicate, Bind and Cover Documents in Volumes

Duplicate one thousand copies of the above codes in Pashtu and Dari numbering almost 1,200 pages reproduced from a clean, camera-ready version of the codes.  The 1,200 pages should be divided into 4 volumes in each language for ease of use, be covered by paperback.  Two hundred copies of the English version are required and should be printed in one volume, unless size requires it be printed in two volumes, bound and covered by paperback. 

3. Deliver Codes to Kabul, Afghanistan

Coordinate printing, pick-up from place of printing and delivery in Kabul.  Secure the AIA?s agreement to deliver and endorse the use of this particular set of codes.  Transport volumes securely from place of printing to Kabul.  Work with the AIA to coordinate secure storage for the codes.  Work with the US Embassy and the AIA to encourage timely delivery of codes throughout Afghanistan by the AIA.  Also, ensure that the US Embassy, Afghan Ministry of Justice and other AIA officials reap positive public relations benefits from US donation of the codes.  The contractor will need an interpreter, airfare to Afghanistan, transportation and administrative support.  

4.  Technical Proposal

The technical proposal shall completely describe how the contractor will accomplish the work, including, but not limited to:

?	Round-trip travel and related visas or other travel documents, hotel accommodations for its personnel.
?	Compiling camera-ready version of most-widely accepted version of Afghan penal, criminal procedure, civil and commercial codes.
?	Printing, duplicating and coordinating the receipt of the finished product (1,200 copies of the codes).
?	Ensuring the US Embassy and AIA are dully credited with the provision of the codes.
?	Transporting of the finished product to the Afghanistan MOJ storage facility NLT 6/10/02.

5.  Cost Proposal

Cost information shall include information by cost element (i.e., salaries and benefits by each proposed staff person; direct costs such as travel (air fare, perdiem, miscellaneous travel costs), equipment, supplies, contractual, other and indirect costs).  Please indicate if indirect rates are DCAA or other Federal agency approved or proposed rates and provide a copy of the current rate agreement.  If proposed rates, please indicate the basis which these rates were established.  Provide the same level of information regarding sub-contract costs or other rationale for making sub-contract award(s).
It is the Department?s policy that acquisitions for services, including construction but excluding personal service contracts, which require contractor personnel to perform work outside of the United States, must include the contractual obligation for coverage under the Defense Base Act (42 U.S.C. Sections 1651 ? 1654, as amended). "Contractor personnel" for this requirement only, includes individuals who are United States citizens or residents, or individuals hired in the United States or its possessions. The current Defense Base Act Insurance rates, the contract number and provider is as follows: 
Contract number: S-LMAQM-99-D-0163
Contractor: Mr. Richard David, (215)761-1482
Ace International
1601 Chestnut Street ? TLP 18
Philadelphia, PA 19192   Rates 9/17/1999 ? 9/16/2001:
Services: $4.50 per $100 of employee compensation

6.  Evaluation Criteria

The following factors shall be used to evaluate technical proposals:

?	Knowledge and experience with Afghan legal issues and justice system.
?	Experience and demonstrated ability to ensure timely compilation, duplication and deliver of the copies of Afghan legal codes to Kabul.

The Government will award a Purchase Order to the offeror whose offer represents the best value to the Government on the basis of technical merit and cost.
