<DESC>The U.S. AGENCY FOR INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT (USAID) in Kampala, Uganda will issue a request for proposals (RFP) to implement aspects of Strategic Objective 7, Expanded Sustainable Economic Opportunities for Rural Sector Growth. This is one of three strategic objectives which compose the USAID/Uganda Integrated Strategic Plan (ISP) for the years 2002-2007. The ISP and annexes may be downloaded in three files from http://www.dec.org/pdf_docs/PDABT976.pdf , http://www.dec.org/pdf_docs/PDABT977.pdf , and http://ww.dec.org/pdf_docs/PDABT978.pdf . A thorough understanding of the USAID/Uganda ISP and the Government of Uganda Poverty Eradication Action Plan (http://www.finance.go.ug/documents.html) should prove very useful to offerors in preparing responsive proposals, once the RFP is issued. The solicitation will seek proposals to design and implement the Agricultural Productivity Enhancement Program (APEP) through a cost reimbursement contract for a period of five years, including the initial design phase. This activity will build on the successful approaches and results of current activities and those nearing completion, which were begun in the period prior to the new ISP. The primary objective of APEP will be to expand economic opportunities in the Ugandan agricultural sector by increasing agricultural productivity and marketing of key food and cash crop systems.  While building on past successes, the new program will place greater emphasis on creating economies of scale that will catalyze the transformation of Ugandan agriculture from low input/low output, subsistence farming to commercially competitive agriculture. The program will identify and address priority food and cash crop systems where productivity gains will lead to significant impacts on the economy and significant numbers of the rural population. APEP will address key constraints in the chain of production-to-market transactions, including input supply and distribution, applied research, technology applications, value-added processing, access to finance, producer organizations, and market development.  Emphasis also will be given to creating competitive agricultural and other off-farm rural enterprises as part of the transformation process. To request a copy of the solicitation that will be ready for distribution on or about May 15, 2002, please send an E-mail request to: rrutter@usaid.gov, or request a copy by mail by faxing your request to the Contracting Officer at 256 41 258981/233417. We also request that you include a current telephone number and/or a fax number or an e-mail address where you can be contacted. The preferred method of distribution of USAID Acquisition and Assistance (A&A) information is via the Internet. (By exception, USAID can provide the solicitation on a 3.5 floppy disk (Microsoft 97 format), via e-mail, or in hard copy). You must confirm in writing to the contact person noted below that, you have received the solicitation (when posted) through the Internet. As the recipient of the solicitation document, you are responsible for ensuring that you have received it from INTERNET in its entirety. USAID bears no responsibility for data errors resulting from transmission or conversion processes. Further, be aware that amendments to solicitations are occasionally issued and will be posted on the same Internet site from which you download the solicitation at FBO. Generally, the Contracting Officer will issue amendments to all those who have sent in the written confirmation of solicitation receipt. However, USAID does not guarantee that an amendment will be issued to you directly based upon written confirmation that you have downloaded the solicitation from the Internet. You are therefore advised to regularly check the FBO Internet site for amendments. NAICS: 541611, Competition Level: Full and Open, Order of Magnitude (Threshold): Estimated $20 million.

The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302.

However, all proposals received within forty-five days (thirty days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

Issuance of the RFP will not be delayed to review requests from MOU country sources received after 15 days or from non-MOU country sources.

The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  Canberra Industries Inc, 800 Research Parkway, Meriden Connecticut 06450. Clin 0001 – Model number EM-DET – CLOV - 4 x 50 x 80 SEG. 2 two (2) fold segmented clover detector with the following characteristics:
SPECIFICATIONS FOR EACH CRYSTAL – ENERGY RESOLUTION – The energy resolution of the detector, measured for 1.33 MeV gamma rays from a Co-60 source, will be <= 2.25 keV (mean 2.1 keV – full width at half maximum FWHM). For 122 keV gamma rays from a C0-57 source, the resolution will be <=1.3 keV FWHM (mean 1.2 KeV).  Resolution will be measured with main spectroscopy amplifier time constants of >=4 us. For each measurement, the source will be placed 25cm from front face of the crystal.  The total count rate will be <= 10E3/Sec.  The number of counts in the photo peaks will be >= 10E5.  The position resolution, measured for 1.33 MeV gamma rays, will be <= 10 keV (FWHM).
SIZE OF DETECTOR – The diameter of the crystal will be 50mm before shaping.  The length of the crystal will be a nominal of 80mm.  The relative efficiency at 1.33 MeV will be approximately 24 percent (source at 25cm from front face of each crystal).
PEAK TO COMPTON – The measured Peak to Compton for 1.33 MeV gamma rays (measured in the standard way) should have a minimum value of >= 43 (mean 45).
TIMING CHARACTERISTICS – These measurements will be carried out relative to a fast plastic scintillator using manufactures or equivalent Ortec timing equipment (the constant fraction discriminator will be set to CF mode).  The FWHM of the timing peak for all gamma rays (> 100 keV) form a Co-60 source should be <= 8 ns.
FABRICATION – The outer contact of the germanium diodes will be ion implanted and segmented longitudinally in 2.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division intends to non-competitively procure Data Transfer Systems and Data Transfer System subassemblies with one year warranty, integration, and installation.  The data switching equipment implements a design jointly developed by the Government and Cable & Computer Technology, Inc. under contract N00l78-96-D-2001 and currently produced under contract N00178-02-D-2014.  The required data switching system simultaneously switches multiple, dissimilar Naval Tactical Data System (NTDS) serial, parallel, digital video, and standard Navy synchro signal types.  The system is expandable to over 2000 ports operating without blocking or trunking. The system operates under a single controller previously developed by the Government. The modularly configurable system provides very low latency and very low bit error rates. The system transmits NTDS signals over distances up to 300 meters between components while remaining transparent to the sending and receiving equipment.  All components to be delivered shall be form, fit, and function matches at the LRU level to items delivered under the contracts previously mentioned.   NSWCDD will award a five-year ID/IQ contract with fixed price pricing provision to Cable & Computer Technology, Inc., Anaheim, CA.   Delivery of each complete data switching system or subassembly is required ten months after receipt of order.  The minimum guaranteed obligation is two 256-port data switching systems.  An estimated maximum quantity of twenty complete data switching systems and additional components may be ordered over the five-year period.  Solicitation N00178-03-R-2001 for this requirement will be issued on or about 15 November 2002.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal.   Outside inquiries must be submitted in writing to Contracting Officer, NSWCDD, Attn: XDS12C, 17320 Dahlgren Road, Dahlgren, VA  22448-5100 or XDS12@nswc.navy.mil.  Interested parties other than Cable & Computer Technology, Inc. must be able to demonstrate their capability to provide the requested equipment. See Notes 22.

<DESC>The Naval Undersea Warfare Center Division Newport has a requirement for improved coated optical fiber for underwater applications.  The effort will be conducted in two phases-Phase I will be for the design and build of special tooling for an existing vertical extruder to extrude a specialized profile on a 50/100 micron optical fiber.  The profile shall consist of Alcryn materials and shall provide a longitudinal strength member and a total specific gravity of 2.0 or greater.  The longitudinal strength member and methodology to increase the total specific gravity shall be loosely decoupled from the coated optical fiber.  The total overall diameter of the coating profile shall be between 2 mm and 4mm.  Phase I will also provide short sample lengths (approximately 2 to 4 meters) for analysis and testing.  Phase II, which is anticipated as  a contract option, is to develop a process to manufacture longer continuous lengths of coated fiber up to 10 km in length.  The goal of these efforts is development of an Alcryn coated optical fiber with significant performance improvement in strength.  We intend to award a contract to Krone Optical Systems, North Bennington, VT.  This company has developed a vertical extruder for overcoating optical fiber and this process is considered critical to the success of the proposed program.  Additionally, the company has experience coating 50/100 micron optical fiber with Alcryn.  All other timely offers will be considered. Offers for other products/services must contain complete product information and pricing information.  Deliverables for Phase I are required by 15 Sep 2003.  Phase II deliverables will be required 18 weeks after option exercise. NAICS: 541710/500 EMP.  Our department no longer issues solicitations or amendments in paper form.

<DESC>The USAID Regional Contracting Office in Budapest, Hungary intends to issue a Request for Proposals (RFP) for USAID/Albania to solicit proposals from organizations interested in implementing an Umbrella Anti-Trafficking Initiative in Albania for such   activities which include awarding & administering small grants to other actors in anti-trafficking. Its main function will be that of coordination with the government, other donors, and the NGO partners who are currently working in anti-trafficking. At the same time, offerors shall propose how they would increase collaboration among USAID, the government, and other donors on anti-trafficking issues. Proposals must build flexibility, creativity, and periodic reassessments into their approach so that the ever-evolving nature of the problem and the responses by the traffickers are addressed.  The approach that USAID requires is to leverage, mobilize, and focus the many positive efforts that are now working independently.  Incentives need to be built into the grant program to be able to coalesce and focus energy and resources.  The selected contractor to implement the specific activities in support of USAID’s Anti-Trafficking Initiative will provide coordination, and technical support at the national and regional level to leverage existing activities conducted in the sector by a variety of NGOs and Government of Albania Agencies.  Some of the activities for the Anti-Trafficking Initiative will include 1.)Establishment of a qualified network of NGOs to determine areas of specialization to rationally divide tasks and activity areas; 2.) Coordination of all planning and implementation activities of USAID-funded Cooperating Agencies, national, and international agencies working in the sector; 3.) Coordination of a yearly “Lessons Learned” meeting with partners to review and assess how well the regional activities are being implemented and share achievements, model approaches, and results, 4.) The enabling of NGOs and others to improve their linkages to prosecutors and police; 5.) Providing assistance to NGOs and service providers towards the improvement of their management and skills capacities; and 6.) Ensuring technical support to approaches to prevention through public information and media and technical expertise in human and psychological support. Anticipated outcomes for this Initiative include the reduction of the successful recruit and trafficking of children, women, and girls and the successful reintegration of children, women, and girls in their respective families (where possible), in independent housing, and/or in foster care placements to avoid their returning to the trafficking situation they left. The period of performance will be 3 years with a total estimated cost of approximately $4.5 million. The RFP will be issued by May 15, 2003. Organizations may express in writing (e-mail or fax) interest in this contract competition either by fax or email (Email preferred) to the Contract Specialist, Ms. Riana Napitupulu at rnapitupulu@usaid.gov  and to the Contracting Officer, Mr. Orion Yeandel at oyeandel@usaid.gov  and Fax No. (36-1) 475-4991 or 475-4988.

<DESC>The performance-based services covered in this solicitation and resultant contract require the contractor furnish all labor, equipment, supervision, transportation, operating supplies, and incidentals necessary to perform road maintenance on roads specified herein, in compliance with the terms, specifications, and conditions stated herein.  Work shall be accomplished with a motor grader with sufficient capacity to meet the performance requirements.   The work consists of performing road maintenance operations on the project roads listed below.  Forest and project road conditions vary significantly from road to road.  Some have varying depths of road base as a surfacing material while others have native materials as a road surface, some a mixture of both.  Existing road widths, drainage facilities, and road grades change by road segments.  Roadway drainage conditions are generally poor.  Some roads may be difficult for motor grader operations.  Some roads have limited public use while others may have significant use during recreational periods such as weekends, holidays, and hunting seasons.  Roads without an improved road generally provide travel for high clearance vehicles such as trucks, sport utility vehicles, and ATVs.   Roads with improved road surfaces, such as pit run aggregate or crushed aggregate surface, generally provide travel for both high and low clearance vehicles such as passenger cars and occasional ATV traffic.  Summer rainstorms have the potential to suspend vehicle and equipment operations until roadbeds dry sufficiently to continue road maintenance operations.  Projects are located on the Fishlake National Forest, Sevier and Wayne Counties, UT. HUBZone set aside. Solicitation package will approx. be uploaded onto FedBizOpps on May 9, 2003.*****

<DESC>POC: Evangela Kunene, Procurement Data Manager, Tel: 703-875-4357, Fax: 703-875-4009, E-mail: ekunene@tda.gov : PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT CONTRACTS OFFICE : Proposal Submission Place: Turkey Greater Izmir Municipality, c/o U.S. Trade and Development Agency, 1000 Wilson Blvd., Suit 1600, Arlington, VA 22209, Attention: Izmir Public Transportation Fare and Parking Fee Collection System Project - Turkey : The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study for determining the technical, financial, and economic feasibility of implementing a public transportation fare and parking fee system.

In the year 2000, Izmir won the prestigious Sesames 2000 Award for its “Kent Kart” implementation - the automatic fare collection system currently in use.  This award recognizes “innovation and leadership in smart card technology and applications worldwide” and notably, the smart card automated fare collection system currently employed in GIM is based on Motorola WSSD technology (manufactured and installed by Korean INTEC).  Seventy percent of Izmir’s public transportation passengers use this card to access three major transport modes (bus, metro and ferries). The system is so widely used that the number of proximity (smart) cards in use has reached over 1M generating over 660,000 data transactions per day.  However, this system now needs expansion and/or modernization to enable more flexible fare/fee structures and integration of all major transport modes as the 80 kilometers of commuter train service will be integrated to the existing system of bus, ferry and LRT. Completing this automatic fare collection modernization project will create greater incentives for residents and visitors to use public modes of transportation. It will also allow GIM to better meet the expanding transportation needs of the region.

The terms of reference for the feasibility study include the following:

·	Capture the current, as well as future, needs and requirements of the Municipality’s fare/fee collection systems, 
o	Research and analyze the state of automation systems used to collect fares/fees for all modes of public transportation and parking in the Municipality,
o	Research and analyze the state of automation systems globally and how these systems compare with and/or effect plans for the modernization of systems in Izmir - both hardware and software systems,
·	Analyze the fare/fee structures (pricing algorithms) that would most benefit the GIM and their customers,
o	Research and analyze routing, time-of-day, demographic groups, and any other criterion effecting fare/fee pricing structures
o	Research inter-modal fare/fee pricing structures including parking
·	Draft the specification for the international tender (RFP) for the upgrade or replacement of the current fare/fee collection system.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The U.S. AGENCY FOR INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT (USAID) in Kampala, Uganda has issued RFP 617-02-009 for the design and implementation of the Agricultural Productivity Enhancement Program (APEP) through a cost reimbursement contract for a period of five years, including the initial design phase. The primary objective of APEP will be to expand economic opportunities in the Ugandan agricultural sector by increasing agricultural productivity and marketing of key food and cash crop systems.  While building on past successes, the new program will place greater emphasis on creating economies of scale that will catalyze the transformation of Ugandan agriculture from low input/low output, subsistence farming to commercially competitive agriculture. The program will identify and address priority food and cash crop systems where productivity gains will lead to significant impacts on the economy and significant numbers of the rural population. APEP will address key constraints in the chain of production-to-market transactions, including input supply and distribution, applied research, technology applications, value-added processing, access to finance, producer organizations, and market development.  Emphasis also will be given to creating competitive agricultural and other off-farm rural enterprises as part of the transformation process. To request a copy of the solicitation please send an E-mail request to: snagwere@usaid.gov, or request a copy by mail by faxing your request to the Contracting Officer at 256 41 258981/233417.

<DESC>Solicitation number NA1341-03-Q-0371 dated April 15, 2003 is hereby amended to respond to technical questions submitted. Question: Does NIST require a magnetron sputtering system with (3) guns? Answer: Multiple sputtering heads are specified to ensure possibility of two or three layer combination coatings such as Cr, Al, or Cr Cu.  It also adds to flexibility of coating larger specimens and small specimens when NIST can select only one head to operate.  A system with two individually selectable sputtering heads would be acceptable. Question: Sputtering guns need water cooling - what is meant by (no water cooling) electronic cooling system?  Would a chiller be acceptable? 
Answer: A system with efficient electronic cooling is preferred or a system with circulating coolant.  NIST wants to avoid cooling using tap water, it adds to the maintenance and increases possibility of water flooding in the lab. Question: Specifications indicate a need for a 4-6 week delivery after receipt of an order, which suggests that you have identified a chosen system that is acceptable; can you provide the Brand and Model Number? Answer:  NIST requires a Turbo Sputter Coater System that meets the listed requirements. NIST is not looking for a particular brand or model, just that the system quoted meets the requirements. Commercially available systems should be available within 4-6 weeks. Due to the fact NIST's current system is down, expedited delivery is required. Question: What size vacuum chamber is required? Answer:  There is a minimum specimen size of 8 inch. A bench-top sputtering system that is easy to install in a typical lab, and move from one lab to another without major space reconstruction work. The sputtering system shall be capable to reach operational conditions (vacuum, clean and gas-atmosphere) in one hour or less. Question: Is there any uniformity specifications? Answer:  NIST requirements are for a cluster size of 5 nm or smaller with a uniformity of 2 % or better in thickness over a 1-inch diameter specimen. If coating is 10,000 Angstroms thick, deviation in the thickness shall be less than +- 100 Angstroms. Question: Would a used system refurbished with a one-year warranty be acceptable? Answer:  NIST requires a new system with at least a one-year warranty, a longer warranty is preferred. The system will be used frequently and will be required to perform the highest quality of research. The due date for quotes, May 26, 2003 @ 3pm EST remains unchanged.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE WAS UNINTENTIONALLY ARCHIVED FROM THE FEDBIZOPPS.  THE RESPONSE DATE FOR RECEIPT OF PROPOSALS WAS EXTENDED FROM MAY 15, 2003 TO SEP 15, 2003.  WE ARE REPOSTING THE NOTICE.  THE RFP IS STILL AVAILABLE ON THE NIAID/CMB HOMEPAGE AT http://www.niaid.nih.gov/cgi-shl/cmb/rfps.cfm.
The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) supports research related to basic understanding of microbiology and immunology leading to the development of vaccines and novel therapeutic agents for the prevention and treatment of infectious and immune-mediated diseases, and improvements in public health. As a part of the research program to improve defense against bioterrorism and emerging/re-emerging infectious diseases, the NIAID seeks to establish an Administrative Center in support of the NIAID Proteomics Research Program, being solicited under a separate RFP (see RFP NIH-NIAID-DMID-03-38). The Proteomics Research Program shall focus on early stage basic research for target discovery and identification and early validation studies. The subject solicitation is being issued as a 100% SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE. The applicable NAICS code is 541710 with a size standard of 500 employees. See Government-wide Numbered Note 1 and Note 26. As assistance to the Proteomics Research Program, the Administrative Center will: 1) Design, develop, and maintain a publicly accessible website that contains the data and technology protocols generated by each Proteomics Research site, as well as a catalog of reagents and products developed by the sites and available for public distribution; 2) Monitor and facilitate the deposition of reagents and protein targets generated by the Proteomics Research sites. It is anticipated that the Proteomics sites will deposit their reagents/products to a centralized repository such as the Biodefense and Emerging Infectious Diseases Research Resource, a new program that will be supported by a separate NIAID contract for distribution to the broader research community; 3) In conjunction with the Project Officer, establish a Scientific Advisory Committee (SAC) composed of leading scientists knowledgeable in a broad range of proteomics and bioinformatic research areas. The committee members shall also include individuals with expertise in microbiology, immunology (both innate and adaptive immunity), and infectious diseases. The committee shall provide advice to the NIAID on the operations and future directions of the Proteomics Centers program based on the state of proteomic technological and research advances, including those contributed by the Proteomics Centers; and 4) Organize programmatic meetings and other related activities involving all of the Proteomics Research Program sites. It is anticipated that one (1) cost-reimbursement, completion type contract will be awarded, with a period of five (5) years, beginning approximately May 2004. RFP NIH-NIAID-DMID-03-45 will be available electronically on or about December 13, 2002, and may be accessed through the NIAID Contract Management Branch (CMB) Home Page at http://www.niaid.nih.gov/contract. Any responsible Offeror may submit a proposal which will be considered by the Government. This advertisement does not commit the Government to award a contract. No collect calls will be accepted.

<DESC>MODIFICATION NO. 3 


Dear Potential Offerors:

The purpose of this amendment is to disseminate the answers to questions raised by a potential offeror.
 
1.  Question (Q):To whom should our electronic submission be sent, and should the cost and technical proposal be sent to the same email address?
Answer (A): The addressee for the electronic submission (technical and cost proposals) is: epura@usaid.gov and cc: wireynolds@usaid.gov
 
2. Q: Can we submit signed documents in PDF format rather than via fax?
A: Yes.
 
3. Q: We note that the RFP provides position descriptions for all proposed long-term personnel except the Policy Advisor.  Can you provide the position description for the Policy Advisor as well?
 
A: Policy Advisor:  It is recommended that the candidate possess a minimum of five years of progressively responsible experience in managing and implementing policy related programs involving counterparts in transitional or developming economies.  Previous experience should demonstrate the ability to (a) provide hands-on, practical advice in not only formulating but also implementing policy; (b) develop effective partnerships involving both the public and private sector aimed at achieving consensus and support for key policy initiatives; and (c) undertake advocacy programs aimed at overcoming obstacles, reaching consensus and ensuring citizen partnership in the policy making process.  The  candidate should possess the professional, interpersonal and communication skills needed to be effective in a Mongolian working environment.  Ideally, the candidate would also have direct private sector experience in ways that strengthen understanding of commercial environments and enhance credibility within the Mongolian private as well as public sector.   Experience and technical skills in a policy area directly relevant to this RFP (such as the financial sector) would also be very useful.
 
By way of this amplification, USAID/Mongolia would like to emphasize that taken together, the long-term technical assistance team should represent MORE than the sum of its parts. A shared vision and a complementary set of skills and experiences is highly desirable.  Ideally, the team will reflect an impressive mix of both public and private sector experience; a background in not only formulating but also implementing policy; an ability to work well with counterparts in strengthening the capacity of local institutions; and real-life (rather than theoretical) experience in running a business and working effectively within a market economy.  Again, the key points here are vision, complementarity, interpersonal skills and a team approach, one that draws on the strengths of each member of the management team and becomes catalytic in pursuing and achieving a common set of goals as well as vision for Mongolia.  The ability of each team member to work well together and complement each other is essential.
 
4. Q: Would you like us to include option years in our budget?
A: No.
 
5. Q: Can you give an idea of the contract effective date and report-to-post date?
A: The estimated contract start date is September 15, 2003 and the estimated completion date  is September 14, 2008.
 
6. Q: Does the Mission prefer that contractors lease or purchase vehicles?
Answer: The Mission typically prefers contractors to lease rather than purchase vehicles, though offerors are welcome to propose alternative solutions.
Pursuant to FAR 52.215-1, Instruction to Offerors – Competitive Acquisition, offerors shall acknowledge receipt of this amendment to this solicitation by sending an e-mail to Ester Pura.  Her e-mail address is epura@usaid.gov.

Sincerely,
William E. Reynolds

<DESC>POC: Evangela Kunene, Procurement Data Manager, Tel: 703-875-4357, Fax: 703-875-4009, E-mail: ekunene@tda.gov : PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT CONTRACTS OFFICE : Proposal Submission Place: Ms Hulya Arkon, Greater Izmir Municipality, Izmir Buyuksehir Belediyesi, Konak 35250, Izmir, Turkey, Tel. 90-232-484-85-33 : Attention: Ms. Hulya Arkon : The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study for determining the technical, financial, and economic feasibility of implementing a public transportation fare and parking fee system.

In the year 2000, Izmir won the prestigious Sesames 2000 Award for its “Kent Kart” implementation - the automatic fare collection system currently in use.  This award recognizes “innovation and leadership in smart card technology and applications worldwide” and notably, the smart card automated fare collection system currently employed in GIM is based on Motorola WSSD technology (manufactured and installed by Korean INTEC).  Seventy percent of Izmir’s public transportation passengers use this card to access three major transport modes (bus, metro and ferries). The system is so widely used that the number of proximity (smart) cards in use has reached over 1M generating over 660,000 data transactions per day.  However, this system now needs expansion and/or modernization to enable more flexible fare/fee structures and integration of all major transport modes as the 80 kilometers of commuter train service will be integrated to the existing system of bus, ferry and LRT. Completing this automatic fare collection modernization project will create greater incentives for residents and visitors to use public modes of transportation. It will also allow GIM to better meet the expanding transportation needs of the region.

The terms of reference for the feasibility study include the following:

·	Capture the current, as well as future, needs and requirements of the Municipality’s fare/fee collection systems, 
o	Research and analyze the state of automation systems used to collect fares/fees for all modes of public transportation and parking in the Municipality,
o	Research and analyze the state of automation systems globally and how these systems compare with and/or effect plans for the modernization of systems in Izmir - both hardware and software systems,
·	Analyze the fare/fee structures (pricing algorithms) that would most benefit the GIM and their customers,
o	Research and analyze routing, time-of-day, demographic groups, and any other criterion effecting fare/fee pricing structures
o	Research inter-modal fare/fee pricing structures including parking
·	Draft the specification for the international tender (RFP) for the upgrade or replacement of the current fare/fee collection system. 

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a USD216,907 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and excerpts from a background definitional mission report, are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm’s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by 2:00 pm on May 30, 2003 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command/Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division is planning to enter into a multiyear agreement for commercial prototyping process technology needed to fabricate prototype photonic integrated circuits (PIC's) having future applications to Navy and other military systems. This effort is planned as a Section 845 Other Transaction Agreement for Prototypes under 10 U.S.C. 2371 and is expected to include established collaboration between a PIC design contractor, process tooling manufacturer(s), volume manufacturing contractor(s), and a university.  Likewise, to facilitate timely transition to military systems, the team must also have established strategic partners for defining both military and commercial requirements for significant advancements in US Military operations through the integration of optical and electrical functions into advanced electro-optic devices.  A PIC prototyping research and development (R&D) facility to be located in the State of Hawaii must be capable of prototyping methods for fabrication and processing of 200mm wafers containing SOI (Silicon-on-Insulator)-based photonic media including: (1) methods for MOCVD growth of III-V semiconductors and other materials (including advanced multi-layer photonic materials); (2) cleaning; (3) advanced lithography; (4) doping; and (5) etching for compound semiconductor devices. This facility must also be able to handle SOI wafers with integrated crystalline Ge layers.  R&D of these Ge/SOI materials will extend to prototyping of methods to integrate CMOS logic circuits, heterogeneous layers of compound semiconductors as well as optical signal conduction layers. The back end of the line process development will include testing of advanced opto-electronic devices.  Interested contractor teams should notify the Agreements Officer representative via e-mail at strongsc@navair.navy.mil.  This expression of interest must include a white paper not more than 5 pages in length detailing the potential team’s complement, areas of expertise, and capabilities and relative experience in developing comparable facilities.

<DESC>This is a request for information(RFI)and not a request for proposal(RFP). The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) has the mission of supporting the acquisition of Enhanced Mobile Satellite Services (EMSS)for Department of Defense (DoD) and non-DoD U.S. Government agencies.  The intent of this RFI is to obtain market information and determine capabilities of all businesses with the infrastructure to support Equipment purchases and airtime services for DoD and non-DoD Agencies. Information is being sought to provide DoD with a hand-held global satellite communication service that includes voice, data, paging, and FAX capability and provides for expansion for other potential mobile/stationary user equipment configurations, including secure voice and data communications. EMSS provides voice, data and messaging services to Government and Government-authorized subscribers. These services are tied to the Defense Information System Network (DISN) through a Government owned and operated ground station. The Contractor shall ensure that EMSS equipment and airtime services are provided to the Government in a manner consistent with its most favored commercial subscribers for the same commercial service. The Government is interested in minimizing recurring costs to EMSS users while maximizing the utility of the EMSS capability. Lower recurring costs will generally increase the number of users financially capable of using the service.

The Government is interested in receiving answers to the following questions with regard to EMSS services:

1)	Describe the current satellite marketplace specifically in respect to how your company fits into the market; 
2)	How will the EMSS services be priced in comparison to the commercial market;  
3)	Describe your communications infrastructure and area of coverage.  Specifically identify Global coverage from 90 degrees North to 90 Degrees South;
4)	Identify type of satellite equipment used (model, manufacture, type, and technical specifications);
5)	Provide pricing for any MSS services you provide based upon your current price list for commercial customers;
6)	Provide a representative listing of customers to whom you are currently providing satellite services;
7)	Describe what control, if any, you have over the pricing of the satellite services and equipment you provide.
8)	Discuss physical and communications security you're your space and earth segments;
9)	Describe any National security Agency-approved encryption devices that are compatible with your handsets for voice or data traffic;
10)Do you have 2 ground stations capable of leasing
   secure  space to DoD in the U.S;
11)Are Virtual Private Network (VPN)-like capabilities
   in place that could segregate DoD traffic from
   commercial traffic; 
   12)Identify current aviation, marine, scientific,
   homeland security, or military applications your
   services are currently being used for;
   13)What is the subscriber capacity on your space and
   earth segments;
 14)Provide detailed call route diagrams for various
   handset to handset to terrestrial calls;
   15)Discuss how system users can be directly connected to
   the DISN through DoD classified and unclassified data
   networks and the Defense Switched Network (DSN)
   terrestrial telecommunications infrastructure. Include
   a discussion of relevant security issues.

NOTE:  All information received will be kept in the strictest confidence and only used internally by the contracting officer.  It will not be released or shared with any other government agency or any government contractors.  FAR 52.215-3, Request for Information or Solicitation For Planning Purposes (OCT 1997) applies to this RFI. 52.215-3(c) Add the following: Information will be used to assist in planning and development of acquisition strategy by DISA and AQN4 for eventual procurement of these services.

<DESC>Westinghouse Savannah River Company (WSRC), managing and operating contractor of the Savannah River Site for the Department of Energy near Aiken, South Carolina, is soliciting expressions of interest from companies wishing to obtain license rights to market and distribute the following technology to commercial customers.  License rights may be granted on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis.  The technology is a new tool that enables the quick and handy installation and removal of fasteners.  Fasteners, such as hexagonal nuts, are loaded into a convenient cartridge.  Used with a ratchet handle, speed handle, or torque wrench, the cartridge presents each fastener for quick installation.  Used in reverse, the cartridge collects removed fasteners for reuse.  This tool was originally conceived for use in radiological areas, including gloveboxes, where the use of protective gloves inhibits mechanics’ dexterity.  Use of the new tool makes such procedures quick and easy and prevents the loss of fasteners.  Different sized cartridges can carry different styles and sizes of fasteners.  In addition to expediting maintenance tasks in radiological areas, the easy on/off cartridge could be used to facilitate many ordinary tasks such as changing car tires, assembling swing sets, and constructing prefab metal buildings.  Any company interested in licensing this technology must respond with a letter of interest (may be submitted by email) no later than May 26, 2003, summarizing the company’s business and technical expertise and motivation for pursuing this opportunity.  Companies deemed appropriate will be provided with further information on the technology.  Such information may require an executed nondisclosure agreement.  Respondents wishing to enter into negotiations for a license will be required to submit a business plan prior to licensee selection and negotiations.  Company qualifications should include, but not be limited to, evidence of successful commercialization of compatible product lines, reasonable schedule for product launch, sufficient manufacturing capacity, established distribution networks, and evidence of sufficient financial resources for product development and launch.  Questions and expressions of interest may be addressed to the Point of Contact identified in this Notice: Dale K. Haas, telephone: (803) 725-4185; fax: (803) 725-4988; email: dale.haas@srs.gov; or address: Westinghouse Savannah River Company, Technology Transfer, Building 773-41A, Aiken, SC 29808.  This is not a procurement; it is a request for parties interested in licensing opportunities only.

<SUBJECT>D--INFORMATION SYSTEMS DIRECTORATE(ISD)/PUBLIC AFFAIRS OFFICE (PAO) PROCUREMENT STRATEGY
<DESC>The purpose of this Special Notice is to inform industry of the procurement strategy developed for the ISD/PAO contracts referenced in Request for Information (RFI), 9-BJ2-Z70-03-03RFI.  The RFI was originally posed on January 29, 2003 and subsequently archived. As previously stated in the RFI, the requirements defined in the following four contracts are to be competed later this year; 1) NAS 9-97001, Information, Imagery, Media and Public Affairs Support Services (IMPASS) with InDyne, Inc.; 2) NAS 9-98143, Data Systems Support Services (DSSSC) with Lockheed Martin Information Technology; 3) NAS 9-01122, Application Development Support Contract (ADSC) with Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC); and 4) NAS 9-97135, Information Technology Support Services Contract (ITSSC) with Muniz Engineering Inc.  In the previous RFI, the Johnson Space Center (JSC) requested industry input on the procurement strategy, the number of contracts and the development of the Statements of Work.  In addition, the RFI solicited any comments regarding the appropriate contract type, set-aside considerations, and any other technical, management, business, and/or contractual issues that should be considered by the Government.  JSC was pleased with the number of companies that responded to the RFI. Based upon industry contributions and input from an independent evaluation team it has been determined that three separate contracts will be competed later this year.   The following information is being provided for planning purposes. 1.  The NAICS codes have not been determined at this time. 2.  Although 'D-Information Technology Services, including telecom services' is identified as the classification code it is not necessarily the code for each of the anticipated contracts.  The other classification codes will be posted when new information about the anticipated procurements are released. 3. There has not been a determination made on whether these contracts will be handled as commercial acquisitions. 4.	At this time there is not any information on an estimated date for release of any solicitations.  Keep posted to this website for additional information on these procurements. Contracts 1) Information Technology Support   This contract will be a combination of efforts currently under the DSSSC contract, the ITSSC contract (except for customer support activities) the server administration portions of the IMPASS contract, and technology infusion support ranging from initial concept development to implementation.  It is the Government's intent to set-aside this effort for small businesses.   2) Multimedia Support  This contract consists of the efforts currently under the IMPASS contract (excluding mail and print shop operations and server administration), the ADSC contract and the ITSSC customer support function.  This contract will support the various organizations at the center by providing a multitude of products and services from such activities as television, graphics, media relations, video teleconferencing, education programs, exhibits, and technology infusion support ranging from initial concept development to implementation.  It is the Government's intent to set-aside this effort for small businesses. 3) JSC Mail Room and Print Shop Operations The requirements for this contract are identified in the current IMPASS contract. It is the Government's intent to set-aside this effort for Hubzone firms. This organization of the three contracts reflects commercial industry practice of separating application development and application hosting.  It also allows the Government to continue Information Technology infrastructure consolidation activities.   The Government does not anticipate any additional reorganization of the requirements associated with the three contracts, therefore, no additional industry comments related to contract consolidation activities are being solicited.  Please keep posted to this site for additional information on these activities.

  POSITION DESCRIPTION
 
 Senior South Asia Urban Development Adviser
 
 Statement of Work
 
 A.	Introduction and Background
 
 The purpose of the Senior South Asia Urban Development Adviser (SUDA) position is to advise and assist USAID missions and their counterparts in South Asia better address the region’s urbanization and strengthen local governments’ urban management capacity.
 
 Urbanization is a phenomenon that is part and parcel of economic development.  The migration of labor, capital, and wage goods from rural to urban settings, from the agricultural sector to services and manufacturing, constitute the great “structural transformation” that is economic development.  This phenomenon is inescapable and of overwhelming importance in determining how societies are governed, use natural resources, and provide essential services such as health, housing, and education.
 
 Over the last few decades, most countries in Asia have been undergoing structural changes that heighten the criticality of urban areas and urbanizing regions.  National economies are transforming or are largely transformed from the agriculturally based and rural to the predominately industrial and service-based that is coincidental with urbanization.  National legislation and legal codes for decentralization in many countries are altering the fundamental structure and process of governance nationally to focus on local government units and governance through broadened civic participation.
 
 In order to realize the economic potential of urbanization, much depends on policy and governance at the central government and local government levels.  In most countries of South Asia, local governments are inadequately empowered, financed, informed, and staffed to deal with the problems and the opportunities of cities and their extended urban regions.  Ultimately, if left unaddressed, this will subvert the promise of economic development.
 
 Ill-prepared to absorb and support rapid growth, South Asia’s cities and peri-urban areas, while absorbing some populations from rural poverty, are also creating extensive new populations living in urban poverty.  World Bank cross-country research on poverty has shown that as countries urbanize, urban poverty rises relative to the national mean and the poor urbanize more rapidly than other income groups.  Overly rapid urbanization has overwhelmed South Asian economies’ capacities to generate new jobs in the formal sector or provide basic health and environmental services.  While cities create the space for increased economic and political participation, judicious public and private actions can expedite that participation and direct it towards more positive outcomes.
 
 Virtually all urban areas in South Asia are subject to accelerated population growth and even in the best of instances, preparations for rapid immigration and urban assimilation have been insufficient.  This is most obvious in the region’s capitals, megacities, and secondary cities where the lack of water supply and waste management services and overwhelmed health and basic education facilities are sustaining neither the requisite levels of private investment or human capital development.
 
 This quiet crisis is exacerbated by the fact that at a time of increasing population, growing pluralism, and increased intensity of demand from all sectors of society, local urban political and administrative institutions do not have the capacity to respond commensurately.  The demands for essential services, often organized and articulated by political parties or civil society organizations, are growing far faster than the ability of local governments to respond adequately.
 
 There is clearly a need to strengthen the response capacity of local governments:
 
 •	Almost all of South Asia’s urban local government need clearer delineation of their authorities, with constitutional or legal mandates that better define their decentralized functional and financial authorities and authorities. •	They need increased revenues, either self-generated or from revenue-sharing from national and sub-national governments. 
•	They need skills and systems that allow them to work more efficiently and transparently when managing urban government financial flows and assets. 
•	They need skills and systems that enable them to work more inclusively with constituents to plan and prioritize investments and to design and monitor investments and government services. 
•	They need to develop more “bankable,” credit-worthy projects and learn to work more effectively with the private sector, in order to attract needed private investment and mobilize more resources.
 
 USAID has used global, regional, and bilateral programs to assist its counterparts improve urban management and services in South Asia.  The Office of Urban Programs, in USAID/Washington headquarters, provides program support and contractual services to support the USAID global strategy to address urbanization, “Making Cities Work.”  Until October, 2002, the USAID/Washington Office of Urban Programs operated a Regional Urban Development Office for South Asia (RUDO/SA) based in New Delhi, India, that provided program and technical support USAID Missions and private and nongovernmental regional partners in the areas of urban infrastructure finance, public-private partnerships, and urban governance.  In FY2002, RUDO/SA initiated and managed two regional contracts that are scheduled to continue until September 30, 2004:  the “Regional Urban Environmental Policy and Management Support Program” (RUEPOMAN) and the “Good Urban Governance in South Asia” (GUGSA) Program.  Since October, 2002, those regional program responsibilities have been assumed by the new Office of Economic Growth within USAID/India.
 
 To varying extents, the USAID missions in South Asia (India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal, and Pakistan) have in the past or currently are assisting their counterparts improve urban management and services.   USAID/India has committed the most resources to urban management, with a bilateral program, the “Financial Institutions Reform and Expansion, Debt Market Component” (FIRE-D) Project and other planned activities as part of its five year country program strategy, 2003-2007.

Technical assistance by the contractor shall consist of diagnosis and repair of system hardware failures. In the event technical assistance results in a requirement to replace a part or component, the contractor shall provide all GenRad in-stock parts, components, or assemblies within twenty-four hours of failure diagnosis.

The visitor will sign in, exchange a picture identification (example: state driver’s license) for the appropriate badge. The visitor will have ten minutes to report to their sponsor. A sponsor system requires all personnel visiting the complex to arrange their visit. The sponsor (point of contact who is assigned to the Avionics Complex and is responsible for the visitor) must make prior arrangements for the visit by submitting a Visit Notification Sheet (VNS) to the Visitor Control Center. When arrangements are completed and approved by the first line supervisor or branch chief, the visitor will be on the access list (approved list of prior arranged sponsored visitors) at the VCC. Upon arrival, the receptionist will verify the visitor with the daily access list. Contractor personnel without a controlled area “A” badge will be issued a Visitor “V” badge.

All personnel entering the Avionics Complex will leave transmitter devices (ie., phones, pagers, walkie-talkies, beepers, etc.) in their vehicles or at the Visitor Control Center (VCC) Bldg 624. This does not include the government owned official business devices that have been approved by the Base Tempest Monitor).  7. In the event that the equipment being maintained under this contract is moved to another location within the avionics complex at WR-ALC, Warner Robins GA, the contractor shall continue to maintain the equipment at the new location (within the avionics complex). GenRad must be notified so they can assist in the planning and/or movement of the test systems and all related equipment.  The government will furnish all labor required for the dismantling, packing, unpacking and the placement of the equipment at the new location. The government will give at least five days written notice, where possible, of the movement of equipment unless such move is due to an emergency.  7.1 If the test systems are to be moved out of the avionics complex, it will be determined whether the contract between Warner Robins Air Logistics Center and GenRad, Inc. must be rewritten and/or renegotiated.  8.
