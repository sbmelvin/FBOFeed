The Contractor shall indemnify and hold harmless the Government against all actions or claims resulting from the fault, negligence, or omission of the Contractor. 52.211-18	VARIATION IN ESTIMATED QUANTITY	(APR 1984) If the quantity of a unit-priced item in this contract is an estimated quantity and the actual quantity of the unit-priced item varies more than 10 percent above or below the estimated quantity, an equitable adjustment in the contract price shall be made upon demand of either party.  The equitable adjustment shall be based upon any increase or decrease in costs due solely to the variation above 110 percent or below 90 percent of the estimated quantity.  If the quantity variation is such as to cause an increase in the time necessary for completion, the Contractor may request, in writing, an extension of time, to be received by the Contracting Officer within 10 days from the beginning of the delay, or within such further period as may be granted by the Contracting Officer before the date of final settlement of the contract.  Upon the receipt of a written request for an extension, the Contracting Officer shall ascertain the facts and make an adjustment for extending the completion date as, in the judgment of the Contracting Officer, is justified. 52.216-2 Economic Price Adjustment-Standard Supplies.  (JAN 1997) (a) The Contractor warrants that the unit price stated in the Schedule for all lines is not in excess of the Contractor's applicable established price in effect on the contract date for like quantities of the same item. The term "unit price" excludes any part of the price directly resulting from requirements for preservation, packaging, or packing beyond standard commercial practice. The term "established price" means a price that-  (1) Is an established catalog or market price for a commercial item sold in substantial quantities to the general public; and  (2) Is the net price after applying any standard trade discounts offered by the Contractor.  (b) The Contractor shall promptly notify the Contracting Officer of the amount and effective date of each decrease in any applicable established price. Each corresponding contract unit price shall be decreased by the same percentage that the established price is decreased. The decrease shall apply to those items delivered on and after the effective date of the decrease in the Contractor's established price, and this contract shall be modified accordingly.  (c) If the Contractor's applicable established price is increased after the contract date, the corresponding contract unit price shall be increased, upon the Contractor's written request to the Contracting Officer, by the same percentage that the established price is increased, and the contract shall be modified accordingly, subject to the following limitations:  (1) The aggregate of the increases in any contract unit price under this clause shall not exceed 10 percent of the original contract unit price.  (2) The increased contract unit price shall be effective-  (i) On the effective date of the increase in the applicable established price if the Contracting Officer receives the Contractor's written request within 10 days thereafter; or  (ii) If the written request is received later, on the date the Contracting Officer receives the request.  (3) The increased contract unit price shall not apply to quantities scheduled under the contract for delivery before the effective date of the increased contract unit price, unless failure to deliver before that date results from causes beyond the control and without the fault or negligence of the Contractor, within the meaning of the Default clause.  (4) No modification increasing a contract unit price shall be executed under this paragraph (c) until the Contracting Officer verifies the increase in the applicable established price.  (5) Within 30 days after receipt of the Contractor's written request, the Contracting Officer may cancel, without liability to either party, any undelivered portion of the contract items affected by the requested increase.  (d) During the time allowed for the cancellation provided for in paragraph (c)(5) of this clause, and thereafter if there is no cancellation, the Contractor shall continue deliveries according to the contract delivery schedule, and the Government shall pay for such deliveries at the contract unit price, increased to the extent provided by paragraph (c) of this clause.

<DESC>The United States Government, represented by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) Regional Office of Acquisition and Assistance in Dhaka, Bangladesh, intends to issue a Request for Proposals (RFP) to solicit proposals from qualified organizations interested in an NGO health services delivery and franchise development program called the "Smiling Sun Franchise Program."

This program will institutionalize a network of local NGOs into a franchise, enabling them to maintain and expand the availability of sustainable NGO health services and products in a way that reduces reliance on USAID funding for recurrent costs.  This program is expected to expand the availability of key family planning and health products and services to the poor, and to continue achieving the population and health targets of the Government of Bangladesh (GOB) and USAID.  This program will establish a mechanism for the clinics to recover greater costs, achieve more operational efficiency, and increase client loads while still providing services to a segment of the poor population.  The GOB has a wide network of health care facilities, but inadequate coverage excludes large sectors of the population from access.  At the conclusion of this program the GOB will have made continued progress in expanding and deepening Essential Service Delivery through public and private organizations and implemented policies that support continued growth.  This aid will be used to promote responsible sovereignty, not permanent dependency.  From the onset of this program, all NGOs will know that the subgrants provided by USAID for recurrent costs will decline and terminate over the next four year period.  USAID's goal for the Smiling Sun Franchise Program at the end of the four-year funding period is that NGOs will no longer be dependent on USAID for recurrent costs while continuing to meet family planning and health targets.

Reports, evaluations, background material and additional supporting documents that have contributed to the development of the Smiling Sun Franchise Program may be found under "Health Service Delivery Supporting Documents" on the USAID/Bangladesh website at: http://www.usaid.gov/bd/proposal_resources.html.

This is a full and open competition and the procedures set forth in FAR Part 15 shall apply.  This RFP is expected to be issued in mid-to-late November 2006 and will be distributed through the Federal Business Opportunities (http://www.fedbizopps.gov) website of the General Service Administration.  Any amendments to this solicitation will be issued and posted on this website along with the RFP.  All questions regarding this solicitation should be directed through the mechanism provided on the FedBizOpps website.

The release of this notice in no way obligates USAID or the U.S. Government to release an RFP or make an award of any type.

<DESC>The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) intend to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) for an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ), Design/Build (D/B) Construction, Multi-Award Task Order Contract (MATOC) for the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service, Southeast Region (Region 4). This is a competitive, best value, source selection that will be conducted in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR Part 15.3).  In using this best value approach, the Government seeks to award to offerors who give the greatest confidence that they will best meet our requirements affordably. Projects are located at U.S. Fish and Wildlife Region 4 sites such as national fish hatcheries and national wildlife refuges in the southeastern United States.  The Southeast Region consists of the states of Arkansas, Louisiana, Tennessee, Kentucky, North Carolina, South Carolina, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, Florida, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands. The MATOC will be for 5 years total consisting of a base year plus 4 one-year renewable options, and will result in award to multiple Design/Builders (D/B). The D/B will be requested to submit proposals on a rotational basis after consideration of individual task orders.   Extenuating circumstances such as familiarity with a site or specialized skills may dictate that a particular D/B be chosen out of order at the discretion of the Contracting Officer (CO).  There will be two (2) evaluation phases. Phase I (Short-list Criteria) and Phase II (Award Selection Criteria. Only applies to short-listed contractors). The sample Task Order referenced under "Award Selection Criteria (Phase Two)" is a real project and will be awarded as a task order to the short-listed D/B firm having the best design solution. The contract type will be firm fixed price, indefinite delivery indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract with individual Task Orders.  Each Task Order will have a Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP). Task Orders may vary in size but are expected to be issued for projects in the $100,000 to $4,000,000 range with most of the projects being below $3,000,000. Many of the project work sites are in remote locations where building materials and supplies are limited in quantity and variety.  Opportunities to use local labor may also be limited in quantity and specialty.  Site access can be difficult in these remote areas.  In Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands, access is primarily by ship or air.  Project work consists of, but may not be limited to: projects primarily architectural in nature, projects primarily civil and infrastructure in nature and miscellaneous structures.  Projects primarily architectural in nature consists of buildings such as visitor centers, administrative office buildings, combination administrative office/visitor center buildings, equipment maintenance shop and storage buildings, crew quarters and bunkhouses, and single family dwellings.  These projects may have a civil works component such as roads, parking lots, water supply and sewerage systems, storm water management systems, utility systems, fences, and other appurtenant incidental structures. Projects primarily civil and infrastructure in nature consists of bridges, levees, concrete structures, water control structures, retaining walls, underground utilities, water and sewerage works, roads, parking lots, marine facilities, boardwalks, erosion control projects, and demolition/deconstruction projects.  These civil projects may have multi-disciplinary components including mechanical, electrical, plumbing, structural, geotechnical, hydrological, environmental, and architectural disciplines. Miscellaneous structures such as fences, kiosks, shelters, blinds, and interpretative elements. This is not a small business set aside in accordance with the latest quarterly adjustment under the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program. The North American Industry Classification System code (NAICS), size standard, and the estimated price range is to be specified on each individual task order.  A vendor must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database (Mandatory for doing business with the government) in order to receive contracts, task orders, and payments from most Federal agencies, including the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. CCR is a self-service database. Vendors register themselves and maintain their own information through the CCR Web site.  In order to register or learn more about CCR, go to http://www.ccr.gov.  You will need to know your Dun and Bradstreet (D&B) number; however, if you do not have this number, you can contact D&B at (800)333-0505.  The tentative RFP issue date is on or about November 15, 2006 with a January 05, 2007 closing date. The RFQ documents will be available electronically on the Federal Business Opportunities website. The FWS is currently using Electronic Commerce to issue solicitations and the resulting award. The RFQ documents will be available at the Federal Business Opportunities website at http://www.fbo.gov under RFP Number 401816R058. Paper copies WILL NOT be available. Once the solicitation is posted, it is incumbent upon the interested parties to review this site for any updates or amendments. Questions should be directed by e-mail to Ms. Natasha Rowland-Howie, Contracting Specialist (natasha_ rowland-howie@fws.gov) or Mr. Lawrence (Mac) McCoy, Contract Specialist (lawrence_mccoy@fws.gov).

<DESC>NASA/GRC has a requirement for three (3) additional ASC units for demonstration and evaluation.  These three additional ASC convertors shall be designated ASC-E #1, #2, and #3 as identifiers.  These units shall be similar to the other hermetic ASC convertors in design and shall include Inconel 718 heater heads. The intended purpose of these convertors is to evaluate operating characteristics of the convertors in an integrated generator environment.	A test stand with ancillary equipment necessary to operate the ASC-E shall be provided.  Upon delivery and acceptance of the hardware, a pair of the convertors will be integrated on to the ASRG EU generator which is composed of primarily existing hardware and will ultimately be tested and characterized at NASA GRC.	Tasks related to the ASC-E development are as follows:   1.	The ASC-Es shall be similar in design and functionality as that currently planned for the ASC-2, with the exception of the heater head material and the thermal, structural, and electrical interfaces, which for the ASC-Es are required to match the ASRG interfaces.  During ASC-E development, the contractor and government shall mutually develop and agree to the product specifications, interfaces, and structural loads specification.	Trade studies, testing, performance predictions, analytical modeling, and hardware characterization shall be conducted to support system trades.	 The heat collector and cold-side adapter flange (CSAF), which provide the thermal interfaces for the ASC-E, will be provided to the contractor as Government Furnished Equipment (GFE).  The contractor shall develop joining processes between the ASC-E and these components. GFE shall also include the Inconel 718 material that will be used for the fabrication of the ASC-E heater heads. 2.

Extension of Period of Performance: The period of performance and related milestones of Option II (Phase III) shall be modified as described below: 1 – ASC-2 Final Design Review and fabrication start (1-17-07) 2 – First test of ASC-2  (8-13-07) 3 – ASC-2 qualification testing and delivery  (5-30-08) 4 – Final Review  (5-30-08) The following additional milestones related to this modification shall be added: 5 – Deliver two modified FTB convertors (built during Phase I) with test stand	(9-20-06) 6 – ASC-E Final Review (10-2-06) 7 - Support of ASRG Review (2-15-07) 8 – Deliver ASC-E #1 and #2 convertors (9-20-07) 9 – Deliver third ASC-E #3 convertor (10-15-07)  The period of performance shall conclude on May 30, 2008. GOVERNMENT FURNISHED PROPERTY: The following shall be provided to the contractor from the Government for the fabrication of the three ASC-Es.   1.	Cold-side Adapter Flange (CSAF).  The CSAFs are components which will be joined to the convertors during the fabrication process.  Quantity: Four (1 spare) 2.	Heat collector.  The heat collectors will be joined to the convertors during the assembly and fabrication process.  Quantity: Four (1 spare) 3.	Inconel 718 material.  This specific heat of material has been previously characterized by the government and shall be used for the fabrication of the ASC-E heater heads.	Quantity:  Sufficient for at least three heater heads. ADDITIONAL DELIVERABLES: 1.	Modified Phase I FTB convertors (Quantity 2) 2.	FTB Test Cart (Quantity 1) 3.	ASC-E convertors (Quantity 3) 4.	ASC-E Test Stand (Quantity 1) 5.	Documentation for FTBs and ASC-Es (drawings, test reports, etc. as described) 6.	ASC-E Summary Report NASA/GRC intends to purchase the items from SUNPOWER, of ATHENS, OHIO 45701.  Sunpower, under its current contract NAS3-03128, is uniquely capable of providing Sunpower's proprietary technology, along with designs and technologies that required substantial development during Phase I and Phase II of the contract.  Patented Sunpower technologies have been applied to the unique design of the convertor that allows the high efficiency and low mass characteristics of the ASC.  There would be substantial duplication of cost to the Government to award a contract for the additional ASC's to another vendor.  The new vendor would have to duplicate research efforts with no guarantee of success.  The cost and time involved would not be expected to be recovered using a competitive procurement. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See Note 26. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to Irene.Cierchacki-1@nasa.gov no later than 4;30 pm local time December 1, 2006. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the pu4rpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.	A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<CONTACT>Cathleen DeBerry Contracting Officer 3032364324     cathleen_deberry@fws.gov;
<DESC>The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Region 6, Lakewood, Colorado intends to award a non-competitive, sole source IDIQ Contract to Milliken Meats, Ltd for Toronto Carivore Diet for endangered black footed ferretsat the Black Footed  Ferret Facility, Carr, Colorado.  The requirement will be awarded as a commercial item in accordance with FAR Part 12. NO SOLICITATION IS AVAILABLE.  Early diets were patterned after mink farm programs and were problematic in availability of diet element components, preparation, labor, storage, and overall animal benefits (e.g. rabbit bone parts periodically caused clinical complications and death).  The American Zoo and Aquarium Association's, Black-footed Ferret Species Survival Plan (SSP) worked through several zoo nutritional specialists to examine possible diet alternatives; and with development of the Toronto Carnivore Diet undertook, both nutritional analyses specifically for ferrets and clinical comparisons of animal condition following feeding trials of multiple diets.  The Toronto Carnivore Diet was found to be superior for black-footed ferrets and is the recommended principal artificial diet for the species.  The Service concurs with the position of the SSP advisory group and has found that this diet results in better overall animal health, is easy to secure and store, and reduces labor and overall staff costs.  Contracting Officer:  Cathleen DeBerry, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Region 6, Denver, CO 303-236-4324.

<DESC>Notice of Intent to Procure Using Other Than Full and Open Competition

The General Services Administration (GSA) proposes to enter into a noncompetitive lease procurement using other than full and open competition with the State of Florida for housing of the long term space needs of the United States Southern Command (SOUTHCOM) in Doral, Florida.  The SOUTHCOM has a need for approximately 700,000 square feet of secured office and related space, and the State of Florida has offered 40 acres of State owned land at no-cost for the development of the needed space using the State's full and open competitive procedures in the selection of the developer/landlord.  The State of Florida has already officially started the procurement process for this proposed project.  More information about the State's procurement process is available by contacting the State of Florida, Departmental Purchasing, Department of Management
Services, 4050 Esplanade Way, Suite 280, Tallahassee, FL 32399-0950.  Due to the size and estimated cost, approval of a prospectus by the United States Congress is required for this proposed action.  Congressional approval has now been granted and GSA will proceed with award of the project to the State of Florida, now estimated to occur by December 22, 2006. In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.305, Availability of the Justification, a copy of the justification for other than full and open competition will be made available for public inspection. If you have questions about this proposed procurement, please contact Millie Toro, GSA Contracting Officer, at 400 West Bay Street, Suite 67, Ground Floor, P.O. Box 3, Jacksonville, FL 32202, or by e-mail at: Milagros.Toro@gsa.gov.

<DESC>The FAA intends to issue a contract for support services to the Office of Aviation Safety for the Aviation Safety Information Analysis and Sharing (ASIAS) Program located in Washington, DC, and currently being performed by a small business.  The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) promotes the open exchange of safety information in order to continuously improve aviation safety. To further this basic objective, the Office of Aviation Safety (AVS) is implementing the Aviation Safety Information Analysis and Sharing (ASIAS) program. The ASIAS program is a broad multi-dimensional government/industry effort to enhance significantly the safety performance of the aviation system through the development of state-of-the-art automated safety information/data analysis and sharing capabilities.  The current ASIAS automated support system houses one of the largest collections of aviation safety data/information in the world. The ASIAS system provides its users with a suite of analytical tools, which enable analysts to perform integrated queries across multiple databases and display pertinent elements in an array of useful formats. Additionally, the ASIAS system provides access to advanced analysis tools, such as data visualization and pattern recognition technologies. The ASIAS system capabilities aid aviation decision-makers, analyze complex relationships, and identify potential hazards not otherwise readily apparent. This announcement is a Market Survey used to solicit statements of interest and capabilities from SBA Certified 8(a) and Small Business concerns.   At this time the nature of the competition has not been determined. This market survey is being conducted in order to obtain the information necessary to aid the FAA in its determination as to whether adequate competition exists to set-aside the competition among eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses (SEDB) that are certified by the SBA for participation in the SBA's 8(a) Program, or whether it is more appropriate to conduct this procurement using other Small Business competitive procurement procedures.  The principal North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 541519, with a size standard of $21.0 Million.  Interested firms are required to submit the attached Business Declaration form and a copy of their SBA SEDB 8(a) Certification letter (if applicable).  The failure to obtain adequate and appropriate SBA SEDB 8(a) or other small business participation in this market survey may result in a determination to conduct this procurement under other competitive procedures.   The contractor shall furnish all personnel, materials, equipment and the services necessary to perform the requirements in the attached Statement of Work. The FAA intends to have any resultant contract in place by December 31, 2006.  The anticipated period of performance is one 12-month base period, with up to four (4) 12-month options. All responses (one response per company) are to be provided on company letterhead and limited to a total of 15 type-written pages. No type font less than 12-point may be used. Interested sources are required to provide the following:         (1) a capability summary describing the corporate approach to performing the work specified.  At a minimum it shall address the following: a)  The vendor's overall corporate structure from a technical perspective; i.e., how it is aligned (top-down) to oversee, manage and ensure quality services to the Customer  b)  The vendor's access to additional resources, skills, subcontractors, subject matter experts, etc., if necessary, to successfully perform the proposed effort  c)  The vendor's program management support, data analysis, planning techniques, and other resources to be employed in rendering the products and services described in the each of major tasks specified above  d)  The vendor's overarching cost and schedule management controls to be employed in performing the major tasks specified above  e)  The vendor's approach to ensure a smooth and seamless transition          (2) information concerning contracts which are considered relevant in demonstrating ability to perform the proposed effort for a Government agency or private company.   At a minimum, the description shall include the information below for contracts performed within the past three (3) years:   Project title/description Customer name  Project start-end dates  Project value  Client point of contact (POC) information including e-mail address and telephone number  Description of work performed  Description of why the work is relevant to the proposed effort  The FAA will not be liable for costs associated with the preparation and submittal of inquiries addressing this announcement.  Brochures alone will not be considered sufficient documentation for demonstration of capabilities.   Responses will not be returned.  This is not a request for competitive proposals and will not result in a contract award.  Since this is a sources sought announcement, no evaluation letters and/or results will be issued to the respondents. No collect calls or telephone inquiries will be accepted.  Since this is a sources sought announcement, no solicitation exists; therefore do not request a copy of the solicitation.  If a solicitation is issued, it will be synopsized on the FAA's contract opportunities web page.  It is the potential offeror's responsibility to monitor this site for the release of any solicitation.  All responses/submittals, including attachments, should be submitted electronically to the following email address: annette.harkless@faa.gov.  (Reference market survey DTFAAC-07-MS-00002). All responses/submittals, including attachments, should be submitted in either Microsoft Word, or portable document format (pdf).

The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), Directed Energy (DE) Contracting Directorate (PK) on behalf of the AFRL DE, Kirtland AFB, NM, intends to award a sole source contract in accordance with FAR subpart 6.302-1 (a)(2)(ii)(A) and FAR subpart 6.302-1 (a)(2)(iii)(A), ?Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements,? to the Marine Physical Lab (MPL) at the Scripps Institute of Oceanography, San Diego, CA, for providing real-time detection and identification of clouds throughout the diurnal cycle using Whole Sky Imagers (WSI's). The contemplated effort involves letting an indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity contract for a five-year period with a maximum total value of $9,500,000. 
BACKGROUND:  Various atmospheric phenomena can have an adverse effect on laser performance.  One of the most disruptive phenomena is clouds.  AFRL/DES intends to collect cloud coverage information at various locations and determine the temporal impact of cloudiness on laser operations under various climatic regimes.  The contractor will collect cloud information using WSI?s, research instruments that acquire digital imagery of the full sky dome 24 hours a day, through daylight, moonlight, and starlight conditions.  AFRL/DES currently has five WSI systems, each of which must be maintained, calibrated, and evaluated with a view towards improving data collection algorithms.  The Government may require additional WSI systems.  The MPL designed and built the currently fielded systems, and has maintained and developed the WSI?s since deployment.  MPL is capable of producing additional WSI systems as needed, and of modifying current systems to improve performance and facilitate data analysis. SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS are: 1) Maintain five AFRL- operated WSI systems at locations across the continental United States, including preventative maintenance, repair or replacement of failed components, coordination of minor system repairs with Government provided on-site caretakers, and software/hardware upgrades necessary to ensure continual data collection; 2) Perform calibration of fielded instruments and routine quality control of WSI acquired data; 3) Evaluate WSI capabilities, including day and night algorithm performance, applicability of data to cloud forecasting problems, capability to extract transmission both day and night, dynamic background calibrations, operation in stressing conditions such as high light levels, twilight, and strong haze, and any other area that both the contractor and AFRL determine beneficial to Government programs; 4) If required, implement system upgrades resulting from work accomplished under item 3; 5) If required, build and deploy additional WSIs at undetermined locations; 6) If required, analyze new wavelength imaging benefits to various Government programs, which may involve building and testing prototypes of new instruments; 7) If required, provide personnel trained in the WSI and its capabilities to analyze, develop software, document, develop minor hardware, and other tasks related to the WSI as the Government  determines appropriate.  Respondents must provide a statement of capability limited to 15 pages.  The Government may break out one or more of the above performance requirements for separate acquisition; respondents must demonstrate whether they can fulfill any or all of the above performance requirements by providing existing product literature including salient characteristics, describing relevant data owned and what additional data, if any, the respondent would require to accomplish that performance requirement, if selected. the Government will reject any responses not providing all information requested.  Submit statements of capability to Keith Kennedy, AFRL/PKDL, 2251 Maxwell Ave. SE, Kirtland AFB, NM 87117-5773 no later than fifteen (15) calendar days after the date of this announcement by 3:00 p.m., Mountain Standard Time (MST).  The proposed contract action requires research and development for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR subpart 6.301 (a)(2)(ii)(A) and 6.301 (a)(2)(iii)(A). Do not send a competitive proposal.  The Government retains sole discretion whether to compete this proposed contract action based upon responses to this notice. The Government will consider information received only to determine whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  As a result of analyzing responses to this synopsis of intent, the Contracting Officer may determine that the Government will issue a solicitation to those prospective sources, which, in the sole judgment of this purchasing activity, have the potential of successfully fulfilling the requirements. If the Government issues a sole source solicitation, the Government will not publish an additional synopsis. This is an unrestricted announcement under NAICS code 541710.  However, firms should indicate whether they are a small, woman-owned, qualifying 8(a), or certified Hub Zone small business; or whether they are a historically black college, university, and minority institution (HBCU/MI).  To receive a DoD contract, offerors must be registered in the DoD Central Contractor Registration (CCR) system and the US/Canada Joint Certification Program.  For more information and on-line registration with CCR, see http://www.ccr.dlis.dla.mil.  The Government anticipates that contractors will have access to, or will generate data that is unclassified with limited distribution or subject to U.S. Export Control laws.  Therefore, only offerors which the Defense Logistics Information Services (DLIS) certifies may submit offers.  Contact US/Canada Joint Certification Office, DLIS Federal Center, 74 Washington Ave. North, Battle Creek, MI 49017-3084 (1-800-352-3572); http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp/ for further information on certification and approval.

<DESC>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)/Johnson Space Center (JSC) may issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) for the design, development, certification, production, and sustaining engineering of a space suit system to meet the needs of the Constellation Program.	Industry is invited to submit a response to this inquiry to assist NASA in the planning for the Constellation Space Suit System (CSSS) acquisition development. The contemplated CSSS procurement is not a follow-on effort to any existing contract.   The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See Note 26. The initial Constellation Program missions to the International Space Station (ISS) are planned to begin as early as 2012, but no later than 2014.  The elements required for this phase include the Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV), Crew Launch Vehicle (CLV), necessary ground systems and a space suit system providing at least launch, entry and abort (LEA) and zero-gravity extravehicular activity (EVA) capability.	Lunar sortie missions are planned to begin as early as 2015, but no later than 2018.  The additional elements required for the lunar sortie phase include the Lunar Surface Access Module (LSAM) and any additional space suit system elements required to support surface EVA. The Constellation Program will require the following space suit capabilities:  1) Crew protection and survivability during LEA scenarios (including spacecraft depressurization, egress mobility and water survival), 2) Zero-gravity EVA for in-space EVA (including contingency crew transfer between vehicles), 3) Surface EVA capability for lunar sortie missions (less than two weeks), 4) Surface EVA capability for lunar outpost missions (up to six months), and 5) EVA capability for Mars missions. While the capabilities above are similar to those that were provided by the Apollo suit, there are significant differences in the objectives for the Constellation Program.  Some of the objectives being contemplated include: minimize life cycle cost; minimize system operational overhead over the entire suit use cycle; minimize system mass, volume, and work-efficiency overhead; maximize unpressurized mobility to allow crewmembers to operate vehicle systems and to perform in emergency situations; maximize EVA capability while limiting impact on unpressurized suit volume, weight, comfort, and other attributes necessary to fulfill the crew survival function; maximize quick donning capabilities; accommodate the full-range of flight crew anthropometries while minimizing the required suit logistics; maximize reliability and minimize maintenance requirements; minimize operational/design constraints for conducting lunar surface operations with respect to geographical location and solar/thermal conditions.  Incorporate, where appropriate, design flexibility and modularity to allow for efficient incorporation of upgrades.  The Government believes that the packaging and inherent technologies of current or heritage flight systems will not adequately achieve these objectives.  The Government anticipates that new technologies and new schemes for packaging subsystems will be necessary for development of a multi-capability suit and has begun performing trades and maturing certain key technologies. NASA is considering a single space suit system to provide the space suit capabilities outlined above.  A single space suit system has the potential for savings in development, certification, and sustaining engineering costs, as well as reductions in required upmass and volume through commonality between the various elements of the space suit system.  The development of the space suit system will require several trades between use of common elements versus use of hardware designed uniquely to meet specific performance objectives.  The initial effort, referred to as Block I for ease of reference, would consist of the design, development, certification, production, and sustaining engineering for elements of the space suit system necessary to provide LEA and zero-gravity contingency EVA capability for the CEV at a minimum.  The next phase of the effort, referred to as Block II, would consist of the design, development, certification, production, and sustaining engineering for any additional elements of the space suit system necessary to support lunar sortie missions, as well as Block I mission capabilities.  The required capabilities include LEA (including long term survival in a depressurized spacecraft), zero-gravity contingency EVA and lunar surface sortie EVA capabilities.  Later phases of the space suit system effort will consist of the design, development, certification, production, and sustaining engineering for elements necessary to support lunar outpost missions, as well as Block I and II mission capabilities.  Later phases/blocks may be developed to support Mars exploration.	If this approach is adopted, each block upgrade would be considered complete, in that the Government intends to only sustain one block version of the suit system at a time.   Additionally, the Government is contemplating including the ability to provide EVA capability to the ISS as a part of the Constellation Space Suit System.  This effort, referred to as Block IA, would provide zero-gravity EVA capability to support ISS maintenance and utilization EVAs similar to that currently provided by the Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU).  Block IA will only be pursued if it offers advantages over the EMU in terms of cost or technical performance.  In order to maximize the potential cost benefits, Block IA should be targeted for delivery as soon as possible after Block I. NASA may issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) to support Block I and II in the second quarter of calendar year 2007.	NASA is contemplating requesting an option to provide the Block IA capabilities as a part of this RFP.  The Government may issue a solicitation or solicitations for a contract or contracts to support lunar outpost and Mars mission space suit capabilities at a later time. The Government is currently considering the following schedule for Blocks I and II: Block I and II System Readiness Review (SRR)	Apr 2007 RFP Release	May 2007 Contract Award	Nov 2007 Block I First Flight Ship Set Delivery	Feb 2013	Goal of 2011 Block II First Flight Ship Set Delivery Jun 2018	Goal of 2015 The Block I date of Feb 2013 represents the Government’s need date to support the planned first CEV mission to the ISS.  The goal date of 2011 represents the Government’s desire to accelerate the planned schedule for the first CEV mission to the ISS.  The Block II date of Jun 2018 represents the Government’s need date to support the planned first CEV lunar sortie mission.  The goal date of 2015 represents the Government’s desire to accelerate the planned schedule for the first CEV lunar sortie mission.       The Government has significant capabilities that could be utilized throughout the development of the space suit system.  These include expertise in EVA and LEA suit design and operations.   NASA continues to maintain a significant amount of in-house expertise specifically in the areas of advanced suit development, human rating testing, crew evaluation, sustaining engineering, and flight processing.  This experience also includes that of the ultimate end-user, the crew.  As opposed to other space flight hardware procurement efforts, suit development may be unique in that many aspects of the design are subjective and therefore development may require additional iterations to adequately incorporate crew considerations.  Also, the Government has unique facilities such as human rated vacuum chambers and ground test articles that might be utilized by the Contractor in support of human rating certification and training.  Further information pertaining to facilities that NASA can provide will be incorporated in the industry day presentations and published to the procurement website.  The Government is considering structuring the initial contract for the space suit system in a manner that will allow full and open competition for any follow-on contracts.  Therefore, it is expected that the contractor will provide to the Government all system drawings, construction documents, procedures, etc. developed under the contract.  While the Contractor shall be responsible for configuration management of all documents, copies of the documents shall be submitted to JSC’s document and drawing system upon approval.  The Government is expecting that all data and procedures developed under the initial contract will be owned by the Government and that there will be no proprietary designs or processes owned by the Contractor or its subcontractors for this suit system. The Government is seeking input on how to best implement the strategies outlined above.  Parties are asked to provide information on:  1)  Responder’s technical capability to design, develop, certify, produce, and sustain a space suit system to provide the multiple capabilities needed to support the Constellation Program.  2)  The technical feasibility and challenges in meeting the objectives for the space suit system.  3)  The recommended approach to developing and initially delivering at minimum the LEA and zero-gravity EVA and lunar sortie EVA capabilities. 4)  Comments and recommendations on the strategy to maintain system commonality including thoughts on elements of the system which might be common between the capabilities and comments on a strategy for certification of an evolving system.  5)  Comments on approach to maturing and infusing technologies needed to meet program objectives. 6) Suggestions on the optimal contract structure, including fee structure and optimal period of performance. 7)  Suggestions on how the capabilities resident in the Government would be utilized.  8)  Suggestions on how to implement the Government owned drawings and processes plan.  9)  Suggest a schedule that would provide the required suit capabilities to meet the planned ISS missions and lunar sortie missions, including interim milestone dates (i.e. CDR, certification, unit delivery, etc.).  Include discussion of the feasibility and risk assessment of accelerating the schedule to meet the Government goal dates (including comments on how early a lunar sortie capability meeting the program objective could be delivered).  10)  Contractor owned physical assets and facilities that could be used to meet the objectives.  11)  Comments regarding geographical location of Contractor products and services, and how you would interface with the project office and user located at JSC Houston, Texas during sustaining and processing project timeframe. 12) Comments on general approach, cost savings, schedule, and risks associated with delivery of ISS based zero-gravity EVA suit system).

<CONTACT>Point of Contact, Pamela Smith, Purchasing Agent, Phone (919) 541-0635
<DESC>NAICS Code: 334111   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) intends to negotiate a sole source purchase order under Simplified Acquisition Procedures to Linux Networx Inc., 14944 Pony Express Road, Bluffdale, UT 84065 for the acquisition of 21-node Evolocity II system upgrade. The Exposure Dose Research Branch (EDRB)  is developing exposure to dose and microenvironmental exposure models for use in exposure and risk assessments. Clients are varied and come from various Agency programs and offices. The exposure related dose estimation model(ERDEM) is one of the central  modeling platform used by EDRB to carry out risk assessments for clients such as OPP. monte Carlo/Sensitivity (up to 20000 simulations) and is prohibitive in terms of execution times (0.5hr/simulation x 20000 = 10,00 hours, versus 1 year = 8760 hours). Also, potential use of ERDEM in exposure  reconstruction would like wise require a large number of simulation runs. EDRB has addressed this time issue by porting ERDEM to a clustered, parallel High Performance Computing (HPC) environment. The current system is a small cluster consisting of nine compute nodes, which has been used to  demonstrate the feasibility of this approach. At this time, EDRB need to increase the number of compute nodes in the current cluster to extend its capability. Linux Networx is the manufacture of the original cluster  and any additions to the cluster must be procured from Linux Networx.  The cluster  is an integrated system, and the compute nodes are internal components that are interlinked and communicate with the cluster control node, using Linux Networx protocols. In order to ensure data compatibility and accuracy the circumstance permitting is FAR 13.106(B) "only one source reasonably  available".  The intent of this notice is to determine if any other source(s) exist, and therefore, no solicitation (RFQ) is available. Consequently, any response failing to provided the aforementioned data and instead choosing to merely submit a routine letter requesting a copy of the RFQ will be  ignored. The information received in response to this notice will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct a competitive procurement.  Interested parties who can meet the above requirements may submit written qualification statements, fully explaining their  capability no later than 10 days after the date of this publication. Submit response to the U.S. EPA, Attn: Pamela E. Smith (MC-E105-02),RTP Procurement Operations Division, Research Triangle Park, NC 27711,  by fax (919)541-1075 or by e-mail at smith.pamela@epa.gov .

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>UPDATE:  The Service has published an official Errata #1 to the Prospectus that includes the National Park Service¿s answers to questions submitted and resulting amendments.  The Errata is posted on http://concessions.nps.gov/prospectus.cfm. NOTE:  The NPS will continue to post additional information regarding this opportunity, please reference the National Park Service Concession website at http://www.concessions.nps.gov/Prospectus.cfm. The National Park Service intends to issue a prospectus for a new ten-year contract term for commercial visitor services at the North Rim in Grand Canyon National Park.  The prospectus will generally cover the services and facilities currently operated by Xanterra Parks and Resorts, Inc.  Parties interested in submitting an offer for this business opportunity can view the properties during a scheduled site visit on Thursday, October 12, 2006. The National Park Service expects to issue the prospectus prior to the beginning of the 2007 operating season, when facilities will be inaccessible due to winter weather.  A pre-bid site visit has been scheduled in order to allow interested parties an opportunity to see the facilities while they are open.  The site visit will begin at 9 a.m. in the auditorium of the main lodge and will conclude no later than 5:00 p.m.  Following an overview of the business opportunity, and an explanation of the bidding process, there will be an opportunity to tour some of the related facilities. The National Park Service Concessions Management Improvement Act of 1998 brings more competition into the concessions contracting process.  As a result of this Act, the current concessioner does not have a preference in the renewal of its contract.  This will be the first competitive bidding process for this business opportunity Facilities included as part of this business opportunity are the historic main lodge with 223 lodging units including historic cabins and motel rooms,  restaurant, café, bar, gift shop, camper store, shower and laundry, service station, and employee housing.  The average annual gross receipts for the past three years from this operation is approximately 8.1 million dollars. For information regarding the site visit (including site visit materials and attendance)  and the upcoming Prospectus release, please visit the National Park Service Concessions website at http://www.concessions.nps.gov/Prospectus.cfm. For additional information and to make reservations to attend the site visit, please call Laura Shearin, Concessions Specialist, at 928-226-0169 by 5 p.m. MST Wednesday, October 4th, 2006.

<DESC>The Navstar Global Systems Positioning Wing intends to release Request for Proposal number FA8807-07-R-0001 for the Next Generation GPS Control Segment (OCX) on 6 November 2007.
The Navstar GPS is a satellite-based radio navigation system that serves military and civil users worldwide.  GPS users process satellite signals to determine accurate position, velocity, and time.  GPS is an Acquisition Category 1D program.  GPS must comply with 10 United State Code (USC)  2281, which requires that the Secretary of Defense ensures the continued sustainment and operation of GPS for military and civilian purposes; and 42 USC  14712, which requires that GPS comply with certain standards and facilitates international cooperation.  This acquisition executes those statutory mandates.  The NAICS code for this acquisition is 541710 and the size standard used is 1,000 employees.
OCX will provide command, control, and mission support for the GPS Block II and III satellites as well as support to existing and new interfaces.  OCX, in conjunction with the modernization of the GPS Block II and the introduction of GPS Block III assures reliable and secure delivery of enhanced position and timing signals to serve the evolving needs of GPS military and civil users.

The Raytheon facility may be accessed from any entry along El Segundo Blvd. or the west gate off of South Hughes Way and Sepulveda Blvd. (see accompanying area map at the end of this synopsis for further directions).     Once on the Raytheon facility follow the white signs that say, ?LA AFB Parking? to the Los Angeles Air Force base parking area.     Participants should take the Aerospace B route Shuttle to the Los Angeles Air Force base.     The Aerospace B route Shuttle runs continuously every 10 minutes to and from the Los Angeles Air Force base. 


INDUSTRY DAY:  An industry day will be conducted at the Los Angeles Air Force Base, Gordon Conference Center, Bldg 270, 483 North Aviation Blvd., El Segundo, CA 90245-2808 on 24 October 2006, 0900 - 1100 hours for the purpose of discussing the DRAFT Request for Proposal (RFP) [RFP # FA8807-06-R-0003] and answering questions regarding the Systems Engineering and Integration (SE&I) effort.

<CONTACT>Tonya Lovelace Contracting Officer 7037871109     tonya.lovelace@mms.gov;
<DESC>THIS IS FOR INFORMATION GATHERING PURPOSES ONLY. The Government is investigating possible sources for the production and sustainment of a weapons fire detection and identification system for ground and aerial employment.  This system must include a sensing, processing, display, and a wired and/or wireless information dissemination capability and a computer-based training capability for sustainment training in the field.  The system must provide real-time detection, classification, and location of weapons firings based on their infrared signatures with minimum false alarms.  The sensor portion of the system must meet the space, weight, and power requirements of current and future military medium range unmanned aerial vehicles.  A single sensor must be capable of detections in a 90 degree field of view minimum and have the ability to interoperate with other sensors to provide 360 degrees of coverage.  The system must detect, identify, and locate small arms, mortars, rocket propelled grenades, man-portable anti-aircraft weapons, tanks, and artillery.  System must provide real-time display of fired munitions and capable of dissemination of the information detected via existing voice and/or data military architectures using the appropriate USMTF message format.  Anti-tampering hardware and software must be integrated into the design.  The system must be adaptable to mount on a HMMWV, other military ground vehicles, towers, tripods, aerostats, or aircraft and operate on 18-36 Volt DC power. Respondents to this sources sought must provide performance data for their candidate system. Should the Government decide to further pursue this requirement, respondents should be prepared to demonstrate performance of their system in a ground employment configuration against government selected targets from the above list at a government test range within 30 days of notification.  The Government will be responsible for range and target availability.  In addition, respondents must demonstrate a production capability for 1 to 25 systems within 180 days of initial order and the ability to perform training and sustainment functions at worldwide locations.

<DESC>The Marine Corps Systems Command, Program Manager for Ammunition, desires the acquisition of the following commercial off-the-shelf, non-developmental items: 1) Cartridge, 9mm FX Blue Marking (DODIC: AA21)  Item Description: The Cartridge, 9mm FX Blue Marking (DODIC AA21) is utilized with the M16A2, M4A1 Carbine, Sig Sauer P226 Pistol, M9, and the MP5 Submachine Gun when the weapon is modified with the M9 Special Effects Small Arms Marking System (SESAMS) Adapter Kit. Weapons fitted with the training adapters will operate semi or full automatic simulating live fire.  2) Cartridge, 9mm FX Red Marking (DODIC: AA12)  Item Description: The Cartridge, 9mm FX Red Marking (DODIC AA12) is utilized with the M16A2, M4A1 Carbine, Sig Sauer P226 Pistol, M9, and the MP5 Submachine Gun when the weapon is modified with the M9 Special Effects Small Arms Marking System (SESAMS) Adapter Kit. Weapons fitted with the training adapters will operate semi or full automatic simulating live fire.  The intended use for these cartridges is to provide enhanced training by allowing force-on-force training versus firing at silhouette on impact. When the round impacts a target, the plastic projectile sheath breaks and detergent marks the target, thus indicating a hit. This cartridge consists of a composite brass/plastic cartridge case loaded with a plastic projectile filled with a fluorescent red, detergent based, non-toxic, washable, inert paste and is propelled by a conventional lead styphnate primer containing approximately .02 grams of GBSE propellant. The overall cartridge length is approximately 1.120 inches, and the weight is approximately 4.30 grams.

<DESC>This synopsis is being posted to the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website located at http://www.fbo.gov, the Navy Electronic Commerce Online (NECO) website located at http://www.neco.navy.mil, and the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division Acquisition website at http://www.crane.navy.mil/supply/homepage.htm.  FBO is the primary point of entry to be used when accessing synopses and solicitations from the World Wide Web.  However, the NECO webpage, as well as the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division Acquisition webpage, serve as alternatives if the FBO website is unavailable. Sources and Information Sought The US Government (government) is issuing this announcement in search of a family of three types of .50 caliber rifle rounds whose ballistic flight paths, from the muzzle out to 2000 yards, are matched to each other, such that they generally fly the same path to target.  The government is looking for a .50 caliber ball (FMJ) round, a .50 caliber armor piercing (AP) round, and a .50 caliber armor piercing incendiary (API) round.  The rounds are intended for use in a .50 caliber Mk 15 rifle (McMillan M88 PIP).  All three rounds should be of the .50 caliber Browning M2HB variety.  The FMJ round projectile should basically be of the M2 or M33 ball configuration, the AP round projectile should basically be of the AP-M2 configuration, and the API round projectile should basically be of the API-M8 configuration.  The nominal weight of any of the three projectile types should not be less than 700 grains, all three projectile types should weigh the same within a nominal 5 grain spread from lightest to heaviest, and all three projectile types should have nominally the same outer size and shape. The corrected muzzle velocity of any projectile type, when measured at an instrumental distance of 78 feet from the muzzle, should not be less than 2600 fps under Standard Metro Conditions of 59°F temperature, 29.53 inches Hg pressure, and 78% relative humidity. Ballistically, concerning the desired impact pattern of a group of fired shots, the FMJ round should exhibit a 1 MOA (minute of angle) maximum extreme spread (ES) variation out to 2000 yards distance.  The AP and API rounds should each exhibit a 3 MOA maximum ES variation out to 2000 yards distance.  The calculated centers of impact of a group of fired shots of each type round, at any distance out to 2000 yards, should all fall within a 1 MOA circular area.

<CONTACT>Wanda Owens, Contract Specialist, Phone 4109658095, Fax 4109659560, Email wanda.owens@ssa.gov
<DESC>The Social Security Administration (SSA) mandates the State Disability Determination Services (DDS) in each state to perform determinations of disability for the residents of that state who file for Social Security disability benefits. In addition to each of the 50 states, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and the territorial governments of Guam and the U.S. Virgin Islands have established DDS entities. SSA has also established a Federal DDS, which, among other functions, serves as a test-bed of policy and procedure for the disability program. SSA receives over two million initial disability claims each year.  

In fiscal year 2003, SSA awarded a FSS BPA with IBM for the purchase of IBM ?System i? (then known as AS/400) equipment, software, and related services in support of the state and federal DDS programs.  As a result, virtually every state and the federal DDS site uses IBM ?System i? mid-range processors and associated software products for case processing.  There are 52 IBM ?System i? systems in the SSA/DDS enterprise currently.  The ?IBM ?System i? infrastructure has been proven to be robust, scalable, and the performance of these products and services have been satisfactory.  SSA?s current BPA with IBM will expire in FY 2008. Given SSA?s substantial investment in and reliance upon the ?System i? infrastructure, SSA has determined that it is in SSA?s and public?s interest to maintain uninterrupted and continuous use of IBM?s ?System i? products and related services.

Previous market research has indicated that only one source of supply/service (IBM) is capable of meeting all of the requirements related to SSA?s current and evolving DDS infrastructure. In accordance with the guidance at FAR 6.302-1 the SSA is seeking to determine if IBM is the only source capable of meeting SSA?s requirements, or if other sources exist that can satisfy these requirements. Specifically, the SSA is attempting to determine if another source can provide SSA with:
 
1)	nationwide/ enterprise-wide support services for the current and evolving IBM ?System i?  infrastructure at all state and federal DDS locations without any change or disruption to the current infrastructure;
2)	products that can integrate into the current IBM ?System i? infrastructure at all state and federal DDS locations without substantial change or disruption to the current infrastructure; 
3)	IBM proprietary software products, licenses, and/or maintenance for those products at all state and federal DDS locations without any change or disruption to the current infrastructure;
4)	training in Agency use of IBM ?System i?  hardware, peripherals, and software at all state and federal DDS locations without any change or disruption to the current infrastructure; and,
5)	associated additional services (such as expert trouble-shooting, PM/400, Alert and Account Advocate) at all state and federal DDS locations without any change or disruption to the current infrastructure.

Vendors having the capability and experience to provide the supplies and services detailed herein are invited to submit complete details regarding their technical capabilities and expertise. Vendor capability statements MUST include the following: 1) Demonstrated success in supporting the IBM ?System i? platform, 2) demonstrated knowledge of, and familiarity with, the three major case-processing systems in use in the DDSs, and, 3) a detailed explanation of the strategy that will be used to support the large SSA and DDS enterprise, which must individually address the services outlined above.  

The Government will consider all responses to this notice, but a determination by the Government to conduct a sole source acquisition remains at the discretion of the Government. Information submitted in response to this notice will be considered solely for the purpose of determining the feasibility of conducting a competitive procurement, and the Government will not pay for any information submitted. This notice is neither a request for quotation nor an announcement of a forthcoming solicitation. Requests for copies of a solicitation will not be honored or acknowledged. 

Information must be submitted in writing to Wanda Owens, Contract Specialist, via email at Wanda.Owens@ssa.gov. Responses must be received by 3:00 p.m. EST on October 31, 2006. If no viable responses are received by October 31, 2006, the Government will establish a BPA with the IBM Corporation.

<CONTACT>Deborah Gilligan, 732-532-5454
<DESC>The US Army Project Manager, Night Vision/Reconnaissance, Surveillance and Target Acquisition (PM NV/RSTA) is conducting a Market Survey to identify potential sources to provide a weapons-fire detection system for tactical forces.  The objective is t o provide a real-time detection, classification, and location of weapons in complex terrain and at standoff ranges that enable precise engagement of combatant shooters or automatic cross-cuing of other sensors for target confirmation to allow rapid underst anding of the situation in support of Joint Urban Operations.  Sources will be required to provide evidence, as listed below, that they have the capability to build, produce and test a system with the following characteristics:  while stationary and on the  move, must be able to detect, classify from ground and airborne platforms (small arms or large caliber [e.g., 5.56mm, 7.62mm, 50 Cal], RPG, mortar or MANPAD) weapons firing.  The system must also determine the precise, targeting-quality location of the we apons-fire event and display the classification/location in a 3-D location and imagery of the threat or cue an imager and allow that to produce the imagery.  As well as format a standard message (USMTF, VMF, and JVMF) which can be forwarded through Army ta ctical communications to a tactical operations center, to another similarly equipped unit in the local area or automatically cross-cue another sensor.  A prototype at the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 7 is required.  This response is for information and  planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government for an award of a contract, nor will the Government pay for information solicited.  Responses to this RFI may be used to help scope and refine requirements for a formal RF P at a later date.  The capabilities of the system are as follows: 1 - Capabilities: 1.1 - The PROTOTYPE shall be capable of providing a 360 degree azimuth coverage as an objective; 1.2 - The PROTOTYPE shall provide coverage in elevation of at least 30-degrees; 1.3 - The PROTOTYPE shall have the capability to detect, clas sify, locate and report multiple threats; 1.4 - The PROTOTYPE shall detect and declare each threat at a distance greater than the effective range of the threat weapon system. The specified range performance of the PROTOTYPE shall be treated as classified i nformation; 1.5 - The PROTOTYPE shall require a Probability of Detection (Pd) of 90% (threshold) with an objective of better than 90%; 1.6 - The PROTOTYPE shall require a Probability of Classification (Pc) of 80%; 1.7 - The PROTOTYPE shall be capable of pr oviding sufficient target position, (i.e., azimuth and elevation or grid location) of the threat to hand off to another sensor or system for prosecution or further hand-off; 1.8	- The PROTOTYPE shall be capable of classifying the type of threat weapon (i.e  small arms or large caliber [5.56mm, 7.62mm, 50 Cal], RPG, mortar or MANPAD); 1.9 - The PROTOTYPE shall have a low false alarm rate from manmade and natural events; 1.10 - The PROTOTYPE shall have the capability to automatically store associated detection , geo-location and weapon classification information for post operation analysis, both when stationary and on the move; 1.11 - The PROTOTYPE shall have the capability to zoom in on detected threats, day and night and in ambient weather conditions; 1.12 - T he PROTOTYPE shall be able to be mounted on a tripod, a vehicle or air platform.  Threshold: independent system (i.e., tripod or yoke).  Objective: gimble and/or other means to attach to other systems (i.e., UAVs, UGVs, Fixed wings, Rotary wings); 1.13 - T he PROTOTYPE is expected to be capable of providing both analog and digital imagery outputs; 1.14 - The PROTOTYPE shall have low latency warning for timely action and response to sniper activities; 1.15 - The PROTOTYPE shall be operable within 10 minutes f rom power turn on; 1.16 - The PROTOTYPE shall be enclosed and protected from the elements; 1 .17	- The PROTOTYPE shall operate at high temperatures with an objective of 160 degrees F ambient (71 degrees C); 1.18 -The PROTOTYPE shall operate at low temperatures with an objective of minus 51degrees F ambient (minus 46 degrees C); 1.19 - The PROTOTYP E shall operate on standard military power, battery power, and aircraft power and also be able to power down when there is loss of power; 1.20 -The PROTOTYPE shall be capable of being readily moved from one platform to another;  1.21	When the PROTOYPE is mounted on a platform with a weapon, the PROTOTYPE shall be able to distinguish between hostile and friendly firing. 2.Requested Information: 2.1 - Describe the system and how it meets the above capabilities; 2.2 - State the m aturity of the PROTOTYPE (i.e., developmental, or production).

<DESC>This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; offers are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This notice is being issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP) for real-time sign language interpreter services in support of meetings attended by deaf/hearing impaired NASA/KSC employees or others, guests or viewers of NASA-sponsored gatherings, and direct support to individual deaf/hearing impaired NASA/KSC employees in the conduct of their official duties. The ability to call upon interpreter services on a real-time basis will require the availability of on site interpreter services Monday through Friday during the core hours of 8:30 AM through 11:30 AM and 1:00 PM through 4:00 PM. The interpreter(s) would effectively be on demand during these core hours time periods to provide services at KSC wherever needed.  In addition, there may be events and activities outside of core hours or events and activities scheduled concurrently during core hours that require interpreter services.  KSC’s Office of Diversity and Equal Opportunity will establish a calendar (hereinafter referred to as the “Ordering Calendar”) reflecting the times and contacts for services.	 The provisions and clauses in the RFP are those in effect through FAC 05-12.  This procurement is a total small business set-aside. See Note 1.  The NAICS Code and the small business size standard for this procurement are 541930 and $6.5 million respectively.  The offeror shall state in their offer their size status for this procurement.  All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. The DPAS rating for this procurement is DO-C9. Offers for the items(s) described above are due by November 20, 2006, 4:00 PM EST to NASA John F. Kennedy Space Center, Procurement Office–Operations Support, Mail Code: OP-OS/Attention: Marcus Orr, Kennedy Space Center, FL 32899, and must include, solicitation number, FOB destination to this Center, proposed delivery schedule, discount/payment terms, warranty duration (if applicable), taxpayer identification number (TIN), identification of any special commercial terms, and be signed by an authorized company representative.   Offerors shall provide the information required by FAR 52.212-1 (JAN 2006), Instructions to Offerors-Commercial, which is incorporated by reference. If the end product(s) offered is other than domestic end product(s) as defined in the clause entitled "Buy American Act -- Supplies," the offeror shall so state and shall list the country of origin. FAR 52.212-4  (SEPT 2005), Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items is applicable.  FAR 52.212-5  (JUNE 2006), Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial Items is applicable and the applicable clauses are incorporated in the attached RFP. The FAR may be obtained via the Internet at URL:  http://www.acquisition.gov/far/index.html  The NFS may be obtained via the Internet at URL:  http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/procurement/regs/nfstoc.htm All contractual and/or technical questions must be in writing (email or FAX) to Marcus Orr (marcus.c.orr@nasa.gov or 321-867-1141) not later than Monday, November 6, 2006 at 10:00 AM EST.  Telephone questions will not be accepted. The Government plans to use the tradeoff process described in FAR 15.101-1 in the evaluation of proposals.  This process allows the Government to consider award to other than the lowest price offeror when, in its judgment, a higher priced proposal provides benefits that merit the additional cost.  The simple fact that a higher cost proposal is rated higher than lower cost proposals does not necessarily justify award.  The benefits of a higher rated, higher cost proposal must be judged to be sufficient to warrant the higher cost and the amount of the higher cost must be judged to be both reasonable and “worth” the benefits. The Government shall make award to the offeror/proposal representing the best value to the Government. The following relative weights will be used by when assessing proposals in order to make an award decision: The Technical Plan is significantly more important than Cost/Pricing; the sub-factors under the Technical Plan are of equal importance.  Past Performance is more important than Cost/Pricing.  Past Performance and Cost/Pricing, when considered together, are somewhat equal to the Technical Plan. Offerors must include completed copies of the provision at 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items with their offer. These may be obtained via the internet at URL: http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/eps/Templates/Commercial_Greater_Than_25K.doc. These representations and certifications will be incorporated by reference in any resultant contract. An ombudsman has been appointed -- See NASA Specific Note "B".

Potential offerors will be responsible for downloading their own copy of this combination synopsis/solicitation and amendments (if any).

<DESC>The awarded contract shall provide the Department of State's Office of Medical Services (MED) with clincial laboratory testing services.  MED performs physical exams to determine availability of Foreign Service Officers and their families to assignments overseas to approximately 200 embassies and consulates.  As such, the Office of Medical Services performs 6500 to 7000 physical examinations per year that require laboratory tests and results.  Although most testing is done in house, some tests cannot be performed within the Office of Medical Services and must be sent out for testing.  The Office of Medical Services also receives samples from overseas activities for testing.  Although most of these are done in-house, some of these tests are required to be sent out for testing.   Further, our overseas posts will be required to send some time sensitive tests directly to the testing laboratory to maintain the viability of the sample.
