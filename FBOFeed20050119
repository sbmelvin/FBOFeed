<DESC>The U.S. Postal Service, Supply Management Facilities Portfolio office, is issuing a Qualification Statement for a regional prequalification of design/build firms. The objectives of regional prequalification are as follows: (1) Prequalify design/build on a program basis. (2) To reduce the administrative burden associated with project specific prequalification. (3) Identify a number of sufficient highly qualified firms by geographic area to achieve adequate competition when required.

Interested design/build firms must submit a Qualification Statement that covers the following parameters: (1) Geographic Areas: Northeast, South, Central and West (2) Contract Vehicle: Design/Build (3) Project Dollar Threshold: $10 to 40 million, $40 to 100 million, $100 million and above. It is not required that interested firms apply for prequalification in all areas. The USPS seeks to prequalify only the most highly qualified design/build firms in each of the defined geographical areas. 

The Postal Service will select the most qualified design/build firms utilizing only the information provided in the Qualification Statement. Because prequalification is a competitive process, meeting the minimum requirements in the Qualification Statement will not guarantee prequalification. Design/build firms that document superior capabilities performance, and experience, will receive the maximum number of points.  A committee appointed by the contracting officer will evaluate Qualification Statements submitted by the due date. 

Respondents must have a minimum of five (5) years experience as a Design/Build Entity and completion or ongoing of three (3) comparable construction projects within the past five (5) years for projects of $10 million to $40 million, and $40 million to $100 million.

Respondents must have a minimum of five (5) years experience as a Design/Build Entity and completion or ongoing of one (1) comparable construction projects within the past five (5) years for projects over $100 million. 

For the purpose of this prequalification a comparable project is defined as follows: for projects $10 million to $40 million, and $40 million to $100 million - Industrial / manufacturing buildings used for processing and distribution. For projects over $100 million - Industrial / manufacturing buildings used for processing and distribution or other projects of similar or greater complexity - New construction, expansion, major repair and alteration, phased construction in occupied facilities. Projects that include mechanization and / or automation installed by the design builder are preferred and may receive a higher rating. Projects that most closely resemble a USPS mail processing distribution facility in function, structure, systems, etc may also receive a higher rating.

Prequalified design/build firms will be automatically notified for any qualifying project in the geographic area for which the firm is prequalified. Based on this notification the firm may request a copy of the solicitation. The solicitation will not be provided automatically. The USPS does not guarantee a specific number of solicitations will be issued during the prequalification period. The USPS at its’ sole discretion reserves the right to conduct project specific prequalification at any time. Prequalified firms will not be required to re-apply for prequalification. Firms shall be prequalified for a period of 5 years from the date of notification. Renewal: The USPS, at its sole discretion, may extend a firm’s prequalification term for an additional 3 years. This decision will be based on but not limited to performance, capabilities, financial condition, and responsiveness.

<DESC>The U.S. Postal Service, Supply Management Facilities Portfolio office, is issuing a Qualification Statement for a regional prequalification of construction contractors. The objectives of regional prequalification are as follows: (1) Prequalify construction contractors on a program basis. (2) To reduce the administrative burden associated with project specific prequalification. (3) Identify a number of sufficient highly qualified contractors by geographic area to achieve adequate competition when required.

Interested construction contractors must submit a Qualification Statement that covers the following parameters: (1) Geographic Areas: Northeast, South, Central and West (2) Contract Vehicle: Design/Build (3) Project Dollar Threshold: $10 to 40 million, $40 to 100 million, $100 million and above. It is not required that interested firms apply for prequalification in all areas. The USPS seeks to prequalify only the most highly qualified construction contractors in each of the defined geographical areas. 

The Postal Service will select the most qualified construction contractors utilizing only the information provided in the Qualification Statement. Because prequalification is a competitive process, meeting the minimum requirements in the Qualification Statement will not guarantee prequalification. Construction contractors that document superior capabilities performance, and experience, will receive the maximum number of points.  A committee appointed by the contracting officer will evaluate Qualification Statements submitted by the due date. 

Respondents must have a minimum of five (5) years experience as a construction contractor and completion or ongoing of three (3) comparable construction projects within the past five (5) years for projects of $10 million to $40 million, and $40 million to $100 million.

Respondents must have a minimum of five (5) years experience as a Design/Build Entity and completion or ongoing of one (1) comparable construction projects within the past five (5) years for projects over $100 million. 

For the purpose of this prequalification a comparable project is defined as follows: for projects $10 million to $40 million, and $40 million to $100 million - Industrial / manufacturing buildings used for processing and distribution: For projects over $100 million - Industrial / manufacturing buildings used for processing and distribution or other projects of similar or greater complexity - New construction, expansion, major repair and alteration, phased construction in occupied facilities. Projects that include mechanization and / or automation installed by the construction contractor are preferred and may receive a higher rating. Projects that most closely resemble a USPS mail processing distribution facility in function, structure, systems, etc may also receive a higher rating.


Prequalified construction contractors will be automatically sent a notice for any qualifying project in the geographic area for which the firm is prequalified. Based on this notification the firm may request a copy of the solicitation. A solicitation will not be provided automatically. The USPS does not guarantee a specific number of solicitations will be issued during the prequalification period. The USPS at its’ sole discretion reserves the right to conduct project specific prequalification at any time. Prequalified firms will not be required to re-apply for prequalification. Contractors shall be prequalified for a period of 5 years from the date of notification. Renewal: The USPS, at its sole discretion, may extend a firm’s prequalification term for an additional 3 years. This decision will be based on but not limited to performance, capabilities, financial condition, and responsiveness. 

A preproposal meeting will be held at 1:00 PM on February 22, 2005 at 4301 Wilson Blvd. Suite 300, Arlington, VA 22203-1840.
 
Qualification packages are available now and may be obtained by email request to Bill Powell at bill.powell@usps.gov or Tim Bonsall at tbonsall@email.usps.gov or written request to either at 4301 Wilson Blvd. Suite 300, Arlington, VA 22203-1840.

<DESC>In accordance with FAR 6.302-2 Unusual and Compelling Urgency, The Department of Homeland Security, Immigration & Customs Enforcement intends to negotiate a three-month extension, for the period of April 1, 2005 through June 30, 2005, with the incumbent contractor, The Geo Group, to manage and operate Migrant Operations Center (MOC) located at United States Naval Air Station (USNAS) Guantanamo Bay (GTMO), Cuba.  The NAICS Code is 561612 and the Size Standard is $10.5 million.  The Geo Group, Inc. is presently providing services for all operational aspects of the MOC related to safety, security and accountability of the migrant population. Services provided include operation and management of the migrant population according to security and other classification considerations: intake/release procedures; maintenance of a perpetually current electronic population roster, housing and job assignments; accountability through direct observation, physical counts, development and enforcement of migrant rules and responsibilities; control of the Migrant Operations Center (MOC) secure perimeter; transportation of migrants in contractor owned vehicles to programs and service on GTMO; and facilitating the delivery of programs and services by government organizations or representatives.  The performance location is one of the most secure and remote military bases in the world. Employee recruitment is difficult due to isolation of the performance location and potential separation from family. The three-month extension is required to award a new contract with an anticipated start date of July 1, 2005. Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit a proposal. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, the Government will consider all proposals received fifteen days after the date of publication of this synopsis. Determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. All questions pertaining to the publication shall be submitted in writing via e-mail to Linda.Holder@dhs.gov or FAX to 949-360-3013.

DESCRIPTION:  The Air Force Research Laboratory Information Directorate, Rome NY intends to solicit and negotiate a sole source purchase order under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 with OPM LLC, 10000 E. Bexhill Dr, Kensington, MD 20895-3203 for the purchase of two (2) Advanced Tactical Air Control Computers (mobile computer systems). These systems must contain the following requirements: IP Rating:  The system must have an IP (Ingress Protection) rating of 65 minimum.  TACPs today are deployed in regions where dust and water are of a high concern.  Computer related equipment is especially susceptible to damage from dust and sand.  A computer with an IP rating of 65 means that there is no intrusion from dust or sand (6) and that the computer can with stand water spray (5) Screen Size:  The system must have screen size of 8.4" diagonal. Screens which are lager (10.1" and above) are too large to comfortable mount on the body. Screens which are smaller (6.4" and below) do not have sufficient viewable area for the display of mapping information. Weight: The system must not weigh more that 5.5 lbs including I/O's and battery. Hot Swap Battery: The system must have a true hot swap battery replacement feature.  Hot swap is defined as the ability to remove the resident battery from the computer system, while the system is running (no tools required), and maintain full operation of the computer system while the battery is removed from the system.  Battery Hot Swap time must be no less than two (2) minutes.  It is necessary to replace the battery from time to time while in the field, the ability to "hot swap" the battery with out the loss of critical data is crucial. Custom I/O: The system must have a military influenced Input Output (I/O) interface. The design of the I/O is critical for the operational efforts of the user in the field. The I/O must be of a design that is both legacy compatible as well as compatible with future technologies i.e., HUD Touch Screen: The system must use true touch screen technology.  Many systems use a touch screen technology that requires the use of a special (digitized) pen/stylus.  The requirement is for the operator to have the ability to use any device available for navigation of the screen including his finger. Any alternative solution would have an adverse affect on the operational requirements of the TACP in that the computer is rendered useless if the special pen/stylus is lost or destroyed. Vehicle Mount: The system must be able to be easily mounted into a vehicle and must be able to draw power from the vehicle.  As TACPs are not dependent upon mechanized units for transportation the ability to mount the computer system in any available vehicle is necessary for the successful completion of the mission. Processor: The system must have, at a minimum, an 800 MHz processor and 512 MB RAM.  The system should consider Transmeta Crusoe as the processor manufacturer. Transmeta technology has proven to use less power and does not generate as much heat as the Intel Pentium class set of chips including the Intel Pentium M. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit quotes. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed purchase order based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received (quote with product specifications) will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. This procurement is setaside 100% small business. The NAICS code is 334119. This procurement shall be awarded under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP).

<DESC>ELECTRONIC RFP ANNOUNCEMENT, POTENTIAL OFFERORS WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR DOWNLOADING THEIR OWN COPY OF THE SOLICITATION AND AMENDMENTS.  The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) is the Federal agency responsible for conducting and supporting research on the brain and nervous system.  It is a component of the National Institutes of Health and the US Public Health Service. Medical advances in the field of neurology have burgeoned in the past several years.  Neurological illnesses which were once considered untreatable are now being treated. Acting on a mandate by Congress to bring important health messages to the public, the NINDS requires a public education strategy, and public education programs, on the topics of stroke and Parkinsons disease, and other neurological diseases as the need arises. The NINDS was established by Public Law 81-692 in August 1950 with a mission of research to improve the quality of life. Along with the aging population there has been a marked increase in the diagnosis of a number of neurological disorders, including stroke and Parkinsons disease. The public needs information about research advances in the neurological disorders in order to take full advantage of treatments and health care practices that may improve their quality of life. Another imperative is communicating changes in standards of treatment to health care professionals. 

The NIH Director places a strong emphasis on the importance of collaboration between the public and private sectors. In his Roadmap, he calls for novel partnerships, such as those between the public and private sectors, to accelerate the movement of scientific discoveries from the bench to the bedside.  At the core of this vision is the concept that clinical research needs to develop new partnerships among organized patient communities, community-based physicians and academic researchers. Toward this end, the NINDS seeks a contractor to identify and seek out opportunities to partner with groups that will help extend the NIH scientific research agenda. 

Within the NINDS, the Office of Communications and Public Liaison (OCPL) holds the lead responsibility for educational activities and translating research findings for both health practitioners and the general public. The OCPL plans to award a single, incrementally funded, cost reimbursement completion contract for five years.   As an incentive to performance, the contract is further issued as an award term contract, allowing the contractor to earn two additional years to the contract as a result of superior performance. The contractor will provide services in the planning, development, implementation and evaluation of health communication products and activities, development of intermediary networks and materials development for professional audiences.  Such services include but are not limited to the following: 1)  Planning, development, implementation and evaluation of public education/communication programs on the topics of stroke and Parkinson’s disease and other neurological disorders as research advances require; 2)  Development and maintenance of intermediary networks of neurological related health institutions, organizations, associations and businesses; 3)  Materials development for professional audiences.  The anticipated solicitation issue date is approximately 15 days after publication of this notice, and proposals will be due approximately 35 days after the issue date.  RFP N02-NS-59000-09 may be accessed through the Research Contracts Branch Home page by using the following Internet address: http://rcb.cancer.gov/rcb-internet/  and clicking on Current Requests for Proposals.  IT IS THE OFFERORS RESPONSIBILITY TO MONITOR THE ABOVE INTERNET SITE FOR THE RELEASE OF THE SOLICITATION AND ANY AMENDMENTS.  Point of contact is Mary E. Landi OLeary; electronic mail address: ml186r@nih.gov  (ML-one-86r); phone 301-435-3807; fax 301-480-0309.  No collect calls will be accepted.

A CONTRACTOR HAS BEEN USED FOR THE PAST THREE YEARS TO ASSIST WITH CARRYING OUT THESE FUNCTIONS WITH THE INTENT OF BUILDING THE EXPERTISE WITHIN THE EXISTING STAFF.  OTHER PRIORITIES OF THE OFFICE HAVE NOT ALLOWED THIS TO FULLY OCCUR.  A NEW DIRECTOR OF IHS DPER BEGAN WORK AUGUST 25, 2003.  HOWEVER, EVEN WITH HIS ADDITION TO THE STAFF, TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE, TRAINING AND GUIDANCE FOR THE NEW DIRECTOR AND FOR NEW DPER STAFF ARE REQUIRED.  THE IHS STRATEGIC PLANNING, PART ASSESSMENTS AND GPRA FUNCTIONS ARE CRITICAL TO THE AGENCY AND MUST BE FULLY AND SUCCESSFULLY ADDRESSED.  THIS REQUIRES THE ASSISTANCE OF THE CONTRACTOR FOR AN ADDITIONAL YEAR.

STATEMENT OF WORK:

THE CONTRACTOR WILL PROVIDE TECHNICAL EXPERTISE TO THE DIRECTOR AND STAFF OF DPER AND TO HEADQUARTERS STAFF AND OTHER IHS GPRA LEAD INDIVIDUALS REGARDING THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE ANNUAL PERFORMANCE PLAN AND REPORT.

GOVERNMENT REQUIREMENTS:

IHS WILL PROVIDE THE MATERIALS AND INFORMATION NEEDED TO PREPARE THE GPRA PERFORMANCE PLANS AND PERFORMANCE REPORTS, RECOGNIZING THAT SOME OF THIS MATERIAL AND INFORMATION IS DEPENDENT ON THE PROGRAM'S ABILITY TO COLLECT FROM THE APPROPRIATE SOURCE.

IHS WILL PROVIDE THE MATERIALS AND INFORMATION NEEDED TO CONDUCT THE OMB PART REVIEWS.

IHS WILL PROVIDE TIMELY RESPONSES TO RECOMMENDATIONS PROVIDED BY THE CONTRACTOR.  IHS WILL PROVIDE OFFICE SPACE, FURNITURE, AND EQUIPMENT WITH ACCESS TO THE IHS E-MAIL SYSTEM AND THE OPH PUBLIC DIRECTORY (I.E., O:DRIVE).  THE MAJOR PORTION OF THE WORK TO BE CARRIED OUT UNDER THIS CONTRACT IS THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO THE NEW IHS DIRECTOR OF PLANNING, EVALUATION & RESEARCH ON GPRA AND PART REQUIREMENTS.  THE COMPLEXITY OF THE DOCUMENTS, I.E., NUMBER OF PERFORMANCE INDICATORS AND OTHER COMPONENTS OF THE PERFORMANCE PLAN, REPORT AND PART REVIEWS, MEANS THAT THE CONTRACTOR MUST INTERACT WITH NUMEROUS INDIVIDUALS.  WHILE SOME OF THESE INDIVIDUALS ARE ALREADY DESIGNATED AS GPRA LEADS, EXPERIENCE INDICATES THAT NEW CONTACTS AND NEW SOURCES OF INFORMATION ARE NECESSARY AT EACH PHASE.  TO MAXIMIZE EFFICIENCY IN CARRYING OUT THESE TASKS, THE CONTRACTOR IS REQUIRED TO BE CO-LOCATED WITH THE STAFF TO WHOM HE IS PROVIDING ADVICE, AND TO HAVE READY ACCESS TO PERTINENT INFORMATION LOCATED IN HARD COPY FILES, AVAILABLE THROUGH E-MAIL, AND AVAILABLE THROUGH STAFF INTERVIEWS.			
SOLE SOURCE DETERMINATION IS BASED UPON THE FOLLOWING:

THE PROPOSED CONTRACTOR IS UNIQUELY QUALIFIED TO CARRY OUT THE REQUIREMENTS OF THIS CONTRACT FOR SEVERAL COMPELLING REASONS.  FIRST, THE CRITICAL ELEMENTS OF THIS CONTRACT REQUIRE A HIGH LEVEL OF TECHNICAL TRAINING AND EXPERTISE IN THE AREAS OF:


PUBLIC HEALTH PROGRAM PLANNING AND EVALUATION
ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT AND PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT
TRAINING AND STAFF DEVELOPMENT
FEDERAL ACCOUNTABILITY LAWS AND REQUIREMENTS

IN ADDITION TO THESE TECHNICAL AREAS IT IS CRITICAL FOR THE PERSON UNDERTAKING THE REQUIREMENTS OF THIS CONTRACT TO HAVE INTIMATE KNOWLEDGE OF THE IHS SYSTEM IN TERMS OF ITS DIVERSE HEALTH PROGRAMS AND ITS HISTORICAL SUCCESSES AND FAILURES PARTICULARLY IN THE CONTEXT OF THE AGENCY'S GPRA AND PART PRODUCTS AND EXPERIENCES INTERFACING WITH HHS AND OMB.

DR. BOTHWELL IS UNIQUELY QUALIFIED TO MEET THESE REQUIREMENTS BOTH IN TERMS OF HIS TRAINING AND PARTICULARLY HIS IHS EXPERIENCE. BESIDES HIS TRAINING AS A CLINICAL PROVIDER (A DENTIST WITH AN IHS ADVANCED GENERAL PRACTICE RESIDENCY) HE HAS THREE GRADUATE DEGREES (TWO MASTERS AND ONE PHD LEVEL) AND TWO CERTIFICATIONS IN AREAS THAT INCLUDE PUBLIC HEALTH, ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT, ADULT EDUCATION AND STAFF DEVELOPMENT.  HE HAS SERVED IN THE IHS AS A COMMISSIONED OFFICER,  AT ALL LEVELS OF THE ORGANIZATION (I.E., FROM THE FIELD LEVEL AS A PROVIDER TO AN IHS HEADQUARTERS PROGRAM LEADER).  OF GREATEST IMPORTANCE IN THE CONTEXT OF THIS CONTRACT, HE IS THE ONLY INDIVIDUAL (CONTRACTOR OR FEDERAL EMPLOYEE) WHO HAS BEEN ACTIVELY INVOLVED WITH GPRA AND PART RELATED ACTIVITIES FOR THE IHS FROM THEIR INCEPTION TO THE MOST CURRENT ACTIVITIES.

DR. BOTHWELL WAS THE FIRST COORDINATOR OF GPRA ACTIVITIES BEGINNING IN 1997 AND HAS REMAINED ACTIVE IN ASSISTING THE IHS IN GPRA ACTIVITIES SINCE DOING IT VIRTUALLY ON HIS OWN THE FIRST TWO YEARS.  HE HAS CONTINUED TO SUPPORT THE IHS GPRA EFFORT AFTER RETIRING FROM THE COMMISSIONED CORPS IN DECEMBER OF 1999 UNDER AN IDIQ CONTRACT AND MORE RECENTLY UNDER DIRECT SOLE SOURCE CONTRACTS.  AS A RESULT OF HIS EXPERIENCE, DOCUMENTED SUCCESS, AND RECOGNIZED EXPERTISE, HE HAS BEEN AN INVITED GPRA SPEAKER AND TRAINER AT A VARIETY OF MEETINGS AND SYMPOSIA OVER THE YEARS.

IN TERMS OF PART ACTIVITIES, HE IS THE ONLY PERSON WHO HAS SERVED AN ACTIVE ROLE IN ALL FIVE IHS PROGRAM PART ASSESSMENTS INCLUDING THE PREPARATION OF APPEALS FOR THE THREE PROGRAMS THAT APPEALS WERE SUBMITTED.  AS A RESULT OF HIS EXPERIENCE AND ACCOMPANYING SUCCESS HE HAS CONSULTED ON PART AND PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT WITH OTHER FEDERAL AGENCIES.  MOREOVER, HE HAS ASSISTED THE DHHS IN IDENTIFYING PROBLEMS AND MAKING IMPROVEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS TO OMB ON THE PART PROCESS AND ON SIMILAR EFFORTS BY THE NETWORK OF FEDERAL EVALUATORS.

THE NEED FOR HIS ASSISTANCE THIS COMING YEAR HAS BEEN PERPETUATED AND EXPANDED BY THE REORGANIZATION OF IHS HEADQUARTERS WHICH HAS RESULTED IN THE RECENTLY HIRED DIRECTOR OF PLANNING AND EVALUATION TO ALSO OVERSEE AND INTEGRATE IHS RESEARCH ACTIVITIES IN HIS PORTFOLIO OF RESPONSIBILITIES.  THIS HAD DILUTED HIS TIME AND AVAILABILITY TO ADEQUATELY ADDRESS GPRA AND PART AND THE ORIENTATION AND TRAINING FOR A NEW POSITION THAT WILL SOON BE FILLED TO ADDRESS GPRA AND PART.  DR. BOTHWELL IS NEEDED TO SERVE AN IMPORTANT ORIENTATION AND MENTORING ROLE FOR THE PERSON SELECTED FOR THIS NEW POSITION.

ADDITIONALLY, THE REACTIVATION OF THE PERFORMANCE ACHIEVEMENT TEAM (PAT) WILL BENEFIT FROM DR. BOTHWELL'S EXPERIENCE IN IHS PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT AND AS A CHARTER MEMBER AND FIRST CHAIRMAN OF THE INITIAL PAT COORDINATING GROUP THAT FUNCTIONED BETWEEN 1997 AND 1999.  THE PAT WILL BE AN ONGOING MATRIX WORKING COMMITTEE CHARGED WITH COORDINATING THE DIVERSITY OF CRITICAL PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS FOR THE IHS.  FURTHERMORE, HIS EXPERIENCE AND BACKGROUND IS AN EXCELLENT FIT TO SERVE AS A CONTRACTOR AND ASSIST THE PAT IN RESPONDING TO THE "ONE HHS" EVALUATION MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVE THAT PRESCRIBES THE USE OF CONTRACTORS.

FINALLY, DR BOTHWELL IS NEEDED TO PROVIDE AN IMPORTANT OVERSIGHT AND COORDINATING ROLE IN THE REACTIVATION OF THE IHS DENTAL PUBLIC HEALTH RESIDENCY OF WHICH HE IS A FORMER DIRECTOR, 1984 -1992.  HE IS BOARD CERTIFIED IN THE SPECIALTY OF DENTISTRY THAT THIS RESIDENCY PREPARES AND QUALIFIES RESIDENTS TO SIT FOR.  THIS RESIDENCY SERVES A CRITICAL LEADERSHIP DEVELOPMENT ROLE IN RESPONSE TO A RAPIDLY AGING AND RETIRING COHORT OF EXPERIENCED IHS DENTAL PUBLIC HEALTH SPECIALISTS.

THUS, DR. BOTHWELL HAS THE UNIQUE COMBINATION OF TRAINING AND SPECIFIC IHS WORK EXPERIENCE THAT NO OTHER PERSON POSSESS TO ASSIST THE AGENCY TO DEVELOP LEADERSHIP CAPACITY AND TO MEET THE CRITICAL FEDERAL ACCOUNTABILITY REQUIREMENTS (I.E. GPRA, PART, AND PMA) THROUGH AN INTEGRATED PROCESS DURING A PERIOD OF IHS HEADQUARTERS REORGANIZATION AND AN ORGANIZATIONAL CULTURE CHANGE TO EMBRACE PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT.	

BECAUSE THE IHS GPRA AND PART ACTIVITIES HAVE BEEN COORDINATED BY DR. BOTHWELL SINCE FIRST IMPLEMENTED AND BECAUSE HE IS THEREFORE UNIQUELY QUALIFIED TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO THE NEW DIRECTOR OF OPHS AND THE NEW STAFF OF DPER HE IS THE PRIMARY RESOURCE FOR IT.

THE PROPOSED SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION IS FOR SERVICES FOR WHICH THE GOVERNMENT INTENDS TO SOLICIT AND NEGOTIATE WITH ONLY ONE SOURCE (FAR 6.302-1).  A DETERMINATION BY THE GOVERNMENT NOT TO COMPETE THIS PROPOSED SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION BASED UPON RESPONSES TO THIS NOTICE IS SOLELY WITHIN THE DISCRETION OF THE GOVERNMENT. CONTRACTORS MAY FORWARD CAPABILITY STATEMENTS TO THE REFERENCED ADDRESS.  INFORMATION RECEIVED WILL NORMALLY BE CONSIDERED SOLELY FOR THE PURPOSES OF DETERMINING WHETHER TO CONDUCT A COMPETITIVE PROCUREMENT. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION, PLEASE CONTACT DARREN JANSEN, IN ROOM 5C-13, PARKLAWN BLDG., 5600 FISHERS LANE, ROCKVILLE, MD 20857 OR ON 301-443-1857.

<DESC>The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) intends to award on a sole source basis, under the Simplified Acquisitions Procedures, a firm fixed price award to the Michigan Public Health Institute, 2465 Woodlake Circle, Suite 140, Okemos, MI  48864 for a follow-on to the Design, Development, and Implementation of the Basic Case Mix for Medicare’s Outpatient End State Renal Prospective Payment System. This request for a simplified acquisition for a sole source purchase order.  The purpose of this request is to complete the work initiated to implement the MMA requirements to develop, design, implement and monitor a basic case mix adjusted system.  This request is to complete tasks that were not, nor could not have been included in the original scope, i.e., the MMA requirements were passed after scope of work had been completed.  In addition the MMA provisions were funded from a separate funding stream, therefore, requiring an individual accounting of these funds.  This request will enable the contractor to complete the report summarizing the data analysis that supported the decisions in the final regulation that implements the basic case mix adjusted PPS.  In addition to completing this report, these funds will be used to refine and monitor the basic case mix adjusted system. This contract is necessary to insure that CMS completes the research and analysis necessary to prepare a report that details the analysis used in support of the basis case mix adjusted  PPS for ESRD and develop a system to monitor and refine the basic system.
The contractor will, (1) prepare a final report, summarizing the methodology used for developing the basic case mix adjusted PPS.  This report should include the analysis that supported the basic case mix system  in the physician payment regulation, (2) make recommendations to CMS regarding potential variables that could be used for refinement and updating purposes, (3) Make recommendations regarding any potential special studies or special analytic runs that should be completed as part of the implementation of the basic case mix adjusted PPS, and (4) Make recommendations regarding a monitoring system that could be used to monitor and assess the basic case mix system. 
Researchers at the Michigan Public Health Service Institute, Kidney, Epidemiology and Cost Center have produced work for CMS in the area of ESRD analysis, quality assessment and manipulating large data bases focusing on kidney disease.  They have existing contracts with CMM, and ORDI in this area.  KECC research has supported, through their analysis of large and complex data bases, the report to Congress on the development of an expanded bundle of services for an improved Medicare ESRD PPS.  In addition, researchers at KECC preformed the preliminary analysis and made recommendations in support of the interim rule for the basic case mix adjusted PPS. These recent experiences coupled with design, and development of a fee for service demonstration in ORDI indicates that they are the only awardee that is capable of providing the supplies or services required.  KECC has created the data base that was used in support of developing the interim regulation for the basic case mix adjusted system.  Their subsequent work on the MMA was used to develop the final regulation. The data base that they created contains data over a three year period of time, release of these data to any other contractor would be prohibited under their existing Data Use Agreement (DUA).  In addition, they are the only group that can present the analyses in the progression that they were completed.  No other contractor was or could present these analyses because they were not part of the process that CMM used to develop, and publish the basic case mix adjusted PPS.  All responsible sources may submit capability statements in consideration to the Agency at the above address.  In addition, all contractos must be registered with the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) at www.ccr.gov

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

The maximum contract value may not exceed $10M aggregate total. The minimum guarantee for the contract shall be $10K. The value of individual task orders executed under this contract may range from $1K to $1M. The Government makes no representation as to the number of task orders or the actual amount of work to be ordered. Contractors are not guaranteed work in excess of the minimum guarantee. Multiple task orders may be awarded with similar completion schedules and overlapping delivery dates. Contract term is for a one-year base period with two option periods. Each performance period will run 365 calendar days, or until the maximum dollar limit is reached, whichever occurs first. The government may exercise the option periods unilaterally. Per NFAS 17.208-100(c)(1), options for post construction award services may be negotiated on individual task orders for unilateral exercise. Estimated start date for this contract is May 2005.

Anticipated deliverables include computer software development and technical documentation, Contractor's Progress, Status, and Management Reports, Test Plan, Software Test Plan, Test Analysis Reports, Program Plan, and Trusted Facilities manual.  An Indefinite-Delivery, Indefinite-Quantity (I.D.I.Q.) Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) - Completion type contract is contemplated with an ordering period of forty-eight (48) months. The maximum contemplated ordering amount is $49,900,000.  The prime contractor and/or system integrators for this contract must have Top Secret SCI security clearances at the time of the award.  Responses to this sources sought are requested from small businesses and will be used for market research purposes and possible set-aside. Should the determination be made to select this as a small business set-aside, another notice will be posted reflecting such. The North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 541710 and the size standard for small business is 500 employees. Respondents to this announcement should indicate whether they are a small business, 8(a) concern, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, women-owned small business, or historically black college or university (HBCU) or minority institution (MI) (as defined by the clause at DFARS 252.226-7000). As discussed at FAR 19.502-2(b)(2), in making R&D small business set-asides, there must be a reasonable expectation that offers will be obtained from at least two responsible small business concerns and also a reasonable expectation of obtaining the best scientific and technological sources consistent with the demands of the proposed acquisition for the best mix of cost, performances, and schedules. The same considerations would apply to any HBCU/MI set-aside. Therefore, respondents should provide a statement of capabilities and information demonstrating management and technical experience on similar acquisitions and resources necessary to successfully compete for this award. See Numbered Note 25. This information will assist the Air Force in making a set-aside decision. Provide information on at least three (3) contracts for similar work within the past five (5) years.

<DESC>The purpose of this Sources Sought/Market Survey is to identify production sources for the Marine Location Marker (MLM), MK 58 Modifications 1, NSN 1370-01-074-0591, DODIC L580. The marker is launched from aircraft in either day or night to provide visual marks on the oceans surface. They may be used to mark the course of enemy submarines during an ASW (Antisubmarine Warfare) mission or a survivor in the water during SAR (Search And Rescue) missions. Markers may be launched from high-speed aircraft or helicopters, and surface ships. They can be used for any type of air to sea surface marking that are referenced by smoke and flame. A marker consists of a  steel body,  a maximum of 21.70 inches in length and  4.94 inches in diameter, weighing  11.5 +/- 0.50 pounds. The center of gravity should be 7.93 +/- 0.50 inches from the base end of the marker. The marker contains a battery, squib, starter mix, two pyrotechnic candles, and a transfer fuse between the two candles. It is armed by removal of adhesive backed metallic foil strip (tear tape). The marker is activated upon entry into seawater with water entering the water port to activate the battery. Battery current energizes the electric squib, which ignites the starter mix, which in turn, lights the pyrotechnic candle. The first candle burns for a minimum of 20  minutes and then initiates the second ca ndle by the use of the transfer fuse. The complete marker produces a continuous yellow flame and white smoke for a burn time of approximately 40 to 60 minutes. A replaceable protective cover protects the ignition end of the marker in shipping. A respondent must have personnel trained, skilled, and experienced in handling Red Phosphorous (RP) compositions that are extremely flammable and environmentally sensitive. Specialized formulation skills are necessary to meet precise burn time ranges requi red for the MK 58. The government expects to procure approximately 8,000 Markers per year based on current budget estimates. Request interested parties provide: "	An approximation of minimum quantities required for order to sustain production capacity. Include the approximate shift times to meet this minimum value, and any significant assumptions made.

<SUBJECT>99 -- Small Business Administration (SBA) extends period for comments to Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPRM) for comments on issues related to SBA’s effort to restructure its size standards

<SUBJECT>99 -- Small Business Administration - Small Business Recertification required for Novation and Change of Name Agreements
<DESC>The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) amended various provisions of its Small Business Size Regulations effective June 21, 2004. One amendment requires that a Federal Agency obtain a new small business certification for a contract held by a small business that is novated to another business as a result of a merger or acquisition. This requirement applies to all novation and change-of-name agreements executed pursuant to FAR 42.12 on or after December 21, 2004. SBA delayed applicability of this rule for novation and change of name agreements because some novations may have been in the progress of completion, but not yet completed when the amendments were applicable. SBA did not want the applicability date to hinder the progress of such agreements. SBA issued a technical correction modifying the applicability date for novation and change of name agreements to December 21, 2004. The technical correction was published in the Federal Register on July 30, 2004. Please see http://www.sba.gov/size/indexwhatsnew.html#part121novation for further information.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE CONSTITUTES AMENDMENT NO. 01 TO THE  COMBINED SYNOPSIS/RFQ FOR CRYO ACTUATOR.  Companies shall acknowledge all amendment(s) in their quote. This notice serves as the official amendment to subject synopsis/RFQ and a written amendment will not be issued. The purpose of this amendment is to answer the following inquiries: Q: Do you know if there is a ballscrew item in this actuator? A: No ballscrew application, 90 degree gearing turn. Q: what is the load capacity requirement for the actuator. All that is given is a torque spec. A: Only motor + gearbox output torque is specified. No requirement on load capacity. Q: what is the travel range required? A: The motor must meet travel range of 10,000 revolutions of the output shaft in either directions. Q: The physical space given requires a right angle gearbox. How much space is there if a gearbox is NOT used? A: Motor without a right angle gearbox is not acceptable. Q: a lifetime of 10,000 cycles is required. Please define a cycle (preferably in travel distance). A: One cycle is equal to one motor + gear box output shaft rotation (360 degrees) in either direction. Q: you specify a resolver requirement. Is this needed for position feedback, or for velocity feedback? A: A resolver is required for position and velocity. Q: what resolution is required from the actuator? A: Motor + gear box output step angle should be less than one degree. Q: will only stepper motor designs be considered? A: Only stepper motors will be considered. Q: "..Resolver resolution shall be +/- degrees maximum over travel range." How many degrees +/-? A: A single speed resolver is sufficient on the motor shaft. No resolution is specified. Q: "..Resolver resolution shall be +/- degrees maximum over travel range." What is the travel range? A: The travel range is one turn of the motor shaft. Q: What is the environment, e.g., vacuum, cryogen immersion, etc.? A: Vacuum and cryogenic operation of 20 degree Kelvin. Q: What is the diameter of the output shaft? A: Shaft diameter is a spline or equivalent. Q: What is the orientation of the envelope with respect to the output shaft and mounting provisions? A: Motor on axis with 90 degree gear box.  Q: What is the required output rate of motion, e.g., in rpm? A: Depends on the motor pulse rate and gear ration chosen. Q: Do you expect to find an off-the-shelf actuator that meets the criteria, or do you expect this to be a development effort? A: Looking for existing technology. The due date for receipt of offers is not extended. Companies shall provide the information stated in the synopsis/RFQ posted on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service (NAIS) on January 25, 2005. Documents related to this procurement are available over the Internet.  These documents reside on a World Wide Web (WWW) server which may be accessed using a WWW browser application.
