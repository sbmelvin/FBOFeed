<DESC><p>NOTICE OF INTENT TO ISSUE A PURCHASE ORDER.&nbsp; The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), Division of Safety Research, Protective Technology Branch Morgantown, WV hereby announces it's intent to issue a purchase order to Cyberware Laboratory for a Whole Body X 3D Scanner (WBX).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Background and Need</p>
<p>NIOSH provides national and world leadership to prevent work-related illness, injury, disability, and death by gathering information, conducting scientific research, and translating the knowledge gained into products and services.&nbsp; The NIOSH Protective Technology Branch uses a Whole Body Scanner (SB) as a valuable tool to conduct research in engineering anthropometry to resolve issues on protective equipment and work station design.&nbsp; An example of the research conducted in the Antrhopometry Laboratory is evaluation of whole body harness fit to construction workers.&nbsp; A worker's body shape information is captured in the scan, which is used to develop a sizing system to improve fit.&nbsp; NIOSH has been conducting anthropometric research with the existing whole body scanner for over ten years.&nbsp; The existing scanner was installed by Cyberware through open competition in 1995.&nbsp; NIOSH has a need to work with this company to reintegrate hardware as well as software into an upgraded digital system to further our research for occupational safety.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cyberware is the only company that produces the whole body 3D scanners that are compatible to our existing systems and data library, which our program uses for design purposes.&nbsp;&nbsp; Switching systems will cause significant delays and additional costs will occur which could be detrimental to the completion of the current project and for future projects using the older data.&nbsp; In addition, all previously developed anthropometry data may not be adequately retrieved without a long-term evaluation and file conversion validation process.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This procurement is supported by justification for other than full and open competition to Cyberware Laboratories under the authority of 41 U.S.C.253(c)(1).&nbsp; Responsible sources that believe they possess the expertise and capabilities identified above are encouraged to submit to the Contracting Officer within 15 days from the posting date of this notice, their written capabilities statement and pricing information in the format they choose, not to exceed&nbsp;10 pages.&nbsp; Please forward the capability statement to Denise L. Rains, reference number 000HCCJC-2008-55225, CDC NIOSH, 315 East Montgomery AVenue, Spokane, WA&nbsp; 99207, email <a href="mailto:dgr8@cdc.gov">dgr8@cdc.gov</a>, or fax to (509)354-8099.&nbsp; All vendors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) prior to award of a Federal contract.&nbsp; The website is <a href="http://www.ccr.gov">www.ccr.gov</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Government will review any/all capabilities statements and pricing information submitted and determine if other qualified sources do exist that could provide this requirement.&nbsp; Information received in response to this announcement will be used sole for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If no affirmative responses are received within 15 days, negotiations will be conducted with Cyberware Laboratory, 2110 Del Monte Avenue, Monterey, CA&nbsp; 93940 as the only source and a purchase order will be issued without any additional notices being posted.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This acquisition is being processed under FAR 12, Commercial Procedures.</p>

<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is planning the acquisition of thermal flight strips, NSN 7530-01-450-6963, for air traffic control operations.  These flight strips are an essential tool in tracking aircraft.  The flight strips are to be manufactured in accordance with FAA Specification FAAD-F-1374, dated August 8, 2002, attached.  Estimated annual quantity for the base year and all option years is 14,000 boxes per year.
The FAA contemplates the use of an Indefinite-Delivery/Indefinite-Quantity type contract with fixed unit prices, with a base year and four 1-year options, for the acquisition of these thermal flight strips.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 323112.
Responses to this market survey will be used to determine if there is adequate competition to set the requirement aside for Small Businesses, Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business, or the 8(a) program in lieu of opening the acquisition up for full and open competition.
The acquisition will be accomplished in two phases: (1) offeror submission of non-converted material and thermal flight strips (bid samples) for testing and evaluation by the FAA against established specifications and standards; and (2) issuance of a Request for Offer (RFO) for submission of price proposals by offerors having successfully completed the first phase.  Offeror's bid samples will be evaluated according to published criteria contained in the FAA's Screening Information Request 1 (SIR 1) package.  The FAA will assess the offeror's capability to meet the FAA's requirements.  Only those offeror's whose bid samples and technical documentation are found to be acceptable will be afforded an opportunity to participate in the second phase of the acquisition process.  The second phase, which will be accommodated by SIR 2, involves the issuance of a RFO and submission of priced proposals.  Award will be made to the responsible offeror submitting the lowest evaluated price in accordance with the terms of the RFO.
Interested vendors shall:1)	Complete and return the attached Business Declaration Form.   The form is provided as a separate document under this announcement.  The FAA reserves the right to review and verify each offeror's program eligibility.2)	Submit requests for SIR 1 in writing.
The FAA prefers that all response submittals, including attachments, be submitted electronically to the following address: Connie.M.Houpt@faa.gov and reference Market Survey No. DTFAAC-08-R-54856.  Vendors must respond by 3:00 p.m. (CST), May 16, 2008.  The FAA will not pay for any information received or costs incurred in preparing responses to this market survey.  This announcement shall not be construed as a request for proposal or as an obligation on the part of the FAA to acquire these products.  The final determination by the FAA not to open this requirement to competition, based on any information provided, is solely within the discretion of the FAA.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command, Warfare Analysis Program Office (AIR 4.10) intends to award a sole source, firm fixed price purchase order to Western Scientific, Inc., 5444 Napa Street, San Diego, CA 92110 for the procurement of a cluster computing system.  The system is required to expand the current capability and capacity of the AIR 4.10 Special Warfare Analysis Center Laboratory.   This acquisition is being pursued on a sole source basis under the statutory authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1.  The immediate need for the enhanced computing system to be operational in order to support Naval Aviation Enterprise programs and Office of the Chief of Naval Operations future capability decisions does not allow for the introduction of a computing system developed by other than Western Scientific due to the inherent incompatibility and configurability issues such an introduction would involve.  Western Scientific is the supplier of the existing cluster computing system and the Government intends to negotiate solely with Western Scientific for enhancement of the system.  The estimated value of this requirement is $163,440.  Responses to this synopsis should be sent via e-mail to amber.f.wood@navy.mil.

<DESC>The Philadelphia VA Medical Center (PVAMC) intends to issue an Invitation for Bids (IFB) for the services of a qualified electrical/mechanical contractor to perform HVAC upgrade work at PVAMC, 3900 Woodland Avenue, Philadelphia, PA 19104.  The contractor will be required to provide all labor, materials, tools, equipment and supervision for the proposed work, which will include general construction, mechanical and electrical work, necessary removal and installation of existing mechanical and electrical systems, including HVAC and sprinkler system units and controls.  Because PVAMC will be providing continuous, 24-hour patient care while construction is taking place, the contractor will need to conduct the work with minimal disturbance to PVAMC operations with only a few, late-night electric shutdowns.  THIS REQUIREMENT IS 100% SET ASIDE FOR SERVICE DISABLED VETERAN OWNED SMALL BUSINESSES.  Contractors will be required to provide as part of their bid package at least three references that can verify that the contractor has successfully undertaken work similar in type and scope to that required by PVAMC at a 24-hour medical facility (hospital, nursing home) within the past five years.  Further details of all required submissions will be provided in the IFB.  There will be a pre-bid site inspection May 27, 2008 at 10:00 AM at PVAMC, for which potential bidders should register in advance by contacting the Contracting Officer at the e-mail address listed below.  Distribution of the IFB will be limited to electronic medium and the PVAMC will not provide hard copies of any documentation.  The IFB, including all bid documents, specifications, forms and drawings, will be available for download at no charge from the Federal Business Opportunities website (FedBizOpps.gov) on or about May 19, 2008.  It is the responsibility of bidders to access that website and obtain copies of all relevant documents.  The deadline for submission of bids and the date of bid opening is expected to be June 19, 2008.  All inquiries regarding this opportunity must be made in writing to the Contracting Officer, preferably by e-mail to the e-mail address specified below.  The estimated construction cost range is between $500,000 and $1,000,000 and the estimated period of construction is eight months.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>Pre-solicitation Notice   Multiple Award Task Order Contract (MATOC) for Unaccompanied Enlisted Personnel Housing (UEPH) in the Southwest Region (AR, AZ, CA, LA, NM, NV, OK & TX) The Contract Specialist for this solicitation will be Kathy Snell, 817-886-1163; or by e-mail at kathy.snell@usace.army.mil. FOR INFORMATION ONLY: This project is required by the Armys Military Construction (MILCON) Transformation initiatives under the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC), the Global Defense Posture Realignment (GDPR) (formerly known as Integrated Global Presenc e Basing Strategy (IGBPS)), the Army Modular Force (AMF) program, and the Armys Grow the Force (GTF) initiative.  The Army must posture facilities to effectively orient combat capabilities where they can most effectively organize, train, and deploy to sup port ongoing operations worldwide.  The Assistant Chief of Staff for Installation Management (ACSIM) has challenged the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) to find ways to streamline its acquisition and construction processes in order to reduce costs and speed up overall delivery of projects, while at the same time providing quality facilities.  The Army requires a minimum 15% reduction in cost and a minimum 20% reduction in time to occupancy.  USACE, in response thereto, created eight Centers of Standardi zation (COS) that are not only the design centers of expertise but also will become the acquisition experts for the facility types for which the COS is assigned.  Forty-one facility types were identified for standardization.  Of those forty-one, SWF has be en assigned responsibility for the Unaccompanied Enlisted Personnel Housing (UEPH), Basic Training (BT) Barracks, Advanced Individual Training (AIT) Barracks, Central Issue Warehouses and General Purpose Warehouses.  SWF has also been requested by Army to provide a standard barracks design for the newly designated Warrior in Transition WIT) facilities.  The primary execution of the work under the SWF COS responsibility will be based on facility-type Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts.   The IDIQ contracts are based around current known requirements within four (4) geographic regions identified as Northwest (CO, IA, ID,IL, IN, KS, MI, MN, MO, MT, NE, ND, OH, OR, SD, UT, WA, WI, WY); Northeast (CT, DC, DE, MA, MD, ME, NH, NJ, NY, RI, VA, VT, WV); Southwest (AR, AZ, CA, LA, NM, NV, OK & TX); and Southeast (AL, FL, GA, KY, MS, NC, SC, TN) for an approximate value in excess $3.1 billion.   SCOPE OF WORK:   Unaccompanied Enlisted Personnel Housing (UEPH), or other similar facilities:  UEPH facilities will house single soldiers and is intended to be similar both functionally and technically to apartment type housing in the private sector.  The soldiers room s hall include, but not be limited to: private sleeping areas, walk-in closets, a shared bathroom and kitchenette.  Additional facility and functional support amenities shall be provided as outlined in the project Scope of Work.  The varying components for t his facility will be: building occupancy requirements, regional soils and climatic conditions, facility structural considerations, HVAC systems, and the exterior architectural features.  Therefore, the overall building design and configurations will vary a s required to meet project specific requirements.  It is the intent of Government to issue design-build Request for Proposals (RFPs) under the contracts awarded as a result of this solicitation, which may be used as the basis for subsequent RFPs/task order s at the same or other installations within the region, i.e., adapt-build and/or as fully-designed RFP/task orders.   CONTRACT INFORMATION:   This solicitation will be evaluated under the Two Phase Design Build Process.  In Phase 1, interested firms or joint venture entities (referred to as Offerors) may submit certain specified performance capability proposals, demonst rating their capability to successfully execute the design -build construction IDIQ contract resulting from this solicitation. The Government will evaluate the performance capability proposals in accordance with the criteria described in the solicitation and will select no more than 5 to compete for the contract i n Phase 2 of the process.   In Phase 2, the selected Offerors will submit preliminary technical design proposals for an initial task, the contract duration, a preliminary schedule and a price proposal.  The Government will evaluate the Phase 2 proposals, in accordance with the criter ia described for Phase 2 in the solicitation, and award the contract to the responsible Offeror, whose proposal conforms with all the terms and conditions of the solicitation and whose proposal is determined to represent the overall best value to the Gover nment, considering technical-design quality, performance capability, and cost.  To meet the minimum guarantee, the Government anticipates awarding the initial task at time of contract award unless funds are not available to award.  In that case, the Govern ment will award the contract with the minimum guarantee.   The following evaluation criteria listed are of descending importance and shall be used in this solicitation unless modified by amendment prior to receipt of proposals: Phase I  Specialized Experience; Past Performance; and Organization and Technical Appr oach   Phase II  Volume I: Building Functional and Aesthetics; Quality of Building Systems and Materials; Site Design; and Sustainability Requirements.

<DESC>Notice of Intent:  The United States Coast Guard (USCG) intends to enter into negotiations on a sole source basis with L-3 Communications Avionics Systems of Grand Rapids, MI. The proposed acquisition will be for 7 each Attitude Indicators NSN 6610-01-HS1-4310, P/N: 501-1836-01 or NSN: 6610-01-309-1413, P/N: 501-1533-51 for one base period (1 year) with four option periods. This requirement will be satisfied using commercial acquisition procedures as describe in FAR Part 12,  13 and 15.  The incorporated clauses and provisions are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-24. The applicable North American Industry Classification Standard (NAICS) code is 336413.  The item specified above represents a follow on to previous contracts with L-3 Communications Avionics Systems and specifications or drawings are not available to the Coast Guard.  The purposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all responses received within ten days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  The Government will not pay for costs incurred in the preparation and submission of data or other costs incurred in response to this announcement. Notice for filing agency protests: It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman:  solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:   G-APO-1, Jemal Building, 11th Floor, 1900 Half Street, SW Washington, DC 20590. Telephone (202) 475-3754, Fax Number (202) 475-3904. POC for this action is Janet Delaney (252) 334-5369. 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Competition in Contracting Act (CICA) as implemented by FAR Subpart 6.3, HSAM 3006.3, CGAP 3006.3 and in accordance with requirements of FAR 6.303-1, the justification for the use of the statutory authority under FAR Subpart 6.3 is justified by the following facts and rationale required under FAR 6.303-2 as follows:

It is anticipated that only one award will be made as a result of the synopsis. The proposed contractor is a large business, L-3 Communications Avionics Systems, 5353 52ND ST SE, Grand Rapids, MI  49512-9704. 

(3) Description of the Supplies or Services.  
Attitude Indicators (Quantity 7 each with an option for 7)
These are considered commercial items and will be procured using the procedures in FAR Parts 12, 13 and 15. The basic estimated value of this acquisition is $25,445.00 or $130,819.00 inclusive of the option.  

(4)  Identification of Statutory Authority Permitting Other Than Full and Open Competition.
The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1), as implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1 entitled Only one responsible source and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.

(5)  Demonstration That the Nature of the Acquisition Requires Use of the Authority Cited.
L-3 Communications Avionics Systems is the only vendor capable of overhauling the USCG Attitude Indicators. 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c) (1); Far 6.302.1 only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The item was derived by L-3 Communications modifying the HH-65 component P/N: 501-1674-01, NSN: 6610-01-HS1-2790, Gyro indicator to the present configuration P/N: 501-1836-01, NSN: 6610-01-HS1-4310 or P/N: 501-1533-51, NSN: 6610-01-309-1413. L-3 Communications holds the proprietary data required to overhaul the item.

(6) Description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable.
A synopsis for this requirement will be submitted to FedBizOpps for potential offerors.  If any responsible responses are received as a result of this synopsis the file will be documented accordingly and the requirement will be competed among all eligible offerors.

(7)  Determination by the contracting officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable.  
It is the Contracting Officers opinion that prices for this procurement will be determined fair and reasonable based on comparison with historical pricing.

(8)  Description of Market Research.  
Market surveys are continually conducted to identify new sources of supply for C-130H components. The Attitude Indicators were last overhauled by L-3 Communications under purchase order HSCG38-07-P-300125. At this time two or more small businesses can not be identified with the capabilities to perform services required for these components.  

(9)  Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition, i.e., proprietary data packages, etc. 
The United States Coast Guard did not purchase the technical data rights. Therefore only L-3 Communications holds the necessary manufacturing drawings, data, and special tooling to overhaul these components. L-3 Communications will not release their drawings or data rights to anyone for the purpose of overhauling these components. 

(10)  Listing of the sources, if any that expressed in writing, and interest in the acquisition.
In accordance with FAR 5.201, the intent to contract for these items will be submitted to FedBizOpps.

(11)  A Statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required.
Complete specifications and drawings for this requirement are not available to the Coast Guard. The Coast Guard does not possess the technical expertise nor were the data rights purchased. Additionally, further competition would require duplicative solicitation, evaluation, and testing.  



(13)  Technical/Requirements Personnel Certification.

	I certify this requirement meets the Governments minimum need and that the supporting data, which forms the basis for this justification, is complete and accurate.

CDRC clinical studies shall be designed to determine how new diagnostics can most effectively impact treatment decisions in comparison to, or in concert with, currently utilized diagnostics, and to ready diagnostic tests for further development by commercial and/or other non-governmental sponsors.  


The goal of the Tuberculosis CDRC is to determine, early in the development process, how investigational diagnostics can contribute most effectively in a TB-endemic country (www.who.int/tb/publications/global_report/2007/pdf/full.pdf, as updated yearly) to inform treatment decisions. This strategy will also assure that early stage clinical evaluation of diagnostics is not solely dependent on comparison to stand alone gold standard diagnostics tests, but rather will enable evaluation of how these diagnostics perform within a clinical algorithm.  This is particularly important since the gold standard currently used for TB diagnosis (the acid fast stain) is an antiquated test with limited specificity and sensitivity.  This strategy is expected to demonstrate that even diagnostic tests with limited sensitivity and specificity may nevertheless show great utility when evaluated in the context of a diagnostic process. 


The CDRC shall also serve as a resource to the research community to provide support and advice for the early stage development of TB diagnostics in the clinical setting and contribute to the overall scheme for moving diagnostics into clinical validation.  Initially, the Contractor shall provide up to two diagnostic tests for assessment by the CDRC; additional diagnostics may be identified by either the Contractor or by the research community. This project will NOT support:  the development of new clinical research facilities and laboratories for testing new diagnostics; the development of new diagnostics and new assays; interventional clinical trials; studies to collect data to support a 510(k) application with the FDA; the establishment or maintenance of a publicly accessible specimen repository; or any research related to the development and testing of investigational products for the treatment or prevention of TB.


The contractor shall be required to:  (1) establish and maintain the Tuberculosis Clinical Diagnostics Research Consortium, including clinical study sites and a CDRC data management center; (2) adhere to objectives and requirements for CDRC clinical studies, including study design and evaluation of diagnostic tests; (3) solicit, review, prioritize and recommend additional diagnostic candidates from the community; (4) develop clinical study plans and protocols for diagnostics; (5) provide protocol implementation, management, oversight, reporting and analysis; (6) establish an external scientific advisory group; and (7) develop and maintain the CDRC website.


Capability statements submitted in response to this announcement should demonstrate the offerors qualifications and experience, specifically providing evidence as to their capability to perform this requirement, with particular attention to the following:


Technical Capability:  1) Adequacy and appropriateness of proposed clinical sites, including a) experience in the diagnosis and treatment of TB and established relationships with local TB control programs; and b) experience in conducting clinical studies of human TB, including obtaining clearances from in-country human subject review boards and adherence to Good Clinical Practice guidelines; 2) Data management capabilities, and experience in designing and implementing clinical protocols, including: a) proposed plans and procedures for data collection, management, quality control and reporting, training of clinical study site personnel, and required interactions with clinical study site personnel; b) experience in providing database management services, particularly for projects involving multi-national collaborations and foreign sites in resource-limited countries; and c) understanding of methodological considerations, challenges, and potential limitations in statistical design and analysis of investigational TB diagnostics in TB-endemic countries, and recommendations for overcoming/minimizing such challenges and limitations; and 3) Clinical study protocols, specifically the proposed process to provide for substantial involvement of clinical study site investigators and clinicians from TB-endemic countries in protocol development and to address current health care practices in the context of protocol design.


Personnel/Management: expertise, experience, and availability of the key professional and technical staff with a project of similar size, scope, and complexity.  It is estimated that the total effort of approximately 20.95 FTEs per year will be required to conduct this project.


All capable small business organizations are encouraged to submit capability statements based on this announcement.  Interested organizations should submit two copies of their capability statement addressing each of the areas cited above.  Any proprietary information should be so marked.  Written capability statements should be received by the Contracting Officer on/before May 16, 2008. Please reference the solicitation number on all related correspondence.  No collect calls will be accepted. Facsimile and e-mail transmissions will be accepted.


Information submitted in the capability statement should be pertinent and specific in the technical area under consideration, on each of the following qualifications:  (1) Experience:  An outline of previous projects, specific work previously performed or being performed and any in-house research and development effort; (2) Personnel:  Name, professional qualifications and specific experience of scientists and technical personnel who may be assigned as a principal investigator and/or project manager; (3) Facilities:  Availability and description of special facilities required to perform in the technical areas under consideration.

<DESC>The US Geological Survey (USGS) has a requirement for services to provide bearing inspection and teardown of a York YT Centrifugal Chiller (model YTD3D3C3-CKG).  This service is known to be available only from Johnson Controls Inc. as the only provider of the service because they are the only known vendor who has an original equipment manufacturer maintenance program for York chillers.  The USGS is aware of no other source that can provide the above.  Therefore, it intends to make an award to Johnson Controls Inc., unless it is contacted by any vendor who believes he can provide the same service.  Vendors are invited to contact the Contracting Officer, vfloyd@usgs.gov no later than 05/09/2008 with an affirmative answer.

<DESC>This is a 'Like-Equipment Sole-Source' Procurement.  The Integra Selector hand piece being procured is needed for the Selector equipment already owned by the customer.  They own previously procured Integra Selector equipment, and need this second hand piece as an operational back up.  Patient safety was recently put at risk where the hand piece that the customer owned quit working during a surgical procedure. The equipment technical representative did not have a back up the hospital could use.  Because our Hospital also serves as a teaching environment, equipment standardization lead to the sole source justification for the Integra system being used.   This is an additional hand piece to be added to capital equipment that is already purchased. The surgeons, staff and SPD are familiar with the equipment and have all been in-serviced on it.

FSC 8140 and 8145 Containers

On December 5, 2007, Federal Prison Industries, Inc (FPI) posted a notice in the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps).  In this notice, FPI proposed to manufacture shipping and storage containers competitively without using its mandatory source.

Shipping and storage containers fall within Federal Supply Classification (FSC) code 8140 - Ammunition and Nuclear Ordnance Boxes, Packages, and Special Containers, and FSC code 8145 - Specialized Shipping and Storage Containers. 

FPI received one comment from an interested party regarding this proposed production, within the 30 days allowed as stated in the December 5, 2007, FedBizOpps notice.  FPI  responded to the concerns that the interested party had raised.  The comments from the interested party and FPIs response were forwarded to and reviewed by FPIs Board of Directors.  Following consideration of the submitted documentation, the Board approved FPIs manufacture of shipping and storage containers as a  competitive product.  They also mandated that FPI would never add shipping and storage containers to its Schedule of Products as a mandatory source product.  In proceeding with its plans, FPI will continue to be sensitive to private sector interests.

Interested parties have a right to raise questions at any time with FPIs Board of Directors.  Any correspondence should be addressed to: Chief, Strategic Business Development and Marketing, Federal Prison Industries, Inc., 320 First Street, NW, Washington, D.C. 20534.  Attention: SBDM Branch.

<DESC>FedBizOpps Notice
Revised Guidelines Ceilings Due to Change in Material for  
the Advanced Combat Helmet (ACH)


	On April 2, 2008, Federal Prison Industries (FPI) Board of Directors (the Board) revised FPIs authorized sales ceilings for helmets.  FPIs primary customer for this item is the Department of Defense (DOD).  Recently, the Army decided to replace the Personnel Armor System for Ground Troops (PASGT) Helmet with the Advanced Combat Helmet (ACH) that increased costs primarily due to material. 

		FPI stated in its request to the Board, that the increased cost of material is the only reason that the sales will increase over the previous Board-authorized ceilings.  This action will not have an adverse impact on the private sector as the number of units produced by FPI is not expected to change.  
	
	Interested parties have a right to raise questions at any time with FPI.  Any correspondence should be addressed to: Chief, Strategic Business Development and Marketing Branch, Federal Prison Industries, Inc., 320 First Street, NW, Washington, D.C. 20534.  Attention: SBDM Branch.

<DESC>The purpose of this contract action is to acquire contractor support for the quality measure development and maintenance life-cycle activities described in the Measure & Instrument Development and Support (MIDS) Umbrella Statement of Work (USOW).

Increasingly, high quality means care that is personalized, prevention-oriented, and patient-centered, based on evidence about the benefits and costs for each particular patient.
Large gaps exist between the CMS of high-quality care for every patient every time and what our health care system delivers. Therefore, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services have many important opportunities to help health professionals, patients, and all of the stakeholders in our health care system turn promising new ideas into action to close the quality gaps.

One way CMS will carry out its obligation to the Health Care System and its beneficiaries is through this Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract for work to be performed by a Measure & Instrument Development and Support (MIDS) Contractor. This umbrella Statement of Work (SOW) encompasses all of the fundamental activities that may be required of a MIDS Contractor. However, no work will be performed on the umbrella SOW since individual Task Orders will be awarded under the IDIQ for specific requirements (refer to contract Section G - Contract Administration, for details on task ordering procedures).

Task Orders may be awarded by CMS or other government agencies identified herein for some or all of the activities identified in this umbrella SOW. For example: A Task Order may be issued for all, or in part, of the activities identified in this umbrella SOW under a Task Order SOW that may read The Contractor shall perform all of the requirements of the umbrella SOW as the maintainer of the Outcome and Assessment Information Set (OASIS). Or, a Task Order may be issued for some of the activities, such as Coordinate with Post Acute Care MIDS Contractors to assure Congruent Measure Application. Each Task Order will contain an individual work statement for requirements to be performed that are within the scope of this umbrella SOW

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This requirement is to be resolicited on a full and open competition basis.  Proposals are due on, May 14, 2008 at 10:00 a.m. See Section entitled Proposal submission for more details.<BR><BR>STATEMENT OF OBJECTIVE<BR><BR>FOR<BR><BR>TALENT MATURITY ASSESSMENT (TMA)<BR><BR><BR>Background<BR><BR>In February 2007 the Deputy Under Secretary of the Army (DUSA) shared a vision to establish an Army Civilian University (ACU).  At its core is the ACUs mission to create a network of schools and colleges that effectively cultivates our essential civilian personnel resource.  This university model will be designed to maximize civilian career development opportunities through a transformational model of effective and efficient learning opportunities that strengthen the Armys Goals and Mission in support of our National Security.  The ACU is responsible for overseeing the analysis and evaluation of current programs involving Army civilian leadership, professional development, and education/training while molding structure into a university learning concept to meet future learning and knowledge management challenges.  <BR><BR>In order to establish an effective ACU program and to ensure Civilian leader development, the Army needs to define current and future competencies; this means defining, measurable skills, knowledge, abilities, qualities, and values required in both technical and leader functions. As part of this process, the Army requires contractor subject matter expertise to conduct a Talent Maturity Assessment (TMA) of Army civilian personnel.  <BR><BR>Scope:<BR><BR>Provide contract consultant support to assist DUSA in obtaining TMA of Army civilian personnel. This will contribute to ability of the emerging Army Civilian University (ACU) to use the analytical results of this assessment as the basis for developing a Human Capital Strategic Plan and a Talent Management Action Plan. In particular, the contractor will deliver: <BR><BR>"	TMA with conclusions and recommendations completed within 90 days ADC<BR>"	Results compared and contrasted to other Government and Industry data points to enrich the analysis<BR>"	Comparisons provided to best-practice of commercial and government organizations <BR><BR><BR>Statement of Objectives:<BR><BR>Phase I. Interview with top leaders (roughly 10-15) of Army Civilian Corps to determine common threads of research topics. Review and consolidate the results from previous civilian surveys. Determine what shortfalls have been found and conduct a trend analysis on similar questions over time. In addition, conduct research on which questions from the existing TMA database need to be revised to reflect familiar terms to Army civilian personnel. Work with ASA (M&RA) and G1 to add up to 5 questions that are deemed necessary to conduct a thorough maturity assessment. Determine which groups should participate in the e-focus groups so that insights gathered will be most representative of the entire population. Conduct external research on the related areas of interest to Army civilian personnel leaders at G1 and ASA (M&RA).<BR><BR>Phase II. Conduct a web-administered survey and focus groups. In conjunction with the Army Research Institute, survey enough appropriated-funds civilian personnel across Army to ensure 5% (roughly 15,000) successful respondents. Conduct 8-12 e-focus groups from various representative groups of Army civilian personnel.<BR><BR>Phase III. Based on results from initial interviews, surveys and focus groups, conduct deep dive, internal research on specific topics of interest.  Determine the most likely causes of the results and any causal linkages to existing civilian personnel structures. Compare the survey and focus group results to best practices in industry and government organizations. Build the Talent Maturity analyses.<BR><BR>Phase IV. Write a comprehensive research report with all interview, focus group and survey results. Decompose survey results by Major Command, pay grade, civilian career field, and up to two additional characteristics. Distribute this report on AKO within 90 days ADC.  Results should be prepared in the following 14 categories: Overall Talent Maturity, Leadership Commitment to Talent, Human Capital Plan, Workforce Planning, Talent Acquisition, Talent Engagement, Talent Development, Talent Deployment, Talent Management, Performance Management, Leadership Development, Talent Retention, Organizational Accountabilities and Innovation.

The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 112990 for full and open competition.  

The FDA intends to issue a purchase order for a vendor who can develop and provide knockout mice during a 15-24 month study.  The vendor performance period will be two years.  Due to a diminishing number of available ivermectin-sensitive Collie colonies, it is becoming difficult for drug sponsors to get the dogs needed to test the safety of new avermectins.  Therefore alternative screening procedures are needed to identify potential P-gp substrates and to address safety concerns.  The second phase of the study will develop alternative in vivo and in vitro models that may be used in lieu of ivermectin-sensitive Collies to confirm the safety of new and combination new animal drug products.  By the end of the second year, FDA plans to have identified in vitro systems that can be used to identify P-gp substrates.  However, since in vivo toxicity and tissue variation in gene expression need to be considered, an in vivo model is also needed.  The vendor shall need to demonstrate technical approach to develop a knockout mouse model (in vivo) and knockout mammalian cell lines (in vitro) that exhibit homozygous recessive and heterozygous genotype for the canine mdr1-/- mutation.  The vendor shall provide a detailed strategy of the development including methodology, feasibility, and appropriateness of the proposed methods together with any unique or imaginative approaches for the development of the model systems.  The vendor shall also provide:
(a)	Provide the specifics of the approach to develop knockout mice.
(b)	Strategies of deleting the mouse mdr1a and mdr1b genes and replacing with a heterozygous and homozygous genotype for the canine mdr1 mutation. 
(c)	Provide the specifics of development of the gene construct.
(d)	Details on what methods are going to be used to insert artificial DNA into the chromosomes contained in the nuclei of ES cells.
(e)	Provide the specifics of ES identification and testing.
(f)	Provide the specifics of confirming successful creation of clones.
(g)	Provide the background and experience of the staff of the laboratory facility.
(h)	Provide an estimate of the time that it would take to complete project.
(i)	Provide estimated charges of unsuccessful production of construct(s), cell line(s), and mice.
(j)	Provide information on how project deliverables will be monitored. 
(k)	Provide venders policy the intellectual property transfer of the cell lines and mice produced.  
(l)	Provide estimated cost of housing and breading.

The vendor shall submit the following deliverables: 
1.	Constructs developed with the mutated canine mdr1 +/-, and mdr1-/-.
2.	ES cell lines with the deletion of the mouse mdr1a and mdr1b genes and the insertions of the canine mdr1 +/-, and mdr1-/- construct. 
3.	Two knockout mice mdr1 +/-, and mdr1-/- model.
4.	Delivery of models in 15-24 months. 

QUESTIONS DEADLINE: all questions must be received by email (david.kordel@fda.hhs.gov) before 5:00 pm (1600) EST on May 9, 2008.

the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the 
date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR 
database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information 
in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not 
a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. 

(2) 

(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as 
name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has 
transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed

(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)
(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or 
change-of-name agreement, the CCR information that shows the Contractor to be 
other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be 
incorrect information within the meaning of the Suspension of Payment 
paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. 

The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual 
payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the 
purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). 
Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information 
provided to the Contractors CCR record that indicates payments, including 
those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be 
considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the Suspension 
of payment paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.

confirmation requirements via the Internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling

A fuel mechanic will then remove the barrel from the sling and transfer the propane from the 125 Gal. Pickle barrels to standard 500 Gallon propane tanks.  This process is repeated until all tanks are at maximum capacity. This is a high priority U.S. Coast Guard search and rescue system that must be kept operational at all times to protect property and lives


2. Requirement:

Vendor shall fuel and fill the NDS sites at Point Pigot near Valdez, Alaska with propane per schedule and quantity, which is 1600 Gallons.

ATTACHMENT 1

ACQUISITION & ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10
PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY

General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY
(OCTOBER 2006) 

(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16
FAM 116 available at http://www.foia.state.gov/REGS/fams.asp?level=2&id=59&fam=0 .

Note:  personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.

(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES.

(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurers liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).

(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:

(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;

(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and

(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.

(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation.  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.

(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractors invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.

(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individuals behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.

(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.

(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).

<DESC>The above referenced request for quotation is hereby amended to clarify the technical specifications.

The following responses are provided to technical clarifications submitted:

QUESTION:  Specification 2 specifies a single frequency requirement.

ANSWER:  The NIST Center for Nanoscale Science and Technology (CNST) does require single longitudinal mode operation.  The narrow linewidth is needed for future holographic work NIST CNST intends to do.  A narrow linewidth means a long coherence length which allows for these future experiments.

QUESTION:  Specification 3 specifies 18 Watts.

ANSWER:  The NIST Center for Nanoscale Science and Technology (CNST) has a demanding experiment that requires as much laser power as possible.  That extra 20% in pump power corresponds to a roughly 20% or more increase in the power output of the ring laser being pumped.  The output of the ring laser will then go into several doubling cavities for frequency conversion.  The frequency conversion process is nonlinear on the input power.  Therefore, to have higher input power can have a very dramatic increase on the final laser power output.  To successfully perform our experiments, NIST CNST needs as much power as possible and hence specified 18W for the power output.

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

<DESC><p>Question: If the requirement is firm fixed price such that billing does not vary by level of effort, if some of the government administrators become unavailable, can the offeror assume that the level of government support will continue by other means or if the contract requires more than 35,000 hours to perform, that a contract modification could be negotiated to add resources.
<p>The contract type is, for the most part, fixed price because the number of hours per labor category will not vary greatly during contract performance. However, the contractor will be paid only for hours worked, i.e., the price per hour is fixed; however, the number of hours worked may vary slightly. The exact schedule for each person will be established during the transition period. As in most IT environments there will be times when additional effort (beyond the normal 40 hour work week) is required. The government will pay for these hours at the rates agreed to in the award. The total hours agreed to in the award document can not be exceeded without a modification to the contract.<br /><br />Question: The announcement from April 2 did not include a Program Manager. <br />May the offeror propose one as part of the contract staffing? <br /><br />The government requirement is from Page 5 of the RFP:</p>
<p>B.9.1 TASK 1 - PROVIDE PROJECT MANAGEMENT<br /><br />The contractor shall provide project management support of contractor personnel under this Contract. This includes the management and oversight of all activities performed by contractor personnel, including subcontractors (if applicable), to satisfy the requirements identified in this Performance Work Statement (PWS). When the project manager is not available the contractor shall designate another staff member as the government's point of contact for all activities associated with this project.</p>
<p>It is the decision of each offeror to propose a solution that meets the requirements of the RFP. The methodology staffing and labor categories proposed are up to each offeror.</p>
<p><br />Question: Page 49, section 5.b, requests firm fixed price cost proposal. <br />Does this refer to firm fixed price hourly rates with billing varying by number of hours worked or firm fixed annual and monthly price without regard to number of hours worked ?</p>
<p>The contract type will be classified as Fixed Price. The labor categories will be set at a firm fixed price including prices for option periods. The expectation is that each full time employee will work a 40 hour work week. The exact schedule for each person will be established during the transition period. As in most IT environment there will be times when additional effort (beyond the normal 40 hour work week) is required. The government will pay for these hours at the rates agreed to in the award. The total hours agreed to in the award document can not be exceeded without a modification to the contract.</p>
<p>Question: Please provide the approximate number of UNIX and windows servers being supported in tasks 5 and 6. 3)</p>
<p>12 Unix servers<br />200 Windows</p>
<p>Question: For the NOC in task 3, may the offeror propose single person coverage or must offeror propose two person coverage at all times? May offeror propose that only one NOC Technician be present at the NOC during off hours?</p>
<p>The offeror may propose one person on off hour's shifts, but the offeror shall fully staff these positions at all times including sick, vacation, etc. The offeror may backfill the position from existing staff, (without impacting other operations). If the fill-in is normally a higher priced labor category, the hours billed would be at the rate of the NOC position and not at the higher priced labor category.</p>
<p>Question: For planning purposes when does the government estimate the time of award?</p>
<p>The existing order is due to expire on 31 July 2008. The government expects to make an award that will allow an orderly transition to occur prior to that date. The exact date of award will be determined based on the number of proposals received and the transition periods proposed by offerors.</p>
<p>Question: Is the current scope equal to the scope of the new RFP, and if so is this scope being handled adequately in the 31,000 to 35,000 hours annual LOE listed?</p>
<p>The scope of this RFP represents the governments understanding of the existing workload and future requirements. Please refer to attachment E for the position requirements and the expected growth areas. Hours worked under the previous contract are not directly equivalent to the requirements of this RFP.</p>
<p>Question: Are all the technologies listed in place currently or are some which are similar in function proposed options (e.g. Heat &amp; Remedy).</p>
<p>The technologies listed are currently in use. However, as in any IT environment, specific products are updated, modified and/or replaced to meet changing requirements. The government's expectation is that the successful offeror will provide the government with recommendations on innovative tools and procedures that will result in improved efficiencies. This will occur throughout the life cycle of the award.</p>
<p><br />Question: At what point is "Special IT Project Assistance" determined to be out of scope, and how will that determination be made?</p>
<p>Any special project that require would labor categories that have not been included in the award or exceed the ceiling for the funds awarded for the period of performance would require a review and determination of scope.</p>
<p>Question: Can you more fully define an "average" 30-40% annual change in the infrastructure (refresh, new applications, new technologies, etc.)? And how much of that change is due to which drivers?</p>
<p>The reference to 30-40% change was to alert the offerors to the dynamic nature of the OCS data center environment. The changes can be in the form of hardware or software and include refresh, new applications and new technologies. Please review paragraph B.15, Task 7 of the RFP.</p>
<p>Question: What Linux variants are currently in place?</p>
<p>&bull; AIX 5.3<br />&bull; CentOS 4.2<br />&bull; BIGIP 4.5.14 <br />&bull; Red Hat Linux ver - 9, 7.3, Enterprise ES - 4, ES - 3, AS 4<br />&bull; ESX 2.5.5<br />&bull; SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 10 SP1 and subsequent releases of SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES)</p>
<p>Question: Is there currently an OCS website? What base functionality beyond basic login and document retrieval is anticipated? Is there a web development tool in place? If not, will a recommended tool be furnished by the gov't?</p>
<p>OCS does currently have a website but will be reworking its look. Standard web developer should have the skill set to generate adhoc, web pages and applications in a small dynamic manner that will allow a fluid transition of information for both our internal staff and external customers. These applications, while being small in nature, should be able to have standard look and feel to present a professional appearance to our customers. The tools to be used for web development will be provided by the government and will be based on the standards of Department of Commerce's policy. Dreamweaver has been used in the past.</p>
<p>Question: Who is the incumbent on this contract and what is the current headcount and the support provided?</p>
<p>GSA did not award or administer the previous contract. The requirements of this RFP are based on the government's immediate and foreseeable needs. The existing order is not the basis for this RFP and should not be the basis for a new proposal. Please refer to attachment E for technical requirements.</p>
<p>Question: What is an acceptable timeframe to transition the program from the incumbent?</p>
<p>The transition must be completed by 31 July 2008. The offeror shall propose a transition plan that will be completed by this date.</p>
<p>Question: Will the incumbent be available for overlap and information exchange?</p>
<p>The incumbent is under contract to the government through 31 July 2008.</p>
<p>Question: For the offerors submission. is the cost proposal counted as part of the 15 pages or as an attachment?</p>
<p>The cost proposal does not count against the 15 page limit.</p>
<p>Question: Can you provide the Page 1, SF 1449 as a .doc file?</p>
<p>The Government currently does not have a .doc version of the SF1149.</p>
<p>Question: Would the government consider excluding Section 4 - past performance and Section 5 - Cost/Price from the page limit which is currently 15 pages?</p>
<p>Sections 4 and 5 are attachments and not counted against the 15 page technical proposal limit.</p>
<p>Question: Given the depth and breadth of requirements within the statement of work and the breadth of management functional areas that must be addressed, would the government consider increasing the page count for the combined section 1 - technical, section 2 - management approach and section 3 - personnel and project staffing to 30 pages?</p>
<p>The 15 page limit applies for sections:</p>
<p>Section 1: Technical Approach<br />Section 2: Management Approach<br />Section 3: Personnel and Project Staffing</p>
<p>Other sections and attachments are not counted against this limit.</p>
<p>Question: Would the government consider treating Section 4 - past performance and Section 5 - Cost/Price as 2 separate attachments or as appendices with no page limits?</p>
<p>The 15 page limit applies for sections:</p>
<p>Section 1: Technical Approach<br />Section 2: Management Approach<br />Section 3: Personnel and Project Staffing</p>
<p>Other sections and attachments are not counted against this limit.</p>
<p><br />Question: Will the government accept electronic submission of responses? If so, what email address should be used?</p>
<p>All responses should be submitted electronically to anthony.pellegrino@gsa.gov with a copy to james.fahey@gsa.gov</p>
<p>Question: If physical responses are to be submitted, what address should be used for submission of hard copy responses?</p>
<p>Physical responses are discouraged. However, if a contractor feels compelled to send hardcopy submissions, the address is:</p>
<p>Anthony Pellegrino<br />GSA<br />10 Causeway Street - Room 1085<br />Room 1085<br />Boston MA 02222<br />(617) 565-5750</p>
<p>Question: What was last year's budget &amp; number of resources by labor categories?</p>
<p>The budget is not relevant to this procurement and is Government sensitive information that will not be shared during the solicitation phase of this procurement.</p>
<p>Question: When is the anticipated contract award/contract begin date?</p>
<p>The existing order is due to expire on 31 July 2008. The government expects to make an award that will allow an orderly transition to occur prior to that date. The exact date of award will be determined based on the number of proposals received and the transition periods proposed by offerors.</p>
<p>Question: What is the requirement for small business prime vs sub-contracter? Is there a 51% Small/ 49% Sub requirement?</p>
<p>This is a small business set-aside. The Contractor shall comply with the Federal Acquisition Regulation. See, especially FAR Part 19.</p>
<p><br />Question: Is it acceptable to include a reference which is based upon the experience of a Sub? Should this be branded as such or merely referenced?</p>
<p>If the reference of the sub-contractor is a reference to include specific personnel that will be assigned to work this order then that reference is acceptable. Sub-contractor references that do not include specific personnel to this order are not relevant.<br /><br />Question: Is there a reason we lost 2 weeks on the modification #2 proposal submission date of May 23? As a result of that modification we made resource plans to support proposal preparation based upon personnel availability. Will GSA reconsider using the May 23 date?</p>
<p>There was a discrepancy among the dates in FedBizOpps, Page 2 of the solicitation, and the date on the SF1449. Both FedBizOpps and Page 2 of the solicitation state 1100 hours, May 12, 2008; however, the SF1449 erroneous stated 1100 hours on May 23, 2008. An Amendment to the modification clarified the date. <br />In order to meet program requirements, it is necessary for a May 12, 2008 response date.</p>
<p>Question: I wanted to check if the contract type that would be awarded from this solicitation had been finalized? That is, whether the ensuing contract would be Cost-plus, etc?</p>
<p>This award will be a fixed-price contract. The labor categories will be set at a firm fixed price for the base year and all option periods.</p>

BAE Systems was awarded the competitive contract to provide (8) First Article Conformal-Controlled Reception Pattern Antenna (C-CRPA) systems to support the F/A-18 Navigation Warfare (NAVWAR) effort.  This quantity was based on estimates that have proven insufficient to support the F/A-18 flight test.  Subsequent analyses of F/A-18 flight test requirements now require eight (8) additional antenna systems.  
This follow on is for the procurement of (8) developmental and testing C-CRPA to support the F/A-18 flight test.The C-CRPA is specifically applicable to the dorsal fuselage of the F/A-18 Aircraft.  Its conformal design is dependent upon proprietary technical data.  BAE Systems Information and Electronic Systems Integration Inc. owns the proprietary technical data required to produce and deliver the C-CRPA for the F/A-18 flight test.

**********
Training System Acquisition VH-60N and VH-3D Aircrew Procedures Trainers (APTs) Muti-Option Contract.

Naval Air Systems Command Training Systems Division (NAWC TSD) Orlando, intends to issue a Request for Proposal on or about 06 JUNE 2008 with the intention to award a contract to upgrade the VH-60N and VH-3D Aircrew Procedures Trainers (APTs) under the Presidential Helicopter Program. This acquisition will award one base effort and have options for eight additional efforts.  Offerors will have 30 to 45 days after the RFP published date, to submit proposals.

DESCRIPTION OF PROGRAM EFFORTS: The acquisition will maintain configuration of the APTs and aircrew training with the Fleet aircraft along with a technology refresh to maintain the APTs in top efficiency. Commonality of VH-3D, VH-60N, and VH-71 Visual Systems/Databases is a goal of the program. The training device modification includes a visual upgrade, a technology refresh, the cockpit upgrade program (CUP), a flight model upgrade to incorporate the Carson rotor blade, correction of existing Trainer Engineering Change Requests (TECRs), an effort to maintain trainer concurrency with the VH In Service aircraft changes and modifications, and relocation of both devices to a new location on MCAF Quantico, Virginia.

The base effort will be to upgrade the VH-60N APTs Computational Technology and Visual Systems. The computational technology refresh will include replacement of the current host and image generator with a PC host, PC image generator and replace the existing visual database with Naval Aviation Simulator Master Plan (NASMP) Portable Source Initiative (PSI) database set. This upgrade will keep the APT at peek efficiency until the VH-60N helicopter is retired. New hardware will have commonality with the VH-71 CPT to the maximum extent possible. Visual Databases from the VH-71 CPT will be integrated into the APT. All additional efforts will be options on the resulting contract.

There will be an option effort to upgrade the VH-3D APT Computational Technology and Visual Systems as described above for the VH-60N APT. Another option effort will be to upgrade the VH-60N APT to a glass cockpit and provide applicable modifications. The VH-60N aircraft is incorporating state of the art technologies that will provide improved electronic displays and upgrades pilot communications and navigation capabilities (glass cockpit). The upgrade will be utilizing avionics, equipment and software utilized by other DOD aircraft to maintain commonality and supportability for future life cycle support. The upgrade will require the removal of the current instrumentation system and the incorporation of glass cockpit multifunction displays and associated weapons replaceable assemblies/wiring. Some software conversion of the instructor operator station and new digital interface code will need to be written.

The next option effort for the trainer modification requirement will be to modify the existing VH-3D APT aerodynamic model to account for the new Carson main rotor blade. This program will replace the existing VH-3D metal Main Rotor Blades (MRB) with a newly designed composite MRB. The new MRB was designed by Carson Helicopters of Perkasie, PA utilizing NASA designed airfoil sections and state of the art materials. The rotor blade offers significant increases in performance and flight envelope over the current metal blades. Aerodynamic model data will be recorded via the VH-3D Lift Improvement Program and will be used to modify the existing VH-3D APT aerodynamic model.

The next option effort for the trainer modification requirement will be the correction of existing Trainer Engineering Change Requests (TECRs) which will be divided in four different lots. The Government intends to award as many TECRs as possible at time of contract award depending on funding availability. The last option effort is for the relocation of both devices to a location within the boundaries of MCAF Quantico, Virginia.

Period of Performance: Varies per CLIN, Overall is 5 years.  Sources: Sources will be limited to the Training Systems Contract (TSC) II Lot I Small business firms.  GFE/GFI Requirements: The Government will provide most WRAs required from the B kit and cockpit peculiar hardware from the A kit for the VH-60N glass cockpit upgrade DURING FY09. EDT software and information may be used for developmental efforts. VH-60N and VH-3D APT IOS and host software in addition to each APTs document library may be made available upon contractor request. Security Considerations: The use of foreign nationals inside of the HMX-1 squadron spaces will not be allowable due to the sensitive nature of the effort. The APTs are unclassified however, access to the HMX-1 squadron spaces may require Secret or above security clearance.  Proprietary Data: The VH-60N and VH-3D APTs were procured with full data rights. The contract will require contractors to provide data without restrictions on documentation and software. Contract Approach: The acquisition will be made via the Small Business open competition under Lot I of the Training Systems Contract (TSC) II Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity Contract (ID/IQC) contract as Firm Fixed Price. Contract payment schedule will be performance-based payments based on significant milestone events. Events are not limited to, but include engineering design reviews, testing events and delivery of documentation. A percentage of the total contract value will be assigned to each event. Management Approach: All efforts will be conducted by utilizing the Integrated Product/Process Development (IPPD) approach. An Integrated Product Team (IPT) will be formed with appropriate roles and responsibilities delineated by team assignment agreement for government personnel. The contractor will provide personnel for those teams.

The RFT dates below are not based on Fleet requirements but are an estimate of the  completion date based on other simulator modifications of this magnitude. 

RFP- June 2008 

Receipt of Proposals- July/August 2008

Oral Presentations- August 2008

Contract Award (CAD)- September 2008

RFT: VH-60N Tech/Visual RefresH- 24 months after CAD
        VH-3D Tech/Visual Refr- 24 months after exercise of option (AEO)
        VH-60 Glass Cockpit- 18 months AEO
        VH-3D Carson MRB- 12 months AEO
        Relocation of devices- up to 30 months AEO

Source of Support: APT modifications will include 6 months of Contractor Field Services. The CFS on site portion will be three months and then three months of on call support will be put in the contract. The APTs will be maintained by COMS upon completion of the CFS period. Spares Acquisition: Spares will be purchased through the prime contractor. A CDRL for initial spares will be part of the PBP payment criteria.  

Summary: The requirements to incorporate state of the art technologies into VH-60N and VH-3D APTs will maintain configuration between aircraft and training system as well as maintaining trainer supportability.
