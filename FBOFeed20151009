The vessel shall have a minimum capacity of 2,350 TEUs and provide climate control for a minimum of 1,350 TEU ammunition laden containers. <br />Duration of the contract period: One 5 month base period with four 1-year option periods and one 5-month option period.<br />All responsible sources may submit a bid, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency.<br />17. Place of Contract Performance: Worldwide<br />18. Set-aside Status: This procurement will be competed as a tiered small business set-aside. If the government receives offers from two or more responsible small business concerns that are competitive in terms of market prices, quality, and delivery; no offers received from other than small business concerns will be considered for award. If the Government does not receive offers from two or more responsible small business concerns that are competitive in terms of market price, quality, and delivery; all offers, including offers from other than small business concerns, will be considered for award. <br />19. Rationale for Small Business Strategy (as required by ASN(RDA) Memorandum, Improving Communications During the Market Research Process, dated 2 June 2014): The Contracting Officer could not make a conclusive determination, in an effort to promote small business participation, whether at least two or more offers would be received from small business concerns meeting the solicitation requirements at fair market prices. She determined that the use of a tiered or cascading evaluation of offers would be appropriate in accordance with DFARS 215.203-70 based on results of competition under RFP N62387-15-R-3000. MSC's Small Business Associate Director and SBA PCR concurs with the determination of a tiered small business set-aside.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Transportation, Office of the Assistant Secretary for Research and Technology, John A. Volpe National Transportation Systems Center (Volpe Center), Cambridge, MA, intends to issue a solicitation for services related to the State of Knowledge and Practice for Using Automated License Plate Readers for Traffic Safety Purposes.<br />&nbsp;
<p>The solicitation will be competed as a Full and Open competition and is intended for a single award. The Government intends to award a cost-plus-fixed-fee completion type contract. This procurement will be conducted in accordance with FAR Part 15, Contracting by Negotiation. The term of the contract is estimated to be 32 months from the date of award of the contract.</p>
<p>The purpose of this contract is to conduct preliminary qualitative research on the feasibility of using Automated License Plate Readers (ALPRs) as countermeasures to improve traffic safety. While ALPRs are deployed for a variety of purposes (e.g., homeland security, locating and recovering stolen vehicles, etc.), the purpose of this study is to focus on the use of ALPRs for traffic safety purposes. Within traffic safety, the emphasis will be on license offenses, including revoked, suspended, or restricted licenses. However, the study should reveal whether ALPRs are being used for any other type of traffic safety function, e.g., speed enforcement. The research shall examine the full range of issues associated with the implementation and use of ALPRs for traffic safety purposes, including, but not limited to: <br />&emsp;<br />&bull; Extent of ALPR use for traffic safety purposes (overall and relative to other purposes) <br />&bull; Development, implementation and maintenance of ALPR databases (e.g., "Hot Lists")<br />&bull; Cost to deploy and maintain ALPRs (including training)<br />&bull; Effectiveness of ALPRs <br />&nbsp; o Benefits/value/usefulness of deploying ALPRs for traffic safety purposes<br />&nbsp; o Challenges and problems encountered when utilizing ALPRs for traffic safety purposes, including technical, operational and institutional (and how they were overcome)<br />&bull; Legal issues surrounding the use of ALPRs and how have they been addressed<br />&bull; Law enforcement acceptance for traffic safety purposes<br />&bull; Community acceptance for traffic safety purposes<br />&bull; Privacy concerns <br />&bull; Other issues or concerns</p>
<p>It should be noted that this research does not involve the deployment of any technology. It is a qualitative, balanced assessment of the issues associated with the implementation of ALPRs for traffic safety purposes.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 541720 - Research and Development in the Social Sciences and Humanities, with a small business size standard of $20.5 million. The estimated release date of the solicitation will be on or about March 30, 2015. Proposals will be due approximately 45 calendar days following the issuance of the solicitation.</p>
<p>The Volpe Center uses electronic commerce to issue Request for Proposals (RFP) and amendments to RFPs. The solicitation and any documents related to this procurement will be available on the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website: https://www.fbo.gov/.

The contract duration is 365 calendar days to account for mobilization, submittals, materials, work, admin, and closeout.</p>
<p><br />The magnitude of construction is between $1,000,000.00 and $5,000,000.00. The NAICS code applicable to this requirement is 236220, with a small business size standard of $36.5 million. The proposed procurement listed herein is set-aside for Small Business.</p>

<DESC>A Request for Proposal (RFP) will be issued OOA 19 Oct 2015 to support the following requirement.&nbsp; Capability documents and interest in participating in this RFP are requested.&nbsp; Responses shall be sent to <a href="mailto:contracting@socom.mil">contracting@socom.mil</a> and identify H9222215J5EANDF in the subject line.&nbsp; No executable files will be accepted.<br /><br />Statement of Work<br />Economic and Finance Domain Activities
<p>1.0 (U) PURPOSE: To acquire an understanding of how key competitor nations are leveraging the Economic and Finance (E&amp;F) Domain to further their national interests.</p>
<p>2.0 (U) BACKGROUND: Peer and near-peer competitors are active in the E&amp;F domain, using their economic and financial assets (especially their state&#8209;owned enterprises) to position themselves strategically at the expense of U.S. and allied security interests. State and non&#8209;state actors are likewise actively using E&amp;F operations in their unconventional or "hybrid warfare" strategies to counter the U.S. and its allies in the areas of responsibility (AORs) of most of the Geographic Combat Commands (GCCs). Presently, the American military is lacking the skills to detect the critical warning signs that are on display in this kind of strategic maneuvering and category of hybrid warfare. These increasingly aggressive E&amp;F strategies should not be seen as peripheral to the American military. These strategic maneuvers are deliberately intertwined with "normal" market activities and represent a substantial part of how competitors pursue asymmetric, unconventional means to gain an advantage over a superior U.S. military.</p>
<p>3.0 (U) OBJECTIVE: The objective of this contract is to provide enhanced situational awareness and expertise to United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) concerning the actions of global competitors in the E&amp;F domain. This analysis will in turn be used to deepen the strategic understanding of competitors' use of the E&amp;F domain to pursue hybrid warfare strategies against the U.S. and its allies, and to potentially serve as predictors of future actions.</p>
<p>4.0 (U) TECHNICAL CONSIDERATIONS: Expertise in analysis of the E&amp;F domain will be coupled with open-source data, collected primarily (but not exclusively) via the IntelTrak software tool, focused on the particular countries of interest as applicable in each designated region.</p>
<p>5.0 (U) TASKS</p>
<p>5.1. (U) Title: Africa Area of Interest:</p>
<p>5.1.1. (U) DESCRIPTION: The contractor will analyze open-source transactions in the E&amp;F domain for a cluster of key countries in Africa and their relation with state-owned and privately held enterprises for the two target countries of interest. Specifically, the contractor will consider transactions with Kenya, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Angola, and Zambia.</p>
<p>5.1.2. (U) DELIVERABLES: One (1) baseline report for each of the two (2) countries of interest, and six (6) monthly updates to each baseline report.</p>
<p>6.0 (U) SECURITY REQUIRMENTS: These studies will be drawn from open-source data, and the reports will be UNCLASSIFIED.</p>
<p>7.0 (U) DELIVERABLES:</p>
<p>7.1. (U) WORKPLAN:</p>
<p>7.2. (U) BASELINE REPORTS:</p>
<p>7.3. (U) MONTHLY UPDATE REPORTS:</p>
<p>7.4. (U) STAFF TRAINING AND SITE VISITS:</p>
<p>8.0 (U) DISSEMINATION AND FORMATTING: Reports may be submitted electronically, via hard copy, or on CD-ROM if necessary.</p>
<p>9.0 (U) GOVERNMENT FURNISHED PROPERTY/EQUIPMENT: Not Applicable.</p>
<p>10.0 (U) GOVERNMENT FURNISHED DATA: Any data required by the contractors will be requested in writing. Reports will be clearly identified by title, classification and control numbers, as appropriate. Provision of such data will be made only as authorized by the COR.</p>

<DESC>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Ames Research Center (ARC) is hereby soliciting information about potential sources for the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA) Science and Mission Operations (SMO) support contract.  This is a follow-on to contract NAS2-97001, with Universities Space Research Association (USRA). <P> SOFIA is an airborne astronomical observatory consisting of a 2.5-m aperture telescope permanently installed in a specially modified Boeing 747SP aircraft. The observatory, with its open port telescope provided through a partnership with the German Aerospace Center (DLR), provides routine access to nearly all of the visible, infrared, far infrared, and sub-millimeter parts of the electromagnetic spectrum.  SOFIA's primary mission is to conduct high-quality, high-impact, cutting-edge research in astronomy, astrophysics, and planetary astronomy in a safe and cost effective manner.  The observatory is able to directly incorporate new or upgraded instruments over its lifetime. <P> The SOFIA Program is executed jointly at two NASA centers. Armstrong Flight Research Center (AFRC) is responsible for flight operations and maintenance of the SOFIA aircraft. The aircraft is based in Palmdale, California.	Flight operations and maintenance are not within scope of this procurement. Program and science management is at Ames Research Center (ARC) at Moffett Field, California; ARC is also responsible for science support required onsite at AFRC.   Science support at AFRC that is within scope of this procurement includes maintenance of the SOFIA primary mirror-coating chamber and integration of science instruments onto the observatory.  <P> SOFIA consists of the observatory and mission support systems.	The observatory includes the Airborne System and the Science Instruments (both Facility Instruments for general observations, as well as Principal Investigator instruments). The Airborne System consists of the Aircraft, Telescope Assembly, and Mission Command & Control System.  The ground-based mission support systems include the SOFIA Science Center (SSC) at Ames, and the SOFIA Operations Center (SOC) located at the Armstrong Aircraft Operations Facility in Palmdale.  The SOC provides housing and maintenance capabilities for the observatory (including the mirror coating chamber) along with science instrument preparation and checkout facilities. <P> SOFIA conducts approximately 100 science flights and produces nominally 800 research hours annually. This translates to nominally 8 or more hours of science per flight, with a flight rate of approximately 3 nights per week, with several weeks per year dedicated to aircraft maintenance. <P> SOFIA carries out a science program defined by peer review of community-based observing proposals. Additionally, SOFIA guarantees observations for instrument developers and conducts a limited number of discretionary investigations defined by the SOFIA Science Mission Operations Director. <P> Long term plans anticipate the observatory could operate through May 2034. <P> The SMO support contract requirements are anticipated to include, but are not limited to, the following: <P> Manage, plan, and execute science and mission operations for SOFIA to meet NASA mission objectives including: <P> Perform the annual SOFIA Call For Proposals and Proposal solicitation and award processes for each yearly observation cycle, <P> Plan flight missions for each yearly observation cycle, <P> Provide qualified staff for the planning and execution of science mission operations consistent with a nominal and sustained flight rate of approximately 100 flights per year and nominally 3 flights per week during mission operations. Science missions fly only at night.	 <P> Top-level science flight duties for on-board SMO personnel typically include: <P>    Science Instrument Operator: Operate facility class instruments to acquire science data per awarded time of selected proposals, <P>    Mission Director:	Science/Flight/Observatory Team coordination, <P>    Telescope Operators: Science target acquisition, telescope operation,  <P> Execute science flight missions. Example duties are: <P>    Flight preparation of the science instrument(s), <P>    Pre/post flight check-out of on-board mission systems, <P>    Science flight plan development, extract science data and deliver to archive, <P>    Post-flight reports. <P> Provide qualified scientific staff to: <P> Plan and execute (for SMO staff and science targets) annual six-week southern hemisphere deployments to Christchurch, New Zealand. (NASA is responsible for overall planning for the deployment), <P> Operate and maintain SOFIAs suite of four facility science instruments, <P> Process and calibrate all facility instrument science data, <P> Manage the archive for all SOFIA science data, <P> Manage pipeline software for four facility science instruments, <P> Provide SOFIA Guest Investigator support, <P> Maintain reflectivity of the SOFIA Primary mirror (routine cleanings, re-coat if necessary), <P> Maintain and operate all science and mission operations equipment and software that are used in performing the SOFIA mission. Examples include: Observatory Simulation Labs, SOFIA Data Archive, Mirror Coating Facility, Flight Planning and Scheduling Tools, Science Instrument Laboratory, <P> Provide NASA with science and mission operations reports that assess performance to requirements, <P> Provide support to observatory improvement testing and observatory check-out, <P> Perform SOFIA science outreach and public engagement functions. <P> NASA/ARC is seeking capability statements from all interested parties, including Small, Small Disadvantaged (SDB), 8(a), Woman-owned (WOSB), Veteran Owned (VOSB), Service Disabled Veteran Owned (SD-VOSB), Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) businesses, and Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU)/Minority Institutions (MI) for the purposes of determining the appropriate level of competition and/or small business subcontracting goals for SOFIA SMO Support Contract.  The Government reserves the right to consider a Small, 8(a), Woman-owned (WOSB), Service Disabled Veteran (SD-VOSB), or HUBZone business set-aside based on responses hereto. <P> This synopsis is for information and planning purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for information solicited. Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation.  <P> No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If a solicitation is released it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps and on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service. It is the potential offerors responsibility to monitor these sites for the release of any solicitation or synopsis. Vendors having the capabilities necessary to meet or exceed the stated requirements are invited to submit appropriate documentation, literature, brochures, and references. <P> Responses must include the following:  name and address of firm, size of business; average annual revenue for past 3 years and number of employees; ownership; whether they are large, or any category of small business, number of years in business.  <P> Responses must also include a one to five page (maximum) summary describing your organizations experience and capabilities to meet or exceed the stated anticipated requirements as they relate to providing science and mission operations support for the SOFIA program. <P> Responses are requested to include affiliate and customer information:	parent company, joint venture partners, potential teaming partners, prime contractor (if potential sub) or subcontractors (if potential prime); list of customers covering the past five years (highlight relevant work performed, contract numbers, contract type, dollar value of each procurement; and point of contact - address and phone number). <P> ARC is soliciting suggestions on contracting approaches to this effort that will enhance competition and provide opportunities for small business. Therefore, we are also requesting feedback in any or all of the following areas for consideration during acquisition planning: 1. For small businesses that cannot perform the entire scope of effort stated above, indicate what portion(s) of this scope your company could perform. 2. Socio-economic considerations are a priority at ARC. Given the general scope of work stated above, please submit suggested percentages and types of the proposed requirements that could be subcontracted to each of the following types of businesses: Small Business concerns, Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB) concerns, Woman-Owned Small Business (WOSB) concerns, HUBZone Small Business concerns, Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) (includes other minority institutions), Veteran-Owned Small Business concerns, and Service Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business concerns. This information may be used to establish subcontracting goals for any future procurement. 3. Besides Past Performance and Price, what other evaluation factors, if any, do you believe should be included in the RFP, and why? 4. Does the selection of NAICS code 541712 seem appropriate? If not, what alternative NAICS code do you suggest, and why? 5. NASA support service contracts generally have a five-year period of performance. What combination of base period and options do you recommend for the duration of the contract, and why? <P> Please advise if the requirement is considered to be a commercial or commercial-type product.  A commercial item is defined in FAR 2.101. <P> Information about major upcoming ARC procurement actions is available at <A HREF="http://ec.msfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/eis/admin/admin.cgi?center=ARC">http://ec.msfc.nasa .gov/cgi-bin/eis/admin/admin.cgi?center=ARC </A>      . Click on ARC. <P> All responses shall be submitted to Jeffrey S. Brown no later than October 29, 2015. Please reference NNA16ZPX001L in any response.	 <P> Questions about this notice may be submitted in writing to <a href="mailto:Jeffrey.s.brown@nasa.gov">Jeffrey.s.brown@nasa.gov </a>  by October 16, 2015. As appropriate, questions and responses will be posted for all interested parties. <P> Any referenced notes may be viewed at the following URLs linked below.	 <P>

DRAFT STATEMENT OF WORK
Veterans Guest Internet Access at the Eastern Colorado Health Care System (ECHCS)

CONTENTS

III.	Performance

I.	BACKGROUND

The US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and VA Eastern Colorado Health Care System (ECHCS) is seeking to provide Internet access to Veterans and their guests during their stay at medical centers across the United States.  In addition, we are seeking the provision of Internet access for Contractors, visitors, and other guests of our facilities.  The proposed Internet access should provide similar levels of service and access to those found in hotels, restaurants, and coffee shops.  The network is not subject to the same security policies and restrictions required by Government and regular VA networks.
Internet access has been essential in the transitioning of soldiers returning from combat in the current Iraq/Afghanistan conflicts.  Injuries from these conflicts have resulted in a generation of Veterans requiring a new set of needs, including long periods of treatment and rehabilitation during which they are relatively isolated in the care environment.  Internet access has been seen as a vital part in dealing with those needs because it provides a way for these patients to remain in contact with family, friends, and comrades in their old units.  It also provides a means for managing their finances, and researching employment and/or educational opportunities online.

<DESC>The Mission and Installation Contracting Command -White Sands Office, invites you to attend the Industry Day for the Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) Support Services requirement. <br /><br />Date: 22 October 2015<br />Start Time: 0900<br />End Time: 1530 <br /><br />Location: WSMR Professional Development Center auditorium, Building 465, Dyer Street, White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico, 88002. Parking is available near the intersection of Dyer Street and Rock Island Avenue and also at Dyer Street and Pica Tinny Avenue. <br /><br />The event will begin at 0900 AM. Attendees should plan on arriving to WSMR at least one and one half (1.5) hours prior to the event so you may process through the Las Cruces Main Post Gate Security; obtain a visitor's pass and check-in at the event. Check-in at the event will begin at 0830 AM MST. A complete/most current agenda for the event will be provided at check-in. <br /><br />Reference the attached Tentative Agenda for a summary of the events for the day.<br /><br />There are no site visit tours scheduled for this event. However, One-on-one discussion sessions will be held in (30) minute intervals with interested Primary Vendors ONLY and each of the Government's Functional Area Experts. The Primary Vendor must be accompanied by at least one (1) of his/her Technical Experts. A response to any unanswered questions during the one-on-one sessions will be published on FedBizOpps.gov after the event. The Government is interested in industry feedback for the following areas in helping to validate or revise the acquisition approach.<br /><br />1. Contract Type <br /><br />2. Evaluation Factors<br /><br />3. Period of Performance<br /><br />4. CLIN Structure<br /><br />5. Phase In <br /><br />6. Performance Metrics<br /><br />7. Subcontracting/Teaming Arrangements <br /><br />RSVP: Contractors electing to attend the Industry Day must e-mail the attached RSVP form (see attached Microsoft Excel workbook) and one-on requests to Vanessa A. Garcia at <span style="text-decoration: underline;">vanessa.a.garcia18.civ@mail.mil</span> no later than 12 October 2015. Due to security procedures, the persons attending the Industry Day must be listed on the RSVP form. There is a limit of two (2) representatives per contractor. No foreign nationals are permitted. <br /><br />Las Cruces, NM is the closest city to WSMR, NM. The closest WSMR access gate is located off of US Highway 70. El Paso International Airport, El Paso, TX is the closest regional airport. Contractors are solely responsible for all expenses associated with their attendance at the Industry Day. Please visit the WSMR website, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">http://www.wsmr.army.mil/Pages/Home.aspx</span>, for more information about WSMR. The quote mark WSMR at a Glance 2011 quote mark and the WSMR Facebook quote mark are also attached for your information. Maps of WSMR are available at: <span style="text-decoration: underline;">http://www.wsmr.army.mil/testcenter/Pages/WhereWeAre.aspx</span>.<br /><br />Occasionally, WSMR will block roads (including US Highway 70) in the area for missile tests. Please call the Road Block phone number, 575-678-1178, for recorded updates on planned roadblocks. The information is usually updated each weekday in the afternoon for the following day. Since the actual firing schedule can slide due to any number of circumstances like weather or equipment problems, travelers should also check the recording right before leaving to ensure nothing has changed. <br /><br />Installation Access: Individuals who have RSVP'd by the required date will be included on an access roster provided to the Las Cruces main post gate (located off of US Highway 70) guards. When you arrive at the main post gate, you are to indicate to the guard that you are here for the Explosive Ordnance Disposal Support Services Industry day event. Each individual MUST provide his/her Gov't issued photo ID (i.e. Driver's license or state issued ID, or CAC etc.). If the individual is on the list, access should be granted onto the installation. If the individual is not on the list, he/she may be subject to the National Crime Information Center III (NCIC III) background check requirements for installation access. <br /><br />Safety: As a tri-service Department of Defense Range, White Sands has tested nearly every type of deployable ordnance developed in the United States since 1945. Quite a number of these munitions were deliberately designed to blend in with the terrain, and their presence may not be immediately obvious to the casual observer. Consequently, even though WSMR performs extensive Range Clearance activities, there is no assurance that any area of the Range is truly 100% free of unexploded ordnance. More information concerning unexploded ordnance hazards can be viewed at http://www.wsmr.army.mil/ux/Pages/default.aspx. The contractors are responsible to view the video found at this link under the title, UXO Hazards Video. <br /><br />Photography &amp; Video Ban: No photographs or videos are allowed on WSMR except in the WSMR museum missile park area. <br /><br />Lodging Accommodations: There is a hotel located on the main post and it is open to civilians. They currently have rooms available for the required dates. Reservations can be made by calling 575-678-1838.

<DESC>On August 5, 2015, GAO sustained protests B-408558.7, B-408558.8, FCi Federal, Inc., and recommended that the Agency open discussions with all offerors remaining in the competition, request revised proposals, undertake a new evaluation of those revised proposals, and make a new selection decision. <br /><br />The Agency's needs have substantially changed since early 2013, when the subject solicitation was issued. The Agency has determined that, among other significant changes, approximately 36 of the 68 USCIS field offices will no longer need Field Office Support Services contractor support. In addition, ongoing changes to field support services due to USCIS's transformation project, which will replace paper-based applications with on-line filings, will result in changing some or all of the CLINs from fixed-price to Time and Materials.<br /><br />As a result, the Agency is cancelling the solicitation, revising its requirements in accordance with its FY16 needs, issuing a new solicitation, and receiving new proposals. <br />

<DESC>The Missile Defense Agency (MDA), Ground-Based Midcourse Defense (GMD) Program is conducting market research to determine interest and capability for sources to continue: Ground Systems development, interceptor manufacturing, testing, fielding, operationally sustaining, maintaining and warfighter support on the deployed GMD weapon system. MDA currently calls this effort "GMD Development, Operations and Sustainment, and Production (DOSP);" however, the title will evolve as the acquisition strategy matures.
<p>This Request for Information (RFI) is intended to help MDA make informed acquisition decisions and business case analyses to:</p>
<p>&bull; Assess the current marketplace and existing industry capabilities to fulfill all or portions of the GMD scope of work;<br />&bull; Obtain recommendations from industry on the contract duration/period of performance, acquisition strategies and approaches (including contract and incentive structures) that are available to support the GMD scope of work;<br />&bull; Identify and assess the major risks to the acquisition; <br />&bull; Identify and mitigate any potential barriers to competition;<br />&bull; Determine industry data/information needs to support proposal preparations; and<br />&bull; Identify areas that could be set-aside for small business.</p>
<p>This is a market research announcement for informational planning purposes only and does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP), nor is it to be construed as a commitment by MDA. Information submitted will be considered as an exchange of capabilities and may be used as part of future RFP(s), either as a single contract activity or under multiple contract actions. MDA will not accept any responses submitted as classified information. Any proprietary information provided should be properly marked. No RFP/solicitation will be issued at this time. Participation in this effort is strictly voluntary with no costs incurred or obligations made on behalf of MDA. MDA is in no way bound by the information obtained through this RFI should an RFP/solicitation be issued at a later date. Responses to this notice will not be construed as an offer and will not be accepted by MDA to form a binding contract. Respondent's information/documents submitted in response to this RFI will not be returned. The Respondent's information/documents should: be complete; be informative; clearly demonstrate competencies and expertise in managing, executing, and delivering program management, systems engineering, models and simulations, test, production/manufacturing, systems integration, fielding, operations and sustainment, and warfighter support of GMD-related capabilities to be integrated into the overarching Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) together; and should include supporting relevancy information. MDA is conducting an information-driven decision making process that requires additional information to plan and execute successful acquisitions for the GMD program. This RFI is part of the overall market research activity to collect, organize, maintain, analyze and present data in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 2.101.</p>

This effort will be conducted on a sole source basis in accordance with the statutory authority 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1. The basis for restricting competition is the lack of proprietary design specifications or drawings, and duplicative cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition, and the unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency requirement through any other source. The duplicative cost and delay necessitated are from reverse engineering of the EOS internal components to develop specifications, soliciting competitive offers and awarding to an alternate source, development, production, system integration and operational test verification The Government is seeking information from companies mitigating the sole source basis listed above.</p>
<p>The Government is seeking companies with the capabilities and facilities to provide components that meet the Government requirement and qualification requirements for the Electro-Optics Sensor (EOS) System.</p>

Background

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Board of Veterans' Appeals (the Board) has jurisdiction over appeals arising from various Agencies of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ), to include the VA Regional Offices (ROs), VA Medical Centers, the National Cemetery Administration (NCA), and the Office of the General Counsel (OGC).  The vast majority, approximately 96 percent, of appeals considered involve Veterans' claims for disability compensation or survivor benefits.  The projected appeals workload has prompted the Board, as the sponsor of the Appeals Process, to work with their VA partners to seek a cohesive and unified strategy to address all aspects of appeals modernization across the Enterprise.  Modernization of VA's Enterprise Appeals Processes is necessary to enable VA to adjudicate appeals efficiently to serve Veterans and their families with issuance of timely and quality appeal decisions. Based on trends in case receipts, the Board expects to experience additional increases in workload, which include new appeals from the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA), as well as, remanded cases returning from VBA's Appeals Management Center, the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims, and appeals from other elements of VA, to include the Veterans Health Administration (VHA), OGC, and National Cemetery Administration (NCA).  If VA appeals process along with supporting technologies is not modernized, it will have a negative impact on Veterans, their families, dependents, and beneficiaries.


VA Board is seeking to acquire a document review tool to facilitate attorneys' review of a large number of Portable Document Format (PDF) files. 

The document review tool needs to support an estimated 1 (minimum) to 50,000 (maximum) documents at a time.  Most of the time, cases contain around 300 documents.  The reader also needs to support documents with an estimated 1 (minimum) to 1000 (maximum) number of pages within each.  The majority of documents contain 1-5 pages.
The sections below describe the features and capabilities the tool must offer in order to be considered.  These were identified through interviews with BVA employees in order to understand their needs. 

Navigation and Usability

BVA reviewers spend dozens of hours a week reviewing cases.  Case files can be significant in size, and it's not uncommon to see case files containing 400+ documents, with many of the documents containing 1000+ pages.  Therefore, it is absolutely essential that the tool be user friendly.

The tool should be able to handle several thousand documents at a time (although they may not necessarily need to all be in memory at one (1) time).  These documents can each have hundreds of pages.  The tool should be able to access documents from a data store, network or folder location, and optimally load documents under (1) one second, but no longer than (5) five seconds. One (1) method for doing so might be letting users "preview" documents before opening them up.

The tool should allow the user to easily zoom in and out of pages and provide the capability to create notes and apply labels (see Document and Evidence Organization below).  The tool should allow reviewers to navigate between and within documents, pages, notes, and labels and provide interface accelerators such as keyboard shortcuts to perform these actions. 

The tool should support users with multiple monitors, allowing for different views on different monitors.

It should support document views that afford various information densities. Examples include dense list views and thumbnail views where the attorney can see more content from a particular document but fewer documents on the page.

It should support customization so the BVA and/or attorneys can customize their interface to remove unused or unnecessary interface elements.

Document and Evidence Organization

BVA attorneys need to organize up to several thousand documents in a case and cite individual evidence within them that is easy to find and retrieve.  The cases contain forms that are standard across all cases and evidence that pertains to a specific condition.  These forms and evidence often need to be associated with conditions, flagged as missing or incorrect, or marked as read and unread.

The tool should provide the ability to organize documents and evidence using labels, folders, tags, categories, etc. (collectively referred to as "labels" for simplicity).  The tool should be able to create and set default labels and in addition allow for the creation of custom labels.  These labels should be associated with entire documents, entire pages within a document, specific evidence within a page, or notes associated with any of the above.

The tool should allow for navigation between these categories and allow the user to specify whether they are looking for documents, pages, evidence, or notes when using these labels to navigate. (See Navigation and Usability above for more).

Notes

BVA attorneys frequently create notes on the documents and evidence they are reviewing in a case.  The note's content may be copied from a document or written out by the attorney.  The notes are often associated with specific conditions in the case or are details about missing information.  Reviewers need to create these notes rapidly, or else risk citing less evidence in the case.  Additionally, these notes need to be hidden from viewers outside BVA.

The tool should provide the ability to create notes and organize them using labels (see Document and Evidence Organization above). Notes must be separate from the case documents themselves, not embedded/appended to the documents.  The tool should provide the reviewers the ability to navigate between notes (see Navigation and Usability), as well as to be able to search by keyword within notes. The tool should provide a master list of all the notes taken on a case and they must be sortable by criteria such as date and label. 

Privacy

Information presented in these cases such as medical conditions and Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and Personal Health Information (PHI) is extremely sensitive.  The tool should ensure this information remains secure at a Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) Moderate level.  Labels, notes, or other content generated in the tool should not be shared with users outside the BVA or to other systems at VA.  Similarly, the tool should support different types of user roles and allow varying levels of access by users of different roles. 

File Format

The tool should allow viewing of PDFs in format 1.4 or higher, supporting PDF Normal and PDF Searchable Image specifications.

Sustainability

VA should be able to point the tool to a directory of PDF files locally or on a network and it should be able to perform without additional configuration or overhead.  It should be implemented in a modern technology stack.

The vendor will need to provide incidental services to include:

1.	Technical support 
2.	Technical documentation
3.	Software Sustainment and Support
4.	Training 
5.	Regular updates including performance and bug fixes

Additional Features

The following represent additional desirable features: 

Remote Access: Many attorneys review these cases from outside VA facilities.  A desirable feature is to allow them to review cases from any location and provide the capability to t support an offline mode and devices like tablets or mobile phones.

Task Reminders: Reviewers need to keep track of conditions they are looking for in order to identify pertinent information related to those issues in the evidence.  It is easy for reviewers to lose track of that information when sorting through the hundreds or thousands of pages of evidence.  A desirable feature would be for the tool to provide a way to remind the reviewer of what they are looking for, such as a constantly visible checklist.

Evidence Prioritization: Reviewers need to ignore content that is not relevant to the case to help them move quickly.  When content is irrelevant to the case, a desirable feature would be for the reviewer to mark it as such and/or skip over it to save time skimming through files in the future.  The feature could also provide a way to hide unnecessary or duplicate documents or evidence.

New Evidence Alerts: New evidence is often added to the case.  Reviewers need to be notified of new documents and evidence as it is added.  If crucial new evidence is added to the Veteran's case, and the reviewer is not aware, they could make the wrong decision.  A desired feature would be an Application Programming Interface that facilitates such notification is important.

Workflow Insight: VA needs insight into the workload and throughput of appeals.  This not only helps delegate work, but also opens the door for rapid process improvement and modernization.  The desired featured could provide at-a-glance statistics about cases or a sense of status for different types of cases as they are reviewed. 
 
Cases at-a-glance: A desired featured would be the capability for reviewers to gain high-level information about a case at a glance.  They currently use metrics like the number of documents in a case, number of pages in those documents, age of a claim, and how many issues are in the case to help them assess how long a case might take.  They use this information to allocate their work time.
 
Additional file format support: A desired feature would be the inclusion of content other than text, such as images taken from the evidence, to be included within the notes.

De-duping of documents: A desired feature would be de-duping capabilities, allowing the user the ability to review a folder for quality in order to identify and tag documents that are similar with a percentage difference marker.

<DESC>SPECIAL NOTICE:

Solicitation VA248-15-R-1322 was protested under GAO file number B-412053 on 9/8/15.  The solicitation originally closed on 9/9/15.  However, after a careful review of the protest grounds and the procurement file, the Agency elected to take corrective action in order to amend the solicitation.  These changes to the solicitation will better reflect the Agency's requirement while facilitating maximum competition among potential offerors.  

An urgent and compelling interim bridge contract to the incumbent was subsequently awarded by the Agency to allow for uninterrupted and continued critical veteran care while implementing the corrective actions necessary to further full and open competition.

As a result, the necessary changes have been made to solicitation VA248-15-R-1322, which is hereby extended to now close on 10/30/14 at 1300 by amendment A00003.  All interested offerors are requested submit/re-submit their best and final offers on or before the aforementioned date and time.

The revised solicitation document will be attached to amendment number A00003.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for a commercial service prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.
<p>SOLICITATION #: <br />This combined synopsis/solicitation is issued as a Request For Quotes. A Firm Fixed Price type contract will be awarded. Award will be based on a Lowest Price Technically Acceptable Basis.</p>
<p>Technical Acceptability will be based on the following:<br />Taking no exceptions from the Performance Work statement.</p>
<p>Past Performance will be based on the following:<br />Recency: within the past three (3) years<br />Relevancy: similar in size and scope of this requirement</p>
<p>Offerors will be provided a past performance questionnaire that can be completed by government points of contact, under previous contracts held. These questionnaires can be submitted with their quotes for consideration.</p>
<p>The Government reserves the right to utilize internal system such as www.ppirs.gov and www.fapiis.gov .</p>
<p>PRICE: The Offeror's price proposal will be evaluated as follows:<br />A. An Offeror's proposed prices will be evaluated by multiplying the quantities per line item by the proposed unit price for each Contract Line Item Number to confirm the extended amount for each. Unit prices will prevail. The Offeror shall use $6,800.00 for the total price on CLINs 0003, 1003, and 2003 as the estimated amount. $6,800.00 will be the same evaluated amount on CLINs 0003, 1003, and 2003 for all Offerors. The price evaluation will document the completeness and reasonableness of the proposed total price for the offers evaluated. Offerors are specifically advised that under this evaluation method, the Government may determine an offer unacceptable if the prices proposed are materially unbalanced between line items and sub-line items. Prices are materially unbalanced if they are significantly overstated or understated in relation to the actual cost of that work. The price will also be evaluated to determine the Offeror's understanding of the contract requirements as expressed by the solicitation. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>B. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for the option years to the total price for the basic requirement. The Option to Extend Services Clause 52.217-8 will also be evaluated for the Offerors proposed prices. The 52.217-8 extension of services will be added/calculated to the offeror's price proposal by utilizing the following formula: monthly price = the monthly price of the last year/CLIN X 6 months. If the option to extend services under 52.217-8 is used, prices are only adjusted if the Secretary of Labor revises the wage rates and the contractor requests an increase due to the change in labor rates. Six month extension period per FAR clause 52.217-8 is used only in circumstances listed in FAR 37.111.</p>
<p>C. The Contracting Officer has determined there is a probability of adequate price competition in this acquisition. Upon examination of the initial offers, the Contracting Officer will review this determination and if, in the Contracting Officer's opinion, adequate price competition exists, no additional cost/price information will be requested. However, if at any time during this competition the Contracting Officer determines that adequate price competition no longer exists; offerors may be required to submit information to the extent necessary for the Contracting Officer to determine the reasonableness of price.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />The solicitation and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-84 effective 05 October 2015, DFARS Current to DPN 20151001, Effective 01 Oct 2015.</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation S152-00001 is being issued as a Request for Quotes (RFQ) for a base year plus two option years. This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-84 (October 5, 2015). The 2012 NAICS code applicable to this acquisition is 111150. For a company to qualify as a small business, the size standard is .75M.
<p>The USDA, ARS, Corn Insects and Crop Genetics Research Genetics Research Unit has determined a requirement for an organic corn winter nursery managed according to USDA Organic Standards for producing corn that will be located Puerto Rico to allow for growing between November and March. Contract shall include one base year beginning November 2015 with two option years. <br />Subject to local weather and soil moisture conditions, the nursery shall be grown within a 6-month period beginning in November 2015 to be harvested in approximately March 2016. The nursery shall include approximately 2000 experimental varieties planted in 12 foot one-row plots with a 3 foot border between plots for a total expected area of approximately 1.6 acres of nursery. Plant spacing is expected to be 9 inches in the row and 30 includes between rows. Contractor will prepare fields including mowing and incorporation of a mucuna or other cover crop by plowing, followed by disking and application of 2000 pounds/acre of granular organic fertilizer. A second disking shall be performed prior to planting when the soil is sufficiently dry to produce an acceptable seed bed. Weeds will be controlled as needed by mechanical cultivation and hand hoeing. Drip irrigation shall be applied as needed throughout the growing season. Bacillus thuringiensis (Dipel or Agree) will be applied as needed for control of lepidopteran pests and Trilogy and Garlic barrier will be applied as required for control of fungal diseases. Label directions shall be followed for application concentrations and methods. The nursery shall be monitored for insect pressure as well. <br />Shoot bagging and pollinations will be done according to breeders' instructions. Hand harvesting will be done by plot when grains have dried sufficiently, and the ears will be allowed to dry to approximately 12-15% moisture in mesh bags with circulating air at ambient temperature or low heat to produce seed with high germination rate. Ears will be shelled by hand or with a corn sheller according to breeder's instructions and dried further if necessary to reduce moisture levels. Dried seeds will be cleaned, packed, inspected and shipped by FedEx to each breeder. Seed will be treated for the presence of insect pests to meet APHIS standards for import and or shipping within the U.S. and USDA Organic certification standards. <br />It is expected that local temporary help will be supplied to assist breeders during the 4 week pollination period. Up to 150 person hours per week are anticipated required to provide this service. Local temporary help will also be provided during harvest and seed processing, in order to expedite the labor intensive process and return seed to breeders in a timely manner. Up to 150 person hours per week are also needed to provide this service. Contractor shall include all anticipated temporary costs in quotations. <br />A stock of planting, pollinating and harvest supplies will be maintained near the winter nursery site. An inventory of these supplies will be maintained to ensure supplies are available when needed. <br />The projected date for returning seed to breeders is June 15 each year but may be affected by unforeseen events. <br />52.212-2 Evaluation -- Commercial Items (Oct 2014)<br />(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:<br />(i) technical capability of the item offered to meet the Government requirement;<br />(ii) price;<br />(iii) past performance <br />Technical and past performance, when combined, are more important than price.<br />(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement.

Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).<br />(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.<br />(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the SAM database; (B) comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer.

If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an "I agree" click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., "click-wrap" or "browse-wrap" agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause.<br />(iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement.<br />(2) Paragraph (u)(1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures.<br />(v) Incorporation by reference. The Contractor's representations and certifications, including those completed electronically via the System for Award Management (SAM), are incorporated by reference into the contract.<br />(End of Clause)</p>

<p>52.212-2 EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS</p>
<p>ADDENDUM TO FAR 52.212-2 EVALUATION-COMMERCIAL ITEMS <br />EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD<br />Basis for Contract Award<br />This is a Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) best value source selection conducted in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.3, Source Selection, as supplemented by the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS), and the Army Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (AFARS). Award will be made to a single offeror who is deemed responsible in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), whose proposal conforms to the solicitation requirements, and whose proposal, judged by an overall assessment of the evaluation criteria and other considerations specified in this solicitation, represents the Lowest Priced Technically Acceptable offer.<br />Trade-offs between cost/price and non-cost/price factors are not permitted. Unreasonably high/unrealistically low, unbalanced, inaccurate or incomplete price proposals may be grounds for eliminating a proposal from competition.<br />The Government will evaluate proposed prices for reasonableness and balance by utilizing price analysis techniques. Proposed prices evaluated as unreasonable may be grounds for eliminating a proposal from competition.<br />The Government intends to award one (1) contract as a result of this solicitation. As set forth in FAR 52.215-1 (f)(4), the Government intends to evaluate proposals and technical specifications and award a contract without discussions with offerors (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a), Clarifications and award without discussions). Therefore, the offeror's initial proposal should contain the offeror's best terms from a cost or price and technical specifications.<br />EVALUATION CRITERIA: The evaluation criteria consists of factors. The proposals will be evaluated under two (2) evaluation factors:<br />FACTOR 1: Technical Acceptability of submitted specifications in accordance with salient characteristics of equipment<br />FACTOR 2: Price</p>
<p>A. EVALUATION APPROACH: <br />Factor 1--Technical Acceptability: The technical proposal must consist of the technical specifications for the washing machines and dryers supported by any additional information in sufficient detail to establish that the machines offered fully comply with the salient characteristics contained in PWS paragraphs Washer Machines and Dryer Machines. Likewise the technical proposal should confirm that offered machines are new out of the box and manufactured within the past two years. If the technical specifications provided do not address the warranty requirement Offerors shall confirm that offered machines will have a warranty meeting the requirements detailed in the PWS section entitled Warranty.<br />The Technical Acceptability evaluation provides an assessment of the offeror's submitted specifications on equipment proposed to satisfy the Government's requirement. The evaluation will focus on whether the offeror's proposal meets or does not meet the Government's requirements. The technical acceptability factor will receive one of the adjectival ratings defined below. Offerors must receive an "Acceptable" rating for the Technical Acceptability factor in order to be considered for award.<br /><br />Technical Evaluation Ratings<br />ADJECTIVAL RATING DESCRIPTION<br />Acceptable The equipment offered and terms clearly meet the minimum requirements of the solicitation.<br />Unacceptable The equipment offered and terms do not clearly meet the minimum requirements of the solicitation.</p>
<p>Factor 2--Price: Price will not be scored or rated. Evaluation of price will be performed using one or more of the price analysis techniques in FAR 15.404-1(b). Through these techniques, the Government will determine whether prices are reasonable, complete, and balanced. Unbalanced pricing may be evaluated in accordance with FAR 15.404-1(g), as applicable, to assess potential performance risk which could result in unreasonably high prices. <br />Definitions:<br />Reasonableness: A price is reasonable if, in its nature and amount, it does not exceed that which would be incurred by a prudent person in the conduct of competitive business. (FAR 31.201-3)<br />Unbalanced Pricing: Pricing that exists when, despite an acceptable total evaluated price, the price of one or more contract line item is significantly over/under stated as indicated by the application of cost or price analysis techniques. (FAR 15.404-1(g))<br />B. EVALUATION PROCEDURES:<br />The technical evaluator(s) shall assess each technical proposal submitted for "ACCEPTABILITY".<br />Proposals that are determined to be UNACCEPTABLE upon technical evaluation will be rejected. Failure to achieve a rating of Acceptable will result in an "Unacceptable" determination for the Technical Proposal. An "Unacceptable" rating results in elimination from further award consideration. <br />Award will be made to the lowest price technically acceptable offer unless the price is so low as to be unreasonable. The Government may determine that a proposal is unacceptable if the price offered is so low that it is determined that the offeror cannot accomplish the level of services promised in the technical proposal for the prices offered in the cost proposal. The Government will not award a contract at a price so low that it will create a likelihood that the offeror will fail to provide a satisfactory level of performance. Offerors offering unique cost saving initiatives should fully explain their cost methodology to substantiate their ability to perform at the prices offered. <br />(b) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<br />(End of provision)</p>

Competition for this purchase is limited to Xerox Brand name items only. The Brand Name justification is included in accordance with FAR 8.405-6(b)(1) as follows:</p>
<p>Xerox MFP's utilize standardized servers and drivers that facilitate management with regard to initial configuration, set-up, and modification. The capability to respond to an Information Technology (IT) security threat, such as viruses, worms, etc. in an expeditious manner is of paramount importance.

Therefore, under the authority of the Clinger-Cohen Act in establishing the Bureau's Information Technology (IT) Architectural infrastructure to ensure interoperability and compatibility throughout the enterprise, the CIO finds its beneficial to continue with the standardize hardware and software to facilitate ease of administration, as well as to provide for enhanced asset management.</p>

This test should be done with the following settings:
"	maximum transmit power
"	proper receiver gain and TGC that allows echo texture to be visible in the deep region
"	transmit focus at the deepest depth
The maximum depth of visualization is determined by comparing the gradually weakening echo texture to electronic noises near the bottom of the image.

(c)  For Laser Imager (Hard Copy Device)
Prior to filming any images, an SMPTE test pattern created by the Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers (SMPTE), should be printed using the appropriate window width (WW) and window level (WL).  If you are unfamiliar with this procedure, you should review Gray et al., "Test pattern for video display and hard-copy camera," Radiology 145:519-527 (1985), and then contact your local service engineer for assistance.  When printed, the 95% density patch within the 100% square and the 5% density patch within the 0% square should be visible, and there should be no notable distortions or artifacts present.  If these criteria are not met, contact your service engineer for laser camera calibration before proceeding with any filming.

(5)  Hard Copy Output Quality Test (Digital) (if applicable)
This test, or a similar test specifically recommended by the hard copy equipment manufacturer.

Required Test Equipment

"	Densitometer
"	SMPTE Test Pattern or another similar test pattern or phantom image having a wide range of gray scales.

The same test image should be used each time.

J.  Display Monitors

	The annual performance evaluation conducted by the diagnostic medical physicist includes testing of image acquisition display monitors for maximum and minimum luminance, luminance uniformity, resolution, and spatial accuracy.  The image acquisition display monitors for nuclear medicine, PET, CT and MRI units shall be tested. Assess the viewing conditions for the area in which the monitor used to evaluation the CBCT studies is located.

K.  Display Monitors - Minimum Criteria

Perform a visual analysis of the SMPTE test pattern.  
1.	Display the test pattern on the imaging console.  Set the display window width/level to the manufacturer-specified values for the pattern.  Do not set the window/level by eye; doing so invalidates the procedure.

2.	Examine the pattern to confirm that the gray level display in the imaging console is subjectively correct.
a.	Review the line pair patterns in the center and at each of the corners.
b.	Review the black-white transition.
c.	Look for any evidence of "scalloping" (loss of bit depth) or geometric distortion.
3.	Use a photometer to measure the maximum and minimum monitor brightness (0% and 100% steps)
4.	Measure additional steps within the pattern to establish a response curve.
5.	Measure the brightness near the center of the monitor and near all 4 corners (or all 4 sides, depending on the test pattern used).

5.  Review of the technical QA program:
The qualified expert shall review the technical QA program.  The review shall include a trend analysis of the QA data.  The results of the technical QA program review shall be included in the written report.  Any trends that identify problems shall be included in the report along with recommended corrective actions.

<DESC>COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION<br />CUSTOM IMAGING NEPHELOMETER
<p>(I) This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice and in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures authorized in FAR Part 13. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.</p>
<p>(II) This solicitation is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ). Submit written quotes on RFQ Number NRMJ3000-16-00006SRG.</p>
<p>(III) The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-84.</p>
<p>(IV) This solicitation is being issued as a total small business set-aside. The associated NAICS code is 334519. The small business size standard is 500 employees.</p>
<p>(V) This combined solicitation/synopsis is for purchase of the following commercial services and products:<br />CLIN 0001 - CUSTOM IMAGING NEPHELOMETER</p>
<p>(VI) Description of requirements is as follows:<br />CLIN 0001 - CUSTOM IMAGING NEPHELOMETER<br />PURPOSE:</p>
<p>A custom imaging nephelometer, including the instrument and some non-recoverable development costs. This instrument will be paired with a custom cavity enhanced spectrometer and a custom photoacoustic spectrometer (both already built at NOAA) to study the optical properties of aerosol particles that may absorb light in the blue and ultraviolet portions of the spectrum. This is known and brown carbon absorption and is commonly encountered in smoke.</p>
<p>TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:</p>
<p>The instrument will measure the light scattered from an internal aerosol sample at 405 nm and one shorter wavelength such as 355 nm, 375 nm or similar wavelength. Preference will be given to a design that can incorporate a third wavelength. The instrument will image the scattered light from a laser beam onto a camera for simultaneous detection of light scattering over a range of angles. The range of angles will include forward scattering angles as small as 10 degrees with preference given to achieving 5 degrees. The range of angles will include reverse scattering angles as large as 165 degrees with preference given to achieving 175 degrees. The sensitivity will be sufficient to use Rayleigh scattering of air as a standard. Except for wavelength and polarization, the overall instrument block design will be reasonably similar to that described in the paper by Dolgos and Martins (Optics Express, Vol. 22, DOI:10.1364/OE.22.021972, 2014).</p>
<p>The instrument will be delivered as a research instrument with rudimentary software. The selected firm will provide NOAA with all results of calibration and tests during development. NOAA will be responsible for any further calibrations and can participate in testing the instrument and writing additional processing software. NOAA will be able to send one person to the selected firm for up to 2 months in order to participate in this co-development.</p>
<p><br />(VII) Delivery will be to US DOC NOAA ESRL, CHEMICAL SCIENCES DIVISION, 325 BROADWAY R/CSD1, BOULDER, CO, 80305. DELIVERY SHALL BE FOB DESTINATION WITHIN 6 MONTHS FROM DATE OF AWARD.</p>
<p>(VIII) FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors -- Commercial Items (OCT 2015), applies to this acquisition. This is a Best Value Acquisition.</p>
<p>NOTICE TO OFFERORS: Instructions for submitting quotations under this request for quote must be followed.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

<DESC>The purpose of the Health Technical Assistance Project (Bantu is to identify, recruit, hire, administer and support qualified individuals or organizations to provide short or long-term technical assistance as needed and requested by USAID Indonesia's Office of Health, in particular, to support USAID's GHI and CDCS strategies and priorities specifically related to health results as described above. The Bantu project will provide specialized, high-level technical assistance to USAID, USAID-funded programs, the GOI (e.g., the Ministry of Health (MOH), National AIDS Commission, Indonesian Commission for Hospital Accreditation, the Office of the Special Envoy for the MDGs, etc.) parastatal organizations (e.g., Eijkman Institute), sub-national government (e.g., district health office), non-governmental organizations (NGOs), civil society organizations (CSOs), academic institutions, and other research institutes as required. Bantu will provide technical assistance in support of the goals and objectives of USAID Indonesia and the GOI in the context of the new CDCS strategy in which USAID and the GOI are partners and co-investors in development.

Most of the specific technical assistance requests will contribute to achievement of specific health results as defined by USAID's CDCS; in some cases, technical assistance requests may also be required to assist USAID in carrying out the planning, implementation and evaluation of its health programs, such as hiring consultants to conduct assessments or evaluations. Bantu will maintain an up-to-date database of professionals, consultancy firms, and other short-term technical assistance organizations; as well as develop and maintain a streamlined hiring or procurement process to allow for quick response to Mission needs. Bantu will be expected to procure the services of individual experts (Indonesia, U.S. or third-country national) as well as of local organizations to fulfill the tasks requested.</p>
<p>This activity will primarily support the implementation of USAID/Indonesia's GHI strategy and the accomplishment of its Development Objectives related to health under the CDCS. It will support current and future areas of strategic interest, including USAID Forward, USAID Evaluation Policy, and other directives.</p>
<p>The Contractor must identify, contract and make available short- and long-term individuals, organizations, or subcontractors to perform the specific tasks identified and requested by the USAID/Indonesia Office of Health. For the purposes of the Bantu contract, short-term assignments will be those that last up to six months; long-term assignments will be six months to three years. The Contractor must identify appropriate consultants with the required expertise, availability, language proficiencies, and experience for each task. Placements, while primarily in Jakarta, may also be in other provinces of Indonesia or in some cases require significant in-country travel.</p>
<p>The Contractor must be responsible for maintaining clear lines of communication with USAID that ensure timeliness and responsiveness to project tasks, completeness of the database, regular feedback on performance of individual consultants and organizations on specific assignments, and satisfactory completion of deliverables and assignments.</p>
<p>USAID will plan, to the extent possible, all anticipated consultant and technical assistance needs and annually submit to the Contractor a plan for consultancies, upon which the Contractor must build their annual work plan. This will determine the level of effort and budget. However, within this plan, there will be planned allowances for short-term consultancies that may arise over the course of the year.</p>
<p>The Contractor must, as instructed by USAID, coordinate and collaborate with other identified partners and USAID programs. Furthermore, the Contractor must utilize local individuals and local organizations as appropriate in order to contribute to capacity development. If local individuals and organizations are used, the Contractor must manage the logistics, travel, per diem, and other such appropriate allowances as will be necessary to relocate these consultants domestically to their assignment location.</p>
<p>The Contractor must provide oversight mechanisms to avoid an actual or the appearance of conflict of interest. In addition, the Contractor must vet the backgrounds and affiliations of all proposed candidates, securing Non-Disclosure and Conflict Agreement forms affirming the they do not have a conflict of interest, when appropriate.</p>
<p>The United States Government, as represented by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) Mission to Indonesia, is seeking proposals from qualified organizations interested in providing the services described in the attached solicitation.</p>
<p>This procurement is being conducted through full and open competition for which the procedures set forth in FAR Part 15 shall apply.</p>
<p>Proposals will be accepted from U.S. or non-U.S. Non-governmental organizations (NGOs), private, for-profit and non-profit organizations, including universities, research organizations, professional associations, and relevant special interest associations. In support of the Agency's interest in expanding the number and sustainability of development partners, USAID encourages proposals from potential new partners USAID plans to award a Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) term type contract, with a total estimated cost in the range of $19 to $23 million covering a total estimated period of five years. Revealing the estimated cost range for the contract does not mean that Offerors should necessarily strive to meet the maximum amount estimated. Offerors must propose costs that they believe are realistic and reasonable for the work. Cost proposals will be evaluated as part of the best value procedure in determining the contract award. The cost effectiveness of Offerors' proposed approaches to achieving the results will be evaluated.</p>
<p>This notice does not obligate USAID to release a solicitation or award a contract nor does it commit the Government to pay for costs incurred in the preparation and submission of a proposal. In addition, final award cannot be made until funds have been fully appropriated, allocated, and committed and internal USAID procedures have been completed. This notice satisfies the synopsis requirement in FAR 5.201.</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for Architect-Engineer services.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.    <br>  <br> 1. GENERAL INFORMATION: <br>   <br> The US Army Corps of Engineers, Middle East District, hereby solicits for A-E Services via Indefinite Delivery Contract (IDC) to be procured with the Brooks Act (Public Law 92-582, as amended: 40 U.S.C. 541) and Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 36.  Firms will be selected for negotiation based on demonstrated competence and qualifications for the required work.  The services will include civil work requirements determined primary from requests by GCC countries that support multi-billion dollar infrastructure improvement programs. The United States Army Corps of Engineers, Transatlantic Division Middle East District (TAM) intends to award up to two (2) A-E Single Award Task Order Contracts (SATOCs), with an estimated overall capacity of ninety million dollars ($90,000,000.00), ($45 million each) under a single solicitation.  Each contract will have a guaranteed minimum amount of $5,000.00 for each of the awarded SATOCs.  The period of performance for each SATOC shall include one 12-month base period and four 12-month option periods, for an overall performance period of five years. Work will be issued by negotiated firm-fixed-price task orders not to exceed maximum limits. The total capacity may be used at any time throughout the life of the contract and the Government reserves the right to move the capacity forward as necessary to meet operational needs.  Options will be exercised in accordance with FAR 52.217-9,  quote mark Option to Extend the Term of the Contract. quote mark  Only firms who are committed to working on-site and in-country, either as the prime firm or with subcontractors, in all regions and areas within TAM's AOR will be considered for this solicitation. The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 541330, which has a size standard of $15,000,000 in average annual receipts.  This announcement is open to all businesses regardless of size.  The contract is anticipated to be awarded in second quarter of FY 2016 for the initial one-year period. All large business firms, selected for this contract, must comply with FAR 52.219-9,  quote mark Small Business Subcontracting Plan, quote mark  regarding the requirement for an acceptable subcontracting plan on that part of the work it intends to subcontract. The plan is not required to be included in the information submitted in response to this announcement. Work will be issued by negotiated firm-fixed-price or labor-hour task orders. It is TAM's intent to issue most task orders as firm fixed-price actions. The task orders are anticipated to be equally distributed between the two design firms; however, this distribution may change depending upon the changing needs and contingency environment of TAM's AOR. These large-scale civil works program requirements will primarily be within countries of Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Qatar, and Kuwait.  TAM's AOR has traditionally paralleled the CENTCOM AOR, which includes the Middle East, the Arabian Gulf states, and portions of Southwest and Central Asia, and Africa.  While the primary focus of this contract will be on work within the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries (Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Bahrain, Kuwait, United Arab Emirates, and Oman), the A-E firm must be able to perform work throughout TAM's AOR and worldwide.  TAM subcontracting goals are as follows:  <br>  <br> (a) 7% of the contract value subcontracted or performed with small business concerns; (b) 1% of the contract value subcontracted or performed with those small business concerns owned and controlled by HUBZones; (c) 1% of the contract value subcontracted or performed with those small business concerns owned and controlled by Service-Disabled Veterans; (d) 1% of the contract value subcontracted or performed with those small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantage individuals; (e) 1% of the contract value subcontracted or performed with those small business concerns owned and controlled by women. Contractor compliance with the Small Business Subcontracting Plan will be monitored through regular submission of reports into the Electronic Subcontracting Reporting System (eSRS). This plan is not required with this submittal, but will be required with the fee proposal of the firm selected for negotiations.  <br>  <br> To be eligible for contract award, a firm must be registered in System for Award Management (SAM). Register via the SAM internet site at https://www.sam.gov.  <br> NOTE: All firms should be aware of the limitations of DFARS 236.602-70. This clause requires that A-E contracts funded by military construction appropriations that are estimated to exceed $500,000, and are to be performed in countries bordering the Arabian Gulf, can only be awarded to United States firms or to joint ventures of United States and host nation firms. TAM's AOR contains many countries that border on the Arabian Gulf such as Iraq, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain, United Arab Emirates (UAE), Oman and Saudi Arabia. In fact, the majority of the countries where TAM has a current presence and construction work border the Arabian Gulf. Consequently, while this acquisition is to be issued as full and open to allow for the greatest amount of competition among qualified A-E firms, it is noted that at least 50%, if not more, of the task orders to be awarded (and, consequently, a majority of the total dollar value of task order awards) under the new A-E IDCs will be limited to U.S. firms or joint ventures involving U.S. firms.  <br>  <br> 2. PROJECT LOCATION: <br>  <br> A-E services to support mission execution throughout the CENTCOM AOR and, in particular, the GCC (Gulf Cooperation Council) countries of Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Bahrain, Kuwait, UAE, and Oman.  <br>   <br> 3.

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <BR> <BR>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <BR> <BR>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <BR> <BR>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <BR> <BR>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

Destination Only. <BR> <BR>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <BR> <BR>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <BR> <BR>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <BR> <BR>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <BR> <BR>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

<p>TITLE: Advanced Software Engineering Technologies for the Software Producibility Initiative</p>
<p>ANNOUNCEMENT TYPE: Initial Announcement</p>
<p>FUNDING OPPORTUNITY NUMBER: BAA-RIK-12-06</p>
<p>CFDA Number: 12.800</p>
<p>I. FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:</p>
<p>Background: On behalf of the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD), Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (OASD(R&amp;E)), the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) is seeking white papers for Advanced Software Engineering TechnologieS (ASETS) as part of the Software Producibility Initiative (SWPI). SWPI is an ongoing program with the overall goal of improving the Department of Defense's (DoD's) ability to design, build, test, and sustain software-intensive systems that are large-scale, high complexity, highly reliable, and operate in relevant military environments, which meet mission critical requirements, safety critical requirements as well as exhibit predictable behavior.</p>
<p>Within SWPI, the ASETS BAA focuses on discovering and adapting cutting-edge ideas in computer science, mathematics, and information science to the production of military software. ASETS seeks to improve the producibility of software-intensive systems that directly support the Warfighter and operate in the most demanding military environments. Producibility may be defined as the capacity to design, produce, assure and evolve software-intensive systems in a predictable manner while effectively managing risk, cost, schedule, quality, and complexity [1]. Previous efforts have provided the foundation for future work by investigating specification of complex requirements; "correct-by-construction" software development; scalable composition; high-confidence software and middleware; system architectures for network-centric environments; technologies for system visualization, testing, verification, and validation; model-driven development approaches; data analytics; and digital curation &amp; forensics.</p>
<p>The ASETS BAA is weapons-system agnostic because software cross-cuts nearly all DoD weapons systems. The ASETS BAA is seeking innovative ideas to improve the DoD's ability to develop and sustain software systems; the ASETS BAA is not requesting effort to perform the sustainment. ASETS research concentrations are organized by software gap areas to focus investigations on software technology and to provide solutions that are broadly applicable to many systems.</p>
<p>Capability Gap: The DoD strives for superiority in a complex operational environment composed of heterogeneous and ever-evolving pieces such as sensors and processing hardware, software, and wired and wireless communications infrastructure. To achieve superiority in this dynamic environment, the DoD invests in fully networked and maximally-capable sensors and platforms at the cutting edge of performance. Software has emerged as a key enabler of capability and flexibility in DoD systems. Software is essential to providing a vast range of military capabilities by playing a fundamental role [1] that deepens, broadens, links, and integrates diverse system elements.</p>
<p>A pervasive DoD challenge is the production of software that provides the Warfighter superior and affordable military capability in an environment where hardware and sensor technology is rapidly advancing and systems' performance demands are ever-increasing. The Government Accountability Office has identified the increasing scope of software development as a contributing factor to poor acquisition program outcome [2]. OASD(R&amp;E) has identified the need for advanced software engineering technology to enhance the producibility of software in this environment with the goal of speeding the delivery of affordable capability to the Warfighter and sustaining it. Specific needs are discussed in the description of Research Concentrations Areas below.</p>
<p>Objective: White papers are being solicited for innovative approaches within the concentration areas listed below. Of interest are advanced software engineering technologies that harness cutting-edge ideas in computer science, mathematics, and information science to enable production of large-scale software-intensive systems with improved quality and performance, decreases in cost and development times, automation of labor-intensive and error-prone processes, increased reliability, and easier integration and sustainment. Proposed ideas should be candidates for advanced technology development and have an established theoretical basis. Techniques solely involving management and business processes are specifically excluded, as are efforts to sustain software systems</p>
<p>Research Concentration Areas: White papers are welcomed in the four technical areas listed below. Cross-cutting proposals are also welcome, but should be identified as such. Proposals should focus generally on technology that enables the production of broad classes of software and not solve implementation-specific problems.</p>
<p>Technical Area 1: Distributed Processing / Multi-core Processing: Investigate approaches that address the production of systems that use parallel or distributed processing. The DoD lacks the ability to quickly, accurately, and affordably optimize software in heterogeneous, multi-core environments that are dynamic and continually evolving.</p>
<p>Future growth in computing performance will have to come from software parallelism that can exploit hardware parallelism [3]. The need for robust, general, and scalable parallel software approaches presents challenges that affect the entire DoD computing ecosystem. These systems range from large, distributed processing enterprises (including clouds) to self-contained embedded platforms such as aircraft where deterministic behavior and real-time control are essential. The environments include heterogeneous processing, and diverse communications channels with characteristics (e.g., latency and packet-loss) that vary over six-orders of magnitude. The National Academy of Sciences report entitled "The Future of Computing Performance" [3] identifies five main challenges to increasing performance and energy efficiency through parallelism:</p>
<p>1. Finding independent operations.<br />2. Communicating between operations.<br />3. Preserving locality between operations.<br />4. Synchronizing operations.<br />5. Balancing the load represented by the operations among the system resources.</p>
<p>Promising research areas include, but are not limited to: partitioning approaches that address data dependencies, data locations, algorithmic dependencies, computational dependencies, and read and write dependencies; rethinking programming models so that programmers can express application parallelism; managing asynchronous behaviors; methods for resource allocation, load balancing, data communication, and synchronization of interactions; new programming languages with appropriate compilation and runtime support; graphical design approaches; executable design specifications; transactional memory approaches; and shared memory management approaches.</p>
<p>Technical Area 2: Completeness, Development, Testing, and Sustainment: Investigate approaches that address the ability to design, produce, and assure large and complex software systems. In very large and complex systems, the DoD lacks the ability to quickly, accurately, and affordably check for the completeness of software with respect to design, the correctness of the software with respect to domain models, the traceability of software features to requirements, and the validation of system function against rigorous sets of performance and reliability standards.</p>
<p>A large DoD system can have in excess of 100 million lines of code, 100s to 1,000s of configuration items, and diverse implementations (programming languages, operating systems, middleware, etc.). These systems may be built by different and geographically distributed developers and require nearly continuous modification and upgrades. It is not unusual to have simultaneous, conflicting requirements (performance, real-time processing, bounded failure recovery, security, etc.) in systems that are not identified until late stages of testing or integration. Further, unanticipated errors and conditions may arise from imprecise estimations during design, possible-but-unlikely inputs or stimuli, changes in the physical environment, operator error, or novel usage. All these factors make it very difficult for the DoD to design, produce, and assure software.</p>
<p>Promising research areas include, but are not limited to: formal specification; syntactic and semantic methods; improvements to code quality (including formal verification); scaling improvements for formal methods; representations and quantification of uncertainty and risk; innovative theorem provers and satisfiability solvers; static and run-time analyzers; model checking approaches; innovative formal methods for architectures, refinement, and change traceability; characterizations of functional and non-functional properties; integration of specification or model-based methods with measurement-based methods; improved fault-tolerance, robustness, adaptability; sampling and measurement; runtime verification; forecasting system behaviors; thresholds to alert users; control recommendations; fault isolation; runtime code replacement or modification; identification of faults induced by hardware, residual software defects, or external influences; and testing and evaluation techniques.</p>
<p>Technical Area 3: Instrumentation and Monitoring: Investigate approaches that enable quantitative and data-driven decisions about the production of software. The DoD lacks the ability to quickly, accurately, and affordably develop quantitative and data-driven descriptions of software that provide programmers and project leaders in Government and industry the same understanding of large and complex software-intensive systems. This gap leads to diverging or speculative assessments of project progress and system performance. It also hampers the test and evaluation community in designing and making assessments of sub-system and system performance that can clearly distinguish software performance from hardware performance.</p>
<p>Promising research areas include, but are not limited to: instrumentation and monitoring of software and firmware with minimal invasiveness; multi-scale and multi-modal approaches such as representations, abstractions, and composition of models and measurements; integration of specification-based methods and measurement-based methods; quantification and representation of uncertainty; dynamic identification of performance metrics; data analytics that improve the performance of integrated development environments; automated data-capture and analysis for software-engineering process improvement; and code visualization.</p>
<p>Technical Area 4: Legacy Software: Investigate approaches that address evolution and interoperability of older software with newly produced or upgraded software. The DoD lacks the ability to quickly, accurately, and affordably integrate newly-developed code with older code and verify system performance. Further, the DoD lacks complete code archives for its legacy systems. This thrust is distinct from the other technical areas because it pre-supposes that the developer will encounter software that was not designed to be easily upgraded or changed. Further, this thrust is not seeking approaches that improve the ability to sustain the software in a particular system. Approaches must investigate novel techniques that could be adopted in the future to sustain many different systems.</p>
<p>The sustainment phase of software is critical for DoD systems given the long life of these systems. Software sustainment can be characterized as either (1) the modification or correction of existing code or (2) development of new functions or performance improvements that provide increased capability to enhance weapon system relevance [4]. Further complicating the task is that systems must integrate or interoperate with older or "legacy" systems whose code may have been written in an obsolete language, in a different context, or with different assumptions. It is prohibitively expensive to rewrite these legacy applications and "wrapping" them has fundamental performance limits for the distributed environment.</p>
<p>Promising research areas include, but are not limited to: methods for extracting the architectural information, sub-components, and flow and inheritance graphs from object code; reverse engineering; digital forensics; digital curation; identifying functional and nonfunctional requirements in legacy code; traceability link recovery; deriving interface requirements between legacy and new code; methods for conversion and refactoring legacy code into new structured programs; and alternate frameworks for the examining legacy code.</p>

<p><br />V. APPLICATION REVIEW INFORMATION:</p>
<p>1. CRITERIA: White papers and/or proposals will be evaluated through a peer or scientific review process using the following criteria, listed in descending order of importance, to determine whether white papers and proposals submitted are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government:</p>
<p>(1) Overall Scientific and Technical Merit of the Proposed Approach - 1a) The extent to which the objective of the proposed approach provides improvements over already-existing approaches, if any, that are currently used to reach the same objective as the proposed approach. 1b) The extent to which the description of the proposed technical approach is distinct from other currently-researched or emerging approaches, if any, with the same objective. <br />(2) The merit of measurement techniques for tracking progress on the proposed effort. <br />(3) Return on Investment - The extent to which the offerors proposed approach provides a return on investment including metrics and measurement techniques to validate the claims. <br />(4) Transition Likelihood - The merit of the offeror's proposed path to broad adoption of the proposed approach. <br />(5) Related Experience - The extent to which the offeror demonstrates relevant technology and domain knowledge. <br />(6) Openness/Maturity of Solution - The extent to which existing capabilities and standards are leveraged and the relative maturity of the proposed technology in terms of reliability and robustness. (7) Reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees (if any).</p>
<p>No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting white papers/proposals. White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.</p>
<p>2. REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS: Only Government employees will evaluate the white papers/proposals for selection. The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in the administrative support contract, which do not require the review, reading, and comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks." These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements. The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&amp;D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries. Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.</p>
<p>3. ADEQUATE PRICE COMPETITION: The Government may simultaneously evaluate proposals received under this BAA with a common cutoff date for multiple offerors. In this case, the Government may make award based on adequate price competition, and offerors must be aware that there is a possibility of non-selection due to a proposal of similar but higher-priced technical approach as compared to another offeror.</p>
<p><br />VI. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION:</p>
<p>1. AWARD NOTICES: Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email will be sent by the technical POC. Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract. Those white papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner. Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.</p>
<p>All offerors submitting white papers will only be contacted via email by the technical POC, referenced in Section VII of this announcement. Offerors can email the technical POC for status of their white paper/proposal no earlier than 45 days after submission.</p>
<p>2. ADMINISTRATIVE AND NATIONAL POLICY REQUIREMENTS: The offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility to support work under this BAA. This acquisition may involve data that is subject to export control laws and regulations. Only contractors who are registered and certified with the Defense Logistics Information Service (DLIS) at http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp/ and have a legitimate business purpose may participate in this solicitation.

You must submit a copy of your approved DD Form 2345, Militarily Critical Technical Data Agreement, with your Proposal.</p>
<p>3. Data Rights: The potential for inclusion of Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) or data rights other than unlimited on awards is recognized. In accordance with (IAW) the Small Business Administration (SBA) SBIR Policy Directive, Section 8(b), SBIR data rights clauses are non-negotiable and must not be the subject of negotiations pertaining to an award, or diminished or removed during award administration. Issuance of an award will not be made conditional based on forfeit of data rights. If the SBIR awardee wishes to transfer its SBIR data rights to the Air Force or to a third party, it must do so in writing under a separate agreement. A decision by the awardee to relinquish, transfer, or modify in any way its SBIR data rights must be made without pressure or coercion by the agency or any other party. Non-SBIR data rights less than unlimited will be evaluated and negotiated on a case-by-case basis. Government Purpose Rights are anticipated for data developed with DoD-reimbursed Independent Research and Development (IR&amp;D) funding.</p>
<p>4. REPORTING: Once a proposal has been selected for award, the offeror will be given complete instructions on the submission process for submitting reports required during the life of the contract.</p>
<p>5. NOTICE: The following provisions apply:<br />(a) DFARS 252.239-7017, Notice of Supply Chain Risk (Nov 2013)<br />(b) DFARS 252.204-7009, Compliance with Safeguarding covered Defense Information Controls</p>
<p>6. GRANT AWARDS ONLY: For efforts proposed as grant awards, offerors must provide an abstract in their proposal (not to exceed one page) that is publicly releasable and that describes - in terms the public may understand - the project or program supported by the grant.

<p>TITLE: Aerial Layer Communications</p>
<p>ANNOUNCEMENT TYPE: Initial announcement</p>
<p>FUNDING OPPORTUNITY NUMBER: BAA RIK-14-06</p>
<p>CFDA Number: 12.800</p>
<p>I. FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:</p>
<p>The Air Force Research Laboratory - Information Directorate (AFRL/RI) is soliciting white papers under this BAA for research, design, development, concept testing, evaluation and experimentation of technologies/techniques for airborne networking and the development and demonstration of mid-altitude aerial layer communication technologies and concepts.</p>
<p>The characteristics of today's aerial layer networks are limiting our combat effectiveness, especially in contested, degraded, operationally limited (CDO), and anti-access area denial (A2/AD) environments where studies have shown that we may be unable to maintain communication availability, and will be outnumbered/outgunned if the status-quo is maintained.</p>
<p>Major challenges include the transformation of the attributes of today's networks to the attributes of the desired network as shown below, while maintaining interoperability.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Today's Network Attributes&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Desired Network Attributes <br /></span>Platform- and link-centric&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Network-of-networks centric<br /><br />Self-contained&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Open<br /><br />Preplanned&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Flexible and Ad Hoc<br /><br />Contains components designed for&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Contains components designed for <br />&nbsp; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">wired</span> and/or <span style="text-decoration: underline;">static</span> applications&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">wireless</span> and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">dynamic</span> applications<br /><br />Demos done on specific platforms <br />&nbsp; requiring modification&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Demos performed on PODs</p>
<p>In addition, adequate capabilities for airborne network management are lacking today and there is a need in the community for solutions to manage and plan both today's multi-information link based airborne network environment and tomorrow's heterogeneous based architectures. Furthermore, a lack of dexterous network management and recovery mechanisms makes it hard to provide the necessary level of network reliability and survivability at the battlefield. This is nowhere more factual than in A2/AD environments where the ability to make rapid adaptations based on the situation is crucial.</p>
<p>This BAA seeks white papers that have a goal to improve the network, and cause the network to become a force multiplier. A force multiplier is a capability that, when added to and employed by a combat force, significantly increases the combat potential of that force and thus enhances the probability of successful mission accomplishment. Example areas of interest are:</p>
<p>1. Secure, Dynamic, ad-Hoc, Adaptable, and Programmable Aerial Mesh Networks<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. Routers and Security Devices<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b.

<p>V. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">APPLICATION REVIEW INFORMATION</span>:</p>
<p>1. CRITERIA: The following criteria, which are listed in descending order of importance, will be used to determine whether white papers and proposals submitted are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1) Overall Scientific and Technical Merit - Including the approach for the development and/or enhancement of the proposed technology;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2) Related Experience - The extent to which the offeror demonstrates relevant technology and domain knowledge;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3) Openness/Maturity of Solution - The extent to which existing capabilities and standards are leveraged and the relative maturity of the proposed technology in terms of reliability and robustness;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (4) Reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees (if any).</p>
<p>No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting white papers/proposals. White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.</p>
<p>2. REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS: Only Government employees will evaluate the white papers/proposals for selection. The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in the administrative support contract, which do not require the review, reading, and comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks." These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements. The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&amp;D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries. Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.</p>
<p>3. The Government may simultaneously evaluate proposals received under this BAA with a common cutoff date from multiple offerors. In this case, the Government may make award based on adequate price competition, and offerors must be aware that there is a possibility of non-selection due to a proposal of similar but higher-priced technical approach as compared to another offeror.</p>
<p>VI. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION</span>:</p>
<p>1. AWARD NOTICES: Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email or letter will be sent by the technical POC. Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract. Those white papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner. Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.</p>
<p>All offerors submitting white papers will be contacted by the technical POC, referenced in Section IV, Paragraph 6 of this announcement. Offerors can email the technical POC for status of their white paper/proposal no earlier than 45 days after submission.</p>
<p>2. ADMINISTRATIVE AND NATIONAL POLICY REQUIREMENTS:</p>
<p>Depending on the work to be performed, the offeror may require a Top Secret facility clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to Top Secret information at the time of award. In addition, the offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility to support work under this BAA. This acquisition may involve data that is subject to export control laws and regulations. Only contractors who are registered and certified with the Defense Logistics Information Service (DLIS) at http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp/ and have a legitimate business purpose may participate in this solicitation.

In accordance with (IAW) the Small Business Administration (SBA) SBIR Policy Directive, Section 8(b), SBIR data rights clauses are non-negotiable and must not be the subject of negotiations pertaining to an award, or diminished or removed during award administration. Issuance of an award will not be made conditional based on forfeit of data rights. If the SBIR awardee wishes to transfer its SBIR data rights to the Air Force or to a third party, it must do so in writing under a separate agreement. A decision by the awardee to relinquish, transfer, or modify in any way its SBIR data rights must be made without pressure or coercion by the agency or any other party. Non-SBIR data rights less than unlimited will be evaluated and negotiated on a case-by-case basis. Government Purpose Rights are anticipated for data developed with DoD-reimbursed Independent Research and Development (IR&amp;D) funding.</p>
<p>4. REPORTING: Once a proposal has been selected for award, offerors will be given complete instructions on the submission process for the reports.</p>
<p>5. NOTICE: The following provisions apply:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (a) DFARS 252.239-7017, Notice of Supply Chain Risk (Nov 2013)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (b) DFARS 252.204-7009, Compliance with Safeguarding covered Defense Information Controls</p>

<p>BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT (BAA) TITLE: Mission Awareness for Mission Assurance (MAMA)</p>
<p>BAA ANNOUNCEMENT TYPE: Initial announcement</p>
<p>BAA NUMBER: BAA RIK-2014-0014</p>
<p>CATALOG OF FEDERAL DOMESTIC ASSISTANCE (CFDA) Number: 12.800</p>
<p>I. FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:</p>
<p>The Information Directorate of the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL/RI), Rome Research Site, is soliciting white papers under this announcement for innovative technologies to enable effective cyber situational awareness (SA) during mission execution to achieve mission assurance for military operations.</p>
<p>AFRL/RI conducts research in the areas of information management and dissemination as well as cyber science and technology. This research has led to the development of service oriented information management and dissemination implementations, in particular, Phoenix Prime. The continued development and maturation of innovative concepts and enhanced services that maximize the situational awareness during mission execution to achieve mission assurance of military operations is the primary focus of this BAA.</p>
<p><strong>Background</strong>: The Information Management Technologies Branch of the Information Directorate of the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), Rome Research Site, are researching and developing techniques and services for information management in diverse military environments. Information Management (IM) is defined as a set of intentional activities to maximize the value of information to support the objectives of the military enterprise. These activities include role/policy based information access control, information tagging and contextualization through semantic assessment, discovery and identification, scalability and responsiveness to resource availability and the administrative activities that support them. Understanding how concepts for sharing information amongst disparate producers, consumers and operational domains and the technologies that can be applied in the unique military operational and tactical domains are of critical importance.</p>
<p>AFRL's information centric technology vision has culminated in a suite of AFRL Information Management (IM) services known as Phoenix Prime. Phoenix Prime is a service oriented information system that enables the management of all information interactions through domain independent "universal services" whose functions include obtaining, discovering, characterizing, identifying, prioritizing, mediating, persisting and disseminating information within and between mission partners. The most recent Phoenix Prime developments correlate users with operational activities, determine information requirements, assess information for mission relevance and establish information processing priorities based upon mission importance and system resource availability. <br /><br />A new consolidated program called "Mission Awareness for Mission Assurance" (MAMA) is being started under this BAA. The goal of MAMA is to enhance cyber situational awareness by the automated assessment of mission execution through the analysis of network traffic flows. This resultant capability is an enabler to achieving mission assurance by allowing prioritization of mission essential functions, mapping of critical cyber assets, vulnerability assessment of mission essential functions and mitigation of vulnerabilities and risks.</p>
<p>A key component of the Cyber Vision 2025 tenet of "Assure and Empower the mission" is that ensuring survivability and freedom of action in contested and denied environments requires enhanced cyber situational awareness (SA) for air, space, and cyber commanders. This can be enabled by, in part, mission mapping. The vision goes on to identify then enabling science and technology (S&amp;T) for mission assurance and empowerment as mission mapping to systems components, cyber mission verification across sensors/platforms and dynamic cyber mission configuration. This program acknowledges that cyber is inextricably entwined with the air and space missions, yet the Air Force has no "true" cyber SA, even for limited critical missions; therefore, the vision of this program is to expand upon the Cyber Vision 2025 S&amp;T platform to not only cyber missions, but to all Air Force missions.&nbsp; Much like the recommendations made by Cyber Vision 2025, the Scientific Advisory Board Study on Cyber Situational Awareness also advocates S&amp;T investment in automated mission mapping, data tagging, utilization of context-aware routers and the evaluation of these technologies in an operationally relevant environment. The study sees this investment crucial to addressing the fact that, even for critical missions, there is almost no understanding of Air Force mission dependencies on information systems.&nbsp; The global AF enterprise relies heavily on communication networks to achieve its mission of global vigilance, global reach and global power. However, as the AF and the nation are gaining unprecedented capabilities from high capacity global networks, it is also contending with increasingly sophisticated threats to its networks and systems. These threats range from distributed denial of service, to Anti-satellite (ASAT), to insider threats. While there are significant investments seeking to mitigate these threats, none will eliminate them. AFRL/RI recognizes that the first step to mission assurance, despite the presence of these threats, is improved SA for decision makers at all levels. This program seeks to provide mission awareness through extraction and analysis of content transiting the Air Force Network (AFNET), to inform Command and Control (C2) elements monitoring mission execution, and to control critical network elements to improve mission effectiveness.</p>
<p>MAMA's challenge is to first identify what specific missions are supported by what specific information flows. This is called "mapping information to missions." However, simply counting packets between endpoints may provide a measure of network performance, but it does not indicate much about mission performance. The Air Force must separate the SA needed to support cyber-dependent mission assurance from awareness of network health and status. Reports to commanders must be at the mission-impact level, not at the network level. The key is to operate higher in the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) stack by tagging information objects with mission relevant data. MAMA will extract semantic content from mission relevant metadata of transiting information objects to assess mission status. In addition to supporting a MAMA's goal of addressing current missions, it is anticipated that the massive amount of extracted semantic content will be useful for other goals such as identification of "low and slow" cyber threats, a big data problem that falls outside the scope of MAMA, but within the scope of AFRL/RI. <br /><br />AFRL/RI is uniquely suited to develop the MAMA concept because it draws heavily upon a maturing, moderate Technology Readiness Level (TRL), set of prior investments to accomplish its objectives. Among these is the Content and Context-aware Trust Router (CCTR) as the high capacity broker that is capable of extracting and brokering information around the AFNET. The broker will forward selected traffic to Phoenix Prime, a cloud-scale enterprise-class information management system that will extract semantic content into a triple store accessible to backend analytics engines. The triple stores will challenge AFRL/RI's high performance computing expertise to maintain performance over time in an effort to continuously assess mission status. Perhaps most importantly, it will marry up AFRL/RISA's adaptive mission templates with a specific mission domain to semantically model the mission space, extract mission orders, and support mission awareness.</p>
<p>The Department of Defense (DoD) and AF are operating within a contested cyber environment and its ability to accomplish their mission will require responding to network dynamics. In addition, peer competitors may deny us continuous communications with mission assets, leading to uncertainty for commanders. MAMA, while not directly assuring the mission, supports mission assurance by providing a network elements basis for resource allocation, and monitors information flows to infer mission performance on a large scale.</p>
<p>AFRL/RIS proposes to focus this program on the Space domain for several reasons. First, as a less mature domain, it is more receptive to technology insertion than the Air domain that has more mature processes and is in the midst of major acquisition efforts.</p>
<p>The high level challenge of providing mission awareness for mission assurance can be broken down into several sub-challenges that are addressed within the program structure. This BAA comprises three projects with each having its own technical risks that require substantial S&amp;T: 1) Mapping the Mission to Information Flows 2) Mission Information Sufficiency, Correlation, and Event Learning (MISCEL) and 3) Integration, Demonstration and Validation of MAMA.</p>
<p>At a high level, MAMA brings together three types of data: 1) models of information flows that support known mission types, 2) knowledge of specific missions being executed with principals mapped to corresponding roles, and 3) the information transiting the network either in support of these missions or from other unmapped data flows. Based upon these components, MAMA will provide mission awareness to C2 operators and provide feedback to Quality of Service mechanisms in the CCTR.</p>
<p>The current research and development focus areas to be conducted under this BAA are as follows: <br />- FY 15-16 - Mapping the Mission to Information Flows <br />- FY 16-17 - Mission Information Sufficiency, Correlation, and Event Learning (MISCEL)<br />- FY 17-18 - Concept Integration, Demo and Validation of MAMA</p>
<p><strong>FY15-16 - Focus Area - Mapping the Mission to Information Flows</strong></p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: Reference: IV.1: FY15 should be submitted by 1 Nov 2014 and FY16 by 1 June 2015 for this Focus Area.</p>
<p>The goal of the "Mapping the Mission to Information Flows" project is to build upon the Active Mission Templates (AMT) project currently under development under the Mission Responsive Information Services (MRIS) consolidated program. The AMT models will need to be extended to incorporate temporal models of information flows. The AMT project enables mission planners to specify semantic models (mission templates) of the information needs of users based on their roles, mission parameters, context, and situations. These models can then be instantiated and used by running IM services to help govern information dissemination that is responsive to specific mission needs. The set of AMT mission models will need to be extended to cover the domain of interest (currently a to-be-determined critical Joint Space Operations Center mission). The models will need to incorporate monitoring criteria to ensure that status reports reflect what commanders need to know. Furthermore, identified mission applications will need to be proxied to transform their message traffic into managed information objects, and MAMA will need to determine what metadata is necessary to support the mission requirements. Key challenges are developing a domain ontology, domain mission context/event definitions, operational concept exploration, complex event processing services, and mission context phase monitors and triggers. This effort draws heavily upon earlier investment in CCTR and Phoenix Prime's semantic extraction and reasoner capabilities.</p>
<p><strong>FY16-17 - Focus Area - Mission Information Sufficiency, Correlation, and Event Learning (MISCEL)</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">NOTE: The Government is looking for white papers now for this Focus Area</span></strong>. The white papers for this focus area should be submitted no later than <strong>13 Nov 2015</strong> for a FY16 award and 1 Sep 2016 for a FY17 award.</p>
<p>The goal of MISCEL is to develop a working architecture for semantic analysis based on textual and structural data extraction from information into mission intelligence, mission status monitoring, mission assurance notifications, and cross-domain situational awareness. The MISCEL project will harness an analytics engine to continuously monitor mission execution and system status.</p>
<p>Mission intelligence will be gained through the autonomous assessment of mission execution. This assessment is performed by analyzing mission information models, raw information contents, and semantic extractions (Temporal, Geospatial, Information, Mission, etc.) in order to determine information to mission(s) correlation, phase changes for mission essential workflows (MEFs), information workflow traceability, status, and mission prioritization. This previously uncaptured mission intelligence will enable effective management of the mission's information space and inform mission assurance capabilities. MISCEL will result in furthering the critical capability of enhancing mission awareness that empowers mission assurance, utilizing information fingerprints to intelligently bridge static, prescribed mission models with operational reality.</p>
<p>MISCEL is the 2nd phase of MAMA, which seeks to transition advanced mission awareness capabilities to the logistical, humanitarian, and mission domains of US TRANSCOM, while simultaneously providing interoperability and cross-SA information to other mission-domains. Phase I targets the production of use case mission models, messaging, and prioritization components. Phase II seeks to provide the intelligent metadata analysis and mission-driven information assessment engine that will manage and configure the core awareness capabilities. Phase III integrates the mission awareness components (Phase I) with mission intelligence capabilities (Phase II) and demonstrates them via red teaming and an operational technology experiment.</p>
<p>The key challenges to be addressed in this project are:<br />- Mission Metadata Value Analysis and Assessment - Use cases for Information, Mission, MEF, and other algorithms have pre-requisite inputs, and are optimized if outputs are normalized. The value of metadata is variable to its applied algorithm, but capturing value can optimize algorithm selection from a catalog and measurably increase the probability of mission success. <br />- Mission Correlation &amp; MEF Workflow Phase Changes- Relevant mission(s) should be identified, as autonomously as possible, when solutions are provisioned only with a set of mission models and raw information. MEF phase changes should be detected and/or learned. Future support for Decision Support hooks should be considered, where supervised, semi-autonomous learning can provide justifications &amp; mission participant decision points can be informed according to the roles, process, algorithms, and metadata value analysis results.<br />- Information, Mission, and MEF Critical Events &amp; Prioritization - Disparate events identified from the information should be evaluated for mission criticality. Normalized scales of prioritization and criticality, aligned with relevant AF guidance and standards, need to be determined in order to inform and adapt agile mission aware messaging systems. Mission Assurance Categorization standards and MEF guidelines should inform the prioritization scale and the assessment results of executed algorithms.<br />- High Performance Combinational Data Mining/Learning - Developing algorithms, with Analytics Engine support, that mine a combination of semantic relationships, structured/unstructured information, and mission templates/models can result in solutions that are slow, and unable to scale to the growing scale of data exchanged and persisted. Also, complexity can grow unwieldy in converging diverse forms of analytics (Graph, MapReduce, NLP, etc.) and queries (SPARQL, XPATH, Keyword, KeystoneML, etc.). It can also be difficult to prove that algorithm(s) qualitatively enhances some facet of mission awareness, increasing the research and implementation complexity.<br />- Behavioral Monitoring - Mission models/templates provide only the most minimal information sufficiency, and tend to be non-runtime adaptable, while also requiring manual supervision. MISCEL pursues behavioral monitoring capabilities that capture information provenance (queries, subscriptions, results, types, formats, etc.) for mission and mission role participants. This captured provenance should be taken into account by algorithms seeking to determine information relevancy increasing/decreasing over time, respective to mission types and roles. Information relevancy correlated to an individual (Personalized, adaptive content, etc.) is beyond the initial scope of the project.<br />- Limited Ontology Scope and Interconnection - Stitching together existing ontologies (Phase I), or developing new ones, if required for the chosen technical approach, may produce more expansive, reusable, and interoperable knowledge of mission awareness. The core idea is that the maximal amount of mission awareness should be generated to inform better mission assurance decisions. Some technical approaches may emphasize a mix of ontologies, process modeling logic, other Mission QoS analytics, and others seeking to balance a mixture of all three. Consideration of past mission participant behaviors, identified mission assurance events, information clusters, and mission participant roles may provide a foundational set of relationships that better induce and learn mission events and workflows over time. <br />- Mission Assurance Categorization notifications - Communicating identified information vulnerabilities, threats, and MEF events provide greater value if based upon, or interoperable with, existing MAC schemas and messaging standards. Past efforts at AFRL (CMAC) have approached this objective from a networking perspective, and enabling interoperability between network health/status and information SA would cross-pollinate advanced features and enable more agile and reusable Mission Assurance capabilities.<br />- Mission-information visualization - While desirable, but not required, demonstrating the effectiveness of information, mission, and MEF analytics that steer mission assurance capabilities in an intuitive manner is complex, but provides powerful visual evidence of the impact of the resulting mission assessment capabilities.</p>
<p>Two benchmarks will be used, each of which consider the capturing of: mission metadata pre-requisites; attribute requirements; mission model constraints; prioritization; and other resulting outputs. The first benchmark will examine the impact of performing valuation of information and the use of that valuation to prioritize what relationships are more critical than others to extract and identify. The second benchmark will be a qualitative benchmark that can measure the effectiveness of the available mission analytics. This benchmark will be used to allow the pursuit of analytics proven to provide greater mission awareness, or that are proven to be more impactful in assessing vulnerabilities. MISCEL mission algorithms should pursue a mixture of offline/online approach that considers best-fit (batch, streaming, runtime/post-processing), as Information Management (IM) is a set of capabilities that operate in widely diverse environments (Tactical/Enterprise) that may be degraded or contested.</p>
<p>MISCEL will harness an analytics engine to continuously monitor mission execution and status. Effective monitoring may require balancing high-performance continuous query execution and relevancy-based storage management. Algorithms developed should either be externally verified for quality and effectiveness, or managed by runtime analytics-based QoS that qualitatively validates execution results for mission effectiveness. Although MISCEL should be applicable to diverse datasets, it is specifically targeted towards mapping and correlating raw information within the context of temporal-semantic models of mission lifecycles for missions of interest. This will provide mission context within the information space, and should provide interfaces/mechanisms for mission-driven information prioritization. A Mission Monitoring and Notification Service will be created that provides standards-based Mission Assurance Categorization messages. These messages provide a potential feedback mechanism to future mission assurance learning components, as well as to mission visualization and reporting components.</p>
<p>During the MISCEL project, one or more tools that statically model missions and mission essential functions should be leveraged. An existing option is Adaptive Mission Templates (AMT), a prototype mission modeling tool developed under the AFRL Mission Responsive Information Services Program. Business Process Model Notation (BPMN) or other tools that integrate Mission Essential Functions (MEF), resiliency processes, mission event impacts, and notions of role/identity mission participation with an integrated operational plan are other examples. While prescriptive mission models/templates provide enough adaptive structure to flexibly define multiple missions, MISCEL seeks to complement these deductive, model-based capabilities with content-based analytics that derive greater mission awareness from introspected information. This ability will be a milestone towards qualitatively improving the likelihood of mission success by utilizing mission models, ingested information, and the available information &amp; mission-based analytics.</p>
<p>Offerors are encouraged to pursue primarily offsite contractor presence, due to limited lab space availability, unless required to effectively foster collaboration, integration, and demonstration requirements.</p>
<p>Annual experiments and/or demonstrations in operationally relevant scenarios and domains will act as capability checkpoints throughout this effort. AFRL/RISA has a number of limited availability cloud testbeds, both on-site and off-site, that can be considered for use. Operationally relevant scenarios from the transport and logistics domain due are desired in order to align planned infrastructure &amp; algorithmic capabilities, and transition opportunities.</p>
<p><strong>FY 17 -18 - Focus Area - Concept Integration, Demo and Validation of MAMA</strong></p>
<p><strong>NOTE: <span style="text-decoration: underline;">White Papers will be accepted in FY17 for this Focus Area</span></strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">.</span> Reference: IV.1: FY17 should be submitted by 1 Sep 16 and FY18 by 1 Sep 2017.</p>
<p>The final project of the program is concept integration, demonstration and validation (DemVal). Red teaming will be used to ensure that these mission critical services are well designed and robust to cyber threats. This component serves several goals. The first is to simply expand the practice of red teaming to improve the maturity of capabilities we transition. Minimally, the system should pass all tests currently required for an authority to operate on NIPRnet/SIPRnet. However, AFRL/RI will go beyond that to consider active intrusion by a red team. In the past, there have been several programs that investigated system hardening, such as Secure Tactical Enterprise Gateway that matured the "crumple zone" concept first developed under the DARPA OASIS (Operations Analysis and Simulation Sciences) program. These ideas will be explored where appropriate, however, they were tuned to much lower throughput scenarios (e.g., tactical network), and so may not be applicable to high data rate deployments. The program will conclude with a limited technology experiment within an operational context. This project represents 25% of the funding and 15% of the technical risk. It is anticipated that the integration task and Limited Technology Experiment (LTE) will be under the Connectivity and Dissemination Core Technical Competency in the Information Systems Division (AFRL/RIS). The red teaming will be led by the Cyber Science and Technology Core Technical Competency in the Information Exploitation and Operations Division (AFRL/RIG) and executed on-site because AFRL/RI wishes to grow competency in this area.</p>
<p>Offerors are encouraged to provide an on-site contractor presence working at AFRL/RISA Rome, NY to foster collaboration with other in-house teams, to minimize integration risks and to effectively leverage experimentation/demonstration resources.</p>

IMPORTANT: If you do not have a DCAA approved accounting system access the following link for instructions: <a href="https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&amp;mode=form&amp;id=1cffad228f48b58057072a6c9113799d&amp;tab=core&amp;_cview=1">Https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&amp;mode=form&amp;id=1cffad228f48b58057072a6c9113799d&amp;tab=<br />core&amp;_cview=1</a></p>
<p><br />V. APPLICATION REVIEW INFORMATION:</p>
<p>1. CRITERIA: The following criteria, which are listed in descending order of importance, will be used to determine whether white papers and proposals submitted are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. Overall Scientific and Technical Merit -- The soundness of approach for the development and/or enhancement of the proposed technology, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. Related Experience - The extent to which the offeror demonstrates relevant technology and domain knowledge. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c. Openness, Maturity and Assurance of Solution - The extent to which existing capabilities and standards are leveraged and the relative maturity of the proposed technology, and <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d. Reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees (if any).</p>
<p>No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting white papers/proposals. White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.</p>
<p>2. REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS:</p>
<p>Only Government employees will evaluate the white papers/proposals for selection. The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in the administrative support contract, which do not require the review, reading, and comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks." These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements. The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&amp;D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries. Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.</p>
<p>3. ADEQUATE PRICE COMPETITION: The Government may simultaneously evaluate proposals received under this BAA with a common cutoff date for multiple offerors. In this case, the Government may make award based on adequate price competition, and offerors must be aware that there is a possibility of non-selection due to a proposal of similar but higher-priced technical approach as compared to another offeror.</p>
<p>VI. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">STEP TWO</span></strong> INFORMATION - REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL &amp; AWARD:</p>
<p>1. AWARD NOTICES: Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email or letter will be sent by the technical POC. Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract. Those white papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner. Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.</p>

<NTYPE>SNOTE
<RESPDATE>103015

<CONTACT>Christine Sordillo, Contract Specialist, Phone 5082336179, Email christine.f.sordillo.civ@mail.mil - John B. Conlin, Contracting Officer, Phone 5082336164, Email john.conlin3.civ@mail.mil
<DESC><p>This DRAFT Request for Proposal (RFP), W911QY-16-R-0001-DRAFT2, is for the procurement of the Joint General Purpose Decontaminant for Hardened Military Equipment (JGPD-HME). The Government invites and encourages Industry to provide feedback on any aspect of the RFP. The Government is especially interested in changes that could be made which would reduce the burden of submitting a proposal and increase Industry's participation in this requirement. Feedback may be sent to Ms. Christine Sordillo, Contract Specialist, at (508) 233-6179, christine.f.sordillo.civ@mail.mil.</p>
<p>The Product Manager for the Decontamination Family of Systems (DFoS) under the Joint Project Manager for Protection (JPM P) has a requirement for a JGPD-HME, which may either be a commercial or non-commercial decontaminant, that will provide thorough decontamination capabilities for tactical vehicles, shipboard surfaces, crew-served weapons and individual weapons exposed to chemical and biological (CB) agent contamination. The JGPD-HME will be applied directly to the contaminated surface and be capable of reducing/neutralizing CB contamination to thorough levels within thirty (30) minutes of application. The JGPD-HME will be compatible with hardened materials consistent with those found on a Detailed Equipment Decontamination (DED) line. The JGPD- HME will be safe, suitable and compatible with HME and be operable in all operational environments (hostile and non-hostile) that have been exposed to CB contamination. The JGPD-HME will not present any uncontrollable hazards to personnel and equipment during storage, transport, or operations. The JGPD-HME will be applied by expedient field applicators with fielded decontamination applicators, such as mops and brushes and fielded decontamination applicators such as the M26 Joint Service Transportable Decontamination System Small-Scale (JSTDS-SS) and M12A1 Power Driven Decontamination Apparatus, or other existing multiple-use applicator systems, such as but not limited to firefighting systems and the P100 Portable Damage Control Pump.</p>
<p>The JGPD-HME packaging will be able to be opened by Warfighters in (Mission Oriented Protective Posture) MOPP gear without packaging excess. The JGPD-HME packaging shall have easily identifiable labels and if the JGPD-HME candidate consists of multiple or optional components, it must be readily apparent (e.g. different color labels, bags, boxes, or other distinguishing features). The JGPD-HME packaging shall have a minimal logistics burden and low waste footprint for packaging. The storage packaging configuration of JGPD-HME shall meet requirements of a one man or woman carry per MIL-STD-1472G and chemical, biological and radiological (CBR) contamination survivability requirements. The JGPD-HME shall be available in two packaging configurations: a small batch size (~5 gallons of ready-to-use decontaminant) and a larger batch size (&gt;15 gallons of ready-to-use decontaminant). The Government is willing to discuss packaging configuration with potential Offerors from now until the final RFP is released.</p>
<p>The Government intends to compete this requirement on a full and open, unrestricted basis, and it intends on awarding a single, 5-year Firm-Fixed Priced (FFP) Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contract with a ceiling of $30,000,000.00.</p>

<DESC><p><strong>THIS IS NOT AN INVITATION FOR BID, PLANS AND SPECS ARE CURRENTLY&nbsp;NOT AVAILABLE.&nbsp; THE TENTATIVE ADVERTISEMENT DATE IS OCTOBER 15, 2015.&nbsp; THIS PROJECT WILL BE ADVERTISED ON A FULL AND OPEN BASIS.<br /><br />Project Location<br /></strong>Whitney Portal Road, also designated as County Road 4018, is located in Inyo County, and connects the City of Lone Pine to the Mount Whitney and Alabama Hills Recreation Areas. The route begins at the junction with US 395 in the town of Lone Pine, approximately 55 miles south of Bishop, CA and proceeds 11.7 miles to the Whitney Portal access area. The project begins near the western termini or the route, near the recreational parking facilities, continues east for 11.2 miles and end just before the intersection with Tuttle Creek Road (approximately 0.5 miles west of US 395). The route is primarily on federal lands including the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and Inyo National Forest. The road is maintained by Inyo County. The route is functionally classified as a major collector. All facilities along the route are associated with the use of adjacent lands, and the majority of traffic on Whitney Portal Road is related to recreational use in the forest and on BLM lands.</p>
<p><strong>Scope of the Work</strong><br />The existing Whitney Portal Road within the project corridor is a two-lane, paved roadway with varying widths and variable width unpaved shoulders, as well as multiple paved and unpaved pull-offs and intersecting roadways. The top 3.5 miles of the project are in steep mountainous terrain with very narrow roadway bench width, steep side slopes and switchbacks. The remaining 7.7 miles of the project are in rolling terrain. There are numerous recreational facilities and parking areas adjacent to the roadway throughout the route. The seasonal average daily traffic along portions of the route reaches 1700. There is heavy pedestrian use and parking along the road in the top 2 miles and bicycle use along the entire route.</p>
<p>The proposed road improvements involve pulverizing and paving, minor widening, grading and drainage improvements to 11.2 miles of Whitney Portal Road. Specific project elements, which would generally follow the existing roadway, include the following:</p>
<p>&bull; Within Segment 1, from Mile Post [MP] 0.00 to 3.50: rehabilitation of the existing 22 feet of roadway with the addition of curve widening as feasible. There is a &frac12; mile section of complete reconstruction within Segment 1 due to horizontal alignment shifts.</p>
<p>&bull; Within Segment 2, from MP 3.50 to 5.2: rehabilitation of the existing 22 feet of roadway.</p>
<p>&bull; Within Segment 3, from MP 5.2 to 11.2: widen the existing roadway approximately 4 feet to accommodate 11-foot travel lanes, and 3-foot shoulders (28 foot paved width).</p>
<p>&bull; Ditch grading, shoulder reconditioning, embankment reconstruction, pulverizing existing pavement and paving in all 3 segments.</p>
<p>&bull; Slope scaling of existing slopes with unstable rock.</p>
<p>&bull; Rehabilitation of existing pull-outs.</p>
<p>&bull; Replacing the curb, bridge rail and approach rail, and performing minor rehabilitation work (concrete crack repair and erosion mitigation) at an aqueduct crossing. The bridge repairs include the installation of carbon fiber reinforced polymer strips to the top of the bridge deck.</p>
<p>&bull; Replacement of old or damaged drainage culverts and extension of culverts to accommodate the wider roadway.</p>
<p>&bull; Upgrading regulatory/warning signs and guardrails to meet MUTCD guidelines.</p>
<p><strong>Items worth noting:</strong></p>
<p>&bull; There is narrow bench width throughout Segment 1 with steep slopes and limited work areas.</p>
<p>&bull; There are steep rock cuts in Segment 1 that require slope scaling in areas with narrow bench widths.</p>
<p>&bull; Large cobbles and/or boulders exist beneath the pavement throughout all 3 segments.</p>
<p>&bull; There is high recreation use, parking adjacent to the roadway, and parking shortages near the Whitney Portal recreation area. Traffic control plans will need to consider methods to prevent parking within active work zones.</p>
<p><br />&bull; There are environmentally sensitive resources adjacent to the road in several locations.</p>
<p><br />&bull; Work along this route will take place within environmentally sensitive areas and will require interactions with the Forest Service, Bureau of Land Management, Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, the County, and the travelling public. Full road closures will only be permitted along portions of the route. In all other locations, delays due to construction will be limited to a maximum of 30 minutes.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Approximate quantities for major work items:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&bull; 60 acres of clearing and grubbing</p>
<p>&bull; 112,000 linear feet of shoulder excavation</p>
<p>&bull; 6,150 cubic yards of waste</p>
<p>&bull; 10 stations of linear grading</p>
<p>&bull; 400 cubic yards of special rock embankment</p>
<p>&bull; 290 stations of pulverizing, 4-inch depth</p>
<p>&bull; 340 stations of pulverizing, 6-inch depth</p>
<p>&bull; 6,250 cubic yards of roadway aggregate</p>
<p>&bull; 33,000 tons of superpave pavement</p>
<p>&bull; 256 linear feet of carbon fiber reinforced polymer</p>
<p>&bull; 24,000 linear feet of asphalt curb</p>
<p>&bull; 3,025 linear feet of guardrail, steel post</p>
<p>&bull; 40 hours of slope scaling<br /><br />Contracting Range = $10 - $15 million</p>

<DESC>Note:&nbsp;Amendment 01 for this Solicitation has been issued. Please see latest attachments.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />The Baltimore District Corps of Engineers, Real Property Services Field Office (RSFO), is issuing&nbsp;this solicitation&nbsp;for a Single Award Task Order Construction Contract (SATOCC) for the Baltimore/Washington corridor, CONUS and Hawaii. The geographic area for this contract is anticipated to be primarily within the Baltimore/Washington corridor, but may be used throughout the Continental United States and Hawaii. This is a task order construction contract that will include both design-build and design-bid-build task orders. One contractor will be selected for award. <br /><br />This proposed procurement is being solicited on an unrestricted basis. The NAICS Code is 236220 with a small business size standard of $33,500,000.00. This procurement is being advertised as a Two Phase Request for Proposal (RFP). The resultant contract will be issued for a five year period. The total capacity for the contract will be $103,000,000.00. A bid bond will be required in accordance with the terms and conditions of FAR 52.228-1 Bid Guarantee. The scope of this contract encompasses a broad variety of construction projects for the Intelligence Community (IC) and other DoD organizations and other agencies, organizations, and branches of the U.S. Government and other customers within the supported secure community. The customers (users) to be serviced by this contract will predominately belong to secure agencies. These types of customers have assets distributed throughout the continental United States and the world. <br /><br />The type of work performed will be in both secure and non secure locations. Projects may include major and minor repair, modification, rehabilitation, alterations, design-build, and new fully designed construction projects. It may also include demolition; infrastructure projects; interior fit-up; architectural renovations, mechanical upgrades and repairs, electrical upgrades and repairs, major utility work (including power substation and chilled water plant with all associated duct bank construction), paving, roofing, Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems, site preparation, and all other activities associated with general and heavy construction. Other projects may include communications systems, security systems, data systems infrastructure, Heating Cooling and Air Condition systems, Counter-Terrorism and Anti-Terrorism Force Protection construction, and Secret Compartmented Information Facilities (SCIF) construction. The contractor will be responsible for integrating, managing, and executing all aspects of all work related to each task order. An active TOP SECRET Facility Site Clearance is required at the time the offer is due, at time of award, and throughout the life of the contract. In the event of a Joint Venture (JV), the clearance requirement will apply to the JV. This means that the entity identified in block 14 of the Standard Form 1442 must have the TOP SECRET Facility Site Clearance in that name along with the matching Cage Code. For example, if Company A and Company B forms a Joint Venture called Company AB, then Company AB must have an active TOP SECRET Facility Site Clearance. Even if both Company A and Company B each individually posses the clearance, unless Company AB possesses its own TOP SECRET Facility Site Clearance, the proposal will not be eligible for award. <br /><br />An award will be made to the Offeror whose proposal is determined to be the best value to the Government considering both price and technical factors. The Offeror's proposal will be due on 19 October 2015. This solicitation is being provided in an electronic format, free of charge, to all authenticated account holders of Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) System. To familiarize vendors with the system, please download the Vendor guide by logging into https://www.FBO.gov. Please note that all Corps of Engineers acquisitions are considered Sensitive, but unclassified documents, and require users to have a valid MPIN entered in the FBO system to access the package. <br /><br />All contracting questions related to the upcoming solicitation may be directed in writing to Gregory Hodgson via e-mail at Gregory.Hodgson@usace.army.mil. <br />

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION FOR SINGLE SOURCE AWARDS IAW FAR 13.106-1
(OVER MICRO-PURCHASE THRESHOLD($3K) BUT NOT EXCEEDING THE SAT ($150K))
IAW FAR13.104, COs must promote competition to the maximum extent practicable to obtain supplies and services from the source whose offer is the most advantageous to the Government, considering the administrative cost of the purchase. When competition is not practicable, IAW FAR13.106-1(b), COs solicit from a single source for purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold.  COs may solicit from one source if the CO determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g., urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, brand-name or industrial mobilization). IAW FAR13.106-3(b)(3),COs are required to include additional statements explaining the absence of competition (see 13.106-1 for brand name purchases) if only one source is solicited and the acquisition does not exceed the simplified acquisition threshold (does not apply to an acquisition of utility services available from only one source) or supporting the award decision if other than price-related factors were considered in selecting the supplier.  This template when completed can be used to document single source awards IAW FAR13.106-3(b)(3).  Note: Statements such as "only known source" or "only source which can meet the required delivery date" are inadequate to support a sole source purchase.  
1. PURCHASE REQUEST OR REQUISITION NUMBER:
695-16-1-133-0006	1A. PROJECT/TASK NUMBER : N/A
	1B. ESTIMATED AMOUNT:
$13,000.00 base year
2. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES OR SERVICES REQUIRED AND THE INTENDED USE:
Justification and approval for a firm-fixed price base and 4 option year contract with General Electric (Datex-Ohmeda). Shall furnish all labor, materials, equipment, travel, parts and supervision for full preventive maintenance full comprehensive coverage and emergency repair for the anesthesia equipment located at the Milwaukee VAMC. Service is needed to maintain the Aisys and Aestiva machines.
3. UNIQUE CHARACTERISTICS THAT LIMIT AVAILABILITY TO ONLY ONE SOURCE, WITH THE REASON NO OTHER SUPPLIES OR SERVICES CAN BE USED:  Reaching out to the market place did not provide any other vendors capable or willing to do the work. Searches in GSA, Vetbiz and national contracts did not reveal other possible vendors. 
4.  REASON THAT SUGGESTED SOURCE IS THE ONLY SOURCE, WHICH CAN PROVIDE THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES:  Given market research to include historical documents and sole source posting, no other vendors came forward to provide capabilities statements or quotes except GE (Datex-Ohmeda Inc.). Other orders were located on FPDS that were also awarded to Datex-Ohmeda Inc.
5. DESCRIPTION OF MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED AND RESULTS OR STATEMENT WHY IT WAS NOT CONDUCTED:  Posted an intent to sole source, VA69D-15-Q-1411 on FBO from 9/15 - 9/19. No vendors came forward with a capability statement. Searched historical documents (current contract VA69D-P-0617).  Solicitation VA69D-11-RQ-0241 was posted to FBO as full and open competition. Upon closing, only one vendor provided a quote, GE (Datex-Ohmeda Inc). Could not locate any service disabled or small businesses or vendors with existing national contracts.

6. Contracting Officer's Certification: Purchase is approved in accordance with FAR13.106-1(b). I certify that the foregoing justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.
