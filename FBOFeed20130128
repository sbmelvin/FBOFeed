As prescribed by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Paragraph 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers. They cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract, nor do they affect a potential offeror's ability to respond to any future synopsis/solicitation which may or may not follow or restrict the U.S. Government's eventual acquisition approach. Additionally, the U.S. Government will not provide reimbursement for any information that may be submitted in response to this RFI. Respondents are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI. Interested vendors responding to this RFI may provide capability information for all pieces of this requirement or for an entire solution. Respondents will not be notified of any results derived from a review of the information provided; however information gathered may be utilized for technical and acquisition purposes. Time permitting and depending upon the information received individual vendors MAY be contacted for capability demonstrations. The U.S. Government will not pay for any costs associated with such demonstration(s) of products or services. Instructions on responding to this RFI are described under headings &lsquo;VI' and &lsquo;VII' of this RFI.
<p>I. Background<br />The U.S Office of Personnel Management (OPM) Federal Investigative Services (FIS) is seeking information from qualified vendors to provide the training options as described in this notice, accessible to FIS employees located in the continental United States and locations around the world. <br />OPM-FIS is headquartered in Boyers, PA and provides investigative products and services for over 100 Federal agencies to use as the basis for suitability and security clearance determinations as required by Executive Orders and other rules and regulations. FIS currently provides over 90% of the Government's background investigations, while conducting over two million investigations annually. FIS currently employs over 2,500 employees who strive to support FIS' overarching mission, providing timely and complete investigative products to customer agencies.</p>
<p>II. Purpose and Scope<br />The purpose of this project is to identify sources capable of providing FIS with unlimited training options accessible to FIS employees. The training options should provide a large variety of one and two day live seminars as well as online training options. Pursuing this initiative also directly supports Executive Order 13589, Section 3, by reducing travel costs through use of technological alternatives such as web-based or other online learning media. <br />Due to FIS' diverse population and the fact that employees are located throughout the country, the selected vendor must be able to provide a large variety of quality classroom training resources available in every state. In addition to classroom training options, online training offerings must also encompass the same quality and choice variety. <br />The selected training vendor must provide an online tracking system which will allow National Training Center (NTC) personnel to properly enroll FIS employees in training courses and to verify completed training. The NTC will work directly with the vendor to ensure that training is properly tracked and recorded. The selected vendor must also assist NTC personnel with any technical or enrollment issues as they occur.<br /><br />III. Deliverables<br />The deliverables for this project must include the following:<br />&bull; Memberships for approximately 1,000 to 1,500 employees. <br />&bull; Administrator rights for NTC personnel so they can enroll students and access student learning courses and materials.<br />&bull; Unlimited access to the online training for one year for courses in communication, writing skills, leadership training, personal improvement, soft skills, and other non-technical training and professional development needs.<br />&bull; Unlimited access to classroom courses for one year for courses in communication, writing skills, leadership training, soft skills, and other non-technical training and professional development needs.<br /><br />IV. Target Audience<br />The primary target audience for the training membership will be FIS employees who work at the FIS offices in Washington, DC; Ft. Meade, MD: Boyers, PA; as well as those who work in field locations throughout the continental United States as well as Alaska and Hawaii. FIS-NTC will provide the names of employees who will be enrolled in the membership program.<br /><br />V. Period of Performance<br />The Government contemplates basic award of a one-year contract, with provision for up to four additional option years. Exercise of the option years would be at the sole discretion of the Government.<br /><br />VI. Instructions for Responding to this RFI<br />Responses to this RFI must be submitted electronically to the U.S. Office of Personnel Management Boyers Contracting Group no later than 3:00 P.M.

Gore & Associates because they are the sole manufacturer of this hardware compatible to the RF equipment already being used on the satellite; therefore, manufacturing drawings and specifications are not available. These cables are identical and compatible to other RF microwave cables already being used for the DSCOVR project.  They are also compatible with environmental facilities the DSCOVR satellite will use at GSFC and KSC. The Government conducted market research that no other vendor could meet the frequency range, thermal vacuum properties, insertion losses, ruggedized design, or spacecraft compatibility needed for testing the DSCOVR satellite at GSFC. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on February 6, 2013.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. NASA Clause 1852.215-84, Ombudsman, is applicable.

The statue of authority permitting full and open competition is 10, U.S. Code 2304 9c)(1), as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1, " Only one responsible source and no other supplies or service will satisfy agency requirements." It is in the best interest of the Government to continue to work with Meggitt Safety Systems on the Fire Extinguisher TCPS because they are the company that designed the initial TCPS and this is considered to be a Critical Safety Item. Note 22 applies

<DESC>THIS IS A TOTAL SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE PROCUREMENT. This procurement will use the two-phase design-build selection procedures and consists of one solicitation covering both phases. Source Selection procedures will be used with the intent to award a firm-fixed price construction contract to the responsible Offeror whose proposal, conforming to the Request for Proposal (RFP), is the most advantageous and offers the best value to the Government.

The work to be acquired under this solicitation is for the design and construction of P-1132 Communication Information Systems (CIS) Operations Complex at Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton, California. This project requires the design and construction of multiple facilities, including a Headquarters building, maintenance/supply building, multi-purpose training/coordination facility, warehouse, and various other ancillary structures within one complex.
 In addition, the project installs telecommunications cable connecting the new remote switch in Pico (24 area) and the new CIS Operations Complex. Paving and site improvements include grading, parking stalls, roadways, curbs, sidewalks, landscaping, fencing, signs and storm-water drainage. Sustainable design principles will be included in the design and construction of the project facilities and will comply with the Energy Policy Act and Low impact Development (LID). The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 236220, and the annual size standard is $33.5 million. The estimated price range for design and construction is between $50,000,000 and $70,000,000.

The Government intends to evaluate proposals and to award without discussions.
 Selection for award will be based on evaluation of the following: Phase One: Factor 1 - Technical Approach,  Factor 2 - Experience, Factor 3 - Past Performance, and Factor 4  Safety; Phase Two: Factor 5 - Engineering Solution, Factor 6 - Energy and Sustainable Design, and Factor 7 - Price. 

The Phase One evaluation will result in a determination of the most highly qualified Offerors. These Offerors will be requested to submit a Phase Two proposal. A maximum of five Offerors will be selected to submit a Phase Two proposal unless the contracting officer determines that a number greater than five is in the Government's interest and is consistent with the purposes and objectives of two-phase design-build contracting.

THE SOLICITATION WILL BE AVAILABLE IN ELECTRONIC FORMAT ONLY.
 The Phase One RFP will be posted on the Navy Electronic Commerce Online (NECO) website at www.neco.navy.mil on or about 13 February 2013. No hard copies will be provided.

<DESC>Electron Spectrometer<br />FA8601-13-T-0112
<p>SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS (Not a Notice of Solicitation)</p>
<p>The United States Air Force, LCMC/Operational Contracting Division, Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio is seeking potential sources, including small business (SB), 8(a), HUBZone, Economically-Disadvantaged Women-Owned small business (EDWOSB), and Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned small businesses, that are capable of providing a Electron Spectrometer. Firms responding shall specify that their products meet the specifications provided below and provide detailed product information to show clear technical compliance.</p>
<p><strong>Spectrometer: <br /></strong>A true 180 &deg; hemispherical electron energy analyzer with a 150 mm mean radius is required. This spectrometer must be operable in an ultrahigh vacuum atmosphere at pressures of 10-10 torr, capable of a bakeout temperature of 200oC, and have a DN100CF (6 inch OD) flange for mounting to the main vacuum chamber. The spectrometer must be constructed of non-magnetic materials inside &mu;-metal shielding and utilize a slit mechanism providing for at least 8 entrance and 3 exit slits which can be set independently via one rotary drive from outside the vacuum. Entrance and exit slits should operate independently. For each pair of entrance slits, one slit defines the energy resolution while the other slit serves to match the angular spread for the analyzer. This arrangement allows optimum transmission for all chosen slit sizes and resolution settings. A view port is to be provided for through the lens (optical) alignment. The analyzer must provide for a 150 mm mean radius. Fringe field corrections must be provided in the entrance and exit areas to guarantee excellent energy resolution at very low kinetic energies.</p>
<p>A multi-element, two-stage transfer lens with well-defined optical properties must be utilized to provide ultimate transmission of electrons from the source to the analyzer. All lens modes must be able to be set electronically. In addition, a standard working distance of 40 mm and a 44&deg; conical shape of the front part of the lens should be provided to guarantee optimum access to the sample for all types of excitation sources.</p>
<p>For small spot analysis, a lateral resolution down to 100 &mu;m should be available. In addition, angular resolution must be able to be optimized down to &plusmn;0.05&deg; to be accomplished with an Iris aperture in the diffraction plane of the lens system allowing the angular acceptance to be continuously adjusted between &plusmn;1&deg; and &plusmn;9&deg; while keeping the acceptance area on the sample constant.</p>
<p><strong>Power Supply:<br /></strong>One power supply must provide for all analyzer operation modes. A modular design / architecture is desired and all detector high voltage modules should be included. The power supply should be a fully digitized, with 24 bit high-precision voltage modules, truly bipolar, with very short settle times and super low noise modes. The modular design of the unit should allow independent setting of all voltages with no voltage dividers used. Each module should be fully galvanically floating, highly stable and linear. Voltages should be controlled by high-precision 24-bit digital-to-analog converters with an overall maximum settle time of 3 ms. Each module is to be equipped with a microcontroller allowing independent setting of all voltages. Analog-to-digital converters for output voltages and output currents should facilitate diagnosis and error localization. The complete electronics package should be contained in a single 19" standard rack housing with removable cables. In addition, the power supply should be able to be operated in FAT (Fixed Analyzer Transmission) or FRR mode (Fixed Retarding Ratio). Both pass energy and retarding ratio should be continuously adjusted to fine-tune resolution and intensity.</p>
<p>The power supply should provide sufficient voltage to allow for an energy span of &plusmn;3500 eV thereby giving access to the high kinetic energy lines and provide for ultra-high energy resolution with step widths down to 20 &mu;eV thus guaranteeing extraordinary stability and low-noise allowing for ultra-high resolution measurements. Preferably the power supply provides the fast and reliable CAN Bus interface and an internal microprocessor for fast and reliable processing and remote control. The temperature stability of the analyzer voltage modules should be better than 1.5 ppm of the voltage span per &deg;C. The power supply must operate on a standard 120v, 60 Hz power line.</p>
<p><strong>Electron Detection:<br /></strong>The detection package should contain an ultra-fast, low-noise preamplifier and counter providing for single channel or multi-channel detection with up to 9 channels. MCD, CCD, Spin or Delay Line Detectors should be able to be retrofitted on site. The detector should be flange-mounted with a standard detector assembly consisting of either one, five or nine single channel electron multipliers arranged as a single block providing both compactness and durability. Channel electron multipliers with an extended dynamic range for extremely high count rate applications should be standard. Upgrades from single to multichannel detection should be capable of being performed on-site. The design of the detection electronics should take into account the need for reliable counting results even in difficult environments and for extended dynamic ranges. Other detector types should be easy to retrofit without modification to the analyzer. Specifications: Provide channels 1, 5 or 9, preamplifier 300 MHz, input Impedance of 50 &Omega;, threshold Level of 4 to 200 mV, dead time 6 ns to 160 ns, counter 160 MHz, 24 bit per channel, package should mount directly on detector flange with a single multi-pin feedthrough in a RF shielded housing.</p>
<p><br /><strong>Performance:<br /></strong>For XPS using the Ag 3d5/2 or Mg K&alpha; spectral line ,at 15 kV, 300 W, with a distance between sample-anode &lt;15 mm: Provides resolution of 0.85 eV with count rates (signal over noise) of at least 300,000 for SCD, 1,700,000 for MCD of 5 channels, and 3,000,000 for MCD of 9 channels. For a resolution of 1.00 eV, these count rates are 900,000, 4,600,000, and 9,000,000 and for a resolution of 1.40 eV, these S/N count rates are 2,000,000, 12,000,000, and 26,000,000.<br />For UPS (Ag valence band, He I, (*) Fermi edge width (12 to 88%) at T=300 K): Provides resolution of 140 meV*with S/N count rates of 2,000,000 10,000,000 20,000,000.<br />For AES using Cu LMM, 20 nA sample current (+15 V bias), 5 keV: Provides resolution of 0.5 % with S/N count rates of 300,000 1,500,000 3,000,000.<br />For ISS Ag, 0.5 &mu;A sample current (+90 V bias), 2 keV, He+: Provides resolution of .5 % and S/N count rates of 1,200,000 6,000,000 12,000,000.</p>
<p><br /><strong>Data Acquisition &amp; Processing:<br /></strong>A software package utilizing the Windows operating system and combining ease of operation with powerful data acquisition and analysis routines must be provided. This data acquisition and data processing software must provide computer control of all analysis methods possible with the electron analyzer. Predefined sequence measurements should be limited only by computer memory and disk space. For MCD detectors, the user has online access to the separate channels and a semi-automatic dispersion calibration should ensure optimal resolution and energy calibration for all analyzer settings. An MCD ratemeter should be included. Standard data processing tools should include background subtraction (linear, Shirley and Tougaard background), satellite subtraction, smoothing, integration, differentiation, numerical operations, scaling, view options, shift, work function adjustment and much more. Peak fitting routines and quantification with easily configurable files for peak parameters (including database for XPS and AES) result in comprehensive surface analysis software for a wide range of applications.</p>

<DESC>The US Army seeks alternative solutions before utilizing a sole source contract under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirement. <br>  <br> Background:  The PD/LMR program office has a new requirement to expand the Fort Hunter Liggett, CA Land Mobile Radio System (LMRS) to a shared LMRS that provides for garrison level commercial radio technology products and incidental services that will satisfy critical homeland defense and safety requirements at Camp Parks, CA and the Presidio of Monterey, CA.  Motorola Solutions Inc. installed the current Trunked P25 LMRS at Fort Hunter Liggett, CA, under competitively awarded delivery/task order DAAB07-01-D-H806, Task Order 0381.  The US Army accepted the LMRS system from Motorola on 2 Nov 2012.  It is not practical for the US Army to do an entire new procurement to replace the entire Fort Hunter Liggett, CA LMRS infrastructure to add capability for Camp Parks, CA and Presidio of Monterey, CA due to the significant investment made for the current Fort Hunter Liggett LMRS that has been operational for less than two months. <br>  <br> Issue:  To date, the US Army has found no work around to expand the new Fort Hunter Liggett, CA LMRS using full and open competition without having to replace Motorola site controller, repeaters, dispatch consoles, and system management terminal to allow interoperability with another manufacture's Trunked P25 components, the installed Motorola system, and to expand the system to provide shared coverage for Camp Parks, CA and Presidio of Monterey, CA. <br>  <br> Our office will consider alternate solutions that retain the use of the aforementioned Motorola components to expand the current LMRS to provide shared coverage.  Please provide a 10-page capability statement describing the alternate solution by 12:00 P.M (EST), 4 February 2013. <br>  <br> Submit alternate solutions by electronic mail (email) to email address ralph.f.kaminski.civ@mail.mil with a copy to email address donna.j.bader2.civ@mail.mil .  Subject matter experts from PD/LMR will evaluate proposed alternate solutions.  <br>  <br> POC for this sources sought notice is Ralph Kaminski, (410) 278-4982. <br>

<DESC>SOURCE SOUGHT <br>  <br> (U) Background:   <br> 3BN 160th SOAR (A) HAAF, Georgia conducts Joint Multilateral Task Force Training at Miami, Florida, West Palm Beach, FL and Cape Canaveral, FL for six (6) separate targets within 300 nautical miles from the established Forward Staging Base (FSB) from 25 February -14 March 2013.  The purpose of this training is to exercise tactical, command and control, and support elements under realistic conditions that replicate the scale, diversity, and complexity of the operational environments currently encountered during overseas combat deployments while simultaneously evaluating one (1) flight lead candidate, One (2) Tier Two level alert, WMD/RDD capabilities and VSO/FID operations. This Statement of Work describes the work necessary to effectively support the robust and dynamic stated training objectives and satisfy the commander's intent for training.  The contractor shall provide the required training support in accordance with the specific mission requirements identified in this document. One of the skills which are not fully exploited until arrival into the combat theater is the use and handling of an interpreter as well as the interaction of non-English speaking combatants/innocents.  In order to bridge this mission critical gap and bring the required and qualified instruction to the trainees immediately, yet effectively and efficiently, it is a requirement that this specialty be out-sourced to a subject matter expert employing up to date tactics, techniques, and procedures.  There is not time for a trial and error/shake-out period; this company/cadre MUST hit the ground running, with the full confidence of the Exercise Control Group (ECG).   <br>  <br> (U) Training Objectives: <br> 1.	Provide realistic tactical scenarios that closely replicate the characteristics of the environments encountered by Special Operations Forces (SOF) during ongoing combat operations overseas.  <br> 2.	Incorporate, synchronize and exercise supporting role players and equipment during all appropriate phases of operations to effectively replicate a typical combat mission profile currently being executed overseas. <br> 3.	Provide scenarios and problems that are realistic and effectively exercise individual Special Operations Forces adaptability and leadership capability under extreme stress. <br>  <br> (U) Scope: <br> 1.	Role Players: <br> a.	The contractor will provide a liaison (LNO / Training support engineer) team between the Control Group and the provided role players and will maintain oversight during all phases of the training evolutions and ensure the safety and logistical support requirements of the role players. <br> b.	The contractor will be responsible for providing all support required to achieve the stated tasks required of the role players. Any specific support required of the client must be specifically delineated in the contract.  <br> c.	There will be a 24-hour operations cycle for a minimum of 6 personal beginning 25 February - 06 March 2013; and minimum of (40) roll players from 06 March 2013 - 14 March 2013.  The training schedule will be dynamic and the contractor must provide above listed handlers and one Liaison Officer to support concurrent planning, preparation, and execution of sequential training events with the ECG as required. <br>  <br> 2.	Liaison Officer (LNO): <br> a.	Provide all logistical and administrative coordination before, during, and after training event in order to facilitate unit's efforts towards training focus. <br> b.	Pre-coordinate all training arrangements with the 160th SOAR (A) designated POC's in order to save valuable time and resources as well as prevent any confusion. <br> c.	Provide all on site logistics coordination and arrangements for contractors and cadre with the ECG. <br> d.	Be on site minimum of two days prior to each target to arrange facility backside support and detailed coordination in order to ensure training site is properly prepared and set up daily to facilitate advanced dynamic training efforts. <br> e.	Coordinate daily with ECG on rules and regulations and base Surface Danger Zone's (SDZ's) and Minimum Safe Distance (MSD) zones to ensure compliance with all rounds, and pyrotechnics. <br> f.	Fulfill LNO duties necessary in order to create a sole source point of contact for ECG in order to simplify their efforts in utilizing any aspect of training targets. <br> g.	Be available to fulfill an advisory role for training scenario development, tactical scenario set up and execution, target zone consideration and set up, situational safety evaluation, and after action review analysis. <br> h.

<DESC>The Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) is requesting information on potential commercial sources to provide custom antibody services to produce a monoclonal antibody that binds to quagga mussel larvae (Dreissena rostriformis bugensis).  The specific area of interest and minimum baseline performance are listed below. Area of Interest.  Here in the USA, quagga mussels and their closely related cousins, zebra mussels, are aquatic invasive bivalve species that cause considerable damage to submerged infrastructure involved in the conveyance, treatment, storage, and use of water.  Affected sectors include the drinking water industry, hydroelectric power, industrial cooling facilities, agricultural irrigation, and recreational use of water.  The mussel life cycle includes a microscopic larval stage (veliger) that is typically detected using cross-polarized microscopy.  A veliger-specific antibody that can be coupled with a fluorescent tag will greatly simplify microscopic detection and identification of these veligers.
Minimum Baseline Performance.  The Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) is seeking a company (Contractor) that will produce a monoclonal antibody that binds to quagga mussel larvae.  Since the target for this project is not a typical immunogen, it is expected that the contractor will have experience generating antibodies against Dreissena spp. (quagga and zebra mussels) and generating monoclonal antibodies to a wide diversity of intact organisms, agents, and proteins.  All hybridoma cell lines, monoclonal antibodies, ascites fluid, culture supernatants, and other products directly funded by Reclamation remain the sole and exclusive property of Reclamation and will be shipped to Reclamation or its named collaborator upon request.
Preliminary work in generating a polyclonal antibody indicated that adult mussel protein elicited the strongest immune response.  Therefore, Reclamation or its collaborator will provide protein extracted from adult mussel mantle tissue.  The contractor must be able to meet or exceed the provision of the following services and products:
a.	Use the provided protein as an immunogen, using a protocol that favors a high affinity IgG response. b.	Monitor serum antibody titers throughout the immunization period and provide serum samples to Reclamation or its collaborator for testing and evaluation. c.	Create hybridomas through fusion of antibody-producing cells (from highest titer immunization) and at least two myeloma cell lines. d.	Test at least 525 fusion cultures for antibody specific to the immunogen and expand all antibody-positive cultures.  The contractor is expected to maintain both master and working cell banks. e.	Subclone at least 10 antibody-positive cultures.  If both fusion partner cell lines produce equal amounts of antibody, cultures from both cell lines will be expanded.  If hybridomas from the two cell lines do not produce equal amounts of antibody, all cultures will be derived from the cell line producing the highest antibody concentration. f.	Provide all antibody-positive subclones to Reclamation or its collaborator. g.	Determine antibody isotypes for each positive clone. h.	Perform cross-reactivity ELISA testing of selected clones using proteins provided by Reclamation or its collaborator. i.	Provide frozen storage for the products from each stage of the process for at least six months following completion of the project.  Stored products will include original fusion cocktails from both cell lines, all developed cell lines, all antibody-positive cell cultures, and back-ups of cell cultures. j.	Mass produce antibody for five clones using in-vitro procedures and culture volumes of at least 150 mL. k.	Provide Reclamation or its collaborator with cell culture supernatant. l.	Purify the final antibody using Protein-A or Protein-G based procedures. m.	Coordinate, consult, and work closely with Reclamation or its collaborator throughout the course of the project.  This will be an interactive and flexible process and the contractor is expected to be available for regular consultation and advice at all stages of the project.  The contractor will also provide assistance in analysis and interpretation of results at each stage of the process. n.	Maintain accurate and thorough records of cell lines, clones, and antibody production, following Good Manufacturing Practice guidelines and standardized QA/QC requirements for cell culture-based processes. o.	Provide periodic written and/or oral reports summarizing the work performed, progress of hybridoma development, problems and plans to resolve these problems, and results of ELISA screening at each stage of the process. p.	Provide final antibody within eight months of receiving the protein antigen.
In the past 7 years, Reclamation and other federal agencies have sponsored and conducted significant research in and workshops on the development of new laboratory analytical methods for the detection of zebra and quagga mussels (Kevin Kelly, PI).  While these new analytical methods are largely at the research level, this effort has demonstrated the potential of molecular methods to selectively and sensitively detect for the presence of zebra and quagga mussels.  Reclamation seeks to apply these molecular-based methods to further improve our capability to monitor for zebra and quagga mussels.  Additional information on Reclamation Zebra and Quagga Mussel Research Program can be viewed at http://www.usbr.gov/mussels/research/.  
This request is to gather information from interested parties and is deemed essential as part of our collaborative, deliberate planning process for future acquisition planning if the information submitted indicates a strong commercial capability exists for Reclamation's intended applications or for research and development efforts with qualified industry representative(s) to develop and commercialize the capability sought.  Interested parties should reply no later than February 15, 2013.  Please include in your response a brief summary statement of your company's capability, experience, and past performance when applicable as it relates to the above description of services. Please also include your company's DUNS number and socio-economic status (small business, woman-owned business, service disabled veteran owned, etc.). Please submit information to Rob Brackett, Contracting Officer, Denver Acquisitions Operations Group at rbrackett@usbr.gov.
This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a solicitation.  Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of the submission of contractor's information.  The Government shall not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for proprietary information not properly identified.  Proprietary information will be safeguarded in accordance with the applicable Government regulations. Response to the RFI will not be returned.

<DESC>Program Summary
<p>DLA is soliciting parties interested in a prime service integrator initiative for HMMWV Industrial Support Successor Contract. The contractor shall function as the Prime Service Integrator in support of all production/maintenance line of the High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV) for which the Services assign to DLA line side parts support. The successor contract is scheduled to start in Jan 2014. This program requires the Prime Service Integrator to own, manage, kit, forecast and deliver inventory to the customer. The billing and payment cycle begins at the time of use by (or delivery to) the customer. Current performance sites are Red River Army Depot (RRAD). Limited stock deliveries are also provided to Maine Military Authority (MMA).</p>
<p>The Contractor will not be expected to perform the actual production/maintenance of HMMWVs, but will be expected to perform logistical support to maintain the production/maintenance lines by providing line side part support through supply bins and stocking points to ensure the parts are there when needed by the production/maintenance workers. As part of that logistical support the Contractor will both purchase parts directly and acquire parts from the Government, specifically DLA and TACOM. This initiative is designed to optimize the supply chain by having a prime service integrator:</p>
<p>1) Tailor its support to production/maintenance lines of a single weapon system and its variants,<br />2) To push its managed inventory to the line side bins and stocking points when and where needed by the production/maintenance workers, and<br />3) Allowing DOD to pay for materiel only when delivered for point of consumption use to the end user (Integrated Logistics Partnership Concept) by moving the point of inspection and point of sale to the point of use.</p>
<p>Please answer the following questions with specific examples and descriptions of your current or past experience in light of the requirements described above. If possible, please provide proper program names, contract numbers, and points of contact with each example.</p>

Proposed start date for OUE is 1 Mar 2013.  Actual fielding decision is beyond the scope, intent, or authority of this RFI or OUE.  Potential for follow-on procurement is dependent on results of tests and availability of funding.  The government is looking for a system that offers the best value to the government, not necessarily the lowest procurement cost.  Mission effectiveness and safety are key considerations. <br>  <br> Interested parties capable of providing a potential replacement for the Armament Circuit Preload Test Set that meets or exceeds the above requirements shall provide a statement of capability (SOC) that demonstrates the existing capability to provide, modify, and sustain the system, along with a description of test set capabilities.  A rough order of magnitude (ROM) is requested as part of the RFI and will be used as market research.  The SOC shall be unclassified and the information submitted should be pertinent to, and identify, the system capability as related to the technical effort requested.  A limit of fifty (50) pages is imposed for the responses, which should be received by close of business 1 March 2013.  Testing results are expected to determine the most effective system. <br>  <br> Please e-mail all information and SOC to the AATC Contracting Officer, SMSgt Jonathan Wood, at jonathan.wood.1@ang.af.mil.  For programmatic questions or technical questions contact Lt Col Sheldon Brown at sheldon.brown@ang.af.mil or Mr. Ken Gavre at kenneth.gavre.ctr@ang.af.mil.

<RESPDATE>020513
<CONTACT>Emily M. Acedo-Malaney, Contract Specialist, Phone 2156566912, Email emily.m.sheaffer@usace.army.mil
<DESC>The Corps of Engineers Philadelphia District is soliciting comments from the construction community addressing the potential use of Project Labor Agreements (PLA) for the following large scale (exceeding $25 million) construction project:
<p>Beach Rehabilitation, Hurricane Sandy Response Project, Barnegat Inlet to Little Egg Inlet, New Jersey</p>
<p>Project Description: Beach rehabilitation from the Barnegat Inlet to Little Egg Inlet, New Jersey. The proposed work will include repairs to protective berm/dune resulting from damages incurred by Hurricane Sandy. It is estimated that approximately 2,000,000 CY of sand are required to restore the beaches of the Barnegat Inlet to Little Egg Inlet project to pre-storm conditions. The proposed work will also include:</p>
<p>&bull; Replacement of sand fencing along approximately 31,000 LF of beach. <br />&bull; Replacement of approximately 111 acres of dune grass. <br />&bull; Rehabilitation of 22,000 LF of pedestrian crossovers.<br />&bull; Rehabilitation of 2,200 LF of vehicular crossovers.<br />&bull; Replacement of 18,000 LF of post and rail fence.</p>
<p>Range of Magnitude: Between $25,000,000.00 and $100,000,000.00</p>
<p>Some of the factors that may be considered regarding PLA use are:</p>
<p>a. The involvement of multiple contractors and/or subcontractors working in multiple crafts or trades.<br />b. The complexity of the project. <br />c. Shortage of skilled labor in the region.<br />d. Completion of the project will require an extended period of time.<br />e. The use of PLA's on other comparable projects in this geographic area.<br />f. The promotion of the Governments long term programs interests such as training of skilled workforce for future projects. <br />g. The possibility of labor disputes that threaten timely completion.<br />h. Additional costs from use of PLAs may be cost prohibitive.</p>
<p>A PLA is defined as a pre-hire collective bargaining agreement with one or more labor organizations that establishes the terms and conditions of employment for a specific construction project and is an agreement described in 29 U.S.C. 158(f).</p>
<p>Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Policy:</p>
<p>a. Project Labor Agreement (PLA) is a tool that agencies may use to promote economy and efficiency in Federal procurement. Pursuant to Executive Order 13502, agencies are encouraged to consider requiring the use of project labor agreements in connection with large-scale construction projects.</p>
<p>b. An agency may, if appropriate, require that every contractor and subcontractor engaged in construction on the project agree, for that project, to negotiate or become a party to a project labor agreement with one or more labor organizations if the agency decides that the use of project labor agreements will</p>
<p>1. Advance the Federal Governments interest in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement, producing labor-management stability, and ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other matters; and</p>
<p>2. Be consistent with law. Reference: Provision: 52.222-33 Notice of Requirement for Project Labor Agreement Clause 52.222-34 Project Labor Agreement.</p>
<p>In consideration of the above factors, and any others which may be deemed appropriate, the construction community is invited to comment on the use of PLAs. Of particular interest to the Government are responses to the following questions:</p>
<p>a. Should a PLA be executed on the above described Beach Rehabilitation project at Barnegat Inlet to Little Egg Inlet, New Jersey? What benefits do you believe a PLA could achieve? What other factors should the Corps consider before deciding to include PLA provisions for the Beach Rehabilitation project?</p>
<p>b. Will the use of a PLA be effective in achieving economy and efficiency? If so, how? What is the estimated relative cost impact, or any other economies or efficiencies derived by the Federal Government, if using a PLA? Will a PLA impact the cost of submitting an offer?</p>
<p>c. Are there any concerns regarding labor-management stability related to this project? Will the use of a PLA produce labor-management stability on this project? Have labor disputes or other labor issues contributed to project delays in the local area? Are you aware of examples of labor-management conflicts in the area which could impact the efficiency of this project, which a PLA could positively impact/resolve?</p>
<p>d. Will use of a PLA be conducive to ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other relevant matters on this project? Are there instances where these standards have not been met on Federal contracts in the local area? Were PLAs used for those specific contracts?</p>
<p>e. This project will require construction contractors and/or subcontractors employing workers in multiple crafts or trades. Do you foresee any work on this project that may result in both the prime contractor and at least one subcontractor, or two or more subcontractors, employing the same trade?</p>
<p>f. Are there concerns by prime contractors on the availability of skilled construction labor? Are there large scale construction projects in the area which could impact availability of skilled labor for this project? What is the anticipated volatility in the labor market for the trades required for the execution of the project?</p>
<p>g. How will a PLA impact the completion time? Would a PLA benefit a project which contains a unique and compelling mission-critical schedule?</p>
<p>h. Where have PLAs been used on comparable projects undertaken by Federal, State, municipal, or private entities in the geographic area of this project?</p>
<p>i. Will the use of PLAs impact the ability of potential Offerors and subcontractors to meet small business utilization goals?</p>
<p>THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS AND DOES NOT CONSTITUTE ANY COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT. Responses to this labor market survey will be used by the Government to make appropriate acquisition decisions. All interested sources must respond to future solicitations announcements separately from responses to this market survey.</p>
<p>Please provide your comments via email to Emily M. Sheaffer, Contract Specialist, at Emily.M.Sheaffer@usace.army.mil no later than 4:00 P.M. (EST) on 05 February 2013.</p>

<p>MARKET RESEARCH REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI). NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENT EXISTS.</p>
<p>The following is an RFI. This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a Request for Proposals (RFP). Responses to the RFI cannot be accepted by the Marine Corps to form a binding contract.</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION: The Marine Corps Systems Command's Program Manager for Ammunition (PM Ammo) is conducting a market survey to determine the availability of a family of 5.56mm marking cartridges (single and linked) to determine their viability for use with the M4/M16 Conversion Kit, NSN: 1005-20-002-4811 and the M249 Conversion Kit, NSN: 1005-21-921-3346 to meet the force-on-force training requirements of the Marine Corps. The intent of this RFI is to identify potential sources for the family of 5.56mm marking cartridges that will allow for Marines to safely use their current service weapons and conversion kits.</p>
<p>SPECIFICATION: The family of 5.56 marking cartridges shall be interoperable with the current Marine Corps M4/M16 Conversion Kit, NSN: 1005-20-002-4811 and the M249 Conversion Kit, NSN: 1005-21-921-3346 without any other auxiliary equipment or configuration changes to the weapon. When fired, the low velocity, non-lethal, reduced energy impact of the ammunition on personnel shall make a noticeable biodegradable mark and will cause slight discomfort, similar to the commercialized CO2 paintball guns, but will not cause lasting injury. The cartridge must be capable of being stored at temperature extremes of -65 degrees Fahrenheit to +160 degrees Fahrenheit, and being operated between -25 degrees Fahrenheit and +125 degrees Fahrenheit. The Marine Corps will use the results of this announcement to determine what capabilities exist in the marketplace.</p>
<p>SUBMISSION INFORMATION: Responses to this RFI should not exceed fifteen (15) pages and should be submitted within 30 days of this notice. Vendors responding to this RFI should submit a description of their capabilities along with Technology Readiness Level (TRL) if not a fielded system, sketches, drawings, specifications, brochures, and production capability. Vendors shall submit data that support claims that their 5.56mm Marking Cartridge design will conform to the current Marine Corps 5.56 Conversion Kits. Vendors' response shall concentrate on the marking cartridges only; this announcement does not include conversion kits or equipment. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this effort is 332992, Small Arms Ammunition Manufacturing; the Small Business Size Standard is 1,000 full time employees. Firms shall indicate their business size based upon NAICs code 332992 and identify a corporate point of contact.<br /><br />NOTE: This is a market survey, not a pre-solicitation notice. The Government will not pay or provide reimbursement for any costs incurred in the preparation or delivery of the request for information. Issuance of this notice does not constitute any obligation on the part of the Government to procure these items or to issue a solicitation. Any information that the vendor considers proprietary should be clearly marked as such.</p>
<p>REQUESTED RESPONSE DATE: Responses to this RFI should be signed and dated. Both e-mail and mail submittals will be accepted. Mailed responses should be sent to: Commander, Marine Corps System Command, Attn: Ms. Laurel Baker, PM Ammo, 2200 Lester Street, Quantico, VA 22134; electronic mail to the Contracting Specialist, Ms. Laurel Baker at laurel.baker@usmc.mil, by 27 February, 2013.</p>

<DESC>NASA Langley Research Center in Hampton, VA solicits interest from companies interested in obtaining license rights to commercialize, manufacture and market the following technology. License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis and may include specific fields of use. THE TECHNOLOGY: NASA Langley has developed a new adhesively bonded joint concept for curved and flat panel sandwich architectures. A woven preform, inserted into the seam between sandwich panels, provides a larger total bonding area and multiple load paths for an improved distribution of load through the joint. NASA is able to create structures by joining sections of sandwich panels or curved shells. The new joint provides more durable load transfer and redundant load paths compared to current state-of-the-art adhesively bonded strap joints. To express interest in this opportunity, please respond to Sean Sullivan, Research Triangle International (RTI),  at: NASA Langley Research Center, 17 West Taylor St., Mail Stop 218, Building 1212, Room 110 Hampton, Virginia, E-mail: Sean.D.Sullivan@NASA.gov, or phone: 757-864-5055. Please indicate the date and title of the FBO notice and include your company and contact information. For more information about licensing other NASA-developed technologies, please visit the NASA Technology Transfer Portal at http://technology.nasa.gov/. RTI is responsible for aggregating and acknowledging all responses.  These responses are provided to members of NASA Langleys Innovative Partnerships Office within the Office of Strategic Analysis and Business Development (OSACB) for the purpose of promoting public awareness of NASA-developed technology products, and conducting preliminary market research to determine public interest in and potential for future licensing opportunities. If direct licensing interest results from this posting, OSACB will follow the required formal licensing process of posting in the Federal Register.  No follow-on procurement is expected to result from responses to this Notice.

<DESC>NASA Langley Research Center in Hampton, VA solicits interest from companies interested in obtaining license rights to commercialize, manufacture and market the following technology. License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis and may include specific fields of use. THE TECHNOLOGY: NASA Langley researchers have developed a novel noise reduction system for jet engines. Aircraft jet engine noise is a major issue for airports, the communities near airports, and, of course, for the jet engine designers. Even with the use of recent high-bypass-ratio jet engine designs, noise continues to be a major concern. The present innovation represents a significant advancement to the concept of using mechanically fixed chevrons on the trailing edge of jet engine nozzles to reduce noise. While the effect of chevrons on noise reduction is well known, commercial implementation has been limited. Unfortunately, the turbulence created with the chevrons, while useful for reducing noise upon takeoff, serves to reduce efficiency during cruising. The present innovation is a simple noise reduction system with effects similar to that of chevrons, yet it is active and controllable to maximize noise reduction while maintaining efficiency. To express interest in this opportunity, please respond to Sean Sullivan, Research Triangle International (RTI),  at: NASA Langley Research Center, 17 West Taylor St., Mail Stop 218, Building 1212, Room 110 Hampton, Virginia, E-mail: Sean.D.Sullivan@NASA.gov, or phone: 757-864-5055.

Also, Contractor shall provide Bioenvironmental Engineering (7 ADOS/SGGB) a copy of contractor's radioactive materials permit and training certificates, if radioactive material will be brought onto Dyess AFB.</p>
<p>9. Security Requirements.</p>
<p>9.1. Levels of Security. Dyess AFB security may be viewed as being one of three broad levels, the level in effect being dependent on the location or AREA of Dyess AFB in question.</p>
<p>9.1.1. The lowest level of security exists in "GENERAL ACCESS" areas. These areas are all of Dyess AFB outside of the "USAF Controlled" and "USAF Restricted" areas.</p>
<p>9.1.2. "USAF Controlled" access areas are the mid-level security areas. Presence within the CONTROLLED ACCESS AREA is by authorization; however, the movement of authorized personnel in and out of these AREAS is generally not impeded.</p>
<p>9.1.3. The highest level of security on Dyess AFB is that within the "USAF RESTRICTED AREAS". These areas are subdivided to be known as Protection Level 1, 2 or 3 AREAS. Work schedule requests or changes to existing schedules for work to be performed in a "USAF RESTRICTED AREA" shall be submitted at least 7 calendar days in advance for approval and coordination of Dyess AFB Security Forces.</p>
<p>9.2. Closed Base. Dyess AFB is considered a closed base. All personnel entering must have specific permission of the installation commander for entry. This permission is granted when a Contractor employee is issued an identification card. The Contracting Officer will provide information necessary to obtain identification cards. The contractor shall be responsible to ensure that all of its employees obtain, and keep on their person at all times while working on the base, a USAF identification card. Upon completion of the work or termination of an employee, the contractor shall be responsible for turn in of identification cards to the Contracting Officer or to the Pass and Registration Office of the Security Forces.</p>
<p>NOTE: Failure to turn in badges will result in WITHHOLDING OF FINAL PAYMENT and revocation of any future badges issued by Pass and Registration Office to the employee and the contractor.</p>
<p>9.2.1. Dyess Form 173. The Dyess AFB Form 173 is subject to the privacy act of 1974, Authority: 10 U.S.C. 8012 and 5 U.S.C. 552a(b)(7). Disclosure is Mandatory: Failure to provide the information and Social Security Number (SSN) could result in denied access to the Dyess AFB installation.</p>
<p>9.2.1.1. Effective 1 Nov 04, a completed signed original Dyess Form 173 (Mar 04) must be delivered to Pass &amp; ID by 0900 on the duty day prior to the desired day of entry onto Dyess AFB. The Visitor Control Center no longer issues temporary passes to contractor personnel unless they have already been previously identified on an executed Dyess Form 173. All information on the Dyess Form 173 must be typed and the authorizing signature must be in blue or black ink. Personal information provided on the Dyess Form 173 will be cross-referenced against state and federal criminal databases to identify those individuals possessing outstanding warrants. Those individuals with outstanding warrants will be detained at the Visitor Control Center on the desired day of entry, and turned over to Abilene Police Department.<br />9.2.1.2. The approving authority (individual on the 577) can make "ink changes" in red ink to correct any errors noted on the form. All changes have to be initialed by the approval authority.<br />9.2.1.3. All individuals with Dyess Form 173's will still continue to be processed via the Texas Law Enforcement Terminal System (TLETS-police wants/warrants check). Once it is determined the individual is cleared from any wants or warrants, a copy of the Dyess Form 173 will be placed at the Tye Gate entry point. The Tye Gate Guard will use this form as an Entry Authority List (EAL) allowing contractors onto the installation. The contractor will then be able to go to the Gate directly (not the Visitor Control Center (VCC) or Arnold Gate) and verify if their Dyess Form 173 is there. Should their Dyess Form 173 not be there, they will be directed to the VCC for issuance of an AF Form 75. At this time, someone will physically have to meet them to sponsor them onto the installation. (Reasons why the form would not be at the guard shack would be erroneous driver's license number, erroneous information, warrant, or identified as illegal alien).<br />9.2.1.4. Should their Dyess Form 173 be at the Tye Gate entry point, the contractor will be told to proceed directly to the Pass and Registration Section for the 7 SFS Contractor Badge issue. The Pass Section will have the original Dyess Form 173. Once a badge is obtained, they need only show the badge at the installation gate for entry onto the installation. Please note that neither the Security Forces Control Center nor the Tye Gate Guards will check the Dyess Form 173 for errors. This is the responsibility of the Pass and Registration Section. <br />9.2.1.5. The Dyess Form 173 will be maintained at the Tye Gate entry point for 48 hours (two business days). After the specified time has expired, it will be destroyed. Should the contractor not process through Tye Gate in that 48-hour period, the contractor will require someone to physically vouch them on base to get a one day pass at the VCC so they may proceed to the Pass and Registration office for their badge. The hold period for these forms at the gate can and will be extended should rain days occur or through prior coordination with any affected agency.</p>
<p>9.2.2. Trusted Agent Letter for Day Labor Requests.</p>
<p>9.2.2.1. Purpose of Letter: To provide sponsoring authority to specific contractor individuals as identified by their sponsoring agency (7 CONS, Army Corp of Engineers, etc) to sponsor day laborers on for one day periods. <br />9.2.2.2. The Letter Process:</p>
<p>9.2.2.2.1. The sponsoring agency, in coordination with their contractor, will identify contractor individuals that require sponsoring/vouching authority. This authority is given to the contractor for the purpose of sponsoring day laborers/job site personnel sub-contracted as a result of an unexpected or new requirement not previously identified in the current contract. This authority will not be given to contractors for convenience only, but should be limited to the smallest group of manager or foreman contractor personnel needed to complete their assigned contract. It is the responsibility of the sponsoring agency to ensure the Trusted Agent Letter remains current. Additionally, all reasonable actions should occur to prevent use of this process when a known laborer/sub-contractor was required well in advance of the day labor/sub-contractor request. (Effective Date: Immediately)<br />9.2.2.2.2. The sponsoring agency will provide this letter to the Pass and Registration Section who will maintain it on file. The Pass and Registration section shall post a copy of the letter at the VCC, as a reference, to verify which contractor personnel have sponsoring/vouching authority.</p>
<p>9.2.2.3. The Process to get Day Labors/Job Site Personnel Sub-Contracted onto the Installation:</p>
<p>9.2.2.3.1. The contractor individuals identified in the Trusted Agent Letter will provide a typed or hand-written form (form will be provided by the 7 SFS) with all individuals they will sponsor onto the installation to the VCC Guard. The VCC Guard will verify the identity of all individuals on the form by checking the information against a valid State/Federal Identification card. The VCC Guard will randomly check a percentage of the individuals via the TLETS. Should any individual not possess a valid identification card, they will be turned away at the VCC and entry to the installation denied. Pen and ink changes can be made to the form, but all information must be validated by the guard before the contractor will be allowed to proceed onto the installation with the sponsored individuals. No AF Form 75/Visitor Pass will be issued to any individual who is sponsored by the Trusted Agent Contractor, unless the sponsored individual will be driving a vehicle onto the installation. Trusted Agent Contractors are encouraged to consolidate all sponsored individuals into the smallest number of vehicles as possible to avoid the issuance of multiple AF Form 75. Should an AF Form 75 be issued, the driver will be required to produce a valid driver's license, current insurance card, and current registration for the vehicle being operated. Once on the installation, the Trusted Agent Contractor will be responsible for the actions of the sponsored individuals. Should an incident occur with a sponsored guest, and negligence be proven on the part of the Trusted Agent Contractor, their vouching/sponsoring authority will be revoked. The Trusted Agent Letter can be adjusted to add and delete names of Trusted Agent Contractors as needed, as long as the provisions of this paragraph are followed. Although the 7 SFS form is used in lieu of the AF Form 75, it carries the same authority and responsibilities. Additionally, the 7 SFS Form will expire at 0001 daily or at the end of the contractor duty day, whichever occurs first. At no time will the Trusted Agent Contractor depart the installation and leave any of his/her sponsored individuals with another contractor that does not have the same vouching/sponsoring privileges. <br />9.2.2.3.2. All contractors must attend a contractor briefing given to the contractors by Pass and Registration who will provide a more detailed explanation regarding contractor badges and their uses. Pass and Registration reserves the right to not issue a contractor badge due to erroneous information or failure to disclose information on the Dyess Form 173. Any derogatory information received from the background check will result in the non-issuance of the contractor badge.</p>
<p>10. Identification of Contractor Vehicles. Contractor vehicles must be marked on each side with company name with either permanent or semi-permanent/magnetic signage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&emsp;<br />11. Other Vehicle and Licensing Requirements: <br />11.1 All contractor employees who will be driving a vehicle on Dyess AFB shall have a current driver's license with them at all times while on Dyess AFB.<br />11.2 All contractor vehicles to be operated on Dyess AFB will have a valid state registration, vehicle inspection, and insurance. Proof of registration and vehicle insurance must be physically available at all times while the vehicle is on Dyess AFB.<br />11.3 Any contractor employee who will be operating heavy equipment or specialized equipment that requires a license or certification shall be so licensed/certified with proof presented to the Contracting Officer's representative and 7 CES COR prior to work start.</p>
<p><br />Addendum</p>
<p><br />1. The requested survey is a gas-line survey only. It does not include cathodic protection or any other utility line.</p>
<p>2. The contract does include testing of the gas regulators for any leakage</p>
<p>3. There are two gas meter systems: one is located at the Tye Gate on the north end of the base and the second is one-half mile south of the Arnold Gate near the main entrance to the base.</p>
<p>4. The gas piping is plastic or polyurethane</p>
<p>5. Digging permits are required for any ground penetrations deeper than 6-inches that are done using equipment. Hand digging with a shovel can be done up to 18 inches without a digging permit.</p>
<p>6. Past survey records are available for contractor review.</p>
<p>7. The most recent gas line maps are dated 2005, but they have been updated by contractors who have replaced gas lines over the past several years.</p>
<p>8. The operating pressure of the distribution system is 40 psi.</p>
<p>9. The contract does not require the contractor to repair any detected leaks. The contract requires any detected leaks to be referred to the base Civil Engineer Squadron for their follow-on action and response.</p>

<p>iii. Volume Three (Do not exceed ten (10) pages).</p>

<p>B. Pricing Information. <br />(1) Submit completed copy of the Government-provided Schedule B containing the Offeror's proposed amounts. Enter pricing only on the Government Schedule B. No Offeror shall alter the Schedule B in any way with the exception of entering pricing. If the Schedule B is found to be altered in any way other than entering pricing, the action will be considered an unacceptable offer and may result in the offer being considered non responsive. Schedule B unit prices shall be limited to two decimal places. In addition, to identify a CLIN/SLIN (Contract Line Item/Sub Line Item) as Not Separately Priced, enter "NSP" in the unit price and/or to identify a CLIN/SLIN as No Charge, enter "NC" in the unit price. Include all applicable discounts in your pricing. <br />(2) The US Air Force is a Federal Government entity, and as such, is exempt from certain taxes. Therefore, the offeror/awardee may not propose for any taxes from which the Federal Government is exempt.

<p>(e) Multiple offers. If more than one solution to the services is available, Offeror may submit multiple offers for consideration, subject to same page limitations. Multiple offers may not be considered if they alter the Government's requirement. Should the Offeror claim exceptions to any requirement in the solicitation, these exceptions shall be listed and rationale provided. Failure to include exceptions will be deemed as acceptance of all terms and conditions of the solicitation and resulting contract.</p>
<p>(h) Multiple awards. This award shall be made on an all or none basis.<br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-1)</p>
<p>(ix) The provision at FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, applies to this solicitation along with the following addenda to the provision:<br />52.212-2 Addendum:<br />Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection in which competing Offerors' past performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent Local Exchange Carrier (LEC) or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. Award will be made to the responsible Offeror proposing the combination most advantageous to the Government based upon an integrated assessment of the evaluation factors described below. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) FACTOR 1 -- TECHNICAL. The Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of acceptable or unacceptable. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following technical subfactors:<br /><br />Subfactor 1 - Provider Capability <br />This subfactor is met when the Offeror provides evidence they are a telecommunications company which owns most of its own facilities such as switching equipment, transmission lines and infrastructure, having the capability to provide Primary Rate Interfaces (PRI), Direct Inward Dial (DID), and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p><br />Subfactor 2 - Local Communications Services. <br />This subfactor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a SITE-SPECIFIC diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix 10 requirements. Reference generic example diagram in Appendix 10.</p>
<p><br />(b) FACTOR 2 -- PRICE. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent LEC or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) FACTOR 3 -- PAST PERFORMANCE. In evaluating PPI, the government will employ several approaches including: reviewing contract references provided by the offeror; seeking PPI through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. Only recent (within the last three years) and relevant PPI (similar or greater in scope, magnitude of effort, and complexity than effort described in this solicitation) will be evaluated. When reviewing PPI, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform the services described in this solicitation. The performance confidence assessment will result in an overall performance confidence rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower. If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer. <br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-2)</p>
<p>(x) Offerors are highly encouraged to complete all Representations and Certifications electronically at the following website: https://sam.gov/.

These requirements also apply to applications pending on the effective date of this contract.<br />(3) Public Utilities Commission (PUC) Authorization. All Offerors shall be local exchange carriers certificated (Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority (SPCOA) , or Certificate of Operating Authority (COA)) with the state PUC where services are being provided. This contract shall at all times be subject to such changes by the PUC of the state having jurisdiction over the particular site as said Commission may, from time to time, direct in the exercise of its jurisdiction.<br />(4) Rates, Charges, and Services. <br />(i) The Contractor shall furnish the services and facilities under this contract in accordance with-<br />(A) All applicable tariffs, rules, regulations, or requirements;<br />(1) Lawfully established by a governmental regulatory body; and<br />(2) Applicable to service and facilities furnished or offered by the Contractor to the general public or the Contractor's subscribers;<br />(B) A firm-fixed-price contract provides for a price that is not subject to any adjustment on the basis of the contractor's cost experience including tariff changes with the exception of TFS. If the prices differ from established tariff prices, it is the responsibility of the contractor to either file a special tariff for the contract with the relevant Governmental authorities or make other arrangements to comply with the governmental requirements. The Air Force will not be liable for price increases for failure to follow these requirements. If, during the term of the contract, the TFS change, the contractor must submit supporting state statutes, local ordinances, regulations, Federal Communications Commission (FCC) ruling and rates, etc, for Government verification. A modification will then be issued based upon the newly documented annual TFS. <br />(ii) The Government shall not prepay for services.<br />(iii) Recurring charges for services and facilities shall, in each case, start with the satisfactory beginning of service or provision of facilities or equipment and are payable monthly in arrears.<br />(iv) Subject to the Cancellation or Termination of Orders clause 252.239-7007, of this contract, the Government may stop the use of any service or facilities furnished under this contract at any time. The Government shall pay the contractor all charges for services and facilities adjusted to the effective date of discontinuance.<br />(v) Expediting charges are costs necessary to get services earlier than normal. Examples are overtime pay or special shipment. When authorized, expediting charges shall be the additional costs incurred by the Contractor and the subcontractor. The Government shall pay expediting charges only when-<br />(A) They are provided for in the tariff established by a governmental regulatory body; or<br />(B) They are authorized in a communication service authorization or other contractual document.<br />(vi) When services normally provided are technically unacceptable and the development, fabrication, or manufacture of special equipment is required, the Government may-<br />(A) Provide the equipment; or<br />(B) Direct the Contractor to acquire the equipment or facilities. If the Contractor acquires the equipment or facilities, the acquisition shall be competitive, if practicable.<br />(vii) If at any time the Government defers or changes its orders for any of the services but does not cancel or terminate them, the amount paid or payable to the Contractor for the services deferred or modified shall be equitably adjusted at the time of deferral or change. The Government and the Contractor shall equitably adjust the rates by mutual agreement. Failure to agree on any adjustment shall be a dispute concerning a question of fact within the meaning of the Disputes clause of this contract.<br />(w) Continuity of Services and Option to Extend Telecommunication Services. <br />(1) This CSA authorizes continuation of services previously authorized on <br />CSA# FA8773-08-C-0060.<br />(2) For all services required on this contract, the contractor shall continue to provide services until a release date is established by the government as a result of competition (cutover complete) or termination (including termination for cause or government convenience). <br />(3) The Government may require continued performance of any services within the limits and at the rates specified in the contract until cutover is complete. These rates will remain firm fixed price during this process. This provision may be exercised more than once, but the total extension of performance hereunder shall not exceed 6 months. The Contracting Officer may exercise this provision by unilateral modification to the contract before 10 days of expiration.<br />(4)The Contractor recognizes that the services under this contract are vital to the Government and must be continued without interruption and that, before contract expiration, a successor, either the Government or another Contractor, may continue them. The Contractor agrees to -<br />(i) Provide transitioning of services during cutover period without termination liability charges; <br />(ii) Exercise its best efforts and cooperation to effect an orderly and efficient transition to a successor; and<br />(iii) Notify the Government of any services not cutover after contract expiration.<br />(x) Work Orders.

<p>(6) Written acknowledgement of all applicable solicitation amendments.<br />B. Pricing Information.</p>

No Offeror shall alter the Schedule B in any way with the exception of entering pricing. If the Schedule B is found to be altered in any way other than entering pricing, the action will be considered an unacceptable offer and may result in the offer being considered non responsive. Schedule B unit prices shall be limited to two decimal places. In addition, to identify a CLIN/SLIN (Contract Line Item/Sub Line Item) as Not Separately Priced, enter "NSP" in the unit price and/or to identify a CLIN/SLIN as No Charge, enter "NC" in the unit price. Include all applicable discounts in your pricing.</p>
<p>(2) The US Air Force is a Federal Government entity, and as such, is exempt from certain taxes. Therefore, the offeror/awardee may not propose for any taxes from which the Federal Government is exempt.

<p>(e) Multiple offers. If more than one solution to the services is available, Offeror may submit multiple offers for consideration, subject to same page limitations. Multiple offers may not be considered if they alter the Government's requirement. Should the Offeror claim exceptions to any requirement in the solicitation, these exceptions shall be listed and rationale provided. Failure to include exceptions will be deemed as acceptance of all terms and conditions of the solicitation and resulting contract.</p>
<p>(h) Multiple awards. This award shall be made on an all or none basis.<br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-1)</p>
<p>(ix) Provision 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition along with the following addenda to the provision.<br />52.212-2 Addendum:<br />Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection in which competing Offerors' past performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent Local Exchange Carrier (LEC) or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. Award will be made to the responsible Offeror proposing the combination most advantageous to the Government based upon an integrated assessment of the evaluation factors described below. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) FACTOR 1 - TECHNICAL. The Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of acceptable or unacceptable. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following technical subfactors:<br /><br />Subfactor 1 - Provider Capability</p>
<p>This factor is met when the Offeror provides evidence they are a telecommunications company having the capability to provide Basic Rate Interfaces (BRI), Commercial Subscriber Lines (CSL), and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p><br />(b) FACTOR 2 -- PRICE. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent LEC or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) FACTOR 3 -- PAST PERFORMANCE. In evaluating PPI, the government will employ several approaches including: reviewing contract references provided by the offeror; seeking PPI through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. Only recent (within the last three years) and relevant PPI (similar or greater in scope, magnitude of effort, and complexity than effort described in this solicitation) will be evaluated. When reviewing PPI, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform the services described in this solicitation. The performance confidence assessment will result in an overall performance confidence rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower. If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer. <br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-2)</p>
<p>(x) Complete all representations and certifications electronically at the following website: https://sam.gov/. If not completed on-line, Offerors must include a completed copy of the provisions at FAR 52.212-3, which can be obtained at http://farsite.hill.af.mil, FAR Part 52 or online at https://sam.gov/. In addition, complete the following Addendum I to 52.212-3:<br /><br />52.212-3 Addendum, Certification to Accept the Government Purchase Card (GPC).

These requirements also apply to applications pending on the effective date of this contract.<br />(3) Public Utilities Commission (PUC) Authorization. All Offerors shall be local exchange carriers certificated (Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority (SPCOA) , or Certificate of Operating Authority (COA)) with the state PUC where services are being provided. This contract shall at all times be subject to such changes by the PUC of the state having jurisdiction over the particular site as said Commission may, from time to time, direct in the exercise of its jurisdiction.<br />(4) Rates, Charges, and Services. <br />(i) The Contractor shall furnish the services and facilities under this contract in accordance with-<br />(A) All applicable tariffs, rules, regulations, or requirements;<br />(1) Lawfully established by a governmental regulatory body; and<br />(2) Applicable to service and facilities furnished or offered by the Contractor to the general public or the Contractor's subscribers;<br />(B) A firm-fixed-price contract provides for a price that is not subject to any adjustment on the basis of the contractor's cost experience including tariff changes with the exception of TFS. If the prices differ from established tariff prices, it is the responsibility of the contractor to either file a special tariff for the contract with the relevant Governmental authorities or make other arrangements to comply with the governmental requirements. The Air Force will not be liable for price increases for failure to follow these requirements. If, during the term of the contract, the TFS change, the contractor must submit supporting state statutes, local ordinances, regulations, Federal Communications Commission (FCC) ruling and rates, etc, for Government verification. A modification will then be issued based upon the newly documented annual TFS. <br />(ii) The Government shall not prepay for services.<br />(iii) Recurring charges for services and facilities shall, in each case, start with the satisfactory beginning of service or provision of facilities or equipment and are payable monthly in arrears.<br />(iv) Subject to the Cancellation or Termination of Orders clause 252.239-7007, of this contract, the Government may stop the use of any service or facilities furnished under this contract at any time. The Government shall pay the contractor all charges for services and facilities adjusted to the effective date of discontinuance.<br />(v) Expediting charges are costs necessary to get services earlier than normal. Examples are overtime pay or special shipment. When authorized, expediting charges shall be the additional costs incurred by the Contractor and the subcontractor. The Government shall pay expediting charges only when-<br />(A) They are provided for in the tariff established by a governmental regulatory body; or<br />(B) They are authorized in a communication service authorization or other contractual document.<br />(vi) When services normally provided are technically unacceptable and the development, fabrication, or manufacture of special equipment is required, the Government may-<br />(A) Provide the equipment; or<br />(B) Direct the Contractor to acquire the equipment or facilities. If the Contractor acquires the equipment or facilities, the acquisition shall be competitive, if practicable.<br />(vii) If at any time the Government defers or changes its orders for any of the services but does not cancel or terminate them, the amount paid or payable to the Contractor for the services deferred or modified shall be equitably adjusted at the time of deferral or change.

These rates will remain firm fixed price during this process. This provision may be exercised more than once, but the total extension of performance hereunder shall not exceed 6 months. The Contracting Officer may exercise this provision by unilateral modification to the contract before 10 days of expiration.<br />(4) The Contractor recognizes that the services under this contract are vital to the Government and must be continued without interruption and that, before contract expiration, a successor, either the Government or another Contractor, may continue them.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.   <br>  <br> The  Silicon Carbide (SiC) High-Voltage Power Technology (HVPT) is an applied research effort focused on extending the state-of-the-art (SOA) in SiC semiconductor switch design, epitaxial material growth ( greater than 100 micrometers), semiconductor device fabrication, and multi-die packaging for high-voltage (HV) applications.  Proposals are solicited that show a path forward to increased current density (at high-efficiency), die size, switching frequency, and blocking voltage ( greater than 10 kV) for both low- and high-duty-cycle switches.   SiC is an emerging power semiconductor material that has electrical, thermal, and mechanical properties that allow it to far surpass the performance of conventional silicon (Si) power technology and make it the prime candidate for next-generation high-voltage switching devices for military, as well as commercial, applications. <br>  <br> Proof-of-concept, SiC high-voltage power devices have been demonstrated to provide greater than twice the power density of Si power devices and at greater efficiency.  This program endeavors to advance the United States' capability to provide SiC HV high-power semiconductor switches; to identify limitations that must be overcome to attain the next high-water mark in SiC device high-voltage performance and; advance the United States' capability to provide high-voltage semiconductor device packaging solutions.  Technology limitations/gaps identified by this program may be the focus of more sustained development efforts in the future.  <br>  <br> The U.S. Army Contracting Command - Aberdeen Proving Ground, Research Triangle Park Division, on behalf of the U.S. Army Research Laboratory, Sensors and Electron Devices Directorate (SEDD) is soliciting proposals for the SiC HVPT program under Topic 1.4.3,  quote mark Wide Band-Gap Power Devices, quote mark  of the ARL Core Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) for Basic and Applied Scientific Research for Fiscal Years 2012 through 2017 at W911NF-12-R-0011.   <br>  <br> Solutions are sought for the development of SiC HV bi-polar, semiconductor switches with ultimate single die blocking voltages in the range of 15,000 V to 24,000 V and current capacity of 10 A.   These switches should be capable of turn-off at the maximum conduction current rating.  The Army is considering several application examples wherein HV switches are utilized.  One application requires switches to operate in a totem-pole configuration at +15,000 V and -10,000 V, 30 A (peak), and a frequency of 35 kHz.  A second application requires power switches and diodes to control the discharge of 20 kV storage capacitors (microsecond discharge time) in a Marx-type power supply with 10 A average current and 100 A short-circuit currents.  It is anticipated that, over the period of performance, the Recipient(s) will be able to demonstrate incremental device performance and fabrication capabilities and/or improvements thereof.  Because component packaging is also a thrust of this program, Recipient(s) will develop and demonstrate packaging concepts that provide for voltage isolation, heat transfer, current, and frequency such that the SiC device performance is not limited by the packaging approach and minimize total volume.  As the Recipient provides device deliverables to the Government, characterizations of the switches and the appropriate HV packaging will enable the Army to assess the state-of-the-art in HV semiconductor switch technology and provide power devices for demonstration circuits that will strive to meet Army requirements. <br>  <br> Since the HVPT program goals align well with future SiC high-voltage commercial applications, it is expected that the Recipient will include matching funds of no less than 25% in their proposal plans.  There will be no equipment purchases using federal funds associated with awards made as a result of this announcement.   <br>  <br> Funding is currently available for the award of up to two cooperative agreements related to the SiC HVPT program for these Fiscal Year (FY) 2012 funds.  While the BAA and Topic remain open for proposal submission until, 31 March 2017, in order to be eligible for the agreement to be awarded with the available funding,  proposals must be received in accordance with the due dates and instructions provided in this announcement.  It is anticipated that up to two  quote mark cooperative agreements quote mark  (31 USC 6305) will be awarded, pursuant to 10 USC 2358 Research Projects, each with a period of performance between twelve and eighteen months.  The total amount available for the award(s) is approximately $3,000,000.00.  The principal purpose of the cooperative agreements is for the public purpose of the support and stimulation of fundamental research and not the acquisition of property or provision of services for the direct benefit or use of the Government.  The Recipient of the cooperative agreements will work collaboratively with scientists from ARL to further the SiC HVPT program.  ARL will participate in the research and use its strong in-house technical expertise to jointly plan and execute the research program with the Recipient.   ARL will evaluate the fabricated power devices to Army-specific circuit stresses and analyze the devices' electrical and physical response.  These analyses and supporting data will be shared with the Recipient and ways to augment the device design, process and or starting material to improve performance will be jointly determined.  ARL's Device Reliability Physics, Pulse Switches and Circuit teams will participate in this collaboration. <br>  <br> In order to be eligible for the cooperative agreements to be awarded with the available funding for this program, offerors are to submit proposals in accordance with the submissions instructions under BAA W911NF-12-R-0011 no later than 28 February 2013.   Proposals will be evaluated using the criteria listed in the BAA.  Any Questions concerning the award(s) process shall be directed to:  Kathryn McManus by email: kathryn.e.mcmanus.civ@mail.mil.  This special notice expires 28 February 2013 at 11:59 PM (EST).      <br>  <br> Available on or about 29 January 2013.

Regardless of the terminology used in each  RFQ ("Brand Name or Equal", or "meet minimum stated specifications), the information describing what you are offering must be physically written into the seller's bid specification block. Salient characteristics are defined as "pronounced features of an item that identify it describe its size and composition, functional intent, and/or operational capabilities or limits."

Responses such as "bidding exact match", "as specified", or cutting and pasting the Government's specification information into the seller's bid specification block are not acceptable responses. Offerors who respond in any of the three examples directly above will be eliminated from the competition without consideration of their offer. If you are bidding the same product as is being requested, your seller bid specification should indicate: "Bidding on Manufacturer (Insert Name) and Part Number (Insert Number).

Fedbid is NOT a forum for filing protests against the Government.  Attempts to file protests through Fedbid will not be considered legitimate as they do not conform to the requirements in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).  It is preferable that disputes and protests be resolved as quickly as possible at the lowest level possible before considering the more formal process described below. Interested parties wishing to file an agency protest directly with the Contracting Officer responsible for this acquisition should review the procedures at FAR Part 33 and send your protest to LTC Douglas Lowrey, at douglas.lowrey@us.army.mil . Interested parties wishing to file an agency protest must abide by the provisions in FAR Part 33, Protests, Disputes, and Appeals.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC, as an Alternate Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO. The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing. To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.  The address for filing a protest directly with AMC is: HQ Army Material Command Office of Command Counsel 9301 Chapek Rd, Rm 2-1SE3401 Ft Belvoir, VA 22060-5527; Facsimile number (703) 806-8866 or 8875.

Notice:  The GSA Multiple Award Schedule (MAS) program has recently experienced a tremendous increase in new offers. Due to the large number of new offers currently in process, it could take up to (6) months or longer before your offer is evaluated. 
 
GSA's practice is to evaluate offers in the order in which they are received. However, GSA may give priority to processing certain offers when circumstances dictate, such as when a federal agency Contracting Officer specifically requests an expedited offer review in order to meet a pending requirement that will be procured under the MAS program, or when there is a need for GSA to bring strategically critical new products or services to market in order to meet federal customer needs.

Solicitation 3QSA-JB-100001-B, Refresh #8, is being issued to update current laws and regulations.

Special Item Numbers (SIN) 711-4 Blueprint Filing Cabinets, 711-5 Card Files, 711-6 Form Files, 711-12 System Type Tables and Accessories, 711-14 - Vertical Surface Attachment Panels and Accessories, 711-20 Display and Communication Boards, Wall Stations, Lecterns, and Accessories, 711-92 - Remanufactured Furniture, 71-202 Wall Units, 71-203 Loft Groups, 71-304 Lecterns, 71-305 Library Furniture, 71-306 Mail Sorting and Distribution Furniture, 71-308 Cafeteria and Food Service Furniture, 71-312 Hazardous Materials Storage, 71-317 Chair, Convalescent, and 71-321 Correctional Institution Furniture are 100% small business set-aside.

Interested parties may access the solicitation at http://www.fedbizopps.gov. This site provided instructions for downloading the solicitation files. Search using Solicitation Number 3QSA-JB-100001-B (include the dashes).

NOTE:  ALL OFFERS AND MODIFICATION REQUESTS MUST BE SUBMITTED ELECTRONICALLY AS AN EOFFER/EMOD (http://eoffer.gsa.gov/).  PAPER OR HARD COPY OFFERS/MODIFICATION REQUESTS ARE NO LONGER BEING ACCEPTED AND WILL BE REJECTED.

Contracting questions should be directed to email address schedule71@gsa.gov or 703-605-9978.  If you already have a GSA contact, please contact your assigned Contract Specialist or Contracting Officer directly.

The Federal Supply Schedule period is continuous. Resultant contracts will be for five (5) years, with three (3) five (5) year options to your contract, for a total of twenty (20) years if performance is satisfactory. The options are not guaranteed. Some of the measurements of satisfactory performance will be such things as adequate sales, quality performance, and timely IFF payments.  One of the most important evaluative factors will be participation in the GSA Advantage! Program. None of these options will be exercised unless your firm has posted its contract information to the GSA Advantage! Website. All offers received will have 6 months after award of a Federal Supply Schedule contract to submit their electronic catalog to GSA Advantage! website. All contracts will be indefinite delivery-indefinite quantity contracts.  All contracts to be awarded include Industrial Funding provisions.  We actively solicit offers from 8(a) firms for the products/services found under this MAS solicitation.  All responsible sources may submit an offer, which will be considered.

<p>The provision at FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items is applicable to this solicitation. The specific evaluation criteria to be included in paragraph (a) of that provision are as follows:</p>
<p>The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be the most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate quotes:</p>
<p>(i) Technical capability of the services offered to meet or exceed the Government's requirement.<br />(ii) Past Performance<br />(iii) Price.</p>
<p>Technical and past performance, when combined, are significantly more important than price in determining the best value to the government. If the Government determines that competing technical and past performance proposals are essentially equal, price becomes increasingly important and may become the determining factor in the best value decision.</p>
<p>Technical capability Technical capability will be determined by review of information submitted by the offeror which must provide a description in sufficient detail to show that the offeror has the capability to perform the required services which demonstrates the technical approach and understanding to meet the Government's requirement. The response should include who, what, when and how the requirement will be accomplished. Such documentation should include technician certification from the original equipment manufacturer within the past calendar year.</p>
<p>Past Performance<br />Past Performance will be determined by review of recent Government Contracts. If other than OEM the offeror shall provide evidence of their experience with the OEM equipment in general and more specifically the Gatan UltraScan US1000XP camera; OEM supply chain experience; and company names including contact information for a minimum of 3 customers within the past 3 years demonstrating experience providing preventative and corrective maintenance services in a lab environment. Provide name, telephone number, email address, contract number and description of services with dollar amount.</p>
<p>The government is not responsible for locating or securing any information, which is not identified in the proposal however the Government reserves the right to obtain information for use in the evaluation from any and all sources including sources outside of the Government. Contractors shall include the firm's DUNS number with quote.</p>
<p>(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options (FAR 52.217-8 and 52.217-9) to the total price for the base requirement. For evaluation purposes, the Government will apply &frac12; of the Option Year 3 pricing in its evaluation of the 52.217-8 option pricing which, for evaluation purposes, would occur following the conclusion of Option Year 3. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>
<p>Offerors are afforded the opportunity to inspect the system prior to the date set for receipt of quotes by contacting the Contract Specialist/Contracting Officer identified herein to schedule an appointment. Failure to inspect the system will not relieve the successful offeror from fully meeting the requirements of the resulting contract at the price offered. <br />The Provision at FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items (DEC 2012), applies to this acquisition. An offeror should complete only paragraph (b) of this provision if the offeror has completed the annual representations and certifications electronically at www.sam.gov.</p>
<p>Offeror shall complete the certifications as applicable in the provision at FAR provision 52.212-3(k) for the application of the Service Contract Act (SCA). If this positive certification is not provided the FAR Clauses at 52.242-41 and 52.242-42 shall be incorporated and the following SCA wage determination shall become part in any resultant contract. http://www.wdol.gov/wdol/scafiles/std/05-2103.txt?v=12.</p>
<p>The Defense Priorities and Allocations System (DPAS) and assigned rating are not applicable to this solicitation notice.</p>
<p>It is the offeror's responsibility to monitor the internet site for the release of any amendments to the combined synopsis/solicitation.</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit an offer, which if timely received, shall be considered. The offer must reference solicitation number 1113988.

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>

The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks.

<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>

<p>Three paper sets of the proposal, an original so marked and two copies are required.</p>
<p>PROPOSAL EVALUATION</p>
<p>1. Initial Evaluation of Proposals</p>
<p>The Government reserves the right to make award without discussion based solely upon initial proposals. Therefore, offerors should ensure that their initial proposal constitutes their best offer in terms of both price and the technical/past performance/references/resumes. If required, the Contracting Officer may establish a competitive range comprised of the technically acceptable proposals. If the Contracting Officer determines that the number of proposals that would otherwise be in the competitive range exceeds the number at which an efficient competition can be conducted, the Contracting Officer may limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition amongst the most highly rated proposals. Only those offerors in the competitive range will be offered an opportunity to participate further in the procurement.</p>
<p>2. Discussions/Final Proposal Revisions (if appropriate/necessary)</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer will engage in discussions with all offerors in the competitive range in accordance with FAR 15.306. At the conclusion of the discussions, a final common cut-off date which allows a reasonable opportunity for submission of written final proposal revisions will be established. Those offerors selected to remain in the competitive range will be notified to submit Final Proposal Revisions.</p>
<p>3. Final Evaluation of Offers (if appropriate)</p>
<p>A final proposal evaluation will be performed after receipt of Final Proposal Revisions.</p>
<p>Past Performance</p>
<p>Past Performance will be evaluated paying particular attention to:</p>
<p>i) The relevance of the services provided to include staffing levels, labor categories, complexity, type of customer (Federal Government or private industry), and length of contract.<br />ii) The offeror's ability to provide qualified staff in a timely manner.<br />iii) The offeror's ability to maintain qualified staffing levels or provide replacements quickly as needed.<br />iv) The offeror's ability to provide qualified staff which will successfully pass all required background investigations, to include stringent financial qualifications.</p>
<p>References</p>
<p>References which provide past performance questionnaires may be contacted. The Government may also consider other information available, including personal knowledge. The dates of the prior performance and the relevance of the work performed shall be considered.</p>
<p>Reference information will be used to assure best value to the Government. The Government will focus on information that demonstrates a proven track record, quality of performance relative to the size and complexity of the procurement under consideration. Performance by the offeror and its subcontractor(s) as it relates to project requirements, including the quality of services, personnel management, effectiveness of cost management/control, timeliness of performance, customer satisfaction, and accurate invoicing will be evaluated.</p>
<p>References other than those identified by the offeror may be contacted by the Government with the information received and used in the evaluation.</p>
<p>Resumes</p>
<p>Resumes will be evaluated paying particular attention to:</p>
<p>i) Qualifications as required by the PWS and Federal Regulation.<br />ii) Past and/or present obtained security clearances. Those offerors who can provide candidates which presently possess active clearances will be ranked higher.<br />iii) Qualifications of proposed key personnel.</p>
<p>Quality Control Plan</p>
<p>The offeror's Quality Control Plan will be evaluated to determine if the document describes the anticipated inspection system for the requested services listed in the PWS. The plan must identify, prevent, and ensure non-recurrence of defective services.</p>
<p>Price</p>
<p>The contractor will be selected upon a determination by the Agency that it is the best qualified to provide the services required by this procurement and that also meets the pricing constraints of the Agency. Before the offeror's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer) whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>
<p>Proposed loaded hourly rates shall be evaluated against market research, past similar requirements, and the Federal Government pay scale to determine realism and reasonableness.</p>
<p>QUOTATION SUBMISSION</p>
<p>Please contact Contracting Officer Melissa Capitani at melissa.capitani@sba.gov with any questions. All questions must be submitted in writing. E-mail message is acceptable.</p>
<p>All offers must be received by 10:00 am Mountain Standard Time on Thursday, August 23, 2012 at: US Small Business Administration, 721 19th Street, Suite 234, Attn: Melissa Capitani, Denver, CO 80202.</p>

<DESC>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>
<p>BASIS FOR AWARD:<br />Award will be made to the responsible, technically acceptable quoter, whose quote, conforming to the combined Synopsis/Solicitation, offers the lowest evaluated price.</p>
<p><br />SHIP &amp; BASE ACCESS <br />Vendors are responsible for correctly submitting forms/applications. Vendors are encouraged to monitor email using "Request a Read Receipt" function and to confirm receipt of facsimile transmissions.</p>
<p>Due to enhanced security measures, ship and base access is required for pre-award ship visits (e.g. ship-check) and for contract performance. Specifically the following permissions are required:</p>
<p>1. El Paso Intelligence Center (EPIC) personnel screening requirement<br />2. Base/Repair Facility Access Request<br />3. Vehicle Access Request<br />4. Ship Access List (vendor-provided)</p>
<p>All forms are available for download on the MSC contracts webpage at http://www.msc.navy.mil. Click on "Contracts" in the upper right corner. "EPIC template" is under "Reference" subheading. Click on "Online Library of Common Documents" for all other forms.</p>
<p>EPIC: Required for access to MSC vessels. Complete EPIC form strictly adhering to format requirements and forward to (CONUS East Coast repairs) MSFSC(underscore)EPIC(underscore)EAST@navy.mil and (CONUS West Coast and HI repairs) MSC.SSUSD.EPIC@NAVY.MIL. EPIC personnel screening requests are desired seven calendar days prior to performance start date. Requests will be managed as expeditiously as circumstances permit. Vendor will be notified by MSFSC of personnel who are denied access to the vessel.</p>
<p>Base/Repair Facility Access: Permit is required to access Navy facilities. Base/Repair Facility Access Request is desired seven days prior to ship check or performance start date. Submit forms per the document instruction and to the Port Engineer. A courtesy copy (CONUS West Coast performance locations only) to Ermanno Magliulo, Engineering Director, at ermanno.magliulo@navy.mil will be appreciated.</p>
<p>RAPIDGate&reg; is being implemented for access to DoD facilities in CONUS, HI, Guam and Puerto Rico. Vendor is responsible to acquire RAPIDGate&reg; status and destination base individual access badge(s) activation prior to performance start date. Delays that may result from inadequate planning are contractor responsibility. Vendor instructions and program information is available at http://www.RAPIDGate.com or tel. 877.727.4342. RAPIDGate&reg; access requires (in succession) (1) Individual Base Commander approval for vendor to access base, (2) Successful vendor RAPIDGate&reg; company annual enrollment, (3) Company employee individual enrollment and possession of RAPIDGate&reg; identification badge for single base or multiple base (enterprise) access. Vendor is responsible to confirm that each employee held annual RAPIDGate&reg; badge is active for the specific facility and performance period in accordance with RAPIDGate&reg; User Agreement (http://www.RAPIDGate.com).</p>
<p>Additional access permissions may be required such as Navy Base Point Loma "Enclave Access request form".</p>
<p>Vehicle Access: Required for vehicle access to Navy facilities. Follow supplemental instructions on Base Access forms or base-specific vehicle access forms.</p>
<p>Ship Access List* (Vendor-Provided): On company letterhead attachment via email, the vendor is required to provide the ship master (courtesy copy the Port Engineer) with an accurate, current list of performing personnel prior to being admitted aboard the vessel. Under no circumstances will a hand-delivered list be accepted.</p>

<p>i) Past performance shall consist of a narrative describing in detail, services of the same nature provided within the last five years.

Three examples of past performance are required.</p>

<p>Three paper sets of the proposal, an original so marked and two copies are required.</p>
<p>PROPOSAL EVALUATION</p>
<p>1. Initial Evaluation of Proposals</p>
<p>The Government reserves the right to make award without discussion based solely upon initial proposals. Therefore, offerors should ensure that their initial proposal constitutes their best offer in terms of both price and the technical/past performance/references/resumes. If required, the Contracting Officer may establish a competitive range comprised of the technically acceptable proposals. If the Contracting Officer determines that the number of proposals that would otherwise be in the competitive range exceeds the number at which an efficient competition can be conducted, the Contracting Officer may limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition amongst the most highly rated proposals. Only those offerors in the competitive range will be offered an opportunity to participate further in the procurement.</p>
<p>2. Discussions/Final Proposal Revisions (if appropriate/necessary)</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer will engage in discussions with all offerors in the competitive range in accordance with FAR 15.306. At the conclusion of the discussions, a final common cut-off date which allows a reasonable opportunity for submission of written final proposal revisions will be established. Those offerors selected to remain in the competitive range will be notified to submit Final Proposal Revisions.</p>
<p>3. Final Evaluation of Offers (if appropriate)</p>
<p>A final proposal evaluation will be performed after receipt of Final Proposal Revisions.</p>
<p>Past Performance</p>
<p>Past Performance will be evaluated paying particular attention to:</p>
<p>i) The relevance of the services provided to include staffing levels, labor categories, complexity, type of customer (Federal Government or private industry), and length of contract.<br />ii) The offeror's ability to provide qualified staff in a timely manner.<br />iii) The offeror's ability to maintain qualified staffing levels or provide replacements quickly as needed.<br />iv) The offeror's ability to provide qualified staff which will successfully pass all required background investigations, to include stringent financial qualifications.</p>
<p>References</p>
<p>References which provide past performance questionnaires may be contacted. The Government may also consider other information available, including personal knowledge. The dates of the prior performance and the relevance of the work performed shall be considered.</p>
<p>Reference information will be used to assure best value to the Government. The Government will focus on information that demonstrates a proven track record, quality of performance relative to the size and complexity of the procurement under consideration. Performance by the offeror and its subcontractor(s) as it relates to project requirements, including the quality of services, personnel management, effectiveness of cost management/control, timeliness of performance, customer satisfaction, and accurate invoicing will be evaluated.</p>
<p>References other than those identified by the offeror may be contacted by the Government with the information received and used in the evaluation.</p>
<p>Resumes</p>
<p>Resumes will be evaluated paying particular attention to:</p>
<p>i) Qualifications as required by the PWS and Federal Regulation.<br />ii) Past and/or present obtained security clearances. Those offerors who can provide candidates which presently possess active clearances will be ranked higher.<br />iii) Qualifications of proposed key personnel.</p>
<p>Quality Control Plan</p>
<p>The offeror's Quality Control Plan will be evaluated to determine if the document describes the anticipated inspection system for the requested services listed in the PWS. The plan must identify, prevent, and ensure non-recurrence of defective services.</p>
<p>Price</p>
<p>The contractor will be selected upon a determination by the Agency that it is the best qualified to provide the services required by this procurement and that also meets the pricing constraints of the Agency. Before the offeror's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer) whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>
<p>Proposed loaded hourly rates shall be evaluated against market research, past similar requirements, and the Federal Government pay scale to determine realism and reasonableness.</p>
<p>QUOTATION SUBMISSION</p>
<p>Please contact Contracting Officer Melissa Capitani at melissa.capitani@sba.gov with any questions. All questions must be submitted in writing. E-mail message is acceptable.</p>
<p>All offers must be received by 10:00 am Mountain Standard Time on Thursday, August 23, 2012 at: US Small Business Administration, 721 19th Street, Suite 234, Attn: Melissa Capitani, Denver, CO 80202.</p>

<DESC>QUESTION 18: During the pre-bid conference for the rebid of the captioned solicitation on 1/25/13 it was observed that some of the contractors in attendance do not reside in, or primarily do business in, other counties or states outside the geographic area covered in the FEMA Major Disaster Declaration No. 4085-DR-NY. In order to respond to the solicitation these companies will have to partner with a small business firm located within the geographic area in order to qualify. Is this permitted?<br />ANSWER 18: Yes<br />QUESTION 19: If it is permissible for nonresident contractors to submit a bid, will the evaluation of the bidder's credentials be based on the resident small business contractor and its financial capabilities or on the nonresident contractor's? (which in essence will circumvent the desired outcome to award the solicitation to a small business within the geographic area).<br />ANSWER 19: Proposals will be evaluated based on their merit.<br />QUESTION 20: Will the ability to obtain a performance bond be based on the resident small business contractor's financial capabilities or the nonresident contractor's? <br />ANSWER 20: No.<br />

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS (IF &gt;$25K)</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).</p>
<p>Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>
<p>THE FOLLOWING DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY ACQUISITION REGULATION CLAUSES ARE HEREBY INCORPORATED</p>
<p>This contract incorporates the following clauses by reference with the same force and effect as if<br />they were given in full text.

<DESC>This is a sources sought notice only.   <br>    <br>  All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency.  <br>    <br>  The Natick Soldier Research, Development and Engineering Center (NSRDEC) is issuing a source sought notice to identify potential devices that can aid in a scientific inquiry to vary and manipulate redistribution of Soldier torso-borne loads (i.e. the body armor and attached equipment) which are primarily borne by the shoulders to other surface areas on the torso. One essential component of the device is that it has the ability to vary the degree of re-distribution of the load  <br>    <br>  DESCRIPTION  <br>    <br>  NSRDEC is interested in systematically manipulating the distribution of torso-borne loads, which are typically borne by the shoulder and upper back. We are also interested in determining an optimal distribution of the load on the torso that leads to improved performance and mobility and an increase in comfort. To do so, we need to obtain a device that would allow us to redistribute the torso-borne loads (ranging from 30 lbs to 120 lbs) which currently are primarily borne by the shoulders to other surface areas on the torso (i.e. shoulder, pelvis, chest, mid back). We prefer the technology be easily placed under or integrated within the military equipment (i.e. body armor, pack, and attached equipment). Adjustability of the device to accommodate various size individuals is also preferred.  Ideally,  the device will also have the ability to vary the degree of re-distribution of the load. This device must be comfortable enough to be worn for periods lasting up to 3 hours. Our end goal is to determine if there is an optimal distribution of the load on the torso that results in an increase in performance and comfort. Sources are only sought for the available technology that would allow NSRDEC to redistribute the torso-borne equipment worn from the primary location, shoulders, to other areas on the torso. NSRDEC will then utilize the device within an internal human use approved protocol(s) to conduct research with volunteers.  <br>    <br>  Period of Performance: 01 March 2013 - 30 June 2013. The technology provider shall provide services that include:  <br>    <br>  1.	Detailed specifications of technology and any known limitations.    <br>  2.	Photo images of the device from multiple angles.  <br>  3.	Ease of Use: The NSRDEC reserves the right to evaluate the performance of the technology, via live demonstration, and will also examine the ease of use of the system prior to award. The live demonstration, if required, will take place at the US Army Soldiers System Command, Natick, Massachusetts.    <br>    <br>  Parameter Recommendation:  <br>    <br>  1.	Safe to place on human volunteers.  <br>  2.	Easily and comfortably placed between the upper body of the human and the military equipment being worn (i.e. load carriage equipment, body armor, etc.) or easily integrated within the US Army's current body armor system.  <br>  3.	Ability to vary the degree of re-distribution of the load would be optimal  <br>  4.	 Ability to redistribute the load to multiple areas on the torso would be beneficial (i.e., shoulder, pelvis, chest, mid back).  <br>  5.	Adjustability of the device to accommodate a range of body sizes is preferred.  <br>  6.	Comfortable and durable enough to carry torso-borne loads ranging from 30 lbs to 120 lbs for prolonged periods (3 hours).  <br>  7.	Should not restrict mobility of the upper body allowing for normal Soldier tasks to be performed (i.e., walking, running,  low crawl, high crawl, shouldering a weapon, throwing, dive to prone, clearing obstacles, etc.).  <br>    <br>  RESPONSES  <br>    <br>  All interested firms and manufacturers, regardless of size, are encouraged to respond to this request for information. Information submissions should include available technology, product literature, and relevant company background/experience. Please provide product pricing as part of the information submission.   <br>    <br>  Information submissions must be received by 01 March 2013. Responses to this notice should be directed to karen.n.gregorczyk.civ@mail.mil. Responses should include information on their product(s) and how they might address the Military requirement. All information supplied will be considered confidential, unless otherwise specified by the firm or available from other sources without restriction. This sources sought is for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute an Invitation for Bid (IFB) or a Request for Proposal (RFP) and is not to be taken as a future commitment by NSRDEC.  <br>    <br>  All respondents shall include all of the information listed below in the response email:  <br>    <br>  1. Company name and Solicitation number in the email subject line.  <br>  2.  Company address, telephone number, primary contact(s) with e-mail address(es), NAICS code(s), business size (i.e., small/large/HUB Zone), CAGE code, and DUNS number. (Respondents must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database in order to obtain a DUNS number. Firms may register with CCR at http://www.sam.gov.)  <br>  3.  Product detailed descriptions and how it addresses our Military requirement. This can also include current or past performance of providing these products to the Government.  <br>  4.  Estimated cost, minimum and maximum delivery schedule, and any anticipated discounts.  <br>  5.  Proposed dates available for demonstration of technology at NSRDEC.   <br>  6.  If applicable a GSA Schedule.  <br>  7. All assumptions, including any assumed Government support.  <br>    <br>  Interested sources must reply no later than 01 March 2013.

<DESC>Pursuant to the National Park Service Concessions Management Improvement Act of 1998, Public Law 105-391, the Director of the National Park Service may award non-competitive temporary concession contracts for consecutive terms not to exceed three years in the aggregate.
Through a lease held by National Park Foundation, the National Park Service (Service) has provided non-motorized boat rental and storage services in Rock Creek Park on the Georgetown Waterfront since transferred from the District of Columbia to the National park Service in 1999. 
The Service anticipates awarding a temporary concession contract for non-motorized boat rental and storage services.  The Service may award one temporary concession contract and by law, the term of temporary concession contract may be one year, two years, or three years or any combination thereof, but not to exceed 3 years.
The National Capital Region (NCR) issues this REQUEST FOR QUALIFICATIONS (RFQ) to determine if an interested operator is qualified to provide non-motorized boat rental and storage services as described in the draft Temporary Concession Contract, including all Exhibits, that accompanies this RFQ.  The Service is issuing this RFQ to obtain information about the experience and financial capability of entities seeking to provide the non-motorized boat rental and storage services.  While responses do not constitute offers, the Service plans to rely, in part, on the information provided as a basis for selecting the temporary concessioner.  The prospectus and a synopsis of the business opportunity will be available on the National Park Service Concessions website at:  <http://www.concessions.nps.gov/prospectuses.htm>
This RFQ does not constitute a REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS (RFP), nor does this RFQ constitute an offer, either expressed or implied.

<DESC>UPDATE 28 January 2013: Below is a question received from industry regarding the subject RFI and the Government's response:  Q:) Currently, only two contractors have access to KGV-135A devices.  What option is the government considering to allow other contractors, who don't have access to these cryptographic devices, to bid compliant solutions?  A:) The Government does not believe that any vendor needs access to the COMSEC chip/device in order to propose a compliant solution.  However after award determination, the Government will provide the COMSEC chip/device as GFE on the contract to the successful offeror only.  *********************************************************** UPDATE 08 January 2013  The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWAR) in support of the Program Management Warfare / Airborne (PMW/A) 170 is seeking comments from industry on the draft System Performance Specification (SPS) and appendices in preparation for the Network Tactical Common Data Link (NTCDL)acquisition.  THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY.

<SUBJECT>V--Research Vessel Charter for Walrus Tagging Mission
<SOLNBR>G13PS00106
<NTYPE>PRESOL
<RESPDATE>021113
<ARCHDATE>03132013
<CONTACT>Donald Shannon
<DESC>The U. S. Geological Survey (USGS) is interested in chartering an offshore research vessel capable of working in broken sea ice to support a walrus radio-tagging project in the northern Chukchi Sea for a maximum of 14 days between July 11  and 25 2013.  Actual trip timing and length will depend on the weather and sea ice and the billing will reflect actual charter days.  The work area will be the northeastern Chukchi Sea at the southern edge of the retreating pack ice.  The vessel will support two workboats in performing the science mission: One workboat will be outfitted and provided by USGS (USGS owned and equipped workboat) and must be loaded onto the charter vessel from a port with road access near Anchorage, Alaska.  A second (similarly outfitted) workboat will be provided by the contractor.  The vessel will be required to transit to Nome, or other appropriate port near the target field work, board the science crew, and continue to the work area for arrival to the work area by about July 14, 2013.  The estimated location of the initial target area will be 150 nautical miles west of Barrow, but is ultimately dependent on sea ice conditions at the time.  The vessel will operate within the sea ice margin.  Radio-tagging will occur for up to 10 days, and then the vessel will return the science crew to the nearest suitable logistics base, with a preference for Wainwright or Nome.  The vessel will provide transportation and support for the science crew of up to 9 people working for USGS, as well a suitable workboat and boat operator experienced in small boat handling offshore in sea ice.  Detailed requirements for vessel, Captain, and crew as well as furuther details are contained in the solicitation.
Please Note: Responses and offers to this solicitation shall be via email to the buyer listed herein and in the solicitation.  Responses and offers submitted via FedConnect are not reliable and may not be received by the buyer.  Please email your offer to the Buyer to insure your offer is received and considered.
This is a 100% small business set-aside and the procurement will be conducted under FAR Part 12 - "Acquisition of Commercial Items".  Offers from other than small business will not be considered for award.  All offerors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) to be eligible for awaard (formerly CCR and ORCA).  Place of Performance:  Anchorage, AK north to the Chukchi Sea, southern edge of the retreating pack ice.  Contact the Buyer if you have questions or require further information: Don Shannon,  dshannon@usgs.gov (916) 278-9342.

<DESC>Background
<p>The U.S. Department of State's Foreign Service Institute is Federal Government's training institution. It is responsible for providing opportunities for officers and support personnel of the U.S. foreign affairs community to prepare for work as American diplomats and other professions in the advancement of U.S. foreign affairs both domestically and abroad. Under the HR LOB/HRD, FSI has been designated as the preferred eLearning content provider for agencies requiring training content for the foreign affairs community. USAID is one such federal agency making use of these services in their solicitation for commercially-produced online English language services.</p>
<p>Many of USAID's staff positions overseas require a certain level of business English. Classroom training was found to be cost prohibitive. Individual USAID missions sought to partner with dozens of different vendors worldwide, resulting in inconsistent training outcomes that were impossible to measure. While USAID regularly hires local staff with a basic understanding of English derived from traditional schooling, such training must be supplemented with business-level training, which includes USAID-specific vocabulary.</p>
<p>Objectives<br />On behalf of USAID, the Foreign Service Institute is in search of a language training vendor that provides annual subscriptions for a library of English language instruction and support which can interoperate with the agency's in-house learning management system. This collection should be customizable so as to satisfy most of the basic and mandatory language training required for employees to maintain and enhance those English skills required for many USAID positions. All work performed by the contractor under this Statement of Work (SOW) shall be subject to the technical direction, approval and oversight of FSI's Contracting Officer (CO) and the authorized Contracting Officer's Representative (COR).</p>
<p>Requirements<br />This language learning tool should provide on-demand support of various professional tasks performed in English such as composing emails, getting translation support, etc. Features must include graphics, animation, applets, music, video, and audio. It should also include a skills proficiency measurement tool; such assessment tool must have the ability to be administered by USAID staff, not by an outside testing vendor.</p>
<p>The program must include an administrative system which allows USAID to assign one "administrator" to oversee the program on a worldwide scale, while concurrently, in-country staff can identify users and monitor usage within their post. Such a structure will allow the administration of a global program that spans over 50 countries and 700 concurrent users. The number of localized interfaces should be sufficient enough to ensure that the majority of USAID's users are able to navigate the service in their native language and must include the following languages at a minimum: Czech, German, French, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Chinese, Japanese, Polish, Korean, Russian, and Turkish.</p>
<p>USAID has a litany of words and acronyms that are specific to the organization. These words and acronyms are not anything a new hire will have learned about in previous careers, and are especially confusing to non-native English speakers. The system must have a customizable word/acronym program which houses organization-specific vocabulary in a central repository with a global reach.</p>
<p>The program should be Windows and Mac compatible. Content should have the flexibility of either being loaded into a proprietary learning management system or being "portalled" through such a system to the provider's site.</p>
<p>The system should be able to generate activity reports which provide the following data:</p>
<p>&bull; Top Users<br />&bull; Overall User Progress<br />&bull; Summary of User Activity (e.g., active/inactive; usage by language level; new user access)</p>

<DESC>The United States Department of Veterans Affairs, Veterans Health Care Administration, Network Contracting Office (NCO) 17 is hereby publishing a notice of intent to award a sole source contract to Valor Healthcare, Inc.,  a wholly owned subsidiary of Humana Government Business, Inc. 500 West Main Street, Louisville, KY 40202, a large business.  The North Texas Veterans Health Care System located in Dallas, Texas has a current community Based Outpatient Clinic to provide primary medical care services and ancillary medical care services to veteran patient beneficiaries within the local Denton, Texas catchment area.  Community Based Outpatient Clinics or CBOCS are established within geographical catchment areas that have an established veteran patient population outside of the greater metropolitan areas that larger VA Medical Centers are normally located.  CBOCS allow veterans greater access to care and take away the burden of traveling to larger cities often hours from their homes.  COBOC often provide shorter waiting periods to receive care.  The Denton, TX CBOC is currently owned and operated by Valor Healthcare, Inc. This six month contract is awarded on the basis of Unusual and Compelling Urgency, FAR 6.302-2.  The amount of the contract is an estimated $1,184,742.00.  The contract is a firm fixed price indefinite delivery indefinite quantity contract since it is not possible to accurately predict the absolute amount of veteran patients seeking care at the Denton, TX CBOC, currently the estimated population is 6100 veteran beneficiaries.  A request for quote/request for proposal will not be made available as this is a direct sole source award to Valor Healthcare, Inc.  Direct Patient care cannot be interrupted at any time.  This award allows for non-interruption in the healthcare of veteran beneficiaries living within the Denton, TX catchment area.

<DESC>PR Newswire Service (Awd Amount: $3,820)<br />I. Contracting Activity
<p>Tricare Management Activity, Contracting Operations Division-Falls Church (COD-FC) is the contracting organization responsible for this individual justification for other than full and open competition. The Contracting Officer is Millie A. Mitchell. <br /><br />II. Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Approved</p>
<p>This justification and approval (J&amp;A) authorizes an exception to the Fair Opportunity Process IAW FAR 6.302-1(b)(1)(i) to utilize the PR Newswire Service</p>
<p>III. Description of the Supplies/Services Required to Meet the Agency's Needs<br />PR Newswire provides electronic distribution, targeting, measurement and broadcasting services on behalf of tens of thousands of corporate, government, association, non-profit and other customers worldwide. Using PR Newsire these organizations reach a variety of critical audiences including the news media, investment community, government decision makers and the general public with their up to the minute full text news developments. Utilizing the latest in communications technology, PR Newswire content is considered the mainstay among individuals who seeking breaking news from the source. DCoE T2 plans to use PR Newswire to secure media advertisement and targeted public media outlet hub for their announcement of a mobile App for Prolonged Exposure to PTSD (Post Traumatic Stress Disorder).</p>
<p>Manufacturer Description<br />PR Newswire US 1 National Newsline (End to End news distribution service) <br />PR Newswire Time Square Assignment Photography and Internet Photo Distribution (Multimedia distribution)<br />PR Newswire Media Microlist- Psychiatry, Psychotherapy, Psychology, Military, Mobile Apps, Telecommunications, Pentagon, Healthcare Policy, Government and Policy <br />(Distribution lists that target specific segments to ensure the message reaches the right audience)</p>
<p>IV. Statutory Authority Permitting Other Than Full and Open Competition</p>
<p>IAW FAR 6.302-1(b)(1)(i) the order must be issued on a sole-source basis because the services requested are only available from PR Newswire which has unique capabilities over their competitors.</p>
<p>V. Demonstration that the Contractor's Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use of the Authority Cited Above (Applicability of Authority)</p>
<p>This exception to fair opportunity is issued on a sole-source basis due to the item being peculiar to one manufacturer. PR Newswire was established in 1954 and has offices in 14 countries routinely sending its customers' news to outlets in more than 170 countries and in more than 40 languages. An independent study of commercial newswires found that PR Newswire gets used by media more often than its competition and generates more clips when they are picked up. The study found that press releases transmitted by PR Newswire were used 55% of the time versus its competitors (Marketwire: 43%, Business Wire: 38%, and Globe Newswire: 37%). PR Newswire also had the highest volume of coverage for releases attracting attention by the media with nearly twice the pickup frequency of its competitors. Pickup frequency is the number of times a single press release was reported in the media and is an important factor when trying to reach a large audience. Without the use of PR Newswire, the target beneficiary audience would not be reached and the President's and Secretary of Defense's goal of identifying and reducing PTSD would not be reached.</p>
<p>VI. Description of Efforts Made to Ensure that Offers are Solicited From as Many Potential Sources as Deemed Practicable<br />PR Newswire is the sole source provider of commercial newswire services from PR Newswire. The customer looked at the marketplace for other potential sources but no other vendor came close in terms of effectively targeting specific audiences and pickup frequency.</p>
<p>VII. Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable<br />The price will be fair and reasonable based on historical comparison of past prices paid on GPC orders. The customer submitted copies of past invoices on previous GPC purchases of PR Newswire services. Those previous purchases were determined fair and reasonable and made in accordance with Tricare's GPC policy. Pricing for those purchases is comparable to the anticipated price from PR Newswire. A copy of the Pricing Guide for PRNewswire dated January 1, 2011 and another dated June 2012 shows pricing has remained constant for many of the services. For those items that increased in price it is annotated clearly in the extended descriptions that there is an increase in the availability of media content from the previous year. <br />VIII. Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results or a Statement of the Reasons Market Research was not Conducted<br /><br />Business Wire, Market Wire and Globe Newswire are the only other commercial newswires on the national scale available but they focus primarily on the investment community. If a commercial newswire other than PR Newswire was utilized instead the effectiveness of reaching the targeted audience would be substantially decreased.</p>
<p>IX. Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition</p>
<p>None.</p>
<p>X. List of Sources, if any, that Expressed Interest in the Acquisition</p>
<p>None.</p>
<p>XI. A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome any Barriers to Competition Before Making Subsequent Acquisitions for the Supplies or Services Required</p>
<p>DCoE T2 will continue to monitor the marketplace to determine whether other commercial newswires can satisfy the government's requirement.</p>
