<DESC>The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is soliciting research proposals in the area of Radio Frequency Analog Spectral Processors.  Proposed research should investigate innovative approaches that enable revolutionary advances in science, devices or systems.  Specifically excluded is research which primarily results in evolutionary improvement to the existing state of practice 

DARPA seeks innovative proposals in the following areas:  Tunable RF filters and filter banks, RF switches, and high-speed high-performance component integration strategies. Advances in these areas will be applied towards the realization of a compact low-power RF front-end for handheld communications applications. 

Additional information on these technology areas is provided in the BAA 06-08 Proposer Information Pamphlet referenced below.

PROGRAM SCOPE

Awards are expected to be made during the first half of calendar year 2006.  Multiple awards are anticipated.  Collaborative efforts/teaming are encouraged.  A web site — http://www. http://teaming.sysplan.com/asp – has been established to facilitate formation of teaming arrangements between interested parties.  Specific content, communications, networking, and team formation are the sole responsibility of the participants.  Neither DARPA nor the Department of Defense (DoD) endorses the destination web site or the information and organizations contained therein, nor does DARPA or the DoD exercise any responsibility at the destination.

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICIATION. The purpose of this Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) is to solicit proposals for the Department of Defense (DoD) during Fiscal Year 2006 and possible future years Medical Science and Technology (S&T) Chemical and Biological Defense Transformational Medical Technologies Initiative (TMTI).  The DoD conducts a vigorous medical research and development program in chemical and biological defense with the goal of protecting the warfighter from disease and biological and chemical warfare agents.  The CBDP seeks to develop counter-measures that can be brought into acquisition and fielded worldwide.  These products must be regulatory compliant, robust, and highly effective at a reasonable cost.  Successful candidates must demonstrate a clear path to regulatory approval, production and end user utility.  They must all be amenable to use in a military environment.

This BAA is focused on developing medical counter-measures to ermerging threats, genetically engineered and nontraditional toxins, virulence factors and microorganisms as biological warfare (BW) threat agents.  An important consideration is a more expedient approach and/or a shorter timeline to advanced development for a potential product.  It is anticipated that these counter-measures would include pre-treatments (including vaccine enhancement technology), therapeutics and basic science to characterize the nature of the threat and identify key targets for intervention or disruption of these agents.  The agent classes that are to be focused on are: intra-cellular bacterial pathogens, hemorrhagic fever viruses and bioregulators. 

Approaches to the objectives for this area include studying the genetic diversity and pathogenicity of natural isolates, identifying common structural elements of specific agents or classes of agents (preferred), elucidating common virulence mechanisms (such as type III secretory proteins), identifying functional domains in toxins and virulence factors, and using this information to develop rapid and effective medical countermeasures protecting against genetically engineered or emerging BW threats.

The MMS is an upper air Meteorol ogical (MET) data collection, processing and dissemination system, which provides data to the field artillery target acquisition and air weather services to improve their mission capability. The MMS works in conjunction with radiosondes, carried aloft by b alloons, to provide barometric pressure, relative humidity, temperature, wind speed and wind direction measurements to an altitude of 30km above the earths surface. The system is capable of operating in any climatic area and over any type terrain. It can sound the atmosphere at hourly intervals over extended periods of time and automatically transmits almost real time data in the format of the user. The current source for this systems components is Smiths Detection, Inc. Suppliers capable of furnishing an y components or spares must so indicate, by writing to Commander, USACECOM, ATTN: AMSEL-LC-IEW-C-SN, Building 1201E, Ft Monmouth, NJ  07703-5000.

This is a Market Survey to locate additional sources for spares for the AN/TMQ-52, Meteorological Measuring Set-Profiler (MMS-P) (NSN: 6660-01-479-1962). The MMS-P uses a suite of Meteorological (MET ) sensors and MET data from communications satellites along with an advanced weather model to provide highly accurate MET data out to a range of 500km.  Profiler measures and transmits MET conditions such as wind speed, wind direction , temperature, pressu re and humidity, rate of precipitation, visibility, cloud height and cloud ceiling. All of these are required for precise targeting and terminal guidance. Profiler enables artillery to have a greater probability of first round hit with indirect fire. For t he first time, the artillery community has the capability of applying MET data along the trajectory from the firing platform to the target area. The current source for this systems components is Smiths Detection, Inc.

<DESC>The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center, San Diego, intends to award an indefinite delivery-indefinite quantity type contract to Science and Technology Corporation (STC) of Hampton, VA.  The contract will be awarded pursuant to FAR 6.302-1: Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.  The contract will provide technical support for research, development, test and evaluation of new capabilities, components, and systems intended to enable bi-directional communication between a wide range of platforms deployed in Air, Land, or Marine environments.  Over a period of two years, the intended contractor shall examine signal (acoustic, optical, electrical) propagation phenomena and develop models for communication systems based on these studies.  STC is currently tasked under a sole source contract # N66001-00-D-5019, which was awarded on 26 September 2000.  The proposed contractor will be a follow on to N66001-00-D-5019.  Use of any other contractor would result in substantial duplication of costs and delays for the Government based on the specialized knowledge and experience acquired by STC under the prior contract.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. See numbered notes 22 and 26.

<DESC>The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) is planning to award three to eight contracts to organizations having the ability to serve as initial or Vanguard Centers for the National Children’s Study (NCS or Study).  Background information on the NCS is available at www.nationalchildrensStudy.gov.  The NCS is a large, long-term longitudinal study of environmental influences on children’s health and development.  This Study will explore a broad range of environmental factors, both helpful and harmful, that influence the health and development of children.   For this Study, environment is broadly defined to include biological, chemical, physical, social and behavioral influences on children.  The range of outcomes include, for example, obesity, diabetes and physical development; injuries; asthma; pregnancy-related outcomes; and, mental health issues.  Likewise, a wide range of environmental influences will be examined for their impact on children’s health and development.  These include, but are not limited to air pollutants, drinking water contaminants, soil and dust contaminants, dietary nutrients, dietary contaminants, parental occupational exposures, infectious and allergic agents, infections, genetics, and social and behavioral characteristics.  The Study’s goal is to better understand the role of how these factors, alone and in combination, affect or are associated with children’s health, disease and development.  The NCS will include a sample of approximately 100,000 children born in the U.S.  Enrolled women and, when possible, their partners will be assessed for a wide range of exposures and personal characteristics early in pregnancy or upon pre-pregnancy enrollment.  Monitoring of the mother’s exposures will continue throughout pregnancy to birth, and possibly beyond.  The child will then be followed for a wide range of health and developmental outcomes and NCS defined environmental exposures throughout childhood until at least 21 years of age.  In the initial phase of this Study, data will be collected in three to eight geographic areas in the United States, referred to as Initial or Vanguard Locations. Data collection in each Location will be conducted by a single Study center, referred to as the Vanguard Centers [the RFP clarifies the definitions and sampling approach]. Vanguard Centers will be expected to follow a common Study Protocol and will have primary responsibility for many aspects of the Study including, but not limited to, establishing community relationships and collection of data from Study participants and their environments. Additionally, the Vanguard Centers will pilot new Study procedures prior to incorporation of these procedures into the Study Protocol.  It is expected that additional contracts will be awarded to the full complement of 30-50 Study Centers when full funding for this effort becomes available in future years.  A SEPARATE SOLICITATION IS BEING RELEASED FOR A SINGLE, COMPETITIVELY AWARDED NCS COORDINATING CENTER (NCS-CC) – [see http://www.fedbizopps.gov listing for the National Children’s Study Coordinating Center].  Offerors for the Vanguard Centers must:  1) Demonstrate a clear understanding of the complexity of this Study, including the need for complex multi-level sampling strategies for selection of Study neighborhoods and participants within neighborhoods; the longitudinal nature of the data collection; the need to collect, process, and ship environmental samples and biologic specimens from multiple sites; and the need to collect interview data from multiple participants including pregnant women, fathers, and other primary caregivers, and children; 2) Demonstrate an ability to gain community support and input to optimize subject recruitment, retention, and dissemination of Study findings; 3) Provide evidence of the ability to identify, recruit, and enroll at least 2000 maternal-infant dyads over a 4-year enrollment period; 4) Provide evidence of the ability to collect, process and ship/transport biologic specimens from mothers, fathers, and offspring; and environmental specimens from the household and neighboring environment; 5) Provide evidence of the ability to enroll participants and collect Study specimens and information (environmental, interview, and biologic) prior to conception and early in pregnancy; 6) Demonstrate the ability to retain and follow Study participants from all socioeconomic groups, including the medically underserved.  [It is anticipated that measurements that require in-person contact will occur at least three times during pregnancy, around the time of delivery, approximately 3 additional times in the first year of life, annually until 4 years of age, and every 3-5 years until the age of 21 years.  Collection of interview data may occur at more frequent intervals.]; 7) Provide evidence of the ability to collect cord blood and the placenta at the time of delivery; 8) Provide evidence of understanding and experience in packaging and transporting biological and non-biological samples to a laboratories and repository(ies) from the Vanguard Center.  (Note: The NCS-CC will develop standard operating procedures in collaboration with the Study Centers.); 9) Provide evidence of the ability to perform a standardized examination of the newborn as well as other clinical and neurodevelopmental exams throughout childhood; 10) Provide evidence of the ability (equipment and expertise available) to perform, at least, 3-D fetal ultrasounds; Dual-energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA); Bioelectric Impedance Analysis (BIA); detailed developmental and psychometric assessments; placement, calibration and use of instruments to collect environmental samples, and other measures as selected in the development of the Study Protocol.; 11) Demonstrate previous experience in the implementation of Quality Assurance/Quality Control activities covering the collection of interview data; collection, storage, and shipping of biologic and environmental specimens; and collection of field observational data;  12) Provide evidence of qualified personnel to oversee all aspects of the Study, as outlined above; and, 13) Provide evidence of working with a centralized coordinating center in the development of protocols and procedures.

	The required service is defined as code 541710 under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS).  The Request for Proposal (RFP) will be available on or after November 16, 2004 through the web site at http://FedBizOpps.gov  (FBO). All potential offerors must also review the NCS Coordinating Center’s RFP, as found in the FBO.  This acquisition is NOT set-aside for small businesses, i.e., all capable organizations are invited to submit proposals.  A Pre-proposal Conference for the NCS Vanguard Centers’ solicitation will be held on November 30, 2004 at a site to be determined, in the Washington DC area.  The specifics of this Conference will be included when the RFP is issued/released.   Questions should be sent to Virginia A. DeSeau, Contracting Officer, at nichdcmb@mail.nih.gov or addressed to the same at NICHD, CMB, Executive Building, Suite 7A07, 6100 EXECUTIVE BLVD MSC 7510, BETHESDA MD  20892-7510  ( if sending by overnight carrier-- 6100 Executive Boulevard, Suite 7A07, Rockville, Maryland 20852), by fax to 301-402-3676 or by phone to (301) 435-6947.

<SUBJECT>J -- Fume Hood Face Velocity Readings, Inspections and Repairs
<SOLNBR>SB1341-06-Q-0040
<RESPDATE>111505
<ARCHDATE>11302005
<CONTACT>Joni Laster, Purchasing Agent, Phone 301-975-8397, Fax 301-975-8884, Email joni.laster@nist.gov - Albert  Petto Jr., Contract Specialist, Phone 301-975-6338, Fax 301-975-6319, Email albert.petto@nist.gov
<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in Gaithersburg, Maryland, 20899 has a requirement for face velocity readings to be obtained on all the fume hoods on site. A system check is also required to be performed on the pressurized side. Any deficiencies found shall be reported and if approved by the NIST authorized representative, repaired. Most hoods are served by a dedicated exhaust fan located in the attic level of the laboratory buildings. There is approximately 10 feet of positive pressure ductwork on the outlet side of each fan. Other hoods in the newer buildings are served by a general exhaust system. All interior positive pressure exhaust ducts shall be leak tested. NIST has approximately 545 fume hoods located in various buildings around the site. These hoods are used by scientists and researchers on a daily basis. Most of the hoods are used for a variety of tasks as determined by the needs of the user, the overall majority are for general purpose use; however, there are hoods used for radioactive materials, and acids.  

The Contractor shall provide all labor, equipment and material necessary to perform the following : (1) The contractor shall perform a visible observation and inspection of mechanical components, fans, ductwork and flex connections for each hood and shall verify the flow sensors are working properly; (2) The contractor shall identify any problems found with the hoods while performing this work, this information shall be submitted to the NIST authorized representative as each building is completed; (3) The contractor shall make repairs upon approval by the Contracting Officer as authorized via a written modification to the purchase order. 

The contractor shall obtain the face velocities on 380 fume hoods located in the laboratories of various buildings (excluding buildings 224, and 222) around the site. Readings must be obtained using a Shortridge Instruments Inc., Air Data Multimeter ADM-860 or newer version and the Velgrid Air Velocity Accessory shall also be used. The test shall be performed as outlined in the Shortridge Operating Instructions, dated 2/21/2003, Chapter 6.0, Section 6.5, titled: Velgrid Air Velocity, as included with the ADM-860. The Contractor is required to complete a grid sheet with average readings and the NIST form ED-2 for each hood tested. NIST shall provide these forms to the Contractor. These completed forms shall be submitted to the NIST authorized representative for record keeping purposes. The 73 fume hoods located in building 224 have already had the face velocity readings checked, however, a leak check of the positive pressurized ducts and inspection of mechanical components etc. shall still be performed. The awarded Contractor obtaining the face velocity readings shall provide at least three (3) hours of hands on training to the NIST HVAC personnel on the proper methods used for obtaining the readings and shall follow all instructions as outlined in the NIST PLANT DIVISION INSTRUCTIONS. (P.D.I.)


The Contractor’s National Environmental Balancing Bureau (NEBB) certified technician shall verify the proper mechanical operation of each fan. Contractor shall check for proper belt tension, check the condition of the scroll and bearings visually and audibly etc. Inspect the condition of the ductwork for leaks or torn flex connections etc.   The Contractor shall notify the NIST authorized representative upon completion of each building inspection and provide a written list of deficiencies. Upon a mutual agreement between the Contractor and the NIST authorized representative in regards to the actual repairs required are determined, the Contractor shall provide a written price quote for the repairs to include labor and materials (labor shall be quoted at an hourly rate) shall be provided to the NIST authorized representative. If the NIST authorized representative finds the price quote to be in order and the funds are presently available at that time for the repairs, a modification shall be processed to add the additional repair work to the purchase order. Once the modification is authorized by the Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall proceed with the repairs. Note: Upon completion of all repairs, The Contractor’s National Environmental Balancing Bureau (NEBB) certified technician shall verify the proper mechanical operation of each fan. Contractor shall obtain hood face velocity measurements and determine total CFM on each hood. The sash height should be at fourteen (14) inches whenever possible while this work is being performed. The data collected shall be recorded on NIST forms ED-2 and grid sheets. The Contractor shall verify the accuracy of the flow sensors at each hood.

Note: The Contractors technician performing the inspections, verifications and measurements must be certified by the National Environmental Balancing Board (NEBB). 

The following documents will be included in the solicitation package once posted: (1) Examples of the NIST Grid Sheets and ED-2 shall be included in the solicitation package; (2) Copies of the Shortridge Instruments Inc. operating instruction showing chapter 6.0, Section 6.5; and (3) A copy of the NIST P.D.I. 

Due to the fact that NIST obtains readings with the ADM-860, using the Velgrid Air Velocity Accessory, the Contractor shall use the equipment as specified within the requirements so all information can be collected and logged equally.  The ADM – 860 unit used must be NIST traceable. Contractor must provide documentation of NIST traceability to the NIST authorized representative upon request. All lab spaces must be checked for fume hoods as there is a potential that some new hoods may have been installed and others removed and may not be reflected on the current listing. The Contractor shall note any new hoods found that were not on the list and any fume hoods that are no longer in place.  Any new fume hoods that have been found that were not on the list shall be tested and logged. The NIST authorized representative must obtain a completed NIST form 899 from Plant divisions Safety Representative before any repairs to fans or duct shall be performed. All work shall be completed within four (4) months from the date of award of a purchase order.

The entire scope of work, requirements and evaluation factors will be addressed in the solicitation when issued. This procurement is being issued as a small business set aside.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command (USASMDC), in conjunction with the Joint Improvised Explosive Device (Defeat) Task Force (Joint IEDD-TF), intends to negotiate on a sole source basis a one year contact extension modification (January 1 , 2006, to December 31, 2006) to W9113M-04-C-0012, which is currently performed by Wexford Group International (WGI).  This contract modification will permit continued performance of current contract services support and enhancement integration of the Join t IEDD-TF in the analysis, assessment and training for counter IED operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, and other overseas locations, as well as the preparation of units scheduled for rotation into overseas Areas of Responsibility.  The purpose of this sole so urce contract modification extension is to allow sufficient time to develop and execute a follow-on competitive acquisition and is intended only as a bridge until the Government can award a competitive contract.  The effort to be performed under this conta ct modification involves direct support of operational forces conducting theater operations in Iraq and Afghanistan.  The U.S. Army Chief of Staff (CSA) directed the Army G3 to develop a response in support of the U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) efforts to mitigate and or defeat the emerging IED phenomenon.  In late 2003, the Army created the IED Task Force led by a flag officer to respond to the IED problem.  Recently, this task force was redesignated the Joint IEDD-TF by direction of the Deputy SECDEF and tasked with the mission of focusing all available DOD resources to counter this threat.  Given this directive, sustaining the existing contract support vehicle is essential to avoid inflicting significant harm to the government by unnecessarily forcing a s uspension of contractor support and diminishing the overall counter-IED effort.   WGI has established itself as the CENTCOM subject matter expert in dealing with the IED threat.  In CONUS, WGI provides significant training support to deploying units.  Mili tary and WGI Field Team members continually rotate back to CONUS and directly share the knowledge they have gained in theater with these deploying units. The relationship between the military and WGI Field Teams and Training Assistance Teams is interdepend ent and is directly correlated to the visible success in reducing the mortality rate among friendly forces.  To incur any break or disruption to the relationship between the Training Assistance Teams and the Field Teams is an unacceptable risk, and will mo st certainly  result in a  fragmented training program.  WGI possesses the needed expertise in the areas of counterinsurgency (CI) and counter terrorism (CT) and is the thread that ties this approach together.  If a different support contractor were introd uced at this juncture, an unnecessary interruption or delay would result for the schedule and performance of the mission Joint IEDD-TF.

<DESC>Support Services for Comprehensive Cost and Requirements (CCaR) System SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS (Not a Notice of Solicitation) This synopsis is issued to conduct market research for informational and  planning purposes only. This market survey is conducted to identify potential  sources capable of meeting the requirements of Aeronautical System Center,  Comptroller Directorate (ASC/FM), located at Wright Patterson AFB, OH 45433.  Services, detailed below, include providing a wide range of support related to  the use, operation, training, maintenance and improvement of the CCaR  application, in both Program Offices or Wings/Groups/Squadrons and at the  Staff level. ASC utilizes the client-server and web versions of CCaR, so  services required are applicable to both versions. Contractor support  personnel are expected to be expert in all facets of CCaR functionality and  operation. Contractor support personnel must also be familiar with the  applications and systems with which CCaR interfaces. Contractor support  personnel must demonstrate familiarity with:  DFAS BQ and MOCAS systems, and  Air Force CRIS, ConWrite + SMART systems. Contractor support personnel must be  capable of teaching all aspects of CCaR utilization to all ASC personnel, with  ability to recommend how CCaR should be employed to best support the unique  mission requirements of every ASC office. Contractor support personnel must  have a means of staying proficient with current CCaR functionality, which has  three major releases every year and maintenance releases once a month.  Responses must clearly address the ability to provide all services, identified  below. Contractor support personnel must have knowledge in Air Force  accounting + finance, financial management, contracts management and program  management, to include knowledge of DOD’s Planning, Programming, Budgeting,  Execution (PPBE) process and knowledge of Air Force Weapon System Acquisition  process, as CCaR supports a significant number of acquisition and functional  processes and products for both USAF and Foreign Military Sales. Contractor  support personnel must have a current security clearance at the Secret level.  ASC’s workload fluctuates over time and any responses must address the ability  to respond in a reasonable amount of time to additional requirements for  contractor support. Of particular importance, each response must clearly elucidate and expound  upon the approach, technique and any ancillary relationships, contract  agreements or vehicles, etc. which they have with Integrated Data Service  (IDS). IDS is the developer of CCaRS, and currently provides both maintenance,  change management, configuration control, design, development, testing and  installation of the CCaR application, all CCaR modules, Looking Glass data  warehouse for the client-server and web versions along with web part design,  development and test and installation of production software products.  Responses must clearly indicate how their employees acquire knowledge, skills,  abilities and training on all CCaR applications and related products.  Demonstration of a seamless process of working with IDS is paramount, as  contractor support personnel have been and are expected to be, very  knowledgeable and familiar with the CCaR application and related products.  Specifically address how employees receive training initially and continually  as major functionality releases occur three times a year. Specifically address  how contractor support personnel will work with USAF and FMS customers in  regards to problems, bugs, enhancements and in turn work with IDS for  resolution to problems and bugs. Also address the process by which contractor  support personnel will clearly communicate the functionality needs of their  customers. Contractor support personnel will be involved with testing new  functionality. Address the process by which prospective contractor support  personnel are evaluated for having an affinity to grasp new concepts, new  processes and new tools. Clearly demonstrate a seamless process between  yourself and IDS which shows how the Air Force will not be responsible for  managing the relationship between these parties in order to provide  outstanding customer support, resulting in successful utilization of CCaR to  support weapon system acquisition offices. Contractor support personnel must demonstrate an understanding of all  functionality as documented in the CCaR users’ manual. CCaR is a relational  database application. Contractor support personnel must understand how  relational databases function so they can properly configure and maintain the  database front end through the Supervisor’s screen processes, and instruct  their customers in the proper procedures for utilizing any of the  functionality inherent in the database. Clearly demonstrate an understanding of the following CCaR functionality on  the part of your company in general and specifically your employees, who would  be providing CCaR support.  Contractor support personnel need to understand  the following functionality so they are the CCaR expert within their assigned  office and have the ability to explain the functionality to their  customers/CCaR users. •	CCaR Modes •	Custom system tailoring •	Requirements Tracking •	Automated funding status •	Electronic workflow •	Funding document generation •	ABSS Interface •	BQ Interface

<DESC>NAICS Code: 334513   Amendment #3 Technical Questions Question #1:   The "shear force, stick-slip motion" is one type of measurement, while "tapping mode" and "sample compression" are another type.  Are both types required or only one or the other? Answer:  The option to perform both types  is requested as stated in the specs, "Capable of providing shear force, sample compression, and stick-slip motion for high resolution, true surface measurements (e.g. tapping mode AFM operation or operation mode with like capabilities). As a reminder the last day for technical questions is  Wednesday, November 02, 2005  Amendment #2 Technical Questions Question #1:  What are the specifications concerning the surface potential measurement requirement? Answer:  The EPA's  interests lie in the need to determine the surface charge of surfaces and see how the charge varies across a  surface.  The surface charge of a corroding metal, for example, is controlled by surface functional groups on the corrosion deposits that form and understanding how the charge changes across a surface might indicate differences in chemical composition.  The surface charge also plays an important  role in controlling the tendency of the surface to adsorb ions, and the attraction of colloids and attachment of bacteria to the surface.  Experiments designed to see how water chemistry changes the surface charge of metal surfaces, for example and other materials are planned.   Amendment  #1 Technical Questions Could the EPA clarify this portion of the Specifications:  "Capable of meeting the following specifications: electric field microscopy, life-mode capabilities (i.e. magnetic interactions versus topography). Capable of providing preferred simultaneous display of topography  image and cantilever oscillation." Question #1:  Does the use of an inexpensive oscilloscope meet the requirements of "display", as compared to an alterative of generating stored data, an acquisition of an image or map? Answer:  It might be best to use an example of an application:  The EPA looks  at metal corrosion products frequently and is interested to know whether certain areas of the corrosion deposits are magnetic and/or electrically conductive, as well as possessing  the need to obtain topography information.   For this requirement the EPA may also be interested to know whether the  materials are reactive with certain other materials or chemical functional groups.  Question #2:  Oscillating cantilever may destroy a tip. Is the requirement to have an oscillating cantilever? Answer: The EPA would like to possess the ability to use appropriate modified tips to answer the  questions of reactivity.   It is the EPA's understanding that the simultaneous display of topographic and cantilever oscillation images will permit a qualitative comparison to be made between the material properties of samples.  Basically, the EPA is looking for the capability of measuring both  height and amplitude for a comparison of the area between the two images.   The Last day for Technical Questions is Thursday November 02, 2005.   This is a combined synopsis/request for quote for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with  additional information included in this notice.

<DESC>MODIFICATION:  THIS IS A FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION.  ALL RESPONSIBLE SOURCES ARE PERMITTED TO COMPETE.  THIS IS NOT A SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE.  RESPONSE DATE IS NOVEMBER 14, 2005.  The Prescott National Forest plans to secure Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) multiple year contracts for professional surveying services as required for administration of National Forest System Lands in Northern Arizona.  The work will primarily involve surveying and marking property boundaries of land within the Prescott National Forest Proclamation Boundary, but may also include projects on the adjacent Kaibab and Coconino National Forests. 
The Forest Service anticipates award of approximately two IDIQ contracts with task orders issued estimated at approximately $5,000.00 to $30,000.00 with an estimated contract maximum of $150,000.00 per contract over the life of the contract.  An Arizona Registered Professional Land Surveyor must be assigned to each task order.  Only firms with Registered Professional Surveyor(s) licensed in the state in of Arizona will be considered.
Tasks include, but are not limited to, identification, monumentation and perpetuation of property corners and controlling corners for land surveys performed to locate property boundaries, boundary line posting and maintenance of previously posted lines. Work may include retracement of Rectangular Surveys of the Public Land Survey System, including section subdivision, as well as retracement of Homestead Entry Surveys and Mineral Surveys that will require the results of survey to be recorded in the public record. The projects may also include right-of-way surveys, topographic surveys, geodetic control, mapping and other incidental work normally associated with the survey profession. A map of the general work area (Northern Arizona) is available for ftp download by contacting rjjackson@fs.fed.us. 
Estimated award date is on or about November 1, 2005.  Individual task orders will be issued against each contract as needed to accomplish the work. Completion time will vary with each individual task order, and may be negotiated. The contracts will not preclude the Forest Service from using its own surveyors, or other surveying firms to perform surveys in the project area.

<DESC>The purpose of this posting is to specifically request information from industry regarding the proposed CLIN structure of the Book Personalization Operations, found in Section B.4.6 and Table B.7.   Questions/comments regarding other areas of the RFP will not be accepted at this time.   As currently structured, the book personalization operations CLIN contains graduated level of volume and requests a unit rate per passport at each level.   The Department of State envisions that at the beginning of each contract year, the contractor will be given a quantity estimate for the year, for example, the vendor may be told that the expected quantity is 4,500,000.    This estimate would be updated as needed  throughout the period of performance.    As passports are produced, the vendor would charge the government the unit price for the range 4,000,001 to 5,000,000.   The Department is contemplating an alternative structure where the vendor would offer a firm, fixed-price for a given capacity.  Using the example above, the vendor would offer $XXXXXX for 4,000,001 to 5,000,000 passports and would receive this amount regardless if 4,000,001 passports or 4,999,999 passports were needed.   Performance metrics and incentives/disincentives would ensure that the vendor is motivated to produce the maximum amount possible.  In this second scenario, the Department solicits feedback from industry on methods to compensate the vendor in the event the actual production exceeds the capacity ordered, e.g. the vendor is asked to actually print 5,225,000 books.    Comments are requested by 4:00 p.m. EST via e-mail to MejiaKJ at state dot gov.  NO PHONE CALLS WILL BE ACCEPTED AND MESSAGES LEFT WILL NOT BE RETURNED.

<SUBJECT>99--Electronic Flight Strip Demonstration
<SOLNBR>4450
<RESPDATE>110805
<CONTACT>Steve Manley, 202-385-8676
<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) Air Traffic Organization - Terminal Services Division (AT0-T) announces an opportunity for industry demonstration of Electronic Flight Strip (EFS) capabilities. This is a follow-on announcement to a July 28, 2005 market survey announcement published on the FAA Business Opportunities website.  That announcement provided background information for the proposed demonstration and was published in order to assess what industry capability currently exists.    The following companies responded to the market survey: 1.	Sensis Corporation 85 Collamer Crossing East Syracuse, NY 13057 2.	Frequentis 12530 Parklawn Drive, Suite 360 Rockville, MD 20852-1702 3.	Systems Atlanta, Inc P.O. Box 99 Lebanon, GA 30146 4.	Northrop Grumman Corporation Information Technology Federal Enterprise Solutions 12005 Sunrise Valley Drive Reston, VA 20191 5. 	Oracle Telecomputing Inc. 25 Industrial Avenue Carleton Place Ontario, Canada K7C 3V7 6.	Raytheon Airspace Management and Homeland Security 1001 Boston Post Rd Marlboro, MA 01752  As stated in the July 28, 2005 announcement, which can be retrieved under the FAA website archives, this is an opportunity for demonstration of Electronic Flight Strip equipment.  This is not an acquisition of equipment.  FAA will assess the results of the demonstration(s) and make a decision regarding FAA Electronic Flight Strip requirements, including the viability of an Electronic Flight Strip acquisition. .   The objective of this information request is to determine if it is in the best interest of FAA to proceed with informal demonstrations of Electronic Flight Strip equipment. One or more companies may  be selected for demonstration of equipment at a company facility.  Attachment 1 hereto contains areas of technical interest to the agency for the facility demonstration.   If the agency makes a determination that further demonstrations are merited beyond the company facility, the next phase will be to evaluate selected systems at the FAA Technical Center.  After successful completion of the Technical Center demonstration, one or more systems will be demonstrated at FAA operational sites.   This will be the only public announcement.  There will be no RFOs or related formal acquisition procedures.  FAA will announce who was selected for further evaluation.       The FAA intends to negotiate an "Other Transaction Agreement" with the some, all or none of the companies responding to this announcement.  That agreement will document the terms and conditions associated with the demonstration.  Any resulting agreement(s) issued under the "Other Transaction Authority (OTA) authorized by  PL 108-76, Section 183 and 49 U.S.C. 106(l) and (m), allows for  agreements and other transactions on such terms and conditions as the Administrator determines necessary.   Companies are requested to respond to the following information request: Each company is to submit information to illustrate how their system addresses or supports the below listed capabilities/features.  If the capability is not currently in the system the vendor may document how the capability would be included in their system in the near term. This information will be reviewed by the FAA.    1.

The US Department of Interior, through its Franchise Fund activity, GovWorks, is issuing this solicitation, Solicitation Number 0406RQ60105 on behalf of Department of Transportation, Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration.  This contract will procure technical, administrative, translation and interpretation support the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, DOT.  Consistent with the NAFTA's commitment to eliminate non-tariff barriers to trade and our overall efforts to facilitate implementation of the NAFTA truck and bus access provisions, the FMCSA is focused on implementing procedures that allow both U.S. and Mexican carriers to obtain IRP and IFTA credentials and allow the carriers to use the highways of each NAFTA country on an equal basis.  This effort provides the southern Border States the technical and administrative assistance they need to effectively implement procedures to issue credentials to Mexican carriers as the NAFTA access provisions are implemented and the carriers begin to operate beyond the border commercial zones.  Concurrently, the work encompassed within the contract will allow the States to continue to work towards a long-term solution that permits Mexico to become a member jurisdiction of IRP and IFTA and register Mexican motor carriers under the terms of the agreements and will provide the FMCSA and the States the opportunity to work towards a reciprocity arrangement with Mexico for U.S. carriers that will operate in Mexico. The resultant contract is anticipated to be Time-and-Material Contract Type. NAICS CODE: 541614		 PRODUCT CODE: R706 COMPETITION:  Full and Open Competition; Unrestricted.

5.  Construction debris must be removed from the site, and the construction area must be secured to the Center’s satisfaction at the end of each day.

7.  All work must meet the latest edition of Building Codes.
8.  The contractor shall at all times abide by the Center’s rules and regulations.
9.  The contractor will comply, as applicable, with the provisions of the Davis-Bacon Act, the Copeland Act, and the Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards Act.
10.  All materials, services and labor shall be warranted free for a period of one year.
11.  The contractor shall test and demonstrate the proper functioning of the caulking to the Center’s satisfaction.
12.  The contractor will provide and maintain competent and adequate supervision at the construction site to ensure that the complete work conforms to the approved plans and specifications and will furnish progress reports and such other information as may be required by the Center.
13.  The contractor will initiate and complete the work within the applicable time frame after receipt of approval of the Center.

HSAR 3009.104-75 PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES
[DEC 2003] 

(a) Prohibitions. 
Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause.  The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 

(b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
“Expanded Affiliated Group” means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for `at least 80 percent' each place it appears. 

“Foreign Incorporated Entity” means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 

“Inverted Domestic Corporation.” A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)— 

(1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 

(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held— 
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or 
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 

(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
“Person”, “domestic”, and “foreign” have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs 
(1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 

(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
(i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or 
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 

(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 

(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 

(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 

(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
(i) warrants; 
(ii) options; 
(iii) contracts to acquire stock; 
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and 
(v) others similar interests. 

(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. 

(f) Disclosure. 
By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296 of November 25, 2002. 

(g) If a waiver has been granted, a copy of the approved waiver shall be attached to the bid or proposal.

<DESC>Armed Forces Retirement Home – Washington
Statement of Work
Title V Operating Permit Compliance Services

The Armed Forces Retirement Home – Washington (AFRH) has a need for reporting activities associated with their Title V Operating Permit.  Under the scenario of fully outsourcing Title V compliance reporting activities, the contractor shall work directly with operations personnel at the facility to track compliance performance, gather the relevant data, and prepare all required reports for submittal to DC Air Quality Division.  The reduced compliance reporting burden for AFRH will comprise ensuring compliance with permit conditions, providing the necessary data for reporting, and signing and transmitting reports to DC Air Quality Division.  The following activity descriptions describe the required tasks that the contractor shall perform.

Facility Emissions Tracking Log – The emissions tracking log is the central tool for demonstrating compliance with the Title V operating permit.  AFRH operating personnel will provide emissions unit activity levels (i.e. boiler fuel usage, paint consumption, etc.) and the contractor shall maintain the tracking log on a monthly basis, to serve as a foundation for periodic reporting under the permit.

Quarterly Reports – The current Title V permit requires AFRH to submit quarterly reports to the DC Air Quality Division.  The reporting periods for quarterly reports are the first and third calendar quarters.  The reports are due by the 30th day of the month following the quarter period (April 30 and October 30).  AFRH operating personnel will provide the necessary data and attachments for these reports.  The contractor shall prepare the reports and transmit them to AFRH for signature and timely submittal by the designated responsible official.

Semi-Annual Report – The Title V permit requires AFRH to submit semiannual reports and compliance certifications to the DC Air Quality Division.  The reporting period for the semiannual report is the first six months of the calendar year.  The report is due by the 1st day of the second month following the six month period (August 1).  AFRH operating personnel will provide the necessary data and attachments for these reports.  The contractor shall prepare the reports and transmit them to AFRH for signature and timely submittal by the designated responsible official.

Annual Report and Compliance Certification – The Title V permit requires AFRH to submit an annual report and compliance certification to the DC Air Quality Division.  The reporting period is the calendar year.  The report and certification are due by February 1st for the previous calendar year.  AFRH operating personnel will provide the necessary data and attachments for these reports.  The contractor shall prepare the reports and transmit them to the AFRH for signature and timely submittal by the designated responsible official.

Mock Compliance Inspection – Representatives of the DC Air Quality Division conduct an annual Title V permit compliance inspection.  In preparation for this inspection, the contractor shall visit AFRH approximately two weeks prior to the scheduled inspection to conduct a mock inspection.  The purpose of this activity will be to confirm compliance of AFRH activities with the Title V permit conditions and to confirm that the necessary documentation for demonstrating compliance is available for the actual inspection by DC Air Quality Division.

Compliance Inspections Support – When the annual Title V permit compliance inspection is conducted by representatives of the DC Air Quality Division, the contractor shall be present to provide technical support and to assist the designated AFRH responsible official in answering questions. 

On-Call Support – The contractor shall maintain regular contact on the Title V compliance issues with the responsible official at AFRH.  In addition, if the responsible official is contacted by DC Air Quality Division about Title V compliance issues related to either the scheduled reporting tasks, or any other Title V related issue, the contractor shall be available by telephone as required, to support AFRH in addressing these issues.

Operating Hours - All work shall be done during normal AFRH operating hours, which are from 7:30 am until 4:00 pm Monday through Friday, excluding Federal Holidays.  The COTR or designated representative shall be available during normal AFRH operating hours.

-------------------------------------------------------

AMENDMENT TO RFQ -- CLARIFICATION -- 31 OCT 05:
(FOR PR F3QCCM5277A200)

Several questions arose from vendors regarding the recent SolidWorks software and training Request for Quote (RFQ), and below is a summary of the answers to those questions for your information and clarification.  

1)  The current 13 SolidWorks seats already being used by the government are on a network with a current subscription service.  The subscription is good for the FY06 annual maintenance period.        
 
2)  The 2005 version of the 13 seats is currently running with maintenance.  The latest version of the software is being requested in the RFQ along with maintenance.
 
3)  SolidWorks Office Premium - NO Routing and/or COSMOS are needed at this time.
 
4)  Each of the on-site training classes are to be taught to train 9 people at one time (not in separate groups).  There is no dedicated “training” facility for classes.  The training area does not have a screen, projector, or white board.      
 
5)  PDM Implementation Service on-site: 
-- the implementation is NOT to install the PDMWorks software for an existing configuration
-- the implementation is NOT to provide services to identify and implement scope of project for PDM life cycles and engineering change process.
