<DESC><span style="text-decoration: underline;">THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. <br /></span>This notice is for information and planning purposes only. In accordance with Part 10 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation, the Government is conducting market research to determine the availability and adequacy of potential business sources in providing a commercial item that meets the Government's requirements. This Request for Information (RFI) does not constitute a solicitation for bids or proposals and it is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government. The information herein is subject to change and in no way binds the Government to solicit for or award a competitive contract. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on FedBizOps website. Proprietary information will be accepted and handled appropriately. Responders should indicate which portions of their responses are proprietary and should mark them accordingly. The Government is not obligated to and will not reimburse the contractor for any costs associated with preparing or submitting a response to this notice and submittals will not be returned to the sender.<br />The primary customer is the United States Air Force (USAF) Security Forces (SF) units. <br />The purpose of this RFI is to identify, in industry, wide area detection capabilities (systems) that meet or exceed current Wide Area Detection (WAD) systems listed on the HQ AF/A7S approved equipment list. It is also expected that any products selected for further Government testing and qualification activities will satisfy the following criteria:
<p>Performance Requirements<br />The vendor shall setup and tune the system prior to turning over the equipment to the government for testing. Upon equipment turnover, the system will be expected to meet all of the following requirements without any further action permitted on the part of the vendor.</p>
<p>Detection</p>
<p>The WADS will be used to monitor an approach zone to an established perimeter. The approach zone starts at the exterior side of a legal boundary (fence or building wall) and radiates outward a minimum of 300 meters. The WADS will be primarily used to monitor wide, relatively flat, open areas an intruder would have to traverse to reach an established perimeter and provide situational awareness to the Security Forces.<br /><br />The WADS shall provide, at a minimum, a probability of detection (PD) of 70 percent at the 90 percent confidence level for distances between 0m and 300m for a person as small as 5ft. (1.5 meters) in height and 100lbs (45kg) in weight, or larger, running, jumping, walking, through the detection zones at speeds from 0.5 feet per second to 13 feet per second (0.15 meters per second to 4 meters per second)..</p>
<p>The WADS shall provide, at a minimum, a Pd of 70 percent at the 90 percent confidence level against crawlers less than 100 meters from the detection device.</p>
<p>The WAD system shall provide, at a minimum, a PD of 50 percent at the 90 percent confidence level for distances greater than 300m.</p>
<p>The WAD systems shall detect a vehicle as small as a small motorcycle moving through the detection zones at speeds up to 67 miles per hour (30 meters per second) at any distance.</p>
<p>False Alarm Rate &amp; Nuisance Alarm Rate</p>
<p>Limit False Alarm Rate for PL 1 and PL 2 areas of detection to no greater than 3 false alarms per day. MAJCOMs determine the allowable nuisance and false alarm rates for PL 3 and PL 4 resources. False alarms, as applied to WADS, are defined as those alarms generated by the system, or components of the system, where the probable cause of the alarm cannot be determined but is not associated with environmental conditions or the presence of animals in the detection zone.</p>
<p>Because an approach zone is not expected to be a manicured or otherwise controlled area or terrain, the term "Nuisance alarms" is not applicable to a WADS sensor. It is anticipated that wildlife, tall grass, trees, and other shrubs will exist in the approach zone and will be detected by the WADS. Reasonable efforts to minimize the effects of vegetation where possible within the approach zone will be made by the operating installation.</p>
<p>Target Accuracy<br />The WADS shall be able to report the location of the target within 2 meters of accuracy for targets 0-300 meters from the perimeter and within 10 meters of accuracy for targets greater than 300 meters from the perimeter.</p>
<p>The WADS will make the target location information available for processing and presentation to an operator by a third party system. The WADS shall communicate to a third party system through the use of ICD 101b.</p>
<p><br />Target Refresh Rate<br />The WADS shall provide a target refresh rate of at least one per second (update location).</p>
<p>The WADS will make the target tracking information available for processing and presentation to an operator by a third party system. The WADS shall communicate to a third party system through the use of ICD 101b.</p>
<p><br />Tamper Protection<br />The WAD system shall provide tamper protection to detect and report attempts by unauthorized personnel to access, bypass, spoof, jam or otherwise circumvent the system regardless of system status or mode of operation. All tamper switches shall activate (send an alarm) before the opening is large enough to allow an intruder an opportunity to manipulate the internal components of a protected device or afford the opportunity to bypass the tamper switch. The probability of tamper detection (Pd) shall be 100%.</p>
<p>The WAD system shall provide notification of compromised sensors or protected components to the annunciator/CCDE within two (2) seconds of occurrence. The tamper notification shall report as a unique alarm.<br /><br />The WAD system shall have locking mechanisms installed, lock hasps installed and tamper switches installed on any enclosures provided by the vendor.</p>
<p>Electromagnetic Interference (EMI)<br />The WAD system shall be capable of operating in an electromagnetic environment without causing or suffering degradation in its performance requirements.</p>
<p>Reliability<br />The WAD system shall have an Operational Availability (AO) of 0.994. AO is defined as Mean Time Between Downing Events (MTBDE) divided by the sum of MTBDE and Mean Down Time (MDT). MTBDE is the average time between events that bring the system down, including critical or non-critical failures, preventive maintenance and training. MDT is the total elapsed time to fully restore the system to an operational state as a result of a downing event.</p>
<p>The WAD system's Mean Time Between Critical Failure (MTBCF) shall be no less than 8,760 hours (1 year). MTBCF is calculated as the total equipment operating time in hours, divided by the number of Critical Failures. A Critical Failure is system degradation, indication of failure or actual failure that prevents the system from performing a specified mission.</p>
<p>The WAD system shall have a Mean Time Between Maintenance (MTBM) of no less than 800 hours, with 1500 hours desired. MTBM is calculated by dividing the operating time by the number of demands for maintenance, scheduled and unscheduled.</p>
<p>The WAD system shall have a Mean Repair Time of no more than 30 minutes for on-equipment repair.</p>
<p>Nuclear, Biological, &amp; Chemical Survivability<br />The WAD system shall be operable and maintainable in an NBC-contaminated environment and allow operators and maintainers to perform all required system tasks while in Mission Oriented Protective Posture 4 (MOPP- 4) gear. <br />*Note: While members are in MOPP 4 they will be wearing .025" thick gloves.</p>
<p>The WAD system shall survive required decontamination following exposure to biological or chemical agents.</p>
<p>The WAD system shall be resistant to the effects of chemicals and vapors present in the environment of air base operations.</p>
<p>System Requirements</p>
<p>Certificate of Compliance<br />A Certificate of Compliance shall be provided with the WAD system detailing power output and safety ratings.</p>
<p>Interface Capability<br />The WAD system shall interface with Advantor, Predator Elite and Vindicator Annunciators with SEIWG ICD-0101(b). This interface will enable the operator to use the annunciator to arm/disarm the detection device, shall report AC Power loss/restore, shall report all communications failure/restore conditions between any components, and shall report low battery conditions before failure occurs.</p>
<p>Detect/Non-Detect Masking<br />The WAD system shall have the ability for the user to set multiple specific areas as "non-detect" or "detect." The "non-detect" areas shall not track or alarm on targets. The "detect" areas shall track and alarm on targets and shall not track or alarm on targets outside the selected area.</p>
<p>Power &amp;Battery Back-up<br />The WAD system shall operate on on-site commercially available power (typically 120/240 VAC) and backup battery power.</p>
<p>If a separate battery backup is provided as part of the vendor's product it shall meet the following requirements:</p>
<p>The WAD system shall operate continuously for a minimum of four (4) hours.</p>
<p>The WAD system shall have a built in battery recharging system that fully recharges the batteries within twelve (12) hours.</p>
<p>The WAD system shall report AC loss as a unique alarm when the system is operating solely off of battery. The AC Loss alarm shall not report as an intrusion. Once AC power is restored, the system shall report the changes as a unique alarm and shall not report as an intrusion.</p>
<p>The WAD system shall transmit a "low battery" message before the battery is no longer operational. The WAD system shall indicate the amount of battery power that is available while operating on battery backup.</p>
<p>Encryption<br />The WAD shall be capable of encrypting data with a National Institute of Standards and Testing (NIST) certified Advanced Encryption Standard (AES).</p>
<p>Malfunction Notification<br />The WAD system shall register system malfunctions and shall alert the operator at the annunciator/CCDE panel of the system malfunction.</p>
<p>The WAD system shall allow the operator at the annunciator/CCDE panel to poll (or self-test) the system for malfunctions and this shall not affect the operating performance of the system.</p>
<p>Construction<br />The WAD system shall be constructed with ruggedized components and resist corrosion.</p>
<p>The WAD system shall allow for quick assembly, within 48 hrs in an expeditionary environment and configuration without sophisticated tools i.e , tools that can only be used for that system or support equipment.</p>

Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation, regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small business set aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors). Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer.

A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement make contract with the firms(s) listed. Note: While price will be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final contract award decision may be based upon a combination of price and past performance factors as detailed in the solicitation. Note: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Interested parties are invited to call the Ombudsman at (405) 734-8241.

Authority:  10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1).   Supplies or services required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source(s) and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. Therefore, the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.
In accordance with FAR 52.225-3, Buy American Act - Free Trade Agreements, one or more of these items under this acquisition is subject to the Free Trade Agreement. 	 Based upon market research the Government is not using the policies contained in FAR 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items in its solicitation for the described supplies or services.  However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Governments requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.
Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made.  No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer.
Electronic procedures will be used for this solicitation.  Hard copies of the solicitation will not be sent from this office.  The solicitation will be available for download only at www.fbo.gov.  
It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement  make contact with the firm(s) listed.
This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application.  The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined.  Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small business set-aside).  Foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could if otherwise eligible participate as subcontractor(s).
Due to the complexity and criticality of this part, only actual manufactures that have successfully completed all testing required by the original company responsible for the design, or manufacturers that have successfully completed all testing on items determined by the government to be similar in complexity and criticality and can be considered approved sources for this item.
An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from Offerors or potential Offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Interested parties are invited to call the Ombudsman at (405) 734-8241.  DO NOT CALL THIS NUMBER FOR SOLICITATION REQUESTS. 
23.	UID:  If unit price exceeds $5,000.00 then UID requirements will apply.

<a href="mailto:frank.bennett@bsee.gov">frank.bennett@bsee.gov</a>
<DESC>The U.S. Department of the Interior, Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) solicits White Papers of not more than five (5) pages in length, for specific areas of interest to the BSEE Technology Assessment and Research (TA&R) Program on Safety of Oil and Gas Operations in the US Outer Continental Shelf.  When appropriate, the research shall be conducted consistently with prior research.  For a summary of TA&R research recently performed, visit http://bsee.gov/Research-and-Training/Operational-Safety-and-Engineering.aspx.  Interested parties are encouraged to view the information presented on the site when considering submitting white papers.
BACKGROUND:   
The BSEE TA&R Program is requesting white papers to be submitted in accordance with the terms of this announcement. Selected white papers will be requested to submit proposals.  Proposals selected for funding by BSEE shall receive funding from FY 2013.  NOTICE:  The BSEE may share the White Papers with other organizations for review.  Potential contractors shall notify the BSEE if they do not want their White Papers/proposals shared outside of BSEE.  BSEE anticipates awards resultant to this announcement will be made on a Firm Fixed-Price (FFP) basis. 
OBJECTIVES: The topics for the FY 2013 safety research funding should be limited to the following topics: 
1. Physical oceanographic and meteorological data for Beaufort and Chukchi Seas to support reliability-based design criteria for arctic offshore oil and gas structures.  
Conduct extensive literature search for physical oceanographic and meteorological data associated with the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas and compile identified data into a framework that aids in developing robust statistical samples needed for describing environmental loads to support reliability-based design criteria for arctic offshore structures and associated marine infrastructure.  This work is intended to support current and future efforts in design of arctic offshore structures utilizing reliability-based engineering and international standards such as ISO 19906 Petroleum and Natural Gas Industries - Arctic Offshore Structures.
2. Reliability-Based Sea-Ice Parameters for Design of Offshore Structures Evaluate existing Beaufort and Chukchi sea-ice data (e.g. data from ice thickness studies, ice strength studies, seasonal freeze-up studies, etc.) and synthesize data in to the statistical values needed for reliability-based engineering design of robust arctic offshore structures that provide high reliability to withstanding ice forces (statistically low probability of failure).  This work is intended to support current and future efforts in design of arctic offshore structures utilizing reliability-based engineering and international standards such as ISO 19906 Petroleum and Natural Gas Industries - Arctic Offshore Structures.
3. Workshop offering a venue for consultation between experts collecting and utilizing physical oceanographic and meteorological data
Plan, organize, promote, and host a 3-day workshop offering a venue for consultation between experts collecting and utilizing physical oceanographic and meteorological data in support of Arctic Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) research pertaining to the physical environment of the Chukchi Sea.  This Workshop is intended to support collaborative discussions necessary to (1) determine the scope, format, and methods of collection of accumulated data; (2) develop a framework for integrating and analyzing this data to support decisions on OCS oil and gas operations; and (3) identify data gaps and opportunities for collaboratively gathering additional data.      4. Assessment of Unmanned Aerial System/Vehicle (UAS/V) technologies for application in sea ice reconnaissance and data acquisition. 
Assess UAS/V technologies for application in monitoring and measuring significant ice features in the Chukchi and Beaufort seas.  As hazardous ice can pose a significant threat to arctic oil and gas operations, UAS/V reconnaissance and associated monitoring of identified features may provide a viable alternative to manned reconnaissance flights and provide an additional tool to be used in concert with other ice monitoring systems (MDA RadarSat 2 imagery, MODIS satellite, IceNav images, field observations, etc.).  Measurement of ice feature geometry can provide useful data for assessing ice feature properties and provide information necessary to support design criteria for future arctic offshore structures.
5. Assessment of subsea glider technologies for application in mapping ice keel geometries, ice gouge geometries, subsea pipeline surveillance, and under ice oil accumulations.
Assess subsea glider technologies for application in measuring/mapping the sub-surface geometry of significant ice features and associated sea floor gouges from grounded ice features.  Measurement of ice feature sub-sea geometry can provide useful data for assessing the properties of significant ice features and provide information necessary to support design criteria for future arctic offshore structures.  Further, subsea glider technologies may provide a mechanism to survey subsea arctic pipelines for potential leaks, as well as look for under ice oil accumulations from undetected leaks.  
HOW TO RESPOND: White Papers of not more than five (5) pages in length, an ORIGINAL PLUS three (3) copies and one (1) electronic copy in PDF format, on a CD, shall be submitted to the U.S. Department of the Interior, Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement, Acquisition Operations Branch, 381 Elden St., Herndon, VA 20170-4817, ATTN: Mr. Frank Bennett, not later than 2:00 PM, Eastern Time on January 19, 2013.

<p>This initiative covers four (4) unique operational areas of the DMA: DMA Headquarters, the Defense Information School, the Defense Visual Information Directorate (DVI) with support of the Defense Asset Management Systems (DAMS), and IT engineering support for the DMA Broadcast network. Both the DMA Headquarters and DINFOS maintain full IT operational support which includes help desk, project management, applications maintenance and development, and network operations.

<p>The Contracting Officer may utilize on-line Reverse Auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation. During the course of the on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307.</p>

<a href="mailto:jenny.y.staggs@nasa.gov">Jenny Y Staggs</EMAIL></a>
<DESC>NASA/DFRC has a requirement for the purchase of a Manufacturers Steering Group (MSG) 3 Low Utilization Maintenance Program (LUMP) in support of DC-8 aircraft. The deliverables for this particular custom maintenance program would include a complete set of inspection work cards for all work required of this Progressive Maintenance Program. NASA/DFRC intends to purchase the service from the Boeing Company, located in Long Beach, CA. Authority for the requirement is 10 USC 2304 (C)(1) and FAR 6.302-1 (a)(2)  Only one responsible source. Justification is based upon the following facts: 1.	Boeing and Douglas legacy engineering and maintenance personal are uniquely qualified to provide a complete reliability, availability and maintainability assessment and analysis of the DC-8 aircraft. 2.	The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has authorized the Boeing Company to develop for commercial aircraft operator custom LUMP under the authority of the MSG 3 that meets all the FAA requirements for certification. 3.	The Boeing Company is the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) for the DC-8 #N817NA aircraft, and has developed the MSG 3 LUMP with input from a committee comprised of customers that operates DC-8 aircraft. Boeing heads the committee, which meeting periodically to review the maintenance programs and make changes as necessary. The maintenance programs are the sole property of Boeing and Boeing issues formal changes to the maintenance program as needed. Boeing is the only authorized seller to develop or modify the original aircraft maintenance instructions and procedures. Failure to adhere to FAA regulations threatens revocation of the aircraft air worthiness certification. Based upon the above, utilization of any other organization in-lieu of the Boeing Company for this type maintenance service would likely result in: a) substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition; and b) unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agencys requirements.  These reasons justify procuring the required services exclusively from the Boeing Company. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to Jenny Staggs at jenny.y.staggs@nasa.gov not later than 4:00 p.m. PDT on Thursday December 27, 2012. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. NASA Clause 1852.215-84, Ombudsman, is applicable. The Center Ombudsman for this acquisition can be found at http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/pub/pub_library/Omb.html	.

<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) IN ACCORDANCE WITH FAR 15.201(c)(7) AND FAR 52.215-3. This is NOT a Request for Proposal (RFP).

Requests for a solicitation will not receive a response. Responses to this notice are not offer and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.
<p><strong>Bottom Line Up Front</strong></p>
<p>FEMA is interested in holding a design competition for Manufactured Home designs that meet Agency needs. The concept is a single design/layout for each of six unit types, specifically one two and three bedroom UFAS and non-UFAS units (Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards or ADA for the Federal Government).</p>
<p><strong>Background</strong></p>
<p>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS)/Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) recognize suppliers are crucial partners in helping meet the challenges of supporting disaster survivors in the 21st century. Capitalizing on industry expertise, the Agency continues to work to improve how FEMA provides temporary housing.<br />FEMA is authorized under Section 408 of the Stafford Act to provide assistance to individuals and households. As part of that assistance FEMA procures, stores, transports and installs, and maintains manufactured homes that are used as temporary housing units. In order for FEMA to be prepared to respond to disasters the Agency maintains readiness contracts to procure manufactured homes.</p>

<DESC>NASA/GRC has a requirement for Data Acquisition Units for the Space Launch System. NASA/GRC intends to purchase the items from Teletronics Technology Corporation of Newtown, PA 18940 on an ID/IQ basis for a period not to exceed sixty (60) months.  The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy Agency requirements. The rationale supporting use of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) is that there is a sound basis to conclude that the Agencys minimum needs can only be satisfied by maintaining the current source.  Specifically, in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii)(A) and (B) and FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii)(A), when procuring a follow-on contract for the continued development or production of a major system or highly specialized equipment , including major components, supplies may be deemed to be available only from the original source when there will be Substantial duplication of cost to the government that is not expected to be recovered through competition and/or (iii)(B), Unacceptable delays in fulfilling the Agencys requirements. Award of a contract to a source other than TTC for the SLS DFI DAUs would result in duplication of cost to the government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.  Duplication of cost to the government if a source other than TTC is selected would result from: 1) Loss of investment of funds spent to date for engineering model DAUs that would have to be replaced and procured from the new supplier; and 2) loss of funds spent to date by NASA and their two primary contractors, Boeing and ATK, to bring the DFI system design, integrated with the avionics design, up through the preliminary design phase.  This includes extensive testing of hardware and training completed in programming and configuration of the DAUs. Award of a contract to a source other than TTC for the SLS DFI DAUs would also result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling NASAs requirements.	Unacceptable delays in fulfilling the Agencys requirements for SLS, if a source other than TTC is selected, would result from: 1) Significant critical path delay as a result of competition; 2) a significant setback in schedule resulting from NASA and their two primary contractors on SLS, Boeing, and ATK, having to repeat the preliminary design phase and integration of the new DAU into the current DFI architecture; and 3) loss of time and knowledge associated with the testing and training on the current DAUs that would have to be repeated with the new DAUs. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on December 28, 2012.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. NASA Clause 1852.215-84, Ombudsman, is applicable. The Center Ombudsman for this acquisition can be found at http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/pub/pub_library/Omb.html.

<DESC>QinetiQ-NA/Engineering Services Contract plans to issue a Request for Quote ESC-12357-LAM for LH2 Supply Chain for Kennedy Space Center (KSC) LC39B in Support of Space Launch System (SLS). This procurement is being conducted under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). Synopsis: KSC is seeking technical expertise in the fields of liquid hydrogen (LH2) production, systems engineering, and control or elimination of LH2 losses during production and operation of storage and transfer systems in support of critical space launch systems. The supply of LH2 at KSC LC39B currently is provided by over the road tankers from Louisiana.  Past Space Shuttle launches have required that an existing 850,000 gallon storage tank located at LC39B be filled by this method prior to the start of LH2 tanking operations. Replenish losses were 12.6%, evaporation losses were 12.2%, normal launch loss was 12.9%, and launch scrub with 24 hour turnaround was 7.8%.  The SLS program has defined the launch vehicle architecture by SLS Block 1, 1A, and 2 which are progressively larger launch vehicles using large quantities of LH2.  Launches are expected to occur approximately once a year starting in December, 2016.  Each mission will include the first launch attempt plus up to 3 scrub turnarounds 24 hours apart. The largest LH2 demand will be the SLS Block 2 configuration estimated to require up to 3 million gallons of LH2 storage tank capacity.  It is expected that the SLS Block 2 and the storage and transfer system will have similar percentage losses as the Space Shuttle. Demonstrated technical experience in LH2 production plant design, development, implementation schedule, and capital, maintenance and operations costs using all available technologies currently in use in industry is required. Demonstrated knowledge of high reliability, critical use and system assurance of availability during LH2 transfer operations including process control systems is required. New technologies can be considered but must have a high Technology Readiness Level (TRL), and a high probability for cost and efficiency improvements and solving technical capability issues as a result of the SLS vehicle requirements and standby storage and resupply between missions.	Demonstrated experience in project management scope, costs, schedule and operational risks is desired. Technologies that can assure advances in LH2 processing, storage and transfer are the desired goal to obtain a near Zero Loss ground system that will assure a high probability of SLS mission success. QinetiQ-NA does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.   The NAICS Code and Size Standard is 541330. The anticipated release date of RFQ ESC-12357-LAM is on or about 01/07/13 with an anticipated quote due date of on or about 01/22/13. All responsible sources may submit a quote which shall be considered by the agency. [OMBUDSMAN STATEMENT IS REQUIRED] NASA Clause 1852.215-84, Ombudsman, is applicable.   The Center Ombudsman for this acquisition can be found at http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/pub/pub_library/Omb.html.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.501(a), with Ellison Technologies of Charlotte, NC, to repair a NIST-owned DMU 70 5-axis machine manufactured by DMG/Mori Seiki.
<p>As part of the NIST Engineering Laboratory's Measurement Science for Smart Machine Tools project, NIST engineers develop measurement methods and standards to optimize and improve performance of complex 5-axis machine tools. A DMU 70 5-axis machine, operating with the original factory installed Seimens 840D controller serves as a test bed to support this research.</p>
<p>Continuity and credible demonstration of improvement require the continued use of this machine. The DMU 70 is currently malfunctioning and requires service. Initial diagnosis of the problem indicated the need for an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) part, a PCU 50, be replaced.</p>
<p>In order to properly repair the machine, the service technician must have expertise in running the DMU 70 and the Siemens 840D controller and have access to the DMG archived files from previous service calls on this piece of equipment. Further, in order for the newly installed part to qualify for the six month warranty, the part must be installed by a DMG-certified technician.</p>
<p>Sole source determination is based on Ellison Technologies being the exclusive distributor for DMG/Mori Seiki in the geographic region of Maryland and their meeting all of the qualifications identified.</p>
<p>Delivery terms shall be FOB Destination.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 811219, and the size standard is $19.0M.</p>
<p>No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations, however, responses received by January 6, 2012, will be considered by the Government.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>

"(b) Soliciting from a single source. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. <br /><br />This announcement constitutes the only notice; proposals are not being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.<br /><br />This solicitation and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-63, December 10, 2012. <br /><br />The corresponding NAICS code is 541690-Other Scientific and Technical Consulting Services and the small business size standard is $14.0 Million. <br /><br />The basis for the sole source determination: <br />The sole source determination is based on the fact that NIAMS requires specific expertise and knowledge in the role of IgE in lupus to advance its basic and clinical efforts in the understanding and treatment of lupus with anti-IgE (Xolair). Dr. Rivera discovered a role for IgE in lupus and is the sole investigator working in this area world-wide. His extensive knowledge of the role of IgE in vivo and his discovery of the underlying mechanisms by which IgE can promote the development of lupus is indispensable to proceed with a NIAMS clinical trial (using Xolair in the treatment of lupus) now being established at the NIH clinical center. It is essential that such expertise be available to NIAMS to gain a better understanding on the role of IgE in lupus and to treat lupus patients with anti-IgE drugs towards ameliorating disease; a disease that is key part of the NIAMS programmatic mission portfolio. <br /><br />Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement, in writing, no later than the response date. Written responses to this notice shall contain sufficient documentation to establish a bona fide capability to fulfill the requirement. Written responses shall reference this Notice of Intent No. NHLBI-CSB-AR-2013-047-CSP and may be submitted electronically NO LATER THAN 9:00 A.M.

<DESC>This is a notice, not a request for a proposal. A solicitation document will not be issued and proposals will not be requested.
<p>The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) Station Support/Simplified Acquisition (SS/SA) Branch, on behalf of the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)-Child Psychiatry Branch intends to negotiate and award a sole source purchase order to The Center for Applied Genomics (CAG), The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, The Joseph Stokes Jr. Research Institute, 3615 Civic Center Blvd., Room 1216E, Philadelphia, PA 19104-4318 for Prevalence and Phenotypic Manifestations of Copy Number Variations in 16p11.2, 22q11, MYTIL, and NRXN3 across 100,000 Subjects project. The purpose of the project is to determine the range of phenotypic manifestations caused by pathogenic copy number variations (CNVs) arising from duplication of the 16p11.2, 16p12.2 region and deletions of part or all of the MYTIL and NRXN3 genes. About 100,000 samples within the CAG repository, from patients representing a wide spectrum of diseases and/or conditions (including healthy controls), will be screened for the presence of CNVs in these 3 loci. NIM's working hypotheses is that mutations in these loci can have broad impacts on neurological, immunological, and/or other system-wide or organ-specific functions leading to a wide range of medical pathological that have not fully characterized or previously attributed to mutations at these loci. NIMH's findings from the pilot study will provide proof-of-principle to support a follow-up study to explore the role of pathogenic CNVs in many other regions (-200 loci) across the full -150,000 samples in the CAG repository. The NIMH's Child Psychiatry Branch is studying genetic risk factors in childhood onset schizophrenia. These children are severely ill and most had a variety of cognitive and motor abnormalities before they became psychotic. One major finding of this project is the higher rate of rare chromosomal copy number variants (CNVs) in this population compared to that seen in the general population. The rate for 22q11, 16p11 abd 2p53 were particularly high for childhood sample, and was also higher than that seen in adult onset schizophrenia. The period of performance is for 12 months.</p>
<p>The CAG is the only existing source for a pediatric population study involving genetic measures and clinical phenotyping. There is over 100,000 subject ages 0-21 with existing records and DNA samples. These samples are from ill and healthy subjects.</p>
<p>The acquisition is being conducted under simplified acquisition using FAR 12 procedures and falls under FAR 6.302-1. This notice if intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Interested parties may identify their and capabilities in response to this synopsis. The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely with the discretion of the Government.</p>
<p>Comments to this announcement, referencing synopsis number 2799429 may be submitted to the NIDA, Station Support/Simplified Acquisition Branch, 31 Center Drive, Room 1B59, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-2080 and Attention: Jasmine Snoddy, Contract Specialist.</p>

<a href="mailto:Clodfelter.Jeffery@epa.gov">Clodfelter.Jeffery@epa.gov</a>
<DESC>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, with San Francisco State University, Office of Research & Sponsored Programs, 1600 Holloway Avenue, San Francisco, CA 94132 to perform an analysis of the data from an Epidemiologic Health Study of Manganese Exposure in East Liverpool, Ohio. This study was conducted as an sole source procurement to San Francisco State University and the data from the East Liverpool must be analyzed and reported using the same statistical techniques previously employed so that the study results are equivalent and comparisons can be made with previous studies conducted in Marietta and Mt. Vernon, Ohio by San Francisco State University. The data from East Liverpool, Marietta and Mt. Vernon is proprietary to San Francisco State University due to patient confidentiality. Therefore, EPA believes this is the only capable source capable of conducting this study.  The circumstance permitting is FAR 6.302- 1 ?Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements?.  The anticipated period of performance is a 12 month base period and two 12 month option periods.  All interested parties who believe they can provide the required services should fully explain their capabilities and qualifications in writing within 15 days from the date of this announcement and provide itemized pricing that is sufficient to make a determination that competition is feasible. The intent of this notice is to determine if any other sources(s) exist, and therefore, no solicitation (RFQ) is available.  Consequently, anyone failing to provide the aforementioned and instead chooses to merely submit a routine letter requesting a copy of the statement of work or more information about the project will be ignored. The information received to this notice will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct a competitive procurement. Please s ubmit response to the U.S. EPA, Attn: Jeffery Clodfelter (MC-E105-02), RTP Procurement Operations Division, Research Triangle Park, NC 27711. No telephone or faxed requests will be honored.

<DESC>The General Services Administration (GSA) intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) for a Construction Manager as Constructor (CMc) to perform construction services on the Federal Office Building (FOB) Infrastructure Systems Replacement Project, in the Washington, DC Metropolitan Area. This is a classified project and each offeror shall possess the required Facility Security Clearance Level of Top Secret and required Level of Safeguarding capability of Top Secret in order to be considered eligible to bid upon this project and be issued a solicitation package. It is anticipated that classified technical data and documentation, up to the level of Top Secret will be utilized on the project.

This project is the second Phase of four Phases with each subsequent Phase extending services and systems of the entire project. The estimated construction cost range for this phase of the project is $50 to $100 million dollars. GSA intends to negotiate the award of a Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP) Contract for the Construction Manager as Constructor (CMc) Services. All work will be performed in accordance with GSA authorized and approved standards. The selection process will utilize source selection procedures in accordance with FAR Part 15.3.

<p>Further, of critical importance to the Government, is compliance with the construction schedule for this phase of the project. It is imperative that all offeror's be able to clearly demonstrate how they successfully managed both pre-construction and construction phase schedules for their identified comparable projects. The offeror's will be required to clearly articulate how they successfully managed and scheduled their staff, project subcontractor personnel, materials, equipment and other applicable resources necessary to comply with established projects intermediate milestone dates, final completion dates and final commissioning and punch-list completion dates.</p>
<p>FACTOR 2: Key Personnel</p>
<p>FACTOR 3: Understanding of Requirements/Management Approach/Subcontracting Plan/Schedule.</p>
<p>FACTOR 4: Apprenticeship Plan.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command/Army Forces Strategic Command (USASMDC/ARSTRAT), located in Huntsville, Alabama, gives notice of the contemplated release of Request For Proposal (RFP) W9113M-11-R-0003 for the effort entitled "Systems Engineering and Technical Assistance Contract (SETAC) 2010".  These requirements were previously synopsized under Draft RFP W9113M-10-R-0001.  This final RFP W9113M-11-R-0003, including all solicitation requirements, will supersede the Draft RFP in its entirety.  <br><br>This contemplated effort is the fourth in a lineage of SETAC contractual vehicles for these performance-based advisory and assistance services, and will satisfy recurring requirements for systems engineering and technical assistance for USASMDC/ARSTRAT and other associated defense organizations in support of their various air, space, missile defense, homeland security/homeland defense, warfighter, and cyber missions as they are defined by Congress, Higher Headquarters, and the Department of Defense.  The goal of these services is to ensure timely, energetic, and cost effective outcomes in the development of technologies and capabilities for defense against evolving threats; to coordinate all technology base development to maximize benefits for strategic and theater missile defense and air/space technology programs; and to ensure programs are in statutory and regulatory compliance.  These recurring support requirements are categorized into nine functional area requirements:  Programmatic and Business Initiatives; Requirements Definition, Analysis, Integration, and Planning; Concept Development and Assessment; Program/Project Analysis and Assessment; Threat Estimation and Projection; Weapons Lethality, Survivability, Electronic Warfare and Kill Assessment and Effects Estimation; Engineering and Analysis Support to Assess Technology, Models, Simulations and Prototype; Logistics Assessment; and Environmental, Treaty and Security Compliance.<br><br>The SETAC 2010 requirement is anticipated to be executed as a 100% set-aside for small business concerns and awarded on a competitive, multiple-award basis considering all qualified small businesses submitting proposals.  The NAICS code for this acquisition is 541712 - Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences (except Biotechnology), with a size standard of 1000 employees.<br><br>It is anticipated that up to five prime contract awards will be made as a result of the solicitation, with one of these awards reserved for Service Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB), and that each prime contract awardee will be guaranteed at least one task order award with a minimum obligation of $150,000.  The planned business arrangement for this contemplated effort is a multiple-award, indefinite-delivery/indefinite-quantity (MAIDIQ) task ordering vehicle that utilizes Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP) and Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF) task order types.  It is anticipated that this effort will consist of a base ordering period of two (2) years and an optional ordering period of an additional 3 years, and will include a program-level ceiling value of $997,000,000 that will be shared among all prime contract awardees.  <br><br>Potential offerors are advised that performance of these advisory and assistance services may create potential organizational conflicts of interest (OCI) as contemplated by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 9.505; therefore, stringent OCI provisions will be included in the solicitation <br>and any resulting contracts, and detailed OCI mitigation plans will be required.  Potential offerors are further advised that in order to be considered for a contract award for this requirement: (1) prime offerors must possess a Top Secret facility clearance and safeguarding capability, (2) all contractor personnel performing at the Government's site must possess, at minimum, a SECRET security clearance,  and (3) prime offerors, major subcontractors/team members, and non-major subcontractors/team members proposed to perform on a cost-reimbursement basis, must possess an adequate accounting system. No foreign participation will be allowed either at the prime or subcontract level.<br><br>It is anticipated that RFP W9113M-11-R-0003 will be formally issued and available for download from the USASMDC/ARSTRAT public website on or about 10 June 2011.

The Government DOES NOT intend to conduct a pre-proposal/industry day conference for this acquisition.<br><br>All communication concerning this acquisition must be coordinated through the Contracting Officer; any communications with anyone other than the Contracting Officer are inappropriate and can result in the potential offeror being excluded from participation in this acquisition. The Contracting Officer for this solicitation is Mr. Stephen Hayes, 256-955-4340, stephen.hayes@smdc.army.mil.  Alternate POC is Mr. Elbert Clarke, 256-955-3420, elbert.clarke@sdmc.army.mil.<br><br>NO PAPER COPIES OF THE RFP WILL BE PROVIDED NOR IS A MAILING LIST BEING MAINTAINED FOR THIS ACQUISITION AS THE RFP WILL BE POSTED ON THE ABOVE WEBSITE ADDRESS.

<DESC>Request for Information (RFI) for Aerosol Particle Size Analyzer <br>  <br>  <br> The Chemical Technology Team, Warfighter Directorate at the US Army Natick Research, Development and Engineering Center, have a need for a time-of-flight measurement technique to measure sub-micrometer particle size distributions of aerosols of diameters ranging from 0.5 to 20 micrometers with high size resolution.  We require direct measurement of the aerodynamic diameter of fine, airborne particles in real time, a particle sizing technique that accounts for particle shape and is unaffected by index of refraction or light scattering, and rapid measurement of particle number and size distribution with the highest accuracy and data collection including 52 channels for high resolution.  Finally, the sought instrument must be able to record the particle's light-scattering intensity on a particle-by-particle case in such a manner than this second measurement is kept separate and distinct from aerodynamic size. <br>  <br> The instrument software shall allow data to be displayed, analyzed, and played back without the need for external spreadsheet programs, but that this software is also compatible with spreadsheets if the need arises.  Have the capability of 3-dimensional plots of the particle size distributions over time that can be replayed as required.  In order to meet these salient characteristics, we anticipate the use of a probing laser coupled with a sensitive detector, an adequate power supply, a vacuum pump for sampling, a LCD display on the particle sizer, and all instrument controls in a single cabinet; additional features include microprocessor-controlled internal pumps with temperature and barometric pressure correction within the sizer.  <br>  <br> Specific technical features required:  <br>  <br> 1.  The instrument shall be able to measure individual particles in an accelerating flow field to determine the time-of-flight of the particle; <br>  <br> 2.  Airborne solids and non-volatile liquids shall be measured; <br>  <br> 3.  Aerodynamic particle size in the range from 0.5 to 20  m shall be measured; <br>  <br> 4. Optical light scattering intensity shall be reported for the 0.37 to 20  m optical size range (PSL equivalent); <br>  <br> 5.  Maximum Particle Concentration shall be at least 1,000 P/cm3 at 0.5  m; <br>  <br> 6.  Coincidence shall be less than 2% at 1,000 P/cm3 and coincidence detection shall be available; <br>  <br> 7.  Display Resolution shall be at least 52 channels total; <br>  <br> 8.  Raw data shall be acquired in at least 1,000 raw data channels (bins); <br>  <br> 9.  Size resolution shall be 0.02  m at 1.0  m diameter; <br>  <br> 10.  Sampling time shall be programmable from 1 second to 18 hours; <br>  <br> 11.   Total inlet flow rate shall be 5.0 L/min (feedback controlled); and <br>  <br> 12.  Atmospheric pressure correction shall be applied between 700 mbar and 1034 mbar. <br>  <br> The Government is conducting this market investigation to acquire information on the types and sizes of businesses that will be able to compete on future contracting actions, potential costs as well as delivery capabilities. <br>  <br> Interested firms are requested to submit relevant information on their company within fourteen (14) days following the publication of the RFI.  Any relevant company background/experience, business category, costs, and any other information that the company believes demonstrates their value/ability to meet the aforementioned requirements should be included. <br>  <br> This RFI is solely for information purposes and does not constitute a solicitation or the issuance thereof.  Responses to this RFI are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a finding contract.  Any information submitted will not be returned, and no payment will be made by the Government for such information. <br>  <br> Respondents must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) and provide a DUNS number.  Firms may register for SAM at https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM/ <br>  <br> Responses to this notice can be sent via email to Roberta.l.ciaramicoli.civ@mail.mil .

<DESC>This is a sources sought notice only.  <br>  <br> All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency. <br>  <br> The Natick Soldier Research, Development and Engineering Center (NSRDEC) is issuing a source sought notice to identify potential devices that can aid in a scientific inquiry to vary and manipulate redistribution of Soldier torso-borne loads (i.e. the body armor and attached equipment) which are primarily borne by the shoulders to other surface areas on the torso. One essential component of the device is that it has the ability to vary the degree of re-distribution of the load <br>  <br> DESCRIPTION <br>  <br> NSRDEC is interested in systematically manipulating the distribution of torso-borne loads, which are typically borne by the shoulder and upper back. We are also interested in determining an optimal distribution of the load on the torso that leads to improved performance and mobility and an increase in comfort. To do so, we need to obtain a device that would allow us to redistribute the torso-borne loads (ranging from 30 lbs to 120 lbs) which currently are primarily borne by the shoulders to other surface areas on the torso (i.e. shoulder, pelvis, chest, mid back). We prefer the technology be easily placed under or integrated within the military equipment (i.e. body armor, pack, and attached equipment). Adjustability of the device to accommodate various size individuals is also preferred.  Ideally,  the device will also have the ability to vary the degree of re-distribution of the load. This device must be comfortable enough to be worn for periods lasting up to 3 hours. Our end goal is to determine if there is an optimal distribution of the load on the torso that results in an increase in performance and comfort. Sources are only sought for the available technology that would allow NSRDEC to redistribute the torso-borne equipment worn from the primary location, shoulders, to other areas on the torso. NSRDEC will then utilize the device within an internal human use approved protocol(s) to conduct research with volunteers. <br>  <br> Period of Performance: 01 February 2013 - 30 June 2013. The technology provider shall provide services that include: <br>  <br> 1.	Detailed specifications of technology and any known limitations.   <br> 2.	Photo images of the device from multiple angles. <br> 3.	Ease of Use: The NSRDEC reserves the right to evaluate the performance of the technology, via live demonstration, and will also examine the ease of use of the system prior to award. The live demonstration, if required, will take place at the US Army Soldiers System Command, Natick, Massachusetts.   <br>  <br> Parameter Recommendation: <br>  <br> 1.	Safe to place on human volunteers. <br> 2.	Easily and comfortably placed between the upper body of the human and the military equipment being worn (i.e. load carriage equipment, body armor, etc.) or easily integrated within the US Army's current body armor system. <br> 3.	Ability to vary the degree of re-distribution of the load would be optimal <br> 4.	 Ability to redistribute the load to multiple areas on the torso would be beneficial (i.e., shoulder, pelvis, chest, mid back). <br> 5.	Adjustability of the device to accommodate a range of body sizes is preferred. <br> 6.	Comfortable and durable enough to carry torso-borne loads ranging from 30 lbs to 120 lbs for prolonged periods (3 hours). <br> 7.	Should not restrict mobility of the upper body allowing for normal Soldier tasks to be performed (i.e., walking, running,  low crawl, high crawl, shouldering a weapon, throwing, dive to prone, clearing obstacles, etc.). <br>  <br> RESPONSES <br>  <br> All interested firms and manufacturers, regardless of size, are encouraged to respond to this request for information. Information submissions should include available technology, product literature, and relevant company background/experience. Please provide product pricing as part of the information submission.  <br>  <br> Information submissions must be received by 01 February 2013. Responses to this notice should be directed to karen.n.gregorczyk.civ@mail.mil. Responses should include information on their product(s) and how they might address the Military requirement. All information supplied will be considered confidential, unless otherwise specified by the firm or available from other sources without restriction. This sources sought is for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute an Invitation for Bid (IFB) or a Request for Proposal (RFP) and is not to be taken as a future commitment by NSRDEC. <br>  <br> All respondents shall include all of the information listed below in the response email: <br>  <br> 1. Company name and Solicitation number in the email subject line. <br> 2.  Company address, telephone number, primary contact(s) with e-mail address(es), NAICS code(s), business size (i.e., small/large/HUB Zone), CAGE code, and DUNS number. (Respondents must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database in order to obtain a DUNS number. Firms may register with CCR at http://www.sam.gov.) <br> 3.

<a href="mailto:tammy.moreno@swpa.gov">Tammy Moreno</a>
<DESC>The Southwestern Power Administration (SWPA) is in the process of preparing a solicitation for the construction of two microwave radio sites in Arkansas.  Each site includes a 200 foot tall microwave radio tower that will weigh approximately 100,000 pounds.  In past solicitations the contractor, or sub-contractor, has been responsible for the design, detailing, fabrication and erection of the tower, as well as the design and drawings needed for the tower foundation.  In this solicitation SWPA is planning to provide the tower and foundation designs.  At this time we are requesting feedback on your interest, comments and suggestions.
The contractor, or tower sub-contractor, will need to prepare fabrication and erection drawings for the tower and tower accessories, based upon the information provided.  At this time we anticipate that the solicitation will provide the following design information for the tower:
1.  Tower outline drawing showing overall dimensions of the tower and designating the size and type of material for each tower member in each section.
2.  Connection design details showing the type, diameter, configuration and quantity of bolts needed at each connection along with the gage and minimum end distance for each member.  For connecting elements such as vangs and flanges, the plate thickness, material type, minimum weld size and minimum hole spacing will be provided.
3.  Climbing ladder details showing the minimum size of members, material type, weld sizes, bolts sizes and manor of connection to the tower itself.  Details will cover the ladder and material needed for the attachment to the tower.
4.  Transmission line ladder(s) details showing the minimum size of members, material type, weld sizes, bolt sizes and manor of connection to the tower itself.  Details will cover the ladder and material needed for the attachment to the tower.
5.  Transmission line bridge details showing the configuration, minimum size of members, material type, weld sizes, bolts sizes, and foundation drawings.
6.  Antenna pipe mount heights, orientation, and details showing the minimum size of members, material type, weld sizes, bolt sizes and manor of connection to the tower itself.  Details will cover the antenna mount and material needed for the attachment to the tower.
7.  Tower foundation drawing showing the foundation dimensions, rebar layout, anchor bolt cage and grounding.  The drawings will not show additional rebar needed for stiffeners, chairs, spacers, wheels, boots, etc., needed for installation of the foundation.  Note that more than one type of foundation design (pier, mat or pile) may be provided for pricing and selection by the Owner.
In consideration of the above factors, and any others which may be deemed appropriate, the construction/tower manufacturer community is invited to comment on SWPA's potential requirement .  Of particular interest are responses to the following questions:
a.  Is your company interested in preparing detail drawings and fabricating a tower that is designed by others?  
b.  What do you see as some of the pros and cons for this process?
c.  Would this type of information be sufficient for providing adequate pricing information?
d.  What potential risk factors do you see in this process?  
e.  What additional information could be provided in the solicitation to help reduce potential risks?
Please provide your comments via e-mail to Tammy Moreno, Contracting Officer,  at tammy.moreno@swpa.gov no later than 4:00 p.m. CST on December 27, 2012.  This is NOT a Request for Proposal and does not constitute any commitment by the Government.  Responses will be used by the Government to make appropriate acquisition decisions.  All interested sources must respond to solicitation announcements separately from this survey.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) seeks information on commercial vendors that are capable of providing a Downstream Plasma Asher System to support nanofabrication research and development in the Center for Nanoscale Science and Technology (CNST) user facility. The system will be sited in a class 100 cleanroom and used as a shared resource accessible to researchers from industry, academia, NIST, and other government agencies, ranging from nanolithography novices to experts in the field. After results of this market research are obtained and analyzed, and specifications developed, NIST may conduct a competitive procurement and subsequently award a Purchase Order for a Downstream Plasma Asher System. If at least two qualified small businesses are identified during this market research stage, then any competitive procurement that resulted would be conducted as a small business set-aside.

The Division of Neuroscience and Behavior's (DNB) Preclinical Medication Efficacy Testing Program seeks to re-compete a contract for the blind testing of reference compounds (<em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">including those previously tested by NIAAA's Clinical Investigations Group (NCIG) program</em>) and proprietary compounds on alcohol drinking in mice using models of various aspects of alcohol dependence.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The contract will use mechanisms having intellectual property conditions favorable to compound providers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This will eliminate a major barrier to testing optimized compounds having preclinical as well as clinical toxicology data and will stimulate interest by the pharmaceutical industry in developing high quality, marketable compounds for alcoholism.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Georgia', 'serif'; FONT-SIZE: 11pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial">Overall, the contractor will assess effects of proprietary compounds in standardized models of alcohol dependence-induced alcohol intake using mice for subjects. The contractor will also develop and implement testing of proprietary compounds in additional mouse models, which may include drinking in the dark (DID), intermittent access drinking model, alcohol deprivation model (ADE), and conditioned place preference (CPP) models. The contractor will also collect, analyze and display data from these tests and report them to designated NIAAA personnel. The data generated by this contract will be used in the identification of compounds for further development.</span></p>

<p>DISCLAIMER</p>
<p>THIS SOURCES SOUGHT IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. IT DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A SOLICITATION AND SHALL NOT BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT. RESPONSES IN ANY FORM ARE NOT OFFERS AND THE GOVERNMENT IS UNDER NO OBLIGATION TO AWARD A CONTRACT AS A RESULT OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. NO FUNDS ARE AVAILABLE TO PAY FOR PREPARATION OF RESPONSES TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. ANY INFORMATION SUBMITTED BY RESPONDENTS TO THIS TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION IS STRICTLY VOLUNTARY.</p>
<p>PROGRAM BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The V-22 aircraft has a unique tiltrotor design. This design has encountered reliability degradation from the ingestion of particles into the aircraft engines particularly while operating in the hover mode. This has resulted in reduced engine reliability or "Time on Wing" (TOW) due to this ingestion of particles when operating in austere environments. The Government is looking for a technical solution and the integration of that solution into the propulsion system of existing and future V-22 aircraft that improves engine TOW particularly in austere/desert environments.</p>
<p>REQUIRED CAPABILITIES</p>
<p>The Government is looking for a cost effective IIS that significantly increases TOW. The objective is for IIS to be delivered as a mission kit that could be installed at the organizational level within eight (8) hours or less.</p>
<p>Specifically, the Government envisions the V-22 IIS to meet the following operational and program requirements:</p>
<p>1. Being able to achieve 90% (or greater) particle separation efficiency utilizing a ISO 12103-1, A4 (ISO Course) and A2 (ISO Fine) sand distribution;<br />2. Ability to achieve the V-22 Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of &lsquo;7' within 12 months of development;<br />3. Provide an integrated anti-ice system that utilizes thermoelectric, bleed air, coatings, or other means to prevent ice formation in the engine inlet while in icing conditions (i.e. local environment (within the inlet) of zero (0) degrees Celsius and visible moisture);<br />4. Solution can not significantly degrade the range and hover capability of the aircraft;<br />5. Maintain a weight of 125 lbs per shipset which consists of two (2) inlets per aircraft while fulfilling the other requirements; <br />6. Solution must be viable in an austere mission environment;<br />7. Solution can have no negative impact on overall engine safety, survivability, reliability, maintainability, and availability;<br />8. Ability to meet the requirements of V-22 System Level Performance Spec SD-572-1-3; and<br />9. Ability to integrate proposed solution with the aircraft and engine manufacturer.</p>
<p>SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p>Any resulting contract is anticipated to have a security classification level of Secret. Any resulting contract shall be compliant with the specialty metal restriction of the Berry Amendment (10 U.S.C. 2533a and 2533b) in accordance with DFARS clauses 225.7002 and 252.225-7014 Alt 1, unless an exception applies.</p>

<DESC>This is a Request for Information (RFI). There is no solicitation available at this time. Requests for a solicitation will not receive a response. Any information submitted by respondents in response to this request for information is strictly voluntary. This RFI does not constitute a Request for Proposals (RFP), nor does its issuance restrict the Government to any ultimate acquisition approach. The Government will neither award a contract solely on the basis of this notice, nor pay for any information that may be submitted by respondents to this RFI.

The purpose of this RFI is to gather market research to assist NAVSUP Weapon Systems Support (NAVSUP WSS) in acquiring a ship maintenance planning solution for the Management Systems Support Division (MSSD) in support of the Submarine Maintenance Engineering Planning Program (SUBMEPP), the Surface Maintenance Engineering Planning Program (SURFMEPP) and the Carrier Planning Activity (CPA).
  The existing maintenance planning solution was developed by the Navy in the 1990s for use by SUBMEPP and has been expanded to encompass SURFMEPP and CPA. The US Navy is seeking to implement a solution that will provide the capabilities to support ship/platform maintenance planning. The US Navys maintenance requirements are expected to grow and change over time, as new ship platforms are brought into the inventory and old platforms are retired. The US Navy intends to acquire a solution that will support efforts to update and modernize the current maintenance planning tool.

The requirements for the ship maintenance planning solution are attached.  The requirements and Attachments A and B are combined in one file.
 Attachment C is a separate excel file.The information provided in response to this RFI shall include the following:

	Company profile/information (All information required in the attached documents)
	Completed Attachments B and C

<CONTACT>Christopher D Mettee, Contract Specialist, Phone 410-965-9486, Fax 410-965-9560, Email christopher.mettee@ssa.gov
<DESC>The Social Security Administration (SSA), Office of Acquisition and Grants (OAG), in conjunction with its customer, the Office of Telecommunications and Systems Operations (OTSO) Division of Integrated Telecommunication Management (DITM), is currently performing market research to determine the availability of sources to provide a VBMS solution to the agency. We are looking for sources capable of providing maintenance on the current and future infrastructure, support, and expansion of the agency's VBMS infrastructure. <br /><br />VBMS extends through every aspect of visual communication between the Agency, its personnel, and its customers. Moreover, VBMS facilitates internal visual communications between SSA locations over a wide geographic area. Specifically, VBMS consists of five separate systems, including:<br /><br />&bull; Interactive Video Teletraining (IVT): A distance-learning tool that transforms the traditional classroom into a distance-learning classroom, using video, audio, and data communications. IVT enables a centrally-located instructor to communicate with each student regardless of the student's geographic location. <br />&bull; Visual Communications Control Center (VCCC): The VCCC acts as the support desk for all hardware and software that receives, monitors, tracks, records, and resolves technical issues related to VBMS.<br />&bull; Audio/Video (AV) Monitoring Walls: The Agency uses its AV Monitoring Walls within its 24x7 Enterprise Operations Control Center for centralized network and application monitoring of critical systems used throughout the Agency. <br />&bull; High Definition (HD) Broadcast Studio: Provides emergency, public information, news releases, and taped broadcasts as determined by the agency's executive staff for dissemination to agency personnel and the Public. <br />&bull; Social Security Television (SSTV): A specialized form of broadcasting where the Agency streams multimedia content for display in the reception areas of Agency field offices. Further, SSTV support the Visitor Intake Process to inform the Public of the waiting lines at field offices.<br /><br />There are two predominant functional areas under the contract. First, we require maintenance, management, and support on the Agency's existing and future VBMS infrastructure. This infrastructure consists of over 1,200 different types of equipment, from digital monitors and camera devices to network storage and communications equipment. The agency possesses over 30,000 pieces of equipment and over 2,000 software licenses spanning over 1,700 locations within the United States and its territories. Maintenance includes onsite support predominantly from 7:30 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. local time, with a two-business day return-to-service time, and in some cases emergency replacement within 8 business hours. This support also includes quarterly preventative maintenance. Moreover, as part of this service, the contractor must staff the VCCC to provide troubleshooting; local repair of equipment; customer service; and overall management of the nationwide VBMS network. Maintenance and support currently represents the most significant functional area under this requirement.<br />Second, we are looking to possibly expand and/or replace our VMBS infrastructure with state-of-the-art equipment to meet the agency's telecommunication needs, for example, initiatives to upgrade to high definition. We attached a draft Statement of Work to this notification that better explains our requirements. Please note that this Statement of Work may reference documents, attachments, and sections that we have not included. Further, the Statement of Work and other documents are not final and may be subject to change.<br /><br />We request information from businesses that believe they have a bona-fide capability to meet the Agency's VMBS requirements. Specifically, interested firms should submit the following information:<br /><br />1) General Information: Include the company name, address, point of contact name, point of contact number, DUNS Number, business size status for the indicated NAICS code.<br /><br />2) Capabilities: In two pages or less, provide an explanation for how your firm has the capability and experience to support the Agency's present VBMS infrastructure nationwide, and the ability to expand and upgrade VBMS equipment. Include details of how you provided similar services to Federal Government clients (include contract number, date of award, dollar value, and explanation of how support relates to the potential requirements stipulated within this notice).<br /><br />3) Documentation Comments: Provide any comments or suggestions to the current Statement of Work and related documentation. Identify any areas that appear ambiguous or otherwise unclear. In reviewing the pricing table, identify any issues that prevented completion.<br /><br />4) Availability of Services through Existing Contracts: We presently believe that due to the scope of this acquisition; the number and variation in the types of equipment required; and the unique terms and conditions (such as the need to establish a Blanket Purchase Agreement or Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity Contract over a seven-year period), that an existing Government-Wide Acquisition Contract (GWAC) may not be a good fit for this potential requirement. Identify if your firm believes that a GWAC exists that could meet these requirements. If so, provide specific details that could assist the Agency evaluate the identified source of supply.<br /><br />Interested sources that believe they have the bona fide capability to perform these services should submit a detailed statement of their solution, in writing, to Christopher Mettee, Contracting Officer, Division of Information Technology Support Services, 7111 Security Boulevard, First Floor Rear Entrance, Baltimore, MD 21244. In addition, SSA will accept responses submitted electronically via email at Christopher.Mettee@ssa.gov. Facsimile responses are not acceptable. Please reference SSA-RFI-13-VBMIS in the email subject line. SSA must receive all responses by 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on December 27, 2012.<br /><br />Synopsis Terms and Conditions:<br /><br />&bull; This is a sources sought announcement, a market survey for written information only. <br />&bull; This is not a solicitation announcement for proposals and the Government will not award a contract from this announcement. <br />&bull; The Government will not reimburse for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement or any follow-up information requests. <br />&bull; The Government will not accept any telephone calls, or requests for a bid package or solicitation. There is no bid package or solicitation. <br />&bull; In order to protect the procurement integrity of any future procurement, if any, that may arise from this announcement; the Government will not give information regarding the technical point of contact.<br />&bull; The Government will not make appointments for presentations. This synopsis is for planning purposes only, not a commitment by the Government. <br />&bull; The Government will use responses to this sources sought/market research notice to make appropriate acquisition decisions.

<DESC>The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal Plant Health Inspection Services (APHIS) , Employee Services Division (ESD) Facility in Riverdale, Maryland intends to negotiate a firm fixed Priced 3 year follow on Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) for calibration and cleaning services previously under warranty for 25 TSI Brand Portacounts currently in use at APHIS/ESD/SB.
<p>The TSI Brand PortaCounts used by APHIS/ESD/SB comply with current Avian Influenza respirator fit-testing requirements. This Respiratory Protection Program was developed to comply with OSHA and the specific requirements of the APHIS Program, and is mission critical to personnel.</p>
<p>APHIS currently has TSI Brand PortaCount units located nation-wide which are sent to the field for designated trained APHIS personnel to perform respirator fit-testing .</p>
<p><br />The current Quote is for each of the 25 Portacounts to have 3 calibrations. <br />Item description CLC3-8038<br />Serial numbers:</p>
<p>8038103903 8038103904 8038103907 8038103908<br />8038090608 8038084019 8038084023 8038084024<br />8038084025 8038084026 8038084027 8038092802<br />8038092813 8038092820 8038092821 8038092822<br />8038092823 8038092825 8038092901 8038092904<br />8038092905 8038092906 8038092907 8038092908<br />8038092909</p>
<p><br />25ea @ $821.67 = $20,541.67 x 3yrs</p>
<p>Total estimated dollar amount for award is $61,625.25</p>
<p>The rationale used for permitting this noncompetitive acquisition is in accordance with FAR - 6.302-1 Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.</p>
<p>(a) Authority. <br />(1) Citations: 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) or 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1).</p>
<p>The property or services needed by the executive agency are available from only one responsible source and no other type of property or services will satisfy the needs of the executive agency</p>
<p>TSI is the Manufacturer for the PortaCounts used and they perform their own cleaning and calibration services. These services were previously under warranty.</p>
<p>In Accordance with FAR 6.302-1 (2) ( C ) (ii) Supplies or services &nbsp;may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of a follow-on contract for the continued development or production of a major system or highly specialized equipment, including major components thereof, when it is likely that award to any other source would result in-</p>
<p>(A) Substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition; or</p>
<p>(B) Unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements.</p>
<p>The quote # 20042380 received by the Contracting officer will be processed immediately because it expires on 12/31/2012. Delay in award could cause unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements and possible price increases for services.</p>
<p><br />This Notice of Intent is not a request for competitive proposals. No solicitation documents are available and telephone requests will not be honored. However, if a firm believes it can meet the requirements it must furnish information about its products and services, as well as three (3) references from other customers who are using these services, to the Contracting Officer by 4:00pm. Central Time (CT) by January 8, 2013. Supporting evidence must be furnished in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to comply with the above requirement. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334512, and the size standard is 500 Employees.</p>
<p>Responses received after the response date or without the required information will be deemed nonresponsive to the synopsis and will not be considered. Capability statements may be sent to: Carol Dingess, Contracting Officer , USDA-APHIS-MRPBS, ASD Procurement Branch, Butler Square Building, 5th Floor, 100 N. 6th Street, Minneapolis, MN 55403, or via email @ Carol.Dingess@aphis.usda.gov or fax @ (612) 336-3554.</p>

<DESC>The Aviation Applied Technology Directorate (AATD) Contracting Division, Army Contracting Command, intends to negotiate on a sole source basis, in accordance with 13.106-1(b), Soliciting from a Single Source, with Stratasys, Inc; 14950 Martin Drive; Eden Prairie, MN 55344.  The proposed contract action, a commercial items purchase order in accordance with FAR Part 13, is for procurement of a one-year extended maintenance agreement for the Stratasys 400mc printer and the Stratsys 900mc printer currently located in AATD's Engineering, Design & Analysis Branch.  The purchase order will be issued on a Firm-Fixed-Price basis. <br>  <br> The Design & Analysis Branch of the Rapid Prototyping Division utilizes two 3D Printers (Stratasys Fortus 400 and Fortus 900 MC) for producing prototype models of design solutions. This SAP is to obtain an annual maintenance contract for the printers, (from 03/06/2013 through 04/06/2014), which will allow the branch's capability to print 3D models of design solutions used for prototyping, fit-up, and in some cases, for flight purposes.  <br>  <br> The proposed vendor, Stratasys, Inc, is the original manufacturer of the Stratasys Fortus 400mc and Fortus 900mc.  The Fortus 3D Printer Systems are unique to Stratasys, Inc., who build and maintain these systems.  The OEM (Stratasys Inc.) is the only source which can supply OEM replacement parts and qualified technicians to repair and maintain their systems. The procurement of these 3D Printers explicitly states use of any service to repair or maintain the system will null and void any expressed warranties and certifications provided by the initial purchase.  Stratasys, Inc. is the only vendor which has access to and can provide OEM proprietary system parts, and the expertise to diagnose problems with the 3D Printer systems operation. Due to the frequency of use of this system to support all Army Aviation programs within AATD, it is vital for this branch to maintain this capability. <br>  <br> No request for quotes/proposals will be posted.  Interested sources may identify interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. The Government will review and consider all capabilities statements or proposals received within the closing date set in this notice.  The Government retains the sole discretion on the decision whether or not to conduct a competitive competition based upon information received in response to this notice.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Companies submitting such statements shall reference W911W6-13-P-0009 in all correspondence with the Government. <br>  <br> Specifications, plans, or drawings relating to this procurement described are not available and cannot be furnished by the Government.

<SUBJECT>High School Follow-on Evaluation of CDCs Dating Matters: Strategies to Promote Healthy Teen RelationshipsTM Initiative
<SOLNBR>BBV9FY130001
<RESPDATE>010313
<CONTACT>Betty B Vannoy, Contracting Officer, Phone 770-488-2891, Fax 770-488-2868, Email bbv9@cdc.gov
<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO SOLE SOURCE: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Office of Noncommunicable Diseases, Injury and Environmental Health (ONDIEH), National Center for Injury Prevention and Control (NCIPC), Division of Violence Prevention (DVP), intends to negotiate on a sole source basis to National Opinion Research Center (NORC) at the University of Chicago, Bethesda, Maryland, the follow-on research service contract for the continued student participation in the project entitled, "High School Follow-on Evaluation of CDC's Dating Matters: Strategies to Promote Healthy Teen RelationshipsTM Initiative." CDC intends to negotiate this requirement under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, HHSAR 306.302-1, and 41 U.S.C.253(c)(1). The purpose of this project is to continue to monitor the longitudinal effects of the entire initiative on enhancing engagement in healthy dating relationship behaviors and reducing teen dating violence (TDV) victimization and perpetration, including physical, sexual and psychological violence. The anticipated performance period is five years. The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 541720 with a small business size standard of $7 million. <br /><br />BACKGROUND:<br /><br />In Fiscal Year (FY) 2009, Congress began providing CDC with funding to address the problem of teen dating violence. With this funding, CDC developed a Dating Matters, which builds on the current evidence base for prevention. The initiative involves 1) school-based, youth-directed curricula, 2) parent-directed components, 3) educator training, 4) communication strategies, 5) policy strategies, and 6) rigorous evaluation. The initiative was designed to increase communities' capacity to sustain implementation of TDV prevention strategies and to sustain the collection and tracking of indicator data over time.<br /><br />In 2011, the Dating Matters initiative funded four cooperative agreements with health departments across the U.S. to implement the multi-component, comprehensive program in middle schools and with families in a metropolitan area determined by the health department (Baltimore City Health Department - Maryland, Chicago Public Health Department - Illinois, Broward County Health Department - Florida, and Alameda County Public Health Department - California). Along with funding the four health departments, the National Opinion Research Center (NORC) was funded to perform the first period of the evaluation research component where they developed a suitable evaluation design, specifically a randomized control trial in which neighborhoods/schools implementing the comprehensive initiative will be compared to neighborhoods/schools implementing an evidence-based TDV prevention program (e.g., standard practice). NORC, along with CDC, determined the ultimate outcomes to be engagement in healthy relationship behaviors, perpetration and victimization of physical, sexual and psychological dating violence, and other intermediate outcomes and mediating variables. In addition, NORC developed an information system that is being utilized to capture all data collected for this evaluation. <br /><br />The follow-on contract is critical to understanding the primary prevention effects of Dating Matters. With the goal of primary prevention of teen dating violence, Dating Matters intervenes with students when they are in middle school, before they begin engaging in really intimate dating relationships, for the purposes of preventing teen dating violence when they really begin dating as they grow older. Therefore, to see the full effects of the Dating Matters initiative, we must continue to survey the students into their high school years, when teen dating violence behaviors are more likely to surface. For example, this contract will enable CDC to better understand the longitudinal effects of a program implemented originally with middle school students on these students' future behaviors in high school.<br /><br />ACQUISITION PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES<br /><br />The purpose and objective of this acquisition is to fund the evaluation research component of CDC's Dating Matters: Strategies to Promote Healthy Teen Relationships<sup>TM</sup> (Dating Matters) initiative to determine the longitudinal effects of the entire initiative on reducing teen dating violence (TDV) victimization and perpetration, including physical, sexual and psychological violence. Authority for CDC's National Center for Injury Prevention and Control to collect this data is granted by Section 301 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 241). This act gives federal health agencies, such as CDC, broad authority to collect data and do other public health activities, including this type of study.<br /><br />THE OBJECTIVES ARE:<br /><br />1. Continued meetings with CDC, the four sites, other CDC contractors, and the school districts involved in the implementation and evaluation.<br />2. Continued involvement in managing all Institution Review Board protocols (eight total) and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) protocols.<br />3. Revise IRB and OMB protocols as necessary to follow youth into high school; requires submitting amendments to the proposals and working with each site to determine the most appropriate consent procedures.<br />4. Using pre-existing relationships, NORC must continue tracking youth who moved on to high school.<br />5. Complete survey administration and data collection with the same cohort of students (approximately 4,000 youth in each grade) and use the same rigorous methodology.<br />6. Continued development and maintenance of the information system database that contains all data collected under the current evaluation contract.<br />7. Continued past student participation and existing proprietary data inventory of ongoing study resolutions.<br />8. Analysis of data including basic descriptive analyses of group characteristics and more advanced multi-level modeling to examine differences in behaviors for control and intervention students.<br />9. Followed by the Dating Matters data, a compilation of an online evaluation tool kit that others can use to evaluate their implementation of Dating Matters.<br />10. Submission of annual project reports and all generated data under the project.
<p><br />The proposed contractor is uniquely qualified to perform these services for the following consideration:</p>
<p>a) Access to the longitudinal student cohort studied under the current contract which is critical for ongoing study resolutions. Approximately 4,000 youth in each grade at four separate sites in the USA.</p>
<p>b) Time constraints imposed by CDC for target study participants, group data, publications, site reporting, require their continued work on this project.<br /><br />c) The ability to coordinate the transfer of deliverables and datasets from the current contract to the follow-on contract.<br /><br />This initiative was previously advertised under Broad Agency Announcement No. 2011-N-13268.<br /><br />This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. A determination to compete this procurement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. However, responsible sources may express their interest by submitting a capability statement. All responses should be received by January 3, 2013 at 10 AM EST. All responses must be in writing and can be sent via email to bbv9@cdc.gov . No telephone calls will be accepted.</p>

These devices are to supplement&nbsp;NOAA's already existing inventory of JSATS receivers and transmitters, and therefore must be JSATS compatible. These receivers are necessary for fulfillment of the agreement number E1183012 from California Department of Fish and Game to support the project: "Survival and Migratory Patterns of Juvenile Spring and Fall Run Chinook Salmon in Sacramento River and Delta" effective June 25, 2012. This research will provide the best scientific data available to support of&nbsp;NOAA's mission of sustainably managing these ecologically, economically and culturally import species.<br />&nbsp;50 each Trident Acoustic Receiver, temp and tilt included, model SR3000 with the following technical specifications:<br />o JSATS compatible - binary phase shift keyed code pulse operating on frequency of 416.7 kHz +/- 0.5%<br />o Completely submersible to at least 60m water depth<br />o Autonomous - no external power or communications cable necessary for operation<br />o Logs data to flash memory<br />o USB port for connecting to PC <br />o Service life: at least 30 days<br />o Onboard processing of detections to filter false detections<br />o Device comes with PC user interface software that allows for configuring device and includes post-processing algorithm of raw data that incorporates transmitter pulse rate to remove false positives. This feature is high value as it greatly reduces labor costs associated with post-processing data if sophisticated filter is not part of software. <br />o Receiver performance and sensitivity equivalent to ATS SR5000 Trident acoustic receiver (NOAA Fisheries Santa Cruz testing report available)<br /><br />Interested parties must respond to this announcement<br />within fifteen (15) calendar days of its publication. All responses must be<br />in writing and may be faxed to 206-526-6025 or email (<a href="mailto:melvin.n.fondue@noaa.gov">melvin.n.fondue@noaa.gov</a>).<br />This is a simplified acquisition with an estimated value of less than.<br />$150,000.<br /><br />All vendors doing business with the Government are required to be<br />registered with the System for Award Management (SAM). NO award can be<br />made unless the vendor is registered in SAM. For additional<br />information and to register in SAM, please access the following web<br />site: www.sam.gov.

Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by NSWC Crane. 

1)	MARKET SURVEY - REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI): The Government is issuing this RFI announcement as part of a market survey to obtain technical and program related information useful for the conduct of an Expendable Electronic Attack (EEA) Payload Analysis.
  This effort is intended to examine payloads that have a reasonable potential to meet the performance concept and provide a low cost, EEA Payload capability. Details regarding the content of information sought are cited below and in a classified attachment to be provided upon request.  Information herein is based on the best information available at the time of publication, is subject to revision, and is not binding upon the Government. The Government WILL NOT PAY for any information received in response to this RFI nor will the Government compensate respondents for any cost incurred in developing information for, participating in meetings with or engaging in discussions with the Government.
  

2)	RFI Response Intent:  The Navy requests data on EEA Payloads at Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 6 or greater TRL that meet the minimum requirements listed in Table 1, although EEA Payloads at TRL 5 that can be updated to TRL 6 may be considered.  TRL 6 is defined as follows: The payload has been demonstrated in a relevant environment.  An example of a TRL 6 demonstrated technology would be as follows:  Testing a prototype in a high fidelity laboratory environment or in a simulated operational environment.  The operational environment is a non-operational captive carriage of a host platform/payload on a tactical jet followed by ejection from the tactical jet and transition of the host platform/payload to an operational state.
  It is expected that any proposed EEA Payloads will consist of Radio Frequency (RF) up/down conversion, Digital RF Memory (DRFM) based technique generator(s), processors, amplifier(s), and associated software/firmware.  Responders may assume that the host platform will provide required receive and transmit antennas.

NMOC Work Stream Areas	Description



1.   Preventive Care and Veteran Health Portals	Serves to create a new, online environment where Veterans, family and clinicians may come together to optimize Veterans Health Care. Clinicians are able to communicate and collaborate with Veterans much more easily.  As Veterans build up their virtual lifelong health records, they will be able to choose to share the information in their account with their health care providers.  This has the potential to dramatically improve the quality of care available to the veterans.  
Projects:  Health Risk Assessment (HRA); eMove!; My HealtheVet and eBenefits Portal Integration; My HealtheVet Capabilities Enhancement; MHV Website Veterans Health Library; and Patient Education Management System (PEMS)




2.    Expand Virtual Real-Time Medicine (Telehealth)	Telehealth involves the delivery of healthcare services using information and telecommunication technologies in situations where patients and clinicians are geographically distant from one another.  New Models of Care is pioneering the use of telepathology to diagnose disease remotely and teleaudiology to treat hearing disorders remotely.  The Home Telehealth Capability Enhancements project set the foundation to increase Veteran usage capacity by 50 percent annually.  Clinical Video Telehealth uses real-time interactive video conferencing, sometimes with supportive peripheral technologies, to assess, treat and provide care to a patient remotely.

Projects include: Home Telehealth (HT) Capabilities Enhancements, Clinical Video Teleconferencing (CVT), and Vista Imaging Storage Infrastructure.






3.   Mobile Applications	The VA mobile and Wireless efforts are part of a larger effort to change the way care is delivered by designing its systems around the need of patients and prepared healthcare teams to improve care coordination.  Wireless technologies represent an important and emerging opportunity to provide quality and patient-centered care, with promise of gaining efficiencies and cost reductions.  Healthcare that offers providers and patients remote access to electronic medical records, virtual monitoring and visits, asynchronous communication, social networking, video conferencing and remote documentation. 

Projects include: Enterprise Mobile Applications and Mobile Applications.








4.

<p>ADDENDA TO 52.212-1 PROPOSAL PREPARATION INSTRUCTIONS: (A) To assume timely and equitable evaluation of the proposal, the offeror must follow the instructions contained herein.

Please limit pages to 1-2. The Government reserves the right to interview the applicant before award. Technical evaluation will be conducted on an acceptable/unacceptable basis using the ratings described in table A-1.</p>
<p>Table A-1. Technical Acceptable/Unacceptable Ratings<br />Rating Description<br />Acceptable Proposal clearly meets the minimum<br />requirements of the solicitation.<br />Unacceptable Proposal does not clearly meet the minimum<br />requirements of the solicitation.</p>
<p>(3) PART III - PAST PERFORMANCE INFORMATION- Only references for same or similar type contracts as desired. Past performance will be rated on an "acceptable" or "unacceptable" basis using the ratings in table A-2.</p>
<p>Table A-2. Past Performance Evaluation Ratings<br />Rating Description<br />Acceptable Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort, or the offeror's performance record is unknown. (See note below.)<br />Unacceptable Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has no reasonable expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>Note: In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom<br />information on past performance is not available or so sparse that no meaningful past<br />performance rating can be reasonably assigned, the offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (see FAR 15.305 (a)(2)(iv)). Therefore, the offeror shall be determined to have unknown past performance. In the context of acceptability/unacceptability, "unknown" shall be considered "acceptable."</p>
<p>(a) Past Performance Surveys: The government will evaluate the quality and extent of offeror's performance deemed relevant to the requirements of this solicitation. The government will use information submitted by the offeror and other sources such as other Federal Government offices and commercial sources, to assess performance. Provide a list of two (2) of the most relevant contracts preformed for Federal agencies and commercial customers within the last three (3) years. Relevant contracts include present/past performance effort which involved much of the magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires. The evaluation of past performance information will take into account past performance information regarding predecessor companies, key personnel who have relevant experience, or subcontractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement when such information is relevant to the instant acquisition. Furnish the following information for each contract referenced: (i) Company/Division name, (ii) Product/Service, (iii) Contracting Agency/Customer, (iv) Contract Number, (v) Contract Dollar Value, (vi) Period of Performance, (vii) Verified, up-to-date name, address, FAX, e-mail and telephone number of the contracting officer, (viii) Comments regarding compliance with contract terms and conditions, (ix) Comments regarding any known performance deemed unacceptable to the customer, or not in accordance with the contract terms and conditions. (b) If a teaming arrangement is contemplated, provide complete information as to the arrangement, including any relevant and recent past/present performance information on previous teaming arrangements with same partner. If this is a first time joint effort, each party to the arrangement must provide a list of past and present relevant contracts. (c) Subcontractor Consent: Past performance information pertaining to a subcontractor cannot be disclosed to the prime offeror without the subcontractor's consent. Provide with the proposal a letter from all subcontractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement, consenting to the release of their past performance information to the prime contractor. (d) Documents submitted in response to this solicitation must be fully responsive to and consistent with the following: (1) Requirements of the solicitation (Item Numbers) and Performance Work Statement (PWS) and government standards and regulations pertaining to the PWS (2) Evaluation Factors for Award.</p>
<p>In accordance with 52.212-2, Evaluation-Commercial Items. Addendum to 52.212-2, Evaluation-Commercial Items; The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: Price, Technical, and Past Performance.</p>
<p>After receipt of proposals, the proposals will be ranked by price before the Government assesses technical capability. Offers will be evaluated based on total price. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise option(s). If the lowest priced offer is determined to be acceptable for Technical and Past Performance, that offer represents the best value for the Government and the evaluation process stops at this point. Award shall be made to that offeror without further consideration of any other offers.</p>
<p>If the lowest priced offeror is not judged to be acceptable for Technical or Past Performance, the next lowest priced offeror will be evaluated and the process will continue (in order by price) until an offeror is determined to be acceptable for Technical and Past Performance, or until all offerors are evaluated.</p>
<p>A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>

(c) If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the Center/MAJCOM ombudsmen Mr. Gregory S.

INSPECTION AND ACCEPTANCE 
 
It is agreed that the Veterans Affairs will have right to inspection of the residential treatment center and all appurtenances by an authorized representative(s) designated by the Veterans Affairs.  
 
Prior to the award of a contract, a multidisciplinary Veterans Affairs team consisting of a social worker, dietitian, registered nurse, and an engineering service safety officer shall conduct a survey of the residential treatment/community health care center, Residential treatment centers to be utilized will be restricted to community based facilities that provide food, shelter, and therapeutic services in a supportive environment.  
 
The contractor will be advised of the finding of the inspection team.  If deficiencies are noted during any inspection, the facility will be given a reasonable time to take corrective action to notify the Contracting Officer that the corrections have been made.  A contract will not be awarded until noted deficiencies have been eliminated.  

The VA shall monitor the contractor's program and inspect the contractor's facility to ensure compliance with this agreement.  Any unsatisfactory conditions noted during an inspection of contract facility will be reported in writing to the VA Contracting Officer through the Medical Center Director.  If corrections are not made to the satisfaction of the VA, the Contracting Officer will consult with the appropriate officials so that suitable arrangements can be made to discharge or transfer patients and to terminate the contract.  
 
Subsequent inspections of the residential treatment center must be made annually by a multidisciplinary team including such VAMC Medical Center personnel as the Director considers necessary to assure the facility provides quality care in a safe environment.  As the VA program personnel accomplish site visits, attention will be directed to the adequacy of veterans' records.  Site visits will also include a spot check of records to ensure contractor invoices accurately reflect the veteran's length of stay.

SAFETY

a.      General observation of residents indicates that they maintain an acceptable level of personal hygiene and grooming.  
 
b.      The facility meets applicable fire, safety and sanitation standards in attractive surroundings conducive to social interaction and the fullest development of the residents' rehabilitative potential.  
  
c.      The facility should be in a central location, near public transportation, and near areas, which provide employment.  

d.      The facility shall be located in Hamilton County, Ohio, USA.

e.      There is evidence of facility-community interaction.  This may be demonstrated by the nature of scheduled activities or by information about resident flow out of the facility, e.g., community activities, volunteers, local consumer services, etc.  
 
f.      Staff behavior and interaction with residents convey an attitude of genuine concern and caring.   
 
g.      Appetizing, nutritionally adequate meals are either provided and nutritious snacks between meals and bedtime are available for those requiring or desiring additional food, when it is not medically contraindicated or a fully operational kitchen and groceries are available for the resident to cook their own meals.

Many of these patients are either undernourished or have developed poor eating habits or both, due to their chronic psychiatric disorder, including alcohol/drug abuse behaviors.

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports.

<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

Requirements for Access to the Norfolk Naval Shipyard 			

(a) Contractors representatives must be United States citizens.  Representatives are to provide the NNSY Security Office proof of U.S. citizenship (i.e. DHS I-9 FORM.  Employee Eligibility Verification Form).  The I-9 is based on presentation of appropriate documentation that both verifies the employees eligibility for employment and denotes his citizenship status.  Contractors can go to 
http://www.nnsy1.navy.mil/Security/docs/i-9.pdf to acquire the required form and completion guidance.

NOTE: The I-9 must be provided before a badge will be issued for unclassified contract work, for access to the shipyard.
  If the contract requires access to classified material, a visit request identifying the employees clearance status may suffice depending on the employees status within the JPAS database.  In the case of contractor truck drivers, knowing some are owner operators, if they are carrying proof of citizenship they can be issued a badge for access to drop off/pick up material.  If the truck driver does not have sufficient documentation and the sponsor is willing to escort the driver to/from the desired location, a by-escort badge may be issued.

(b) VENDORS/CONTRACTORS SHALL FORWARD ALL VISIT REQUESTS ON THEIR COMPANY LETTERHEAD SIGNED BY AN AUTHORIZED COMPANY OFFICER.

(1)	 Vendors/contractors shall provide FULL name, FULL SSN, Date of Birth, Place of Birth and a specific statement attesting that the person(s) for whom they are requesting access are citizens of the United States.
  By so stating, the vendor/contractor is certifying that they have positive documentation of that persons citizenship on file (i.e. a signed and verified EEVF I-9 form).  The request shall also state the specific reason for the visit request and the specific date(s) for which they are requesting access to Norfolk Naval Shipyard (i.e., date of delivery).

(2)	Material Shipments: Upon completion of the above documentation, vendors/contractors shall fax the letter to the Material Division (phone: 757-396-3141 and fax: 757-396-1029).

(3)	Service contractor:  Upon completion of the above documentation, vendors/contractors shall fax the letter to Technical Point of Contact listed in the contract.

NOTE:  PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING AS IT APPLIES TO NEW ACCESS REQUIREMENTS BEING IMPLEMENTED ON 1 October 2011

(d)  Commander, Navy Installations Command (CNIC), has established the Navy Commercial Access Control System (NCACS), a standardized process for granting unescorted access privileges to vendors, contractors, suppliers and service providers not otherwise entitled to the issuance of a Common Access Card (CAC) who seek access to and can provide justification to enter Navy installations and facilities.
  Visiting vendors may obtain daily passes directly from the individual Navy installations by submitting identification credentials for verification and undergoing a criminal screening / background check.  Alternatively, if the vendor so chooses, it may voluntarily elect to obtain long-term credentials through enrollment, registration, background vetting, screening, issuance of credentials, and electronic validation of credentials at its own cost through a designated independent contractor NCACS service provider.  Credentials will be issued every five years and access privileges will be reviewed / renewed on an annual basis.  The costs incurred to obtain Navy installation access of any kind are not reimbursable, and the price(s) paid for obtaining long-term NCACS credentials will not be approved as a direct cost of this contract.
  Further information regarding NCACS can be found at http://cnic.navy.mil/CNIC_HQ_Site/index.htm  (under Popular Links).

<DESC>   REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS<br />December 17, 2012<br /> <br />PERIOD OF PROPOSAL SUBMISSION ENDS:<br />January 11, 2013
<p>The U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission (hereafter "the Commission") invites submission of proposals to provide a one-time unclassified report on cloud computing in China, with particular emphasis on the role of the Chinese government and state-owned enterprises in developing China's cloud computing industry; how the social, legal, and regulatory environment in China may affect foreign consumers of Chinese cloud services; and risks or security issues for U.S. users of Chinese cloud computing services, including how information stored by Chinese cloud computing services might be susceptible to theft or exploitation, or how cloud computing infrastructure might be used to launch or enable cyber attacks.</p>
<p>ABOUT THE COMMISSION.  The Commission was established by Congress in 2000 to monitor and report to Congress on the economic and national security dimensions of the United States' trade and economic ties with the People's Republic of China. Further details about the Commission are available on its website at: www.uscc.gov.</p>
<p>The Commission solicits this research pursuant to its Congressional mandate (contained in 22 U.S.C. 7002), which states that "The Commission...shall investigate and report exclusively on...</p>
<p>"UNITED STATES-CHINA BILATERAL PROGRAMS.-Science and technology programs, the degree of non-compliance by the People's Republic of China with agreements between the United States and the People's Republic of China on prison labor imports and intellectual property rights, and United States enforcement policies with respect to such agreements."</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>"FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION.-The implications of restrictions on speech and access to information in the People's Republic of China for its relations with the United States in the areas of economic and security policy."</p>
<p>ABOUT PROPOSALS.  The Commission solicits proposals from organizations and individuals capable of providing a one-time unclassified report on cloud computing in China, with particular emphasis on the role of the Chinese government and state-owned enterprises in developing China's cloud computing industry; how the social, legal, and regulatory environment in China may affect foreign consumers of Chinese cloud services; and risks or security issues for U.S. users of Chinese cloud computing services, including how information stored by Chinese cloud computing services might be susceptible to theft or exploitation, or how cloud computing infrastructure might be used to launch or enable cyber attacks.</p>
<p>Key issues and questions to be addressed by the report are:</p>
<p>1.	Briefly define cloud computing. Is this term used the same way in the United States and China? Are there any differences between the countries' (i.e., in government or industry) views on the role and prospects for cloud computing?&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />2.	Detail the development of China's cloud computing efforts. Key questions include: When did they start? What is their level of capability vis-&agrave;-vis U.S. and other foreign providers? How does China's cloud deployment/penetration compare to the United States? How have U.S. firms helped in the development of China's cloud computing efforts (and vice versa, if applicable)? What roles have the Chinese government and Chinese state-owned enterprises played in China's cloud computing development?</p>
<p>3.	Explain the extent to which U.S. consumers use: 1) American- or Chinese-owned or operated cloud infrastructure in China, and 2) Chinese developed, owned, or operated cloud infrastructure outside of China. In each case, is information about China's role in this infrastructure transparent or available to consumers? To what extent are decisions to utilize this infrastructure made directly by consumers versus services providers? How do current market trends affect these decisions?</p>
<p>4.	Describe, from the perspective of a U.S. consumer, potential risks and security issues associated with the utilization of Chinese cloud infrastructure. Do Chinese firms offering cloud services provide information assurance services comparable to U.S. and other foreign counterparts? How does the social, legal, and regulatory environment in China affect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information stored or transmitted by Chinese cloud operations? How can cloud infrastructure be used for the purposes of censorship or to launch or enable cyber attacks? To what extent is information stored or transmitted by Chinese cloud systems susceptible to theft or exploitation? In each case, how do these potential risks and security vulnerabilities compare to services available from U.S. or other foreign providers?</p>
<p>5.	Assess the prospects for cloud computing in China. Will the technology become more widespread? If so, at what rate? How innovative are Chinese firms operating in the cloud market? Beyond the technology alone (i.e., also accounting for legal, regulatory, and market factors, such as potential subsidies), are U.S. firms favorably positioned to compete against Chinese firms in this sector?</p>
<p>Additional Requirements of the Commission:</p>
<p>1.	Prior to the award of any contract, the contractor must be registered in the federal System for Award Management (SAM).</p>
<p>2.	Once a contractor has been selected for this project by the Commission and a contract signed, public notice of this will be made on the Commission's website.</p>
<p>3.	The Commission's goal is to have a report prepared for review in a timely fashion.  In ordinary circumstances, once a contractor has been selected by the Commission and a contract signed, a draft of the report must be submitted to the Commission for review no later than 120 days from the date of issuance of the contract. The Commission will then endeavor to provide comments and requests for adjustments within 30 days; subsequently, the final report must be submitted within 30 days of formal receipt of the Commission's comments. The Commission recognizes that, under certain circumstances, a contractor may wish to have more time to prepare the first draft of the report under the contract.  The contractor, in their initial submission, should stipulate the time frame for submissions of the initial review draft.  It is to be understood, however, that time is of the essence in completing research contracts for the Commission.</p>
<p>4.	As work on the report progresses, the Commission's Research Coordinator shall act as a representative of the Commission in monitoring the progress, quality, and responsiveness of the report to the major issues of concern identified in the Request for Proposals (RFP). The Research Coordinator shall, on request to the contractor, be entitled to informal briefings on the status of the research work and to readings of the draft in progress.</p>
<p>5.	The report shall conform to the Chicago Manual of Style. Upon receipt of all drafts, the Commission will inspect the document for typographical errors or other deviations from the Chicago Manual of Style guidelines. At the discretion of the Commission, if a draft contains excessive deficiencies, the Commission will return the draft to the contractor with notice that the draft does not conform to the Chicago Manual of Style guidelines, and request the contractor cure the draft of deficiencies within five (5) working days (not counting weekends and Federal holidays). Upon resubmission of the draft by the contractor to the Commission, should deficiencies remain, the Commission, at its discretion, will submit the draft to its technical editor for correction, the cost of which ($55 per hour for text, $65 per hour for endnotes) will be deducted from the final cost of the contract. The contract shall be subject to termination if the Commission deems that the work is of unsatisfactory quality.</p>
<p>6.	At the Commission's discretion, the report procured via this RFP may be posted on the Commission's website.</p>
<p>7.	Each organization or individual responding to this request must warrant that they will perform this work solely for the Commission, and that the resulting report will not be shared with other parties without the prior written consent of the Commission.</p>
<p>8.	The Commission expects contractors to identify all personnel working on the contract, and that there will not be any delegation of responsibilities to other parties without prior written approval of the Commission.</p>
<p>9.	After completion of the report, the Commission staff, in consultation with the Contractor, will prepare a short summary of the research for posting on the Commission's web site and other media. The Commission staff shall consult with the contractor in preparing said document.</p>
<p>10.	At the discretion and request of the Commission, the contractor shall agree to participate in up for four (4) separate briefings, and up to one (1) public hearing, held by the Commission, of up to two (2) hours each in the Washington, D.C. area, supported by at least one (1) individual affiliated with the Contractor identified as "key personnel." This could include, but not necessarily be limited to, briefing the content of the research to Commissioners and Commission staff, appearing as witnesses at a public hearing held by the Commission, and briefing the content of the research to Members of Congress and/or their staff. No additional remuneration will be provided to the Contractor for these briefings or a hearing. The Commission will make a good faith effort to schedule briefings and a hearing at times that are subject to mutual agreement.</p>
<p>Primary Selection Criteria:</p>
<p>1.	The Commission will determine which organization or individual responding to this request will be awarded the contract based on a comprehensive "best value" analysis of the proposals received, to include costs, technical value, and ability to complete the work satisfactorily and on time, and past performance with the Commission, if applicable.</p>
<p>2.	The primary weighting criterion in selection shall be the assessed qualifications and ability of an organization or individual to address the fundamental research points enunciated above ("Key issues and questions to be addressed by the report").</p>
<p>3.	The cost and amount of time necessary to complete the report will also be considered as criteria in the selection process.</p>
<p>Proposal submissions should include:</p>
<p>1.	A statement of the applicant's relevant qualifications to satisfy the terms of this RFP, to include curricula vitae for personnel intended for work on the project.</p>
<p>2.	Identification of the principal researchers who will be responsible for the preparation of the report.   It is understood that the designation of the researchers is a critical element of the proposal, and any changes regarding which individuals will be involved in the report's preparation must be approved by the Commission in advance and in writing.</p>
<p>3.	A description of the research methodology the applicant proposes to employ. In describing methodology, the submission should provide detailed descriptions of the sources and methods that will be used to research the report's topic and the extent to which Chinese language sources, if any, and other primary materials will be used.</p>

<DESC>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS
It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 
Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). 
Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

All equipment must have clear traceability to the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM). Traceability means a clear, complete, documented, and auditable paper trail which traces each step from an OEM or distributor to its current location.
B.  STATEMENT OF WORK
1.  Components furnished hereunder shall be returned by the contractor in an airworthy condition and in all respects suitable for installation in U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) aircraft.  Certification and documentation requirements apply.  
2.  Components shall be serviced/modified in accordance with Federal Aviation Regulation Parts 43 and 145 or alternate standard approved in writing by the Engineering Division, USCG Aircraft Logistics Center (ALC).
  
3.  A DD Form 1577-2, Unserviceable (Repairable) Tag-Material, or a CG-1577-A (11-90), Unsatisfactory Report Tag, will be attached to each Not Ready for Issue (non-RFI) component describing faults.  Components shall be reworked/overhauled to correct the specific fault(s) identified.

4.  The contractor shall also perform a visual and technical inspection in accordance with the current applicable Component Maintenance Manual (CMM) and correct all additional deficiencies found.  This shall include replacement of broken parts and the removal of any foreign matter or corrosion.         

5.  Components returned for rework shall be overhauled when the Time-Since-Overhaul (TSO) is equal to or greater than 60% of the scheduled Time-Between-Overhaul (TBO) recommended by the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM).  However, in no case shall the price specified on the order be exceeded without written authorization from the Contracting Officer.  

6.  Corroded parts shall be replaced, except in those cases where removal of corrosion from a part will not impair the efficiency or safe operation of the part.  Corrosion removal and treatment of affected areas will be accomplished in accordance with the OEM specifications (or best commercial practices if not addressed by the OEM).

(i) warrants;
(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.

<DESC>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS
United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). 
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Parts 12.6 and 13, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Solicitation number HSCG38-13-Q-200022 is issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ).  This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-63.  The applicable North American Industry Classification Standard Code is 335911.  The small business size standard is 500 employees. The US Coast Guard Aviation Logistics Center intends to award a firm fixed price purchase order for the purchase of the following parts used on the Short Range Recovery (SRR) aircraft:

It is anticipated that a non-competitive order shall be awarded on a sole source basis as a result of this synopsis/solicitation. All parts must have clear traceability to the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), Saft America Inc. Traceability means a clear, complete, documented, and auditable paper trail which traces each step from an OEM or distributor to its current location.
It is the Government's belief that the OEM Saft America Inc. is the only source able to obtain the required technical and engineering data, required to successfully provide these items. Concerns having the expertise and required capabilities to provide these items are invited to submit offers in accordance with the requirements stipulated in this solicitation. No alternate part numbers will be accepted.  The Government will award a purchase order resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government.

Only the use of airworthy commercial specifications or standard military specifications/military standard parts will be utilized and approved from this solicitation.  Newly manufactured commercial items will only be procured from sources able to provide a certificate of airworthiness, FAA 8130 (preferred), a certificate of conformance and traceability to the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM).  The Federal Aviation Regulation, Part 21, outlines certification procedures.  Drawings and specifications are not available and cannot be furnished by the Government.  
Packaging, packing and preservation shall be in accordance with best commercial practices to enable shipment to destination and transshipment to Coast Guard units without repackaging or incurring damage during shipment and handling. Items shall be individually packaged and labeled. Labeling shall include the appropriate national Stock number, Part Number, Nomenclature, quantity, Delivery Order Number and Line Item number. Labeling data shall be attached to the outside of the shipping container. Bar coding is not required.

(a) Prohibitions.
Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause, or with any subsidiary of such an entity.  The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of national security.
(b) Definitions.  As used in this clause:
Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for at least 80 percent' each place it appears. Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)
(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.  Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.
(c) Special rules.  The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.
(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:
(i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.
(d) Special Rule for Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying section 835(b) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b) to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.
(e) Treatment of Certain Rights.
 (1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:
(i) warrants;
(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.
 (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.
(f) Disclosure. The offeror under this solicitation represents that [Check one]:

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />FAX: 202.475.3904 <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695</p>

<DESC>1. Laser. According to materials to be processed (especially<br />Polyimide) it looks like you need a pico-second (ps) laser. We have a<br />couple of different ps solutions. However, our most cost effective solution<br />is only 1.8W (~$40k less than other option). Would 1.8W be sufficient for<br />your application?
<p>ANSWER: At least 2.5W</p>
<p>2. Trepanning head. ATH-Alpha Laser Trepanning Head is mentioned. Is<br />this a strict requirement, or can other trepanning heads be used?</p>
<p>ANSWER: Others may be used</p>
<p>3. What is the required precision for the positioning stages? This<br />spec has a large affect upon the price.</p>
<p>ANSWER: XY stage +/- 1 um repeat accuracy at least +/- 7 um accuracy with a<br />1 um</p>
<p>4. For beam delivery only trepanning is specified. Do you need an<br />objective? If yes, will both the objective and trepanning head be mounted on<br />the same axis? What spot sizes are required?</p>
<p>ANSWER: No objective, diameter resolution 0.5 microns</p>
<p>5. Will you need online vision- through processing objective?</p>
<p>ANSWER: No</p>
<p>6. Auto alignment: Theoretically it is possible to do auto alignment<br />through the processing objective, but due to a very small field of view it<br />is quite complicated. Then it is rational to use a camera next to objective.<br />As a result, at least 100 mm of X travel shall be used only for travel<br />between camera and trepanning, another 100 mm between camera and objective.<br />Was this assumed?</p>
<p>ANSWER: Yes</p>
<p>7. In our experience, trepanning heads are designed only for 1064+532<br />nm wavelengths. I am almost sure that combination 355+532 in one unit is<br />not available. If this is the case, then should we only quote a 532nm<br />solution?</p>
<p>ANSWER: Yes</p>

<DESC>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester&rsquo;s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency&rsquo;s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security United States Coast Guard (CG-9131) Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 Washington, D.

Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause, or with any subsidiary of such an entity. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of national security. (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for `at least 80 percent' each place it appears. Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)&mdash; (1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held&mdash; (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: (i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) Stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to an acquisition described in section 835(b)(1) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1). (2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. (3) Certain transfers disregarded.

(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: (i) warrants; (ii) options; (iii) contracts to acquire stock; (iv) convertible debt instruments; and (v) others similar interests. (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.

<DESC><p><strong>THIS IS A SYNOPSIS OF PROPOSED CONTRACT ACTION. FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS CONTAINED IN THIS NOTICE FOR RESPONDING TO THIS OPPORTUNITY.</strong></p>
<p>The Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP), North Central Regional Office (NCRO), anticipates the need for a multiple award, indefinite delivery indefinite quantity (IDIQ), firm fixed-price contract for supplemental architect-engineering (A/E) services, with a one year base requirement and up to four option years. While the Government anticipates multiple awards, no more than two awards are expected.</p>
<p>The services will be for various BOP facilities in the North Central Region to include the states of Colorado, Illinois, Iowa, Indiana, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota, Wisconsin, and Wyoming. Disciplines and services may include, but are not limited to: architecture, electrical, mechanical, structural, civil and geotechnical engineering, elevator, life safety, fire safety, code-compliance, LEED certification, Section 106, hazardous material consultant services, life safety inspections, investigations, land surveys, materials testing services, comprehensive subsurface investigations, preparation of construction documents, estimates, bidding services, construction administration and/or assistance to BOP staff in the preparation of in-house designs or related work. Services may also include special studies, reports, programming, site evaluations, environmental assessment for remediation, and other associated work.</p>
<p>Most projects will take place in a fully occupied, fully operational, secure correctional environment. Most projects require complex design effort and detail along with extensive coordination between design disciplines, the institution, and the Regional Office during design and construction. Institutions, located at a total of seventeen (17) different site locations in the North Central Region, are comprised of two prison complexes, several institutions, satellite camps, and two hospitals. Projects at select institutions may involve issues of national security.</p>
<p>Given the close coordination needed between the successful firms and the Regional Office, selection of firms will be limited geographically to those located within a 50-mile radius of the North Central Regional Office, located at 400 State Avenue, Kansas City, Kansas 66101. Firms are to perform services as required by the issuance of individual task orders. The guaranteed annual minimum amount of each contract is $10,000.00 and the estimated annual maximum is $1,000,000.00. The maximum amount of any individual task order is $1,000,000.00. Services will be required for a one-year base period with four one-year option periods for a total of up to sixty months from the date of award.</p>
<p>The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code applicable to this requirement is 541310 (Architectural Services). Interested firms must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) at www.sam.gov which includes Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA). NAICS code 541310 must be included where applicable in the registrations (e.g. provision 52.219-1 of ORCA if representing as a small business). The current size standard for this NAICS code is $7 million average annual receipts for the firm's preceding three fiscal years.

<DESC>Added Amendment 001.
If viewing this announcement from a source other than Federal Aviation Administration Contract Opportunities (FAACO) website, please visit http://faaco.faa.gov/ for the original announcement.  Updates and or amendments will only be issued at http://faaco.faa.gov/. 
The purpose of this Request for Offers is to seek competent and qualified contractors to perform all work necessary to replace the chiller control panels on all 4 chillers at the Seattle Air Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC) located in Auburn, Washington in accordance with the specifications, drawings, contract clauses, and wage rates.   Magnitude of base construction is $100,000 - $250,000
The NAICS Code for this project is 238220.  SIR is open to all bidders Large and Small.  
The total contract duration for completion of all work shall be 45 calendar days after official notice to proceed for construction.
The following is a general description of the work: There are four (4) existing Trane 320 ton chillers installed in the Seattle ARTCC.  These chillers were installed in the early to mid-1990 and their control panels are obsolete types which are current not supported by the manufacturer.  These control panels are to be replaced with the newest variant of the Trane Adaptiview Control Panel Package.  This package is to contain the newest display, UC 800 Controller, mounting swing arm and the new control panel. Included in this project is the connection and full integration of the new control panel system with the facility's DDC system which consists of the Johnson Control's Metasys System.  The panels shall be programmed with all communication units of the English format and not the Metric format.  For example, Degree F shall be used not Degree C. Also included in this statement of work is the replacement of the conduit and wiring system of the Johnson Control's Metasys System to the three older Trane Chillers (CH 100, CH 400 and CH 500).  A single conduit may be run to the ceiling above these chillers; however, from this location three (3) separate conduits shall be run from this point to each of the three older chillers.  Chiller 200 is the newest of the four (4) chillers and is not included with the re-conduit and re-wiring effort.  The existing wiring and conduit for Chiller 200 may be re-used if possible.  The existing, old wiring shall be removed from the existing conduit for Chiller 100, Chiller 400 and Chiller 500.  This wiring is not to be abandoned in place.  This work shall be accomplished by JCI. The Tracer TU Service Tool shall be provided for work on the panels. Any and all associated work required to install and return the four chillers to full operation is included in this work.  This associated work includes but is not limited to removal and replacement of the control panels, removal and replacement of the refrigerant charge, marking and revisions to the control system wiring, removal and replacement of existing sensors, transducers, brackets, required pressure and vacuum testing, required or recommended oil changes and refrigerant dryer servicing.

<DESC>The General Services Administration (GSA) intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) for a Construction Manager as Constructor (CMc) to perform construction services on the Federal Office Building (FOB) Infrastructure Systems Replacement Project, in the Washington, DC Metropolitan Area. This is a classified project and each offeror shall possess the required Facility Security Clearance Level of Top Secret and required Level of Safeguarding capability of Top Secret in order to be considered eligible to bid upon this project and be issued a solicitation package. It is anticipated that classified technical data and documentation, up to the level of Top Secret will be utilized on the project. The project is anticipated to be awarded in October 2012 and includes both pre-construction phase services and construction phase services, over multiple years. This project is the second Phase of four Phases with each subsequent Phase extending services and systems of the entire project.&nbsp;<strong>(ADDED 5/6/2012)&nbsp;&nbsp;This presolicitation is only for the Phase II portion of the project.&nbsp; If funding becomes available for any other Phases then GSA will solicit for the construction services on a per phase basis.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; The estimated construction cost range for this phase of the project is $50 to $100 million dollars. GSA intends to negotiate the award of a Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP) Contract for the Construction Manager as Constructor (CMc) Services. All work will be performed in accordance with GSA authorized and approved standards. The selection process will utilize source selection procedures in accordance with FAR Part 15.3. The selection procedure will employ tradeoffs and the technical/management factors are considered to be significantly more important than price and price related factors.
<p>The four technical factors are described hereinafter.</p>
<p>FACTOR 1: Past Performance - Offeror's must demonstrate successful experience on at least two (2) similar projects completed within the past (8) years.</p>
<p>Definition of Similar project is: "a project comparable in scope of work and on occupied and fully functional facilities and sites, as well as with construction adjacencies."</p>
<p>All similar projects must meet the type and complexity of all the following characteristics: (1) The project involved new utility services connections to new utility infrastructure, site work, renovations to an existing historically significant building that included substantial classified scope of work (including Top Secret) incorporating demolition and hazardous materials abatement and remediation, civil, architectural, historic preservation and restoration, structural, roofing, electrical, emergency power, telecommunications/IT systems, physical security systems, mechanical, plumbing, and fire life safety and protection systems; (2) The project required coordination to maintain continuity of operations in all or some of the occupied spaces of the existing building and/or adjacent building(s) along with maintaining all existing utilities during construction;(3) The project involved environmental controls that included but were not limited to temperature, humidity, vibration mitigation, dust and noise control; (4) The project involved secured site access and a restricted site with limited space for material staging along with the requirement to maintain pedestrian and vehicular traffic flow around the site;(5) The total project construction cost at time of contract award was not less than $50 million.</p>
<p>Further, of critical importance to the Government, is compliance with the construction schedule for this phase of the project. It is imperative that all offeror's be able to clearly demonstrate how they successfully managed both pre-construction and construction phase schedules for their identified comparable projects. The offeror's will be required to clearly articulate how they successfully managed and scheduled their staff, project subcontractor personnel, materials, equipment and other applicable resources necessary to comply with established projects intermediate milestone dates, final completion dates and final commissioning and punch-list completion dates.</p>
<p>FACTOR 2: Key Personnel</p>
<p>FACTOR 3: Understanding of Requirements/Management Approach/Subcontracting Plan/Schedule.</p>

<DESC><br />SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUCEMENT (SYNOPSIS): The purpose of this announcement is a MARKET SURVEY to determine the interest and capability of Small Business, HUBZone, 8(a) or Service Disabled Veteran Owned Business contractors for the following proposed 2-Step Design-Build Project: Convert, Remodel, and bring up to code a currently excess Unaccompanied Personnel Housing facility located at Arctic Avenue and 3rd Street on Fort Greely (Building 660), Alaska. Responsible sources having relevant experience and capabilities to perform the required work will be considered for determining the acquisition strategy for the subject project.
<p>This Sources Sought announcement is part of a market survey for information only to be used for preliminary planning purposes. No proposals are being requested or accepted with this synopsis. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS AND NO CONTRACT WILL BE AWARDED FROM THIS SYNOPSIS. PROJECT IS SUBJECT TO AVAILABILITY OF FUNDS.</p>
<p>PROJECT INFORMATION: Convert, remodel, and bring up to code a currently excess Unaccompanied Personnel Housing facility located at Arctic Avenue and 3rd Street on Fort Greely (Building 660). Facility is to be converted to three category codes: 14183, 14185, and 73016. Specifically, the 1st floor will be designed for 73016 (Emergency Services/Police Station), the 2nd and 3rd floors will be designed for 14183 (Battalion Headquarters) and 14185 (Company Operations Facility). The bottom floor will be used for "common" functions such as arms rooms, supply rooms, and an EST trainer.</p>
<p>Building 660 is a 4-story building constructed in 1961 as an UPH barracks with dormitory rooms, gang latrines, food preparation, dining and administrative functions. The 1995 Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) action caused the majority of the building to become uninhabitable through 15 years of non-use and minimal maintenance. The 51,000 SF of UPH space has been listed as excess since Fort Greely was withdrawn from Army Surplus by Missile Defense Agency (MDA) in 2002. Major components of the facility are failing or have failed resulting in a current ISR-I rating Black. Currently the Network Enterprise Center (NEC) has equipment space for various wireless telecommunication systems and the Armed Forces Network.

Offerors are requested to respond to this Sources Sought Synopsis.    <br>      <br>   Responses are requested only from: POTENTIAL SMALL BUSINESS CONTRACTORS that have the knowledge, skills and capability to perform the work concerning the potential project described below.   <br>      <br>   Responses are to be sent via email to david.w.neal@usace.army.mil no later than 4:00 p.m. Central Time, 21 December 2012.   <br>      <br>   Scope of Work:   <br>      <br>   The US Army Corps of Engineers Omaha District is currently performing an erodibility study for the spillway feature of Pipestem Dam (see Figure 1). Pipestem Dam is located northwest of the city of Jamestown, North Dakota. The area currently being considered is slightly over 100 acres in size and is shown in Figure 1 by the highlighted flat area southwest of the embankment. The boundary of the geophysical investigations shall extend to a minimum of 100 feet beyond the limits of the spillway floor.    <br>      <br>   The Contractor shall perform geophysical testing in support of site characterization efforts to meet the following project objectives:  1) Define the depth to bedrock across the study area, 2) Provide gross lithologic data regarding the overburden materials, and 3) Provide detailed lithologic data of the upper 60 feet of unconsolidated materials. The depth of investigations for objectives 1 and 2 above shall be approximately 150 feet below ground surface for estimating purposes. Data density shall be sufficient to provide a 3-dimensional portrayal of the top of bedrock. These objectives may be achieved by collecting time-domain electromagnetic (TDEM) data.  The total line length is 23,000 feet for estimating purposes. The Contractor may adjust this estimated footage; however, all changes must come with justification for increasing or decreasing the total footage required to meet the project objectives. The number of transects required to meet the objectives outlined above shall be proposed by the Contractor.  The Contractor shall acquire the TDEM data to map lateral and vertical variations in the ground conductivity.  Along line station spacing shall not exceed 2 meters in order to provide a continuous profile of the subsurface conductivity variability.  TDEM data should be coupled with sub-meter accuracy GPS to aid in follow-up investigations.   <br>      <br>   The geophysical system used for collecting the time-domain data must be a mobile system. In addition, since very near surface data is being collected, the geophysical receiver, when combined with the appropriate transmitter, must be capable of remote control operation, high-speed data transfer, and capable of very short turnoff times (1.5 microsecond shutoff into a 3- to 5-meter loop) in order to provide higher resolution imaging.   <br>      <br>   The Contractor shall obtain all necessary permits, licenses, and approvals from all local, state, and federal authorities as are necessary for the performance of the Contractor's services.  The Government will obtain any required access agreements with property owners, their representative, or agent, on properties not controlled by the Government.   <br>      <br>   The Contractor shall prepare all necessary planning documents to include, at a minimum, an abbreviated site-specific draft and final Work Plan and Site Safety and Health Plan.  As appropriate, the Work Plan shall include the results of any forward modeling performed to help interpret the production data or to constrain those earth models derived from the production survey data.   <br>      <br>   The Contractor shall prepare a draft and final report.  Drawings and sketches shall be prepared as required to present details and results of the investigation.  The scale and quality of the drawings shall be appropriate for the purpose intended.   <br>      <br>   Please include the following information in your response/narrative:    <br>     Company name, address, and point of contact, with (h)er/is phone number and email address   <br>     Duns number and CAGE Code for your company   <br>     Offeror's business size to include designation as Certified Small Businesses, HUBZone Certified Small Business Concerns, Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses and Women Owned Small Businesses   <br>     Offeror's capability to perform, to include geographic span, logistic complexity, and project size    <br>     Details of similar projects and state whether you were the Prime or subcontractor   <br>     Project references (including owner with phone number and email address)   <br>      <br>   Comments will be shared with the Government and the project management team, but otherwise will be held in strict confidence.   <br>      <br>      <br>

<AWARDEE>COMPUSEARCH SOFTWARE SYSTEMS, INC. 21251 Ridgetop CIR STE 100 Dulles, VA20166-6501
<DESC>NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION NASA SHARED SERVICES CENTER LIMITED SOURCE JUSTIFICATION I recommend that NASA, NASA Shared Services Center negotiate with Compusearch Software Systems, Inc. (Compusearch), only for the continued maintenance of the Agencys PRISM software.  This action will be performed by awarding a follow-on task order against Compusearchs General Services Administration (GSA) Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) GS-35F-0585J.  The total Firm-Fixed Price (FFP) of this effort is about XXXX.XX.   The period of performance is 18 months which includes a base period of 6 months (January 01, 2013 through June 30, 2013) and four 3-month option periods (July 01, 2013 through September 30, 2013; October 01, 2013 through December 31, 2013; January 01, 2014 through March 31, 2014; April 01, 2014 through July 11, 2014). Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) awarded the previous delivery order to Compusearch under task order NNM11AA53T.  The file transferred to the NSSC for administration on August 22, 2011.  The NSSC will continue to function as the contract administration office; however, the requesting activity will remain in place at the MSFC.  This new task order is a follow-on to the MSFC award for the PRISM software maintenance of the Contract Management Module (CMM).  CMM is the contract writing system used by NASA.  The requirement consists or renewing the annual software maintenance services for the Agency's PRISM software license which currently supports 1,000 users.  Maintenance requirements under the new task order will consist of the following: 	Delivery of Releases, Service Packs, Technical Bulletins, Manual Updates, and other Licensed Materials.  Software Maintenance support via telephone, remote support/update, and Compusearch's On-line Footprint System. 	Software maintenance includes support for the PRISM Document Generation module, Receiving module, Interagency Agreement module, Invoice module, FPDS-NG interface, Grants module including NASA customizations, APP module, Source Selection module, NASA user specific database updates, Multi-Select customization, Single Sign On customization, FPDS-NG interface customization, updates to PRISM award to SAP interface including XML trigger, and Grants interface. 	 Compusearch Database Administrator (GSA  Gold Plan) support. This recommendation is also made pursuant to FAR 8.405-6(b)(2), which implements the authority of the Multiple Award Schedule (MAS) Program cited in FAR 8.401 pursuant to Title III of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (41 U.S.C. 251) and Title 40 U.S.C 501, Services for Executive Agencies, for the acquisition of supplies or services when the work is a logical follow-on to an original Federal Supply Schedule order, not previously issued under sole source or limited source procedures, that was placed in accordance with applicable Federal Supply Schedule ordering procedures. Competition is impractical for the following reasons: 1.	Only one source is capable of responding due to the unique specialized nature of the work. As maintenance is an ongoing set of various activities (patches, updates, system integration) it is not feasible to bring in a new contractor to perform work that is dependent on previous work that has been completed.	Only Compusearch has the requisite capabilities to continue performing the specialized requirements. 2.	Market research among FSS holder was conducted via internet searches through the GSA eLibrary.  Based on the results of the research it is confirmed that no other companies are authorized by Compusearch to provide PRISM software maintenance.. 3.	No other supplies or services will satisfy the agencys requirements and no other provider can supply a similar service. 4.	No other vendor has access to detailed and timely knowledge of Compusearchs existing and emerging product set, especially with regard to ongoing development and product planning which directly benefits NASAs ongoing activities to improve procurement management throughout the Agency. 5.	Compusearch is solely positioned to support NASAs implementation of its new product capabilities\ enhancement due to their detailed knowledge that has been obtained via the existing contract vehicle (NNM11AA53T) and the previous contract vehicle (NNC05QA05D) which has been in existence since 2004. Pursuant to FAR 8.404, BPAs or orders placed against a MAS, using the procedures in this subpart, are considered to be issued using full and open competition (see 6.102(d)(3)). Therefore, when establishing a BPA (as authorized by 13.303-2(c)(3)), or placing orders under Federal Supply Schedule contracts using the procedures of 8.405, ordering activities shall not seek competition outside of the Federal Supply Schedules or synopsize the requirement.   However, the Limited Source Justification will be synopsized within 14 days after award pursuant to FAR 8.405-6(a)(2). Pursuant to FAR 8.404 (d) Pricing.  Services offered on the schedule are priced either at hourly rates, or at a fixed price performance of a specific task (e.g., maintenance). GSA has already determined the prices of supplies and fixed-price services, and rates for services offered at hourly rates, under schedule contracts to be fair and reasonable. Therefore, ordering activities are not required to make a separate determination of fair and reasonable pricing, except for a price evaluation as required by 8.405-2(d). Notwithstanding, the NSSC will seek additional pricing discounts pursuant to FAR 8.405-4 before placing the order. Due to the specialized nature of this requirement, there are no known actions which the agency may take to remove or overcome barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the services required.	Therefore, purchase of the services from Compusearch, is the only practical approach. I hereby certify the facts in this justification and any supporting data used for this justification are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge.

The Bus transfer schemes and related control wiring, modifications to the deck opening for metal-enclosed bus passage, and 120 volt lighting circuit conductors are also performance oriented and will involve some element of Contractor-design. The contractor shall perform all necessary work required to have a completely operational switchyard once complete. This shall include all control, relay, annunciation, status, and power wiring necessary. Unless stated otherwise, all equipment, structures, devices, etc shown as being removed, it shall be the responsibility of the contractor to dispose of such equipment. <br>  <br> Note No. 1: United States government is not responsible for providing you with notifications of any changes to this solicitation.

<p>JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL (J&amp;A)<br />FOR<br />OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION</p>
<p>I. CONTRACTING ACTIVITY</p>
<p>a. Contracting Activity:</p>
<p>Aeronautical Systems Center, Enterprise Acquisition Contracting Division (ASC/PKE)<br />2275 D Street<br />Wright-Patterson AFB, OH 45433-7228</p>
<p>POC: Jason Cadek<br />(937) 656-7499<br />E-Mail: Jason.Cadek@wpafb.af.mil</p>
<p>b. Program Activity: All Air Force (AF) Commands are directed to manage their individual Contracting Engineering and Technical Services (CETS) requirements under AFI 21-110, Engineering and Technical Services Management and Control guidelines.</p>
<p>II. NATURE AND/OR DESCRIPTION OF THE ACTION BEING PROCESSED</p>
<p>a. CETS is the medium through which AF units use contractor personnel to provide on-site proficiency training, technical advice and technical assistance when organic skills are not available. The CETS may be acquired to support Air Force Security Assistance Center (AFSAC), the Army, the Navy, the Air National Guard (ANG) and possibly the Coast Guard for various weapon systems/subsystems/equipment located at operational AF, ANG, Army, Navy and Coast Guard installations.</p>
<p>b. This Class J&amp;A covers contractual actions for CETS to be awarded for 01 January 2011-31 December 2015. The total estimated number of contracts to be covered for the 5-year period of performance (01 January 2011-31 December 2015) is 10, for an estimated amount of $140.25M. This estimate is based on each Commands' projected CETS requirements, based on historical data, for the 5-year period covered by this Class J&amp;A. Contracts will be awarded and task orders issued only after corresponding requirements have been validated by HQ USAF/ILMM and Commands have issued purchase request packages to ASC/PKESN. The exact number of contracts/task orders and estimated amounts cannot be precisely determined as Commands are continually eliminating and adding CETS representatives, at their respective bases, each year as requirements materialize.</p>
<p>c. The CETS support weapon systems such as F-22 A/C, F-16 A/C, F-15 A/C, KC-135 A/C and A-10 A/C, which is in direct support for the aircrafts in the AFPEO/AC Portfolio. All AF activities that have CETS requirements must submit, on an annual basis, their HAF-ILM (A) 7150 (or its equivalent) to HQ USAF/ILM. This report includes precise narrative justifications for each CETS requirement including a list of the prime contractors. In accordance with AFI 21-110, Engineering and Technical Services, HQ USAF/ILMM reviews and validates these requirements on an annual basis. HQ USAF/ILMM maintains these reports.</p>
<p>d. Contracts will generally be awarded during the September-December timeframe prior to the start of each year of performance. The contracts are based on the calendar year with a period of performance beginning 01 January and ending 31 December. All CETS contracts are service contracts, which are requirement contracts, with task orders issued against them. The funding is obligated to each task order issued against the basic contract on a yearly basis. Any CETS contracts that contain AFMC requirements will have a separate Requirements Approval Document (RAD) per contract covering the entire period of performance. All non-Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC) requirements will provide the appropriate Advisory and Assistance Services (A&amp;AS) documents and Determination/Decision Document (DDD). The CETS contracts/task orders utilize fixed price man-month or man-day contracts with cost reimbursement Contract Line Item Number (CLIN) for personnel support expenditures such as official travel and in some instances, relocation. All CETS contracts are awarded in accordance with AFI 21-110.</p>
<p>e. CETS is not a typical program managed by ASC. The CETS program is unique because it does not have any Program Managers, Financial Managers, Logisticians or Engineers involved within the CETS contracting organization. Those functions are performed within the requiring activities, not within the CETS Contracting Office.</p>
<p>III. DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES/SERVICES REQUIRED TO MEET THE AGENCY'S NEEDS</p>
<p>a. The AF acquires CETS for specialized on-site technical nonpersonal services that are essential in accomplishing the assigned mission of the equipment and/or weapon systems. The CETS contracts provide a method by which the contractor can provide new/updated information to the using command on new and/or complex equipment and weapon systems in the AF inventory. The CETS contracts also encompass on-the-job training of AF maintenance personnel by employees of the original equipment manufacturers. The CETS representative's main duties consist of the following:<br />&bull; Give on-site technical advice and hands-on training on all aspects of equipment maintenance and operations including modifications and retrofits;<br />&bull; Advise and train on special tools, handling equipment, test equipment and other related items;<br />&bull; Comply with and emphasize safety precautions and comply with Voluntary Protection Program requirements on applicable bases;<br />&bull; Provide maintenance and operational information from the manufacturer;<br />&bull; Assist in mishap investigations and failure data reporting;<br />&bull; Perform direct maintenance only under unusual or emergency circumstances.</p>
<p>b. Air Force Engineering and Technical Services (AFETS) are the primary source of Engineering and Technical Services (ETS) support in the AF. AFETS field engineers are used and retrained as necessary to meet technical needs. CETS is an important element in developing an organic AF capability (insourcing) for its systems. In accordance with AFI 21-110, CETS personnel may not be retained on contract beyond which time AFETS personnel have attained proficiency on assigned systems and can provide the technical assistance associated with CETS support.</p>
<p>c. All of the CETS contractors are original equipment manufacturers (OEM)s. The OEMs have successfully provided engineering and technical support over the past 30 years. The CETS OEMs place highly trained personnel in the field to train AF maintenance teams. The AF personnel continually evaluate, through weapon system and team performance, the quality of service these CETS personnel provide. Since a majority of CETS contracts are follow-on, the technical capabilities of the CETS personnel have already been validated.<br />d. The type of funding that the AF CETS program uses is 3400 appropriations or operations and maintenance funds (O&amp;M). All other services/agencies will provide their appropriate O&amp;M funding. For any CETS Foreign Military Sales (FMS), AFSAC will provide the appropriate funding and will be sole source designated by the Letter of Offer and Acceptance (LOA)/International Agreement Competitive Restrictions (IACR) for individual contracts instead of this Class J&amp;A. <br />IV. STATUTORY AUTHORITY PERMITTING OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION</p>
<p>The statutory authority which permits other than full and open competition for this class of contract actions is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii). In the case of each individual contract, there is only one responsible source and no other services will satisfy agency requirements. Under this Class J&amp;A the requirements are deemed to be available only from the original source (OEM) for the continued provision of highly specialized services.</p>
<p>V. DEMONSTRATION THAT THE CONTRACTOR'S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS OR NATURE OF THE ACQUISITION REQUIRES THE USE OF THE AUTHORITY CITED ABOVE (APPLICABILITY OF AUTHORITY)<br /><br />a. For each acquisition awarded under the authority of this J&amp;A, the agencies' minimum needs can only be satisfied by unique services available from one source (the OEMs). The OEM contractors possess the necessary proprietary data required to provide on-site CETS technical training. The AF lacks the expert resources and data necessary to establish an organic capability for these services when weapon systems/equipment or modifications thereto are initially fielded. The services are contracted from the manufacturer of the equipment or weapon systems in accordance with the policies and procedures in AFI 21-110. Only OEM CETS supported contracts have the ability to reach any specific expert at any time. Therefore, this acquisition is for continued performance of a highly specialized service.</p>
<p>b. The OEM contractors also provide critical, updated technical data to the CETS representatives in the field. The original technical data is acquired by the government during the initial acquisition of the system/subsystem. At times the technical data is ambiguous and the OEM provides the expertise for interpretation. Furthermore, the expertise of the OEM contractor's research, development, manufacturing and administrative teams, buoyed by the learning curve effect of the manufacturing redesigning, modification and refining process, is not available outside the original equipment manufacturers. Additionally, the OEM contractors are highly trained, possess many years of experience, as well as being certified by the OEM on the different types of equipment that they will be training the AF to use/maintain.</p>
<p>c. Acquisition of engineering drawings from the prime contractor, OEM, is often lengthy and time consuming. Frequently, the OEM contractor can supply the drawings through their CETS representatives within hours, thus enhancing the operating Commands' ability to make a major decision that affects the safe operations of very expensive weapon systems during combat situations. There are times when the ALC will have to go to a manufacturer for drawing support because the center does not have the system knowledge to support a request. Having the CETS representative available eliminates this time consuming procedure and increases the operational readiness of warfighting systems.</p>
<p>d. ASC/PKESN believes that award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition and unacceptable delays in fulfilling the AF's requirements. The OEMs are designated as sole source for CETS provided in support of AF major subdivisions such as AFMC, Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC), Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC), Air Education and Training Command (AETC), Air Mobility Command (AMC), Pacific Air Forces (PACAF), Air Combat Command (ACC), United States Air Forces in Europe (USAFE), Air Force Space Command (AFSPC) and the ANG. Due to the fact that technical data and expertise are not available except from the OEMs, award to any other source would result in unacceptable and unreliable training for our AF maintenance teams and a critical increase in weapon systems downtime. Based on the reasons stated previously, it is also likely that award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost as a result of required reverse engineering on the different weapon systems/equipment or modifications in order for any other source to provide the required training, which would take numerous years. The process of reverse engineering for each different weapon systems/equipment or modifications would be substantially expensive that it would duplicate previously incurred costs for developing, manufacturing and training individuals so that the company would be able to provide individuals to perform CETS duties. There is not any way to provide an estimate for the duplication cost for the different weapon systems/equipment or modifications for CETS, since the original cost for each of the individual programs are not known to ASC/PKESN. It would be too costly to request the OEMs to research and provide the total costs for each individual program from research and development through production. None of the excess cost for reverse engineering would likely be recovered through competition and would also result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling agency requirements due to the fact that the entire process would be too time consuming.</p>
<p>e. Accordingly, OEMs are the only firms capable of providing the services described in Section III above without the USAF experiencing substantial duplication of cost that could not be expected to be recovered through competition and unacceptable delays in fulfilling its requirements.</p>
<p><br />VI. DESCRIPTION OF EFFORTS MADE TO ENSURE THAT OFFERS ARE SOLICITED FROM AS MANY POTENTIAL SOURCES AS DEEMED PRACTICABLE<br /><br />A synopsis was published on 13 August 2009 in the FedBizOpps following coordination with the Small Business Office. No sources have formally responded. A prior synopsis, for the FY 08-FY 10 program, also did not produce any new sources. Individual contract synopses published over the past 6 years have not produced any new qualified sources beyond the OEMs. All CETS basic contracts, that meet the criteria set forth in FAR 5.3, will be synopsized in an individual Notice of Contract Action.</p>
<p>VII. DETERMINATION BY THE CONTRACTING OFFICER THAT THE ANTICIPATED COST TO THE GOVERNMENT WILL BE FAIR AND REASONABLE</p>
<p>Fair and reasonable price determination on individual contract actions will be made based upon the results from various tools such as audits, technical evaluations and historical information. The requiring agencies provide a DD255a with each contract requirement which contains an independent government estimate for the calendar year. All proposed program costs will be thoroughly analyzed for each contract action. Contractors will be required to submit cost or pricing data to support the government's evaluation of the proposed price (in accordance with TINA threshold). When an audit is required, the technical evaluations will be provided by the Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA) and audit assistance from the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA). When under the TINA threshold, analysis will be performed by contacting DCAA for recommended rates and factors and by comparison to other PKESN CETS contracts. These methods will provide the contracting officer with adequate knowledge to determine a fair and reasonable price.</p>
<p>VIII. DESCRIPTION OF THE MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED AND THE RESULTS, OR A STATEMENT OF THE REASONS MARKET RESEARCH WAS NOT CONDUCTED</p>
<p>As described previously in Section VI, market research, in accordance with FAR Part 10, was conducted by synopsis of the proposed acquisition, advising industry of the pending acquisition and soliciting inquiries from interested parties. No inquiries were made regarding the synopsis. Furthermore, market research for CETS over the past 30 years has not generated any successful new sources other than the OEMs.</p>
<p>IX. ANY OTHER FACTS SUPPORTING THE USE OF OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION</p>
<p>a. ASC/PKESN experience has been that the various commands that CETS supports have contracted for Interim Contract Support (ICS) CETS personnel to support the USAF because the new systems are so intensive with computer driven devices that hardware/software changes and technical data are late-to-need. The manufacturer normally has the task of maintaining the technical data/software baseline for the USAF. Until the total engineering support is transferred to the responsible Air Logistics Center (ALC), the manufacturer has the only master file of current technical data.<br />b. There are many components and hardware support items that are coded weapon system peculiar. The manufacturer has the specification data to cross-reference these items and provide alternative part numbers and specification numbers that can be substituted for installation on a component. As the weapon system matures, the AF develops the cross-reference tables at the ALCs and provides adequate support. This support is critical until in-house capabilities are developed.</p>
<p>c. Procurement of engineering drawings from the prime contractor (OEM) is often lengthy and time consuming. Frequently, the OEM contractor can supply the drawings through their CETS representatives within hours, thus enhancing the operating Commands' ability to make a major decision that affects the safe operations of very expensive weapon systems during combat situations. There are times when the ALC will have to go to a manufacturer for drawing support because the Center does not have the workforce to support a request. Having the CETS representative available eliminates this time consuming procedure and increases the operational rate of warfighting systems.</p>
<p>d. The Commands' statements of work will define all requirements to deliver a full-up operational weapons system to a combat unit. Frequently during the process of production, modifications/changes are made that affect the end product causing a shortfall in technical data, software and hardware for subsystems when the initial system is fielded. The CETS representatives are often the only link between and operating unit and the company to solve the problem.</p>
<p>e. The minimum needs of the government for data and data rights have been determined according to DFARS 227.71. No technical data will be purchased or generated by contracts awarded under the authority of this J&amp;A. Only services and related travel support costs, as defined and approved under the procedures set forth in AFI 21-110, can be purchased under the authority of this J&amp;A.</p>
<p>X. LIST OF SOURCES, IF ANY, THAT EXPRESSED INTEREST IN THE ACQUISITION</p>
<p>See Section VI above.</p>
<p>XI. A STATEMENT OF THE ACTIONS, IF ANY, THE AGENCY MAY TAKE TO REMOVE OR OVERCOME ANY BARRIERS TO COMPETITION BEFORE MAKING SUBSEQUENT ACQUISITIONS FOR THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES REQUIRED</p>
<p>The expertise required to provide CETS on a specified piece of equipment or weapon system is not normally available from other than the prime manufacturer. As the equipment/weapon system remains in the AF inventory, the possibility of the AF having trained personnel experienced on the contractor's equipment increases. This organic capability will result in the contracted services being eliminated. Other than organic capability, obtaining open competition is not practical due to the constant changes in the equipment/weapon system and lack of updated technical data being readily available.</p>
<p>XII. CONTRACTING OFFICER'S CERTIFICATION</p>
<p>The contracting officer's signature on the coordination and approval document evidences that he/she has determined this document to be both accurate and complete to the best of his/her knowledge and belief (FAR 6.303-2(a)(12)).</p>
<p>XIII. TECHNICAL/REQUIREMENTS PERSONNEL'S CERTIFICATION</p>
<p>As CETS support extends to multiple platforms and multiple users contracted through ASC/PKESN, per AFI 21-110, there is not a single POC for technical/requirements. Each using activity provides their requirements to ASC/PKESN through a DD255a per the AFI. As evidenced by his/her signature on the coordination and approval document, the Contracting Officer acting as the coordinator for all program managers has certified that any supporting data contained herein which is the using activities responsibility is both accurate and complete (FAR 6.303-2(b)).</p>

<p>JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL (J&amp;A)<br />FOR<br />OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION</p>
<p>I. CONTRACTING ACTIVITY</p>
<p>a. Contracting Activity:</p>
<p>Aeronautical Systems Center, Enterprise Acquisition Contracting Division (ASC/PKE)<br />2275 D Street<br />Wright-Patterson AFB, OH 45433-7228</p>
<p>POC: Jason Cadek<br />(937) 656-7499<br />E-Mail: Jason.Cadek@wpafb.af.mil</p>
<p>b. Program Activity: All Air Force (AF) Commands are directed to manage their individual Contracting Engineering and Technical Services (CETS) requirements under AFI 21-110, Engineering and Technical Services Management and Control guidelines.</p>
<p>II. NATURE AND/OR DESCRIPTION OF THE ACTION BEING PROCESSED</p>
<p>a. CETS is the medium through which AF units use contractor personnel to provide on-site proficiency training, technical advice and technical assistance when organic skills are not available. The CETS may be acquired to support Air Force Security Assistance Center (AFSAC), the Army, the Navy, the Air National Guard (ANG) and possibly the Coast Guard for various weapon systems/subsystems/equipment located at operational AF, ANG, Army, Navy and Coast Guard installations.</p>
<p>b. This Class J&amp;A covers contractual actions for CETS to be awarded for 01 January 2011-31 December 2015. The total estimated number of contracts to be covered for the 5-year period of performance (01 January 2011-31 December 2015) is 10, for an estimated amount of $140.25M. This estimate is based on each Commands' projected CETS requirements, based on historical data, for the 5-year period covered by this Class J&amp;A. Contracts will be awarded and task orders issued only after corresponding requirements have been validated by HQ USAF/ILMM and Commands have issued purchase request packages to ASC/PKESN. The exact number of contracts/task orders and estimated amounts cannot be precisely determined as Commands are continually eliminating and adding CETS representatives, at their respective bases, each year as requirements materialize.</p>
<p>c. The CETS support weapon systems such as F-22 A/C, F-16 A/C, F-15 A/C, KC-135 A/C and A-10 A/C, which is in direct support for the aircrafts in the AFPEO/AC Portfolio. All AF activities that have CETS requirements must submit, on an annual basis, their HAF-ILM (A) 7150 (or its equivalent) to HQ USAF/ILM. This report includes precise narrative justifications for each CETS requirement including a list of the prime contractors. In accordance with AFI 21-110, Engineering and Technical Services, HQ USAF/ILMM reviews and validates these requirements on an annual basis. HQ USAF/ILMM maintains these reports.</p>
<p>d. Contracts will generally be awarded during the September-December timeframe prior to the start of each year of performance. The contracts are based on the calendar year with a period of performance beginning 01 January and ending 31 December. All CETS contracts are service contracts, which are requirement contracts, with task orders issued against them. The funding is obligated to each task order issued against the basic contract on a yearly basis. Any CETS contracts that contain AFMC requirements will have a separate Requirements Approval Document (RAD) per contract covering the entire period of performance. All non-Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC) requirements will provide the appropriate Advisory and Assistance Services (A&amp;AS) documents and Determination/Decision Document (DDD). The CETS contracts/task orders utilize fixed price man-month or man-day contracts with cost reimbursement Contract Line Item Number (CLIN) for personnel support expenditures such as official travel and in some instances, relocation. All CETS contracts are awarded in accordance with AFI 21-110.</p>
<p>e. CETS is not a typical program managed by ASC. The CETS program is unique because it does not have any Program Managers, Financial Managers, Logisticians or Engineers involved within the CETS contracting organization. Those functions are performed within the requiring activities, not within the CETS Contracting Office.</p>
<p>III. DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES/SERVICES REQUIRED TO MEET THE AGENCY'S NEEDS</p>
<p>a. The AF acquires CETS for specialized on-site technical nonpersonal services that are essential in accomplishing the assigned mission of the equipment and/or weapon systems. The CETS contracts provide a method by which the contractor can provide new/updated information to the using command on new and/or complex equipment and weapon systems in the AF inventory. The CETS contracts also encompass on-the-job training of AF maintenance personnel by employees of the original equipment manufacturers. The CETS representative's main duties consist of the following:<br />&bull; Give on-site technical advice and hands-on training on all aspects of equipment maintenance and operations including modifications and retrofits;<br />&bull; Advise and train on special tools, handling equipment, test equipment and other related items;<br />&bull; Comply with and emphasize safety precautions and comply with Voluntary Protection Program requirements on applicable bases;<br />&bull; Provide maintenance and operational information from the manufacturer;<br />&bull; Assist in mishap investigations and failure data reporting;<br />&bull; Perform direct maintenance only under unusual or emergency circumstances.</p>
<p>b. Air Force Engineering and Technical Services (AFETS) are the primary source of Engineering and Technical Services (ETS) support in the AF. AFETS field engineers are used and retrained as necessary to meet technical needs. CETS is an important element in developing an organic AF capability (insourcing) for its systems. In accordance with AFI 21-110, CETS personnel may not be retained on contract beyond which time AFETS personnel have attained proficiency on assigned systems and can provide the technical assistance associated with CETS support.</p>
<p>c. All of the CETS contractors are original equipment manufacturers (OEM)s. The OEMs have successfully provided engineering and technical support over the past 30 years. The CETS OEMs place highly trained personnel in the field to train AF maintenance teams. The AF personnel continually evaluate, through weapon system and team performance, the quality of service these CETS personnel provide. Since a majority of CETS contracts are follow-on, the technical capabilities of the CETS personnel have already been validated.<br />d. The type of funding that the AF CETS program uses is 3400 appropriations or operations and maintenance funds (O&amp;M). All other services/agencies will provide their appropriate O&amp;M funding. For any CETS Foreign Military Sales (FMS), AFSAC will provide the appropriate funding and will be sole source designated by the Letter of Offer and Acceptance (LOA)/International Agreement Competitive Restrictions (IACR) for individual contracts instead of this Class J&amp;A. <br />IV. STATUTORY AUTHORITY PERMITTING OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION</p>
<p>The statutory authority which permits other than full and open competition for this class of contract actions is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii). In the case of each individual contract, there is only one responsible source and no other services will satisfy agency requirements. Under this Class J&amp;A the requirements are deemed to be available only from the original source (OEM) for the continued provision of highly specialized services.</p>
<p>V. DEMONSTRATION THAT THE CONTRACTOR'S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS OR NATURE OF THE ACQUISITION REQUIRES THE USE OF THE AUTHORITY CITED ABOVE (APPLICABILITY OF AUTHORITY)<br /><br />a. For each acquisition awarded under the authority of this J&amp;A, the agencies' minimum needs can only be satisfied by unique services available from one source (the OEMs). The OEM contractors possess the necessary proprietary data required to provide on-site CETS technical training. The AF lacks the expert resources and data necessary to establish an organic capability for these services when weapon systems/equipment or modifications thereto are initially fielded. The services are contracted from the manufacturer of the equipment or weapon systems in accordance with the policies and procedures in AFI 21-110. Only OEM CETS supported contracts have the ability to reach any specific expert at any time. Therefore, this acquisition is for continued performance of a highly specialized service.</p>
<p>b. The OEM contractors also provide critical, updated technical data to the CETS representatives in the field. The original technical data is acquired by the government during the initial acquisition of the system/subsystem. At times the technical data is ambiguous and the OEM provides the expertise for interpretation. Furthermore, the expertise of the OEM contractor's research, development, manufacturing and administrative teams, buoyed by the learning curve effect of the manufacturing redesigning, modification and refining process, is not available outside the original equipment manufacturers. Additionally, the OEM contractors are highly trained, possess many years of experience, as well as being certified by the OEM on the different types of equipment that they will be training the AF to use/maintain.</p>
<p>c. Acquisition of engineering drawings from the prime contractor, OEM, is often lengthy and time consuming. Frequently, the OEM contractor can supply the drawings through their CETS representatives within hours, thus enhancing the operating Commands' ability to make a major decision that affects the safe operations of very expensive weapon systems during combat situations. There are times when the ALC will have to go to a manufacturer for drawing support because the center does not have the system knowledge to support a request. Having the CETS representative available eliminates this time consuming procedure and increases the operational readiness of warfighting systems.</p>
<p>d. ASC/PKESN believes that award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition and unacceptable delays in fulfilling the AF's requirements. The OEMs are designated as sole source for CETS provided in support of AF major subdivisions such as AFMC, Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC), Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC), Air Education and Training Command (AETC), Air Mobility Command (AMC), Pacific Air Forces (PACAF), Air Combat Command (ACC), United States Air Forces in Europe (USAFE), Air Force Space Command (AFSPC) and the ANG. Due to the fact that technical data and expertise are not available except from the OEMs, award to any other source would result in unacceptable and unreliable training for our AF maintenance teams and a critical increase in weapon systems downtime. Based on the reasons stated previously, it is also likely that award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost as a result of required reverse engineering on the different weapon systems/equipment or modifications in order for any other source to provide the required training, which would take numerous years. The process of reverse engineering for each different weapon systems/equipment or modifications would be substantially expensive that it would duplicate previously incurred costs for developing, manufacturing and training individuals so that the company would be able to provide individuals to perform CETS duties. There is not any way to provide an estimate for the duplication cost for the different weapon systems/equipment or modifications for CETS, since the original cost for each of the individual programs are not known to ASC/PKESN. It would be too costly to request the OEMs to research and provide the total costs for each individual program from research and development through production. None of the excess cost for reverse engineering would likely be recovered through competition and would also result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling agency requirements due to the fact that the entire process would be too time consuming.</p>
<p>e. Accordingly, OEMs are the only firms capable of providing the services described in Section III above without the USAF experiencing substantial duplication of cost that could not be expected to be recovered through competition and unacceptable delays in fulfilling its requirements.</p>
<p><br />VI. DESCRIPTION OF EFFORTS MADE TO ENSURE THAT OFFERS ARE SOLICITED FROM AS MANY POTENTIAL SOURCES AS DEEMED PRACTICABLE<br /><br />A synopsis was published on 13 August 2009 in the FedBizOpps following coordination with the Small Business Office. No sources have formally responded. A prior synopsis, for the FY 08-FY 10 program, also did not produce any new sources. Individual contract synopses published over the past 6 years have not produced any new qualified sources beyond the OEMs. All CETS basic contracts, that meet the criteria set forth in FAR 5.3, will be synopsized in an individual Notice of Contract Action.</p>
<p>VII. DETERMINATION BY THE CONTRACTING OFFICER THAT THE ANTICIPATED COST TO THE GOVERNMENT WILL BE FAIR AND REASONABLE</p>
<p>Fair and reasonable price determination on individual contract actions will be made based upon the results from various tools such as audits, technical evaluations and historical information. The requiring agencies provide a DD255a with each contract requirement which contains an independent government estimate for the calendar year. All proposed program costs will be thoroughly analyzed for each contract action. Contractors will be required to submit cost or pricing data to support the government's evaluation of the proposed price (in accordance with TINA threshold).

These methods will provide the contracting officer with adequate knowledge to determine a fair and reasonable price.</p>
<p>VIII. DESCRIPTION OF THE MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED AND THE RESULTS, OR A STATEMENT OF THE REASONS MARKET RESEARCH WAS NOT CONDUCTED</p>
<p>As described previously in Section VI, market research, in accordance with FAR Part 10, was conducted by synopsis of the proposed acquisition, advising industry of the pending acquisition and soliciting inquiries from interested parties. No inquiries were made regarding the synopsis. Furthermore, market research for CETS over the past 30 years has not generated any successful new sources other than the OEMs.</p>

<p>X. LIST OF SOURCES, IF ANY, THAT EXPRESSED INTEREST IN THE ACQUISITION</p>
<p>See Section VI above.</p>
<p>XI. A STATEMENT OF THE ACTIONS, IF ANY, THE AGENCY MAY TAKE TO REMOVE OR OVERCOME ANY BARRIERS TO COMPETITION BEFORE MAKING SUBSEQUENT ACQUISITIONS FOR THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES REQUIRED</p>
