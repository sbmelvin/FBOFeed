The proposed project consists of approximately 150,000 gross square feet (GSF) bio-containment facility and 1250-car multi-level parking facility.  The bio-containment facility will provide a focus for in-depth research and rapid response programs dealing with agents of new emerging and re-emerging disease at the national and international level and to further support the research programs in biodefense.  All areas of the facility should be capable of supporting work at the Biosafety Level 3 and incorporate state-of-the-art engineering for handling of infectious agents, disease vectors and animal models for the study of transmission, pathogenesis, and prevention of infectious disease.  The facility will include bio-medical research labs, a vivarium capable of housing nonhuman primates as well as adaptable space for use as an insectory, office, conference facilities, interaction areas and public space.  Only the Developer will be selected initially under this solicitation.  A key objective of this contract is to provide the Laboratory Complex in the shortest time frame while maintaining quality, design excellence, operational flexibility, cost efficiency and responsible cost and schedule management of the project.

NIH intends the DM to select the design consultant and construction manager after consulting with the NIH. The DM must have demonstrated experience in providing full development services for projects of equal size, complexity, and type of client with a high degree of customer satisfaction.  In addition, the DM must be experienced in interacting positively with communities.  The NIH will award the contract to the responsible offeror whose proposal represents the greatest overall value based on the combination of technical and price factors.  All evaluation factors other than cost or price, when combined, are significantly more important than cost or price. There are three Go-No-Go requirements; (1) Project Experience, (2) Fee Development Experience, (3) Ability to Secure Letter of Credit ($150,000.00).  The additional technical evaluation factors and their subfactors are listed below.  These factors are listed in descending order of importance but all sub factors within a factor are of approximately equal importance.  The first three factors are particularly important.  I. Past Performance: (1) Customer Satisfaction; II. Relevant Project Experience: (1) Project Budget/Schedule (2) Project Size (3) Project Quality (4) Project Type (5) Client Type and (6) Service Scope; III. Capability/Qualifications: (1) Staffing Plan (2) Key Personnel (3) Project Management (4) Quality Assurance and Quality Control; IV. Participation of Small Disadvantage Business Concerns; V.

<DESC>THIS WILL BE A COMBINED SYNOPSIS AND SOLICITATION 

STATEMENT OF WORK

Conduct and Independent Analysis and Validation of Information Resources Management Organization Structure, Staffing, and Mission, and Work Assignments and Recommend Any Necessary Changes and Improvements Necessary to Improve the Effectiveness and Efficiency of the Rural Development Information Resource Management and Information Technology Support Programs

1.0	General

1.1	Background

Information technology (IT) in both the private and public sectors has undergone a significant transformation within the past several years which has expanded and altered the type of automation support activities now delivered by organizations assigned this responsibility.  The emergence of web-based applications and systems has expanded automation support activities by emphasizing the need for increased telecommunications capabilities and improved security processes to protect information assets.  The deployment of mainframe applications has been superceded with the design, development, and implementation of web-centric applications hosted on servers.  Organizational constructs such as ?web farms? have been introduced.  New automation technologies have been introduced such as firewalls, intrusion detection, public key identification (PKI), electronic data interchange (EDI), data warehouses/data marts, imaging and workflow management, fully automated call centers, automated mail handling, and many others.  New software tools have been introduced which has and continues to alter the landscape of IT organizations as they struggle to keep pace with the accelerating availability of new automation technology.  Organizational structures that, in the past, supported a mainframe environment and a limited array of tools, operating systems, and data base management systems are no longer effective to responding to the automation support demands of today.

In addition to this technical evolution, congressional mandates have emerged that require government agencies to better plan and manage IT capital investments.  IT managers must now be knowledgeable in financial management concepts such as the computation of present values, pay-back period computations, and the computation of return on investment.  Performance goals must be defined and measured continually throughout the life of an investment.  The Department of Agriculture has developed and deployed an Information Technology Investment Planning System (ITIPS) to monitor the performance of agencies in the accomplishment of all capital planning activities.  Annual reporting and review processes are coordinated through the Department with the Office of Management and Budget.  These new capital planning activities have been absorbed by IRM but not efficiently integrated into the organization.

Over the past several years, like most organizations within the federal government, the Information Resources Management organization has been impacted by staffing cuts and decreased budget allocations.  In some divisions and branches reductions in supervisory staff has increased supervisory-to-employee ratios above 25 to 1 while other parts of the IRM organization experience significantly lower ratios. Although this allows IRM to maintain an overall acceptable ratio, realignment of managerial and supervisory ratios is imperative to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of managers in IRM divisions and branches with the extremely high ratios. Secondly, as a result of hiring restrictions and budgetary limitations, the IRM organization has been unable to transform itself to keep pace with the changing technical environment as well as the emerging legislative and Departmental mandates impacting on its mission.  New mission and work assignments have been made to divisions and branches based on the availability of personnel and not necessarily on assigned mission.  This has resulted in much overlapping of work assignments and conflictsin carrying out assigned missions. Thirdly, the reduction in staff has caused many tasks performed within IRM that are directed to monitoring and improving IRM efficiency and effectiveness have been abandoned and the performance of other tasks has been reduced in frequency.   Some examples of such tasks include the constant monitoring and analysis of cost reports related to National Information Technology Center billings, strategic IRM planning efforts,  and the analysis of National Finance Center costs.
 

1.2 Objective

This Statement of Work (SOW) is directed toward the completion of an analysis of the current organizational and staffing make up of Rural Development?s Information Resources Management organization.  This includes the development of recommendations that will allow the Agency to build an IT organization better able to provide the automation support required by the Agency and better positioned to meet the ever changing automation technologies that are rapidly emerging through out the industry.


1.3	Scope

The Agency requires the analysis of current mission responsibilities and workload assignments throughout the IRM organization both in Washington, D.C. and St. Louis, Mo.  The organization structure of the Rural Development IRM should be studied, evaluated, and compared to the structure in other government agencies and in private industry.  Recommendations for organizational and staffing changes should be based on an assessment of ?best practices? throughout the IT community.  Interviews of key IRM managers including the Chief Information Officer, Deputy Chief Information Officer, all division directors, and selected branch chiefs should be conducted.

The Agency requires this analysis and the resulting recommendations in order to effect changes in the IRM organization that will improve the efficiency and effectiveness of automation support program throughout the Agency.

<DESC>This is a Pre-Solicitation Notice for a full and open competition. This Request for Proposal (RFP) will ONLY be released and available electronically at http://www.fedbizops.gov. Accordingly, No telephone, fax or email requests will be accepted. Since the RFP will only be available electronically, it will be the responsibility of interested parties to monitor the Federal Business Opportunities websites for any amendments. The Estimated release date of the RFP is July 31, 2002 and estimated date of proposal due is August 30, 2002. The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) anticipates awarding one contract to obtain accurate payment layer thickness and dielectric constant data at a selected number of Long Term Pavement Performance (LTPP) test sections using Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) technology. For more information on the LTPP Program please see http://www.tfhrc.gov/pavement/ltpp/ltpp.htm. This RFP was previously issued January 18, 2002 but was cancelled February 15, 2002 due to new regulations from the FCC.  Those regulations created strict guidelines that none of the existing GPR equipment could meet.  The FCC modified those regulations on July 12, 2002.  The modified regulation grants a waiver to operators of GPR equipment that owned their existing equipment prior to July 15, 2002.  The waiver is effective July 15 but the equipment must be registered with the FCC by October 15, 2002 or the individual wavier is cancelled.

As a historically Black university, the primary mission of Tennessee State University is to educate minority students.  The university prepares its students for careers in a number of academic/health related fields.  The university offers programs of study ranging from bachelor degrees to doctoral and professional degrees.  Educational opportunities are provided for traditional and nontraditional students, offering scholarly interaction among diverse people.  The university is committed to a broad program of research, both basic and applied, and creative work to stimulate the faculty and students in a quest for knowledge and to aid society in resolving its scientific, technological, socioeconomic, and cultural problems.  The school's program for health professions provides the necessary level of expertise required and also provides technical assistance to other HBCUs in support of their efforts to pursue research activities.  Further justification for the sole source award to Tennessee State University resides in its technical capabilities, which have been applied in the past to HBCUs projects similar to that within the Statement of Work for this proposed contract.  Furthermore, CMS staff determined the conference should be held in Nashville, Tennessee because of its closeness to other HBCUs in this region.  All responsible sources may submit capability statements in consideration to the Agency at the above address.

<DESC>s Information Directorate (AFRL/IF) and the National Institute of Justice's Office of Science and Technology (NIJ/OST) are soliciting proposals for the development and demonstration of innovative technology to better detect concealed weapons (CW) in the hands of criminals--the number one technology priority of the state and local law enforcement community--and to provide law enforcement officers and military personnel engaged in peace keeping the ability to conduct surveillance through exterior and interior building walls in hostage rescue situations.  Technology that lends itself to school-security/school- safety is also of interest.  AFRL/IF and NIJ/OST will entertain responses to this solicitation that propose either development of new technology or demonstration and evaluation of existing technology.  Of particular interest are technologies that: (1) are low cost in production; (2) are portable, optimally handheld or as small as possible; (3) provide the ability to detect weapons or survey individuals through walls at a distance; (4) can be used to enhance school safety; and, in regard to weapons detection, (5) can detect weapons with little or no metal content, and explosive materials.  One area of interest is the detection of living humans through walls at ranges of up to 100 feet (30 meters).  An awareness of where living people are located within a building is necessary when dealing with hostage situations, terrorism, counter terrorism, etc.  AFRL/IF and NIJ/OST have also been developing technology to detect both metallic and non-metallic weapons (guns and edged weapons) that are concealed beneath a persons clothing.  This CWD technology development program has been ongoing since 1995 and has the goal of standoff detection of these concealed weapons at a range of 10 meters.  Finally, approaches are sought for the purpose of enabling the transition of sensor collection technology to the resource allocation and information management process that logically occurs further down stream in the CONOPs for special operations and law enforcement.   PROGRAM SCOPE:  Technical areas of interest include phenomenological issues associated with TWS and CWD, TWS and CWD breadboard/brassboard/prototype development, enabling technology development, enhancing technologies, and technologies for the purpose of enabling the transition of sensor collection technology to the resource allocation and information management process that must occur for the purpose of information dissemination and utilization.  TWS phenomenological issues include the reflective, transmissive, and absorptive effects of the atmosphere and various wall materials and their effect on TWS performance.  Of particular interest are technologies that are capable of "seeing through" or penetrating metallic walls.  Phenomenological issues associated with living humans such as movement, heart beat, respiration, sounds, etc. are also of great interest to the TWS program.  Phenomenological issues associated with both metallic and nonmetallic weapons, attenuation and reflective characteristics of various types of clothing (i.e. winter vs. summer clothing, heavy leather etc.) is of interest to the CWD program.   Applicable TWS and CWD breadboards/brassboards/prototypes include but are not limited to imaging and non-imaging radar systems, acoustic technology, radiometers, low dose backscatter systems, etc.  The proposal must clearly explain how the technology developed is compatible with or is capable of exploiting the appropriate phenomenology.  Enabling technologies are those technologies that are not currently mature enough to integrate into a TWS or CWD system but whose development is necessary to meet the long term cost, performance, size, and/or implementationgoals.  These enabling technologies include unique antenna designs, low cost/producible MMIC designs, scanning improvements, etc.  The proposal must explain how these enabling technologies will improve the performance of the TWS or CWD system.  Enhancing technologies are those technologies that are not directly part of the TWS or CWD system but the integration of such technology could enhance the overall system performance.  An example of an enhancing TWS technology is a tag that could be worn by a person that positively identifies the "tagged" person.  The tag could also be used to alleviate some of the detrimental phenomenological issues associated with various wall types by reflecting or transmitting a much stronger signal than would be otherwise be reflected or emitted from the person being surveyed.  In the case of CWD an enhancing technology might be a unique approach to processing that would interpret the sensor data and automatically decide whether the person had a concealed weapon.  Sensor technology transition, resource allocation and information management technology includes proposals that deal with infrastructure backbone including information processing/exploitation/dissemination and the necessary telecommunications to enable successful interoperability between special operations units or law enforcement agencies.  The proposals will be broken into four categories; TWS, CWD, sensor technology transition and interoperability.  The offeror must also state whether the technology proposed is near-term or long-term.  Near-term proposals are those that propose technology that can at least be demonstrated in a brassboard form within 2 years.  Long-term proposals must propose technology that can be demonstrated in a breadboard form within 2 years and brassboard form within 5 or 6 years.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ENTIRE SOLICITATION.  DO NOT SUBMIT A FORMAL PROPOSAL AT THIS TIME.  EVALUATION CRITERIA:  Proposals will be evaluated using the following criteria in descending order of importance:  (1) overall scientific and technical merit; (2) potential contributions/relevance to NIJ, Air Force and DoD; (3) capabilities and experience;(4) plans and capabilities to accomplish technology transfer; and (5) total cost and cost realism.  (NOTE:  Cost realism will be used as an evaluation criterion only in proposals, which have significantly under or over estimated the cost to complete the effort).  In addition, the Government will consider other factors, such as past and present performance on recent Government contracts and the capacity to perform the requirements of the effort.  GENERAL INFORMATION:  Prospective offerors should first submit a 5 - 10 page white paper that describes their technical approach, an estimate of the cost, a schedule, a description of the deliverables (i.e. final report, breadboard, brassboard, etc.) and whether the proposal is intended to be short-term or long-term technology development.  Based on the technical, financial and schedule content of the white paper the government will decide whether to request a proposal.  Offerors are required to submit an original and (5) copies of their white paper with a cover letter indicating whether the offeror is a large, small, woman-owned small business, Historically Black College or University, or Minority Institution, to AFRL/IFEM, ATTN: David Ferris, 32 Brooks Road, Rome, NY 13441-4114 by 7 Jul 1999.  Also, small business only should send one (1) copy of the cover letter only (1st Class Mail, Unclassified only) to ATTN:  Ms Janis Norelli, Director of Small Business, AFRL/IFB, 26 Electronic Parkway, Rome NY 13441-4514.  Options are discouraged and unpriced options will not be considered.  Offerors must mark their white papers with the restrictive language stated in FAR 15.609(a).  Multiple white papers may be submitted in different areas of technology.   White papers are limited to a total page count of 10 pages and shall be double-spaced with a font no smaller than 12 pitch.  NIJ has budgeted approximately $4.0 million in FY99.  Additional funding will be available in FY00 and FY01.  The total value of all efforts awarded under this BAA will not exceed $15 million.  Proposals should be for up to 24-months of effort, and range in value between $500,000 - $1M.  This effort should include those tasks necessary to get to a breadboard system (in the case of long term technology) or a brassboard system (in the case of near term technology).  It is anticipated that the effort will be modified via an engineering change proposal for continued technology development with the ultimate goal of a demonstration.  The demonstration will depend on the type of technology developed and whether the technology is considered near term or long term.  Only government evaluators will make selections under this BAA.  Personnel from the Air Force Research Laboratory and the National Institute of Justice, as well as other federal agencies and state and local police agencies will evaluate proposals. 
Most awards are expected O/A 17 October 99.  The cost of preparing proposals in response to this announcement is not an allowable direct charge to any resulting contract or any other contract, but may be an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect cost in FAR 31.205-18.  An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear significant concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition.  Routine questions are not considered to be "significant concerns" and should be communicated directly to the Contracting Officer, Joetta A. Bernhard, and (315)330-2308.  The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the Contracting Officer or Program Manager, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements and recommendations to the appropriate Government personnel.  The Ombudsman for this acquisition is Vincent Palmiero, Deputy Chief, Contracting Division, AFRL/IFK at (315) 330-7746.  When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern.  The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of the proposals or in the source selection process.

<DESC>This notice is a Request for Information only.  The Government may or may not issue a solicitation as a result of this announcement.  The Government will NOT pay for any information given in response to this call for information.



BACKGROUND

Pursuant to the authority established in the Clinger Cohen Act, the Senior Procurement Executive (SPE) of the General Services Administration is interested in receiving information from industry, specifically education institutions and test development experts, on the feasibility of offering examinations to measure the ability of the GSA acquisition workforce to apply knowledge gained through classroom and on-the-job training.  

Presently, there are nearly 3,000 associates that are considered to fall within the definition of GSA's acquisition workforce.  The distribution by series is as follows:

Job Title                                      Number of Employees
Contract Specialist--                        1,292
Property Disposal Specialist--             174
Purchasing Agent--                             103
Procurement Clerk--                             84
OTHER--                                               1354 
TOTAL                                                 2,957

Under current law, those in the contracting series, and those possessing a contracting officer?s warrant regardless of their series, are required to meet established educational requirements, depending on their grade.   It is envisioned that competency testing can help management understand where to focus learning resources as well as to identify those associates who are fully qualified in all competencies, even if they lack some of the classroom hours.  The goal of the SPE is to use a combination of competency testing and classroom instruction to fully qualify the entire acquisition workforce by 2005. The competencies as defined by the Acquisition Workforce Committee Competencies are detailed herein.


Those institutions that are interested in partnering with GSA to develop a competency testing solution may submit a response in the format outlined below.  More detailed statistical information is available at: www.gsa.gov/xxxxxx, or by contacting Kenneth J. Buck at 202-219-0311.  Responses are due by January 21 and may be submitted electronically to: Ken.Buck@gsa.gov.

The next step will be to hold face-to-face meetings with any respondent(s) to help refine the acquisition strategy.  Depending on the information received in response to this announcement, GSA is open to making a single award for these services.  Before making this determination, GSA will take into consideration the number of interested respondents, the estimated development costs and the number of GSA associates that need to take the test for the endeavor to be profitable for the industry partner.  Be assured that all information submitted is deemed to be confidential and not releasable to anyone outside of the Government evaluation team.








Please respond to the following statements and questions.

1)	Discuss the pros and cons of using competency testing to measure the quality of the GSA acquisition workforce.

2)	Discuss any known legal or regulatory barriers that might prohibit use of testing.

3)	Discuss the historic precedence for using such testing in the acquisition or other disciplines.

4)	It is envisioned that any test would include a combination of objective and subjective case studies to measure the capability of the GSA associate to apply knowledge in real life settings.  Is it feasible to develop such a comprehensive test?   If so, how would it be structured? 

5)	What program resources (number and qualifications) would GSA need to allocate to support industry partner(s) in any endeavor? 

6)	Given the potential pool of associates, would you consider a cost sharing arrangement where the development costs are borne by the industry partner and then recovered on a transaction basis through either preparatory classes and/or application of the test?

7)	If a cost sharing scenario is acceptable, identify any potential risk factors and what GSA could do to help minimize risk.  

8)	Based on the breakdown of the GSA workforce (see website), how many associates would need to be tested in order for you to recover your costs and realize a reasonable profit?  Please be as specific as possible.

9)	Are your services available on a GSA Schedule or another multiple/single award IDIQ contract?

This statement must demonstrate that the oligonucleotides provided will be equivalent in quality and size, and encompass as many or more genes as the Operon set.  The capability statement and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can fully meet the requirement.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 PM EDT, (local Washington DC time) on July 26, 2002.  If you have any questions, please contact Malinda Holdcraft, Purchasing Agent via electronic mail at holdcram@exchange.nih.gov or by fax at 301-402-4513.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received shall be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive requirement.  No collect calls will be accepted.  No faxed copies of capability statements will be accepted.  Interested parties shall mail one original and two copies to: Malinda Holdcraft, NIH/NCI/RCB, 6120 Executive Blvd. Room 6072, Rockville, Maryland 20852-7194.

<DESC>In the absence of other qualified sources, it is the intent of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) of the Department of Commerce to acquire two Adiabatic Demagnetization Refrigerator Systems (ADRs) from Janis Research Company, Inc., Cryogenic Equipment, Two Jewel Drive, PO Box 696, Wilmington, MA  01877-0696.   NIST currently has a research effort to develop detectors that are capable of counting the number of optical photons in a single pulse of light. This capability is essential for testing secure communication systems under development that rely on a single photon to represent one bit. These detectors operate at 100 mK to achieve the sensitivity required to detect a single quantum of light. The operation of these detectors requires a refrigeration system that is easily transportable (compact), low vibration, cryogen-free and low-maintenance.  The only type of refrigerator that cools below 100 mK and meets the above needs is the Adiabatic Demagnetization Refrigerator (ADR). To create the cryogenic 100 mK environment required for this detector technology, NIST designed a new generation of ADRs approximately 5 years ago. NIST scientists have built and assembled 5 ADR-based cryogen detector systems based on this technology, since ADRs were not commercially available.  The new optical detector technology was successfully demonstrated using one of these custom ADRs.  NIST offered the technology to industry through a licensing process.  Only Janis Research Company currently holds a non-exclusive license to the NIST ADR design. The Terahertz Technology Project needs to purchase two ADR systems.  Janis Research Company is the only source that meets the following unique requirements:  (1) The ADR refrigeration unit must be interchangeable with existing NIST assembled ADR units;  (2) The unit must be capable of obtaining a base temperature < 100mK and maintaining this temperature in excess of 24 hours per cooling cycle;  (3) The unit shall maintain mechanical vibrations at a level that does not interfere with experiments on an optical table;  (4)  The unit shall be cryogen-free, not requiring liquid nitrogen or liquid helium for operation;  and  (5)  Cryogenic and vacuum mechanical and electrical  connectors must be identical  with those in  NIST existing equipment and ADR systems.  This acquisition is for a commercial item for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302.   Interested concerns must submit a written qualification statement that clearly establishes the firm's capability to meet the above requirements.  This qualification statement shall be submitted to the individual and office cited above within 15 days from the date this synopsis is posted on the Internet.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, the government will consider all proposals received within 15 days after the date of publication of this synopsis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID), of the National Institute of  Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), is re-competing and expanding their current contract with the Baylor College of Medicine, Contract No. N01-AI-65298.  This solicitation will be a full and open competition, NAICS Code 541710, 500 employees.   

This RFP solicits proposals for respiratory pathogens research units to support the infection prevention program of the Respiratory Diseases Branch, DMID.  The Government has a need to continue this effort and expand the respiratory pathogens unit as part of the Bio-defense Research Agenda.  The focus of these units will include: 1) increased capacity to conduct pre-clinical and clinical research activities on emerging and re-emerging bacterial and viral respiratory pathogens with an emphasis on multi-drug resistant organisms and novel influenza vaccines; 2) enhanced capability to evaluate vaccines, therapeutics, and novel strategies to enhance the protective human immune response; 3) emphasized integration of human mucosal immunity with clinical research; and 4) emphasized research on product development activities.  

Separate proposals are solicited for separate parts of this solicitation:  Part A - Bacterial Respiratory Pathogens Research Unit (BRPRU) and Part B - Viral Respiratory Pathogens Research Unit (VRPRU).   An offeror may respond to either Part A or Part B, or both.  It is anticipated that a total of three contracts will be awarded to successful offerors demonstrating capability of responding to the requirements of this solicitation. It is anticipated that three (3) cost-reimbursement, completion-type contracts will be awarded for a period of seven (7) years at an estimated level of effort 24.90 FTEs for each year (Part A) and 19.90 FTEs for each year (Part B).  

The Part A bacterial research unit will focus on the major themes of:  bacterial carriage, progression to lower respiratory tract disease, and development of prevention strategies that optimize the protective immune response (including innate and mucosal immunity).  The BRPRU unit will also conduct clinical studies, which focus on these major themes, including Phase I and Phase II clinical trials of candidate vaccines and therapeutics.  In addition, this unit must have the capacity to conduct clinical challenge studies with bacterial respiratory pathogens.   

The Part B viral research unit will focus on the major themes of:  viral pathogenesis, evaluation of new and/or improved vaccines and therapeutics, and development of strategies that optimize the protective immune response.  The VRPRU will also conduct clinical studies that focus on these major themes, including the conduct of Phase I and Phase II clinical trials of candidate vaccines and therapeutics.  In addition, this unit must have the capacity to conduct human challenge studies with viral and respiratory pathogens, including influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).  

Once awarded, the Respiratory Pathogens Research Units (RPRUs) will become a part of a multi-disciplinary Respiratory Pathogens Research Network (RPPN) that will also include contracts that support bacterial and viral Respiratory Pathogens Research Reference Laboratories.  These laboratories will provide standardized key serological assays for use in vaccine studies and distribution of reagents for the measurement of the human immune response to bacterial or viral respiratory pathogens.  The Respiratory Pathogens Reference Laboratories will be awarded through a separate solicitation entitled Respiratory Pathogens Research Reference Laboratory Support , RFP-NIH-NIAID-DMID-03-37 that is also posted at this time.  

RFP-NIH-NIAID-DMID-03-05, will be available electronically on the CMB Homepage on or about July 24, 2002, may be accessed through the NIAID Contract Management Branch (CMB) Home Page at http://www.niaid.nih.gov/contract and will be posted on Fed Biz Opps:   www.fedbizopps.gov.  Any responsible offeror may submit a proposal that will be considered by the Government.  This announcement does not commit the Government to award a contract.  No collect calls will be accepted.  No facsimile transmissions will be accepted.

<DESC>The National Library of Medicine (NLM) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Jesus People Against Pollution (JPAP), Columbia, MS 29429 in accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b)(1) for a continuation of existing services. The JAPA shall perform the following tasks:  (1) Purchasing additional computers and printers to increase the community's ability to access the NLM databases. 
(2) Coordinating a field trip for approximately 10 youth (high school and/or college students) from the Columbia, MS area and/or surrounding area to visit the NLM.  The students will learn about the products and services of the NLM during the visit and will be introduced to health careers options. (3) Conducting two sessions in which they share information about the NLM and it's products and services with other organizations in the Columbia, MS area.  The goal of these sessions will be to stimulate these organizations to work with JPAP on environmental education issues and to improve the awareness of the community of environmental information on the web. Jesus People Against Pollution (JPAP) is a grass roots environmental justice organization located in Columbia, Mississippi.  The organization was created in response to an explosion at a local chemical plant that resulted in severe exposure of the community to toxic substances.  JPAP's primary mission is to achieve environmental and economic justice for the persons living around the Reichold Chemical Co./Newsom Brother Superfund Site in Columbia. JPAP collaborated with the NLM during fiscal year 2001 on the Addressing Health Education and Diseases or AHEAD initiative.  For this project JPAP opened an Information Resource Center in Columbia, MS and provided access to NLM's databases and other government produced environmental health information to the Columbia community.  JPAP also identified and worked with other local church ministries, schools and community-based organizations in the region between Jackson and Columbia, MS to share resources and information about the NLM databases. NLM shall provide JPAP with a manual to be used to conduct future training sessions in the Columbia community. JPAP has set out to educate the impacted communities about the availability of toxicology and environmental health information so that the community can better understand the relationship between environmental exposure and disease. There continues to be an urgent need to address the lack of access to toxicology and environmental health information and to improve the understanding of the relationship between environmental exposure and disease in the Lower Mississippi Delta region.  Residents of Columbia, Mississippi have an even greater need to gain electronic access to health information resources given the documented environmental exposure they have already suffered.  Continued support of the AHEAD initiative will ensure timely access to information regarding prevention, diagnosis, and treatment options regarding environmental issues.  JPAP is uniquely capable of assisting the NLM with this effort because of their history of activities and involvement in Columbia, MS and surrounding communities.  JPAP has been active in this region since 1992 and is headed and staffed by individuals living in the community that have suffered from exposure to toxic substances.  In addition, JPAP has developed extensive working relationships with members of the community, other community groups, local government, the state of Mississippi and the federal government. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations. However, the Government will consider all quotations received 15 days from the date of publication. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. The anticipated award date of the purchase order is 
August 1, 2002. For questions regarding this announcement, please contact Brenda K Lee at 301 496-6546

Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to enter into a sole source purchase order with Dr. Ralph J. Brodd for research study on rechargeable battery Technologies. The study seeks to apply expertise and experience in technology development, industry production and marketing of rechargeable batteries to gain a better understanding of industry factors-global and domestic-and of the technology characteristics that affect the adoption of new rechargeable battery technologies.  In addition, the study will consider the implications of the analysis for ATP's  past investments in this and related technology areas and examine possible strategies for overcoming current market difficulties.  The proposed work requires direct experience in the industry, substantial personal contacts, and credibility with individuals at high levels of business and R&D management in the battery industry and related industries.  It also requires experience with and knowledge of the financing of technology development and commercialization by firms of different types and sizes in the battery industry and knowledge of industry trends.  Dr. Brodd is uniquely qualified because of his experience in the battery industry and related academic work.  He has managed several new technology ventures devoted to advanced rechargeable battery development and commercialization, with responsibilities for production, sales, and marketing.  The proposed requirement is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b).  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement.  This notice of intent is no a request for competitive quotations.  However, the government will consider all capability statements received by July 30, 2002.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  A Request for Quotation (FRQ) package is not available.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Energy - Oak Ridge Operations plans to award multiple award fixed-price task order type contracts for processing services for recovery and optional down blending of enriched uranium scrap materials generated in DOE production and research and development efforts.  This work is currently being performed by BWX Technologies, Inc. Naval Nuclear Fuel Division (BWXT), and Nuclear Fuel Services (NFS) under five-year, fixed-price task order contracts.  The combined value of the contracts over the five-year period is approximately $14 million.  DOE plans to award identical contracts to all responsible offerors possessing all the necessary qualifications and capability to perform this work.  Tasks will be competed among those contractors having the qualifications and capability to perform the work.  Based on our market research, BWXT and NFS are the only sources possessing all the necessary qualifications and capability to perform this work.  The materials to be processed are a wide variety of scrap generated in the DOE complex.  Over a five year period, the overall effort will involve approximately 2,000 kilograms uranium (kgU) of scrap which will be unirradiated or slightly irradiated and enriched to greater that 20 percent U235.  Some scrap will be security classified, Confidential-Restricted Data, by composition.  The scrap categories that are to be processed include:  (1) miscellaneous uranium/zirconium scrap; (2) enriched uranium that is clad in stainless steel scrap; (3) enriched uranium/aluminum metal and oxide in a mixture of various metallic and nonmetallic oxides; (4) enriched uranium in metallic cladding; (5) enriched uranium/carbon inter-metallic and mixtures; (6) enriched uranium hexafluoride; (7) uranium-fluoride compounds and mixtures; and (8) impure oxides and compounds.  Some material handling tasks may be required that involve only sampling and/or packaging of HEU.  Interested parties must have the following: (1) a Nuclear Regulatory Commission license for Highly Enriched Uranium; (2) environmental permits for uranium processing; (3) processing and storage facilities that satisfy Nuclear Material Safeguards and Security requirements; (4) interface capability with DOE Safe Secure Transport System including certified containers for transportation and storage; and (5) an approved Nuclear Material Control and Accountability Program.  The firm shall also have or be able to obtain an affirmative Foreign Ownership, Control, or Influence Over Contractor (FOCI) clearance determination.  Additionally, any contractor receiving an award shall take title to, and be responsible for, all wastes and by products remaining after completion of services.  Disposal of any wastes or residual materials shall be in accordance with federal, state, and local laws and regulations concerning disposal of such wastes.  If disposal services are required, proof of lawful disposal shall be provided to DOE.

<DESC>It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine (NLM) to procure continuation of  professional research, writing production, and publication management services on a sole source basis from Margaret Kubale, Cincinnati, Ohio.  The journal Public Health Reports (PHR) is the official Journal of the U.S. Public Health Service. The journal is published six times a year with several additional supplements each year. PHR is need of a writer/editor/production manager to assist Journal contributors with rewriting manuscripts, editing all manuscripts to make them consistent with Journal templates and protocol, compiling articles into issues, working with the design and layout contractor, and assisting in the planning and compliance with publication schedules.  Margaret Kubale was a principal developer of the Journal's current style. She is familiar with the process in which she helped establish over the last year. Also during the last year she has worked closely with the Journal's design and layout contractor (CCSI) and the publisher (Oxford University Press) and has a thorough working knowledge of how those two entities process the Journal's work. This knowledge is a prerequisite to this contract because a new contractor would require time to learn the aspects of the design and how to interact with CCSI and Oxford. This would cost the government significant additional time and funds to accomplish. She has worked with Public Health Reports and has had a hand in establishing the current procedures and practices of the Journal. Margaret Kubale is uniquely qualified. The proposed acquisition will be procured under FAR Part 13 - Acquisition for Non-Commercial Items.  This is not a Request for Quotation (RFQ), nor is an RFQ available, however, all responsive sources may submit a proposal in a timely manner which will be considered by NLM.  Firms interested in responding to the notice must be able to provide the services as specified above.  Responses must be in writing and must be received in the office within fifteen (15) calendar days from the publication date of this notice.  Proposal must include pricing information. NLM Synopsis No. NLM 02-167/CYC.  Inquires regarding this procurement may be made to Cara Y. Calimano, Office Automation Technician, NLM on (301) 496-6127.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This requirement will be satisfied using commercial acquisition procedures specified in FAR Parts 12 and 13.5.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; firm-fixed-price proposals for procurement of the following items are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Solicitation number DTCG38-02-R-H00005 is being assigned to this procurement for tracking purposes only and this synopsis/solicitation is being issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP).  The incorporated clauses and provisions are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-07.  This requirement is unrestricted, the North American Industry Classification Code is 336413 and the size standard is 1000 employees.  The anticipated contract term shall be from date of award through final delivery; there are no option periods.  The Coast Guard seeks to award one contract for the procurement of the following items and the corresponding quantities; firm-fixed prices are required for these items.  Offerors must submit firm-fixed prices for one (1) Tank Top Assembly Unit for the Chemical Toilet System for the HC-130 aircraft as a prototype unit for First Article Test and Evaluation as well as firm-fixed prices for a remaining production balance of twenty-seven (27) tank top assemblies.  The prototype unit must conform to the same form, fit and function as the present tank top assembly, Part Number 2901-001.  Part Number 2901-001 is manufactured by Monogram System of Compton, California and the specifications and drawings for the Chemical Toilet System are proprietary.  The Coast Guard will make available for inspection, measurement, photographs, and sketches of the tank top assembly currently in use.  Upon request, a copy of the Illustrated Parts Breakdown (IPB) showing part numbers and location of top-end components will be made available.  Offerors must respond within ten (10) calendar days of this announcement or no later than 30 July 2002 to request access to the existing Chemical Toilet System.  A date and time for access to the existing system will be forwarded immediately following the ten (10) day period.  Minimum requirements:  The tank top assembly must have a manually controlled open/close shut-off valve that maintains the holding tank?s contents within the holding tank until servicing is required.  The top-end/external components (motor-pump-filter assembly, check valve and toilet bowl) from the Chemical Toilet System currently in use must be usable on the new tank top assembly.  Within ninety (90) days of award, the successful awardee must provide the prototype unit and install the unit for evaluation and testing.  The prototype unit will be evaluated for form, fit and function for a period of 6 months and evaluation will consist of the following factors:  There shall be no leakage from the tank, valve, or the connecting flexible duct assembly; the shut-off valve must not allow any fluid to enter the connecting flexible duct assembly under normal operating conditions (other than actual servicing).  At any time during the evaluation period, the contractor will be notified, as necessary, to make required changes to meet form, fit and function at no additional cost to the government.  If changes or corrections are required, the contractor will have 30 days to accomplish the changes/corrections.  The first article evaluation period will recommence upon completion of changes/corrections and the length of the evaluation period will be negotiated, not to exceed a maximum of 180 days.  Failure to obtain First Article Approval at this time may result in termination of the contract at no cost to the government.   
Upon successful evaluation, subject to availability of funds, a delivery order will be issued for the production of twenty-seven(27) tank top assembly units, to be manufactured inclusive of any changes/corrections noted during the evaluation period.  Delivery of the twenty-seven (27) units is required within 180 days of issuance of the delivery order.  This requirement will be satisfied as a ?Best Value? procurement; the technical factors listed herein are considered to be significantly more important than offered price.  However, as technical evaluations become more equal among competitors, price will become the deciding factor for award.  The technical evaluation factors are listed in descending order of importance.  More credit will be given for more relevant information and more credit will be given for most recent information.  Offeror?s are required to submit data relevant to delivery performance and number of Quality-Related Failures for the manufacture and maintenance for the tank top assembly submitted for First Article Testing.  Offerors must provide a listing of users of the tank top assembly proposed for evaluation, inclusive of a Point of Contact, agency or company name, and telephone number and email address.  Offerors must submit a data package sufficient to discern overall product design (form, fit and function), compatibility with the existing Chemical Toilet System, and ease of use of the mechanical open/shut valve and overall weight.  The data package must provide information pertinent to installation, operation, service and maintenance of the tank top assembly for Coast Guard crews.  Inspection and acceptance of the production units shall be performed by USCG ARSC Quality Assurance personnel at destination.  Additionally, a Certificate of Conformance in accordance with FAR 52.246-15(b) is required with each component shipped.  F.o.b. point shall be destination.  Production items shall be shipped to USCG ARSC, Receiving Section, Bldg. 63, Elizabeth City, NC  27909-5001 unless otherwise directed by the delivery orders.  Copies of packing slips and the Certificate of Conformance shall be affixed to the outside of the shipping container.  Packaging of the items for shipment shall be in accordance with the Contractor?s best commercial practices with the following exceptions.  Each item or unit must be individually packed in a separate box, carton, or crate.  Each individual container shall be labeled on the outside with National Stock Number, Part Number, Serial Number, Quantity, Nomenclature, Contract Number, Line Item, and Delivery Order Number. Only Bar Coding of the National Stock Number is necessary.  The internal packaging material shall be sufficient to prevent damage during shipment, handling and storage.  Each unit shall be packaged to protect against electrostatic damage.  Preservation protection must be sufficient to prevent corrosion, deterioration or decay during warehouse storage for a period of one year, but no preservation coating will be applied directly to the component.  Packaging material shall NOT consist of the following material: popcorn, shredded paper, styrofoam of any type, or peanut style packaging.  Offers are required by close of business on 26 August 2002.  Facsimile offers are acceptable and may be forwarded via fax number 252-335-6452.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI) Advanced Technology Center (ATC) intends to procure a GenePix 4100A Array Scanner with Axon Instruments 3280 Whipple Road, Union City, California 94587.  The supplies and services herein are commercial as defined in FAR Part 12. The North American Industry Classification System Code is 421450 and the business size standard is 100 employees.  The GenePix 4100A Array Scanner coupled with the GenePix Pro Array Analysis Software, (purchased under purchase order 263MQ116194), will set the highest standards in the acquisition and analysis of data from all types of arrays.  NCI ATC requires this particular piece of equipment for analyses of genes regulating tumor formation and progression in Men1 disease, thyroid disease and insulinomas. Our lab has expertise in isolating LCM RNA samples from tumors and normal tissue, converting the RNA to cDNA after 2 rounds of RNA amplification, and comparing their cDNA profiles on human microarray chips consisting of 10,000 genes. The GenePix 4100A is an upgraded model of the original GenePix 4000B, currently being used in the laboratory.  This upgraded array scanner has some new unique features that are required for performing gene expression profiling and related research: a) High speed simultaneous scanning, scans two wavelengths in a single pass, b) tightly integrated software/hardware package that runs self-diagnosis of laser power and performance; c) Scripting capabilities for generating customized reports; d) barcode is read by software; e) auto-alignment of non-Axon images; f) array list generator for identifying genes; g) non-confocal optics for optimum signal-noise and field uniformity and; h) small unit takes up less valuable bench top space. Also, it is critical that the array chips being hybridized are scanned as soon as they are washed so as not to loose their fluorescent label.  The above features of the Axon GenePix 4100A Array Scanner are believed to be unique to the NCI.  This is not a notice for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirements, especially with regard to compatibility, it may submit a statement of capabilities.   The capability statement and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can fully meet the requirements.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 PM, EDT (local Washington, D.C. time) on August 1, 2002.  If you have any questions, please contact Malinda Holdcraft, Purchasing Agent via electronic mail at holdcram@exchange.nih.gov or by fax 301-402-4513.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received shall be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.   No collect calls will be accepted.  No faxed capability statements will be accepted.

POC Evangela Kunene, USTDA, 1621 N. Kent Street, Suite 200, Arlington, VA 22209-2131, Tel: (703) 875-4357, Fax: (703) 875-4009.  Pinalito Hydroelectric Project.  The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms that are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study for the est. 39 MW Pinalito Hydroelectric project in the Dominican Republic.  The Pinalito project is located in the upper basin of the Yuna River, which flows into the Samana Bay on the northern coast of the country.  

To date three dams have been built in the Yuna River basin that provide water for irrigation and have an estimated 43 MW (Rio Blanco 25MW; Rincon 10MW; Hatillo 8MW) installed capacity. In order to complete the development of the hydro potential of the Yuna River basin, CDE intends to build the El Torito-Los Veganos complex (two power plants), and the Pinalito project.  The final stage of development of the basin is the implementation of the Pinalito hydroelectric project.

One of the objectives of the Pinalito project is to help offset the country's reliance on imported fossil fuels for the majority of electricity generation. In addition, the construction of the Pinalito project would contribute to the regulation of the Yuna River basin and therefore to the regulation of the river flow and control of floods and sedimentation.  Moreover, as discussed above, the Pinalito project, when implemented, will complete the hydro development of the Yuna River basin.  The Terms of Reference (TOR) for this Feasibility Study include the following tasks:

Task 1.  Country and Project Context
Task 2.  Project Site Studies
Task 3.  Project Parameters
Task 4.  Project Design
Task 5.  Environmental Assessment (EA)
Task 6.  Project Benefits/Economic Financial Analysis
Task 7.  Reports
Task 8.  Final Feasibility Study Report

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $400,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (TDA).  The total cost of the Feasibility Study is estimated at U.S. $502,000; CDE has committed to provide the remaining $102,000 for the completion of the study through in-kind and local services.

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from TDA, at 1621 N. Kent Street, Suite 200, Arlington, VA 22209-2131.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, TDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm's name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want TDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to TDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to TDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, TDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling TDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this TDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under TDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the TDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the TDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the TDA grant amount.  Details of TDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in Spanish and English directly to the Grantee by 5:00 p.m., August 30, 2002 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<DESC>INTRODUCTION:  The Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) is soliciting proposal concept papers for various research projects, technology advancements and/or demonstrations directed at enhancing the deployment of high-speed rail service in the United States.   Technologies most likely to enhance the deployment of high-speed rail service in the U.S. are those which will-- (a) enhance the revenue-generating capability of high-speed operations; (b)  bring about capital cost reductions and economy in producing equipment and facilities; (c) reduce operating costs of high-speed rail service; (d) improve the reliability of equipment and infrastructure components; (e) improve safety; and/or (f) enhance the social benefits and/or environmental aspects of high speed rail.  ELIGIBLE  PARTICIPANTS:  This is an unrestricted solicitation.  Any responsible source may submit a proposal concept paper for consideration under this Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) including, but not limited to, states or local governments, or organizations of state or local governments, universities or institutions of higher education, hospitals, non-profit organizations, private individuals, corporations, businesses or commercial organizations, except that any business owned in whole or in part by the Federal Government is not eligible.  Although businesses owned in whole or in part by the Federal Government are not eligible for funding under the Program, they may contract with eligible participants.  Cooperative arrangements (e.g., joint ventures, limited partnerships, teaming arrangements, or collaboration and consortium arrangements) are permitted and encouraged.   Small, Small Disadvantaged (SD), and Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Business Concerns, and Veteran-Owned (VO) and Women-Owned (WO), and Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) Small Business Concerns, and Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) and Minority Institutions (MIs) are encouraged to submit proposal concept papers on their own and/or in collaboration with others.  However, no portion of this BAA will be set aside or reserved exclusively for Small, SD, or Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Business Concerns, or for VO, WO, or HUBZone Small Business Concerns, or for HBCU and MIs.   AREAS OF TECHNOLOGY INTEREST:  Technologies which are high-priority research candidates for evaluation pursuant to this BAA include:  (1) Grade crossing hazard mitigation systems.  (2)  Innovative, low cost technologies to improve track and structures.  (3) Advance train control systems.  (4) Non-electric locomotives and passenger equipment systems. (5) Other scientific study, technology adaptation, or demonstration directed toward advancing the state-of-the-art or increasing the knowledge or understanding of  high-speed passenger rail service in the U. S.   EXCHANGES:   Exchanges of information between parties interested in submitting proposal concept papers and the Government, prior to the submission of proposal concept papers, are strongly encouraged.   Such informal exchanges may provide potential offerors with preliminary information on the Government's level of interest in prospective works or projects and possibly forestall costly effort on the part of interested parties whose proposed work may not be of interest to the FRA under this BAA.  Any exchanges of information must be consistent with procurement integrity requirements of Section 27 of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act (41 U.S.C. 423, as amended) (see Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 3.104; available at http://www.arnet.gov/far/).  For [pre-submission] technical inquires, interested parties may contact the BAA primary technical point of contact, Mr. Robert McCown (Tel:  202/493-6350, Fax:  202/493-6333), or one of the other, secondary technical points of contact to be identified in Appendix A of the BAA 2001-2 Proposal Preparation Package.  All non-technical inquiries should be directed to the Grants/Contracting Officer, Mr. Thomas Riddle or alternate(s) to be identified in Appendix A of the BAA 2001-2 Proposal Preparation Package.  After submission of proposals, all technical and non-technical exchanges will be conducted through the Grants/Contracting Officer(s) in accordance with FAR 15.306.  PROPOSAL CONCEPT PAPERS AND PREPARATION INSTRUCTIONS:   For the purposes of this BAA, proposal concept papers are considered offers and should contain the offeror's best terms from both a cost or price, and a technical standpoint.  Successful proposal concept papers may be used, in whole or in part, as the basis for award in any ensuing contract or other award instrument as the scope of work, statement of objectives, or work statement, or they may be used as the basis for negotiations and subsequent award pending the submission of any additional or supplemental information or clarification, as requested.  Proposal concept papers should be ten (10) pages or less (except as otherwise noted).   Proposal concept paper submissions must contain a Technical Concept Section and a separate Cost or Pricing Section from all offerors, and a separate section containing Past Performance Information from all offerors other than states or local governments, or organizations of state or local governments, or universities or institutions of higher education.  Specific medium, content and format requirements and additional instructions for preparing submissions, as well as further information on the areas of interest themselves and the evaluation/selection process, will be provided in the BAA 2001-2 Proposal Preparation Package (BAA 2001-2 Package).  On or about July 1, 2001, the BAA 2001-2 Package will be made available in electronic media and posted to the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website (formerly known as the Electronic Posting System (EPS)).  Once posted, the BAA 2001-2 Package may be download or printed from the following Internet address: http://www.fedbizopps.gov/ (the same site is also accessible/co-located at http://www.eps.gov).  The FRA does not intend to make the BAA 2001-2 Package available in hard copy.   BAA TIME LINE:  BAA 2001-2 will be open from the date of posting of the BAA 2001-2 Package on FedBizOpps (currently anticipated to be on or about July 1, 2001) through June 30, 2002.   Prospective offerors may submit and the FRA will accept proposal concept papers as of the date the BAA 2001-2 Package is posted on FedBizOpps.  Unless BAA 2001-2 is superceded or canceled, FRA will continue to accept concept submissions and inquiries through June 30, 2002.  Although the BAA is open for an extended period, interested parties would be well advised to submit proposals as early as possible.  Submissions that are incomplete or materially lacking, pursuant to the instructions in the BAA 2001-2 Package, may be returned unevaluated, or evaluated as is, without further opportunity for revision, at the discretion of the Source Selection Authority.  EVALUATION PROCESS:  All materially complete proposal concept papers submitted under this BAA will be subject to technical review in accordance with the established evaluation criteria.  Proposal concept papers which are evaluated favorably from a technical perspective and determined by the FRA to be consistent with the objectives of the BAA and of interest to the Government, and in which there are no significant or outstanding issues or areas for clarification, will be subject to a cost review.  Technically acceptable proposal concept papers that are considered realistic and reasonable, in terms of proposed cost, and fee, if applicable, will be subject to a review of past performance information provided by the offeror or obtained from sources other than those identified by the offeror (excepting those offerors previously identified as not being required to submit past performance information).  Proposal concept papers that are not evaluated favorably, contain material deficiencies or significant weaknesses, or are otherwise deemed unacceptable from a technical perspective, or that are not consistent with the objectives of the BAA or not of interest to the Government; will not be afforded further opportunity to submit proposal information or revisions, will not be subject to cost or past performance review, and will be rejected/declined.   EVALUATION CRITERIA:  Proposal concept papers (and other submissions, if and when requested) will be evaluated using the following criteria, which are listed in descending order of relative importance:  (A) Technical Factor: (1)  The relationship of the proposed research project, technology advancement and/or demonstration to the FRA's mission and its potential to advance U.S. high-speed rail technology, and the extent to which its application to railroad operations would improve intercity passenger operations through improved railroad capital equipment or infrastructure, traffic control centers, interfaces among these, or operating methods, and/or its potential for performance improvement in one or more qualities such as, cost effectiveness, reliability, safety, availability, or maintainability.  (2) The overall scientific and/or technical merit of the proposal.  (3) The technical qualifications and demonstrated experience of key personnel proposed to perform the technical efforts.  (4) The administrative/managerial qualifications and demonstrated experience of the proposing organization to support the projected. (B) Cost/Price Factor:  (1) The reasonableness and realism of the proposed costs and fee (if any).  (2) The extent of any proposed Cost Sharing/Cost Participation under the proposed effort (exclusive of the offeror's prior investment).   (C) Past Performance Factor:  The extent or level of relevant corporate performance, or relevant performance by  key personnel or by subcontractors or parties to cooperative arrangements (excepting those offerors previously identified as not being required to submit past performance information).  AWARDS:  Awards will be made to those responsible offerors whose offers provide the best value to the Government, in terms of  technical excellence, cost or price, and performance risk (as applicable), and other factors to include consistency and accord with the objectives of the BAA and the FRA's mission and its interest in pursuing the proposed research project, technology advancement and/or demonstration.   Awards may take the form of contracts, grants or cooperative agreements.  Contracts will be used when the principal purpose is the acquisition of supplies or services (including research and development) for the direct benefit or use of the Federal Government.  Grants or cooperative agreements will be used when the principal purpose of the transaction is to stimulate or support research and development for another public purpose.  Applicants may include in their submissions, for consideration, an opinion on the type of award instrument they consider would be the most suitable or appropriate venue for their proposed project.  Offers (i.e., proposal concept papers) being pursued as (or which are subsequently determined by FRA as) Federal financial assistance (e.g., grants or cooperative agreements), must be accompanied by the appropriate application forms as specified and instructed in the BAA 2001-2 Package to be posted to FedBizOpps, as identified above.  Forms or related submission materials for Federal financial assistance application will also be posted to FedBizOpps.  All awards will be subject to the availability of funds.   FUNDING AUTHORITY AND RELATED INFORMATION:  Funds for this program are authorized in the Department of Transportation and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2001, Public Law 106-346 (October 23, 2000).  FRA will make available up to $6.5 million for awards under the BAA during fiscal year 2001 (FY 01) for proposal concept papers evaluated favorably and determined by the FRA to be consistent with the objectives of this BAA and of interest to the Government, and for which adequate funding exists.  Fiscal year 2002 (FY 02) awards are subject to the availability of FY 01 appropriations or the continued availability of unobligated prior no-year funds.  Awards may be of any dollar value (so long as those amounts do not exceed the total amount available under the BAA), but it is anticipated that most, if not all, individual awards (or that part of the Government's portion in a cost sharing arrangement) will have dollar values ranging between $25,000 and $500,000 each.  Prospective offerors are advised that contract awards greater than $500,000 will generally require the awardee (except a small business concern) to already have in place or prepare, at or before the time of award, an acceptable plan to maximize the participation of small business enterprises to include separate goals for using small and SD businesses, and WO, VO, and HUBZone small businesses as subcontractors.  Prospective offerors are advised that contract awards greater than $550,000 may  require the submission and certification of cost and pricing data. Cost sharing by awardees is not mandatory under this BAA; however, because of the potential for long-term benefits to those firms or institutions involved in these research and development activities, offerors are strongly encouraged to consider sharing the cost of their proposed projects.  ATTENTION: The Department of Transportation (DOT), Short-Term Lending Program (STLP) offers working capital financing in the form of lines of credit to finance accounts receivable for transportation related contracts. Maximum line of credit is $500,000 with interest at the prime rate. For further information, call (800) 532-1169. Internet address:  http://osdbuweb.dot.gov .  For information concerning the BAA only, all parties should contact the grants/contracting or technical officials listed above.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION.  NO OTHER REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS OR ANNOUNCEMENT (EXCEPTING THE BAA 2001-2 PROPOSAL PREPARATION PACKAGE) WILL BE ISSUED.

<DESC>CH2M Hill Hanford Group (CHG), in conjunction with the U.S. Department of Energy River Protection Project, is soliciting interest and information from firms having the capability to separate cesium and technetium from Hanford Site tank wastes.  This capability will be demonstrated in GFY03 by performing limited radioactive laboratory tests independently or by teaming with a laboratory that has the capability to possess radioactive materials and perform tests that simulate cesium and technetium separation conditions.  The requirement is to determine and verify the process conditions to optimize cesium and technetium separation from simulated Hanford tank wastes.  Cesium and technetium can be jointly or independently separated from the alkaline, Hanford Site tank wastes. 

The laboratory tests will use radioactive waste samples and material that simulates Hanford tank waste, the composition of which will be provided by CHG.  The radioactive tank waste samples, to be specified and provided by CHG, will be representative of various radioactive tank wastes found at the Hanford Site.  The simulant and radioactive waste samples will contain RCRA metals such as barium, chromium, cadmium, lead, silver, and zinc to the extent that these metals are soluble in the alkaline waste solutions.  Technetium is primarily present as the pertechnetate anion in the Hanford Site tank wastes whereas cesium is present as a cation.  

The anticipated scope of work involves the preparation of the simulated waste and performing laboratory-scale cesium and technetium separation tests to demonstrate the steps of the proposed flow sheet.  These tests are to be conducted without acidifying the alkaline tank waste simulant and radioactive samples.  The effect of pH and specific constituents of radioactive tank wastes, such as aluminum, carbonate, nitrate, nitrite, phosphate, potassium, sodium, uranium, and halides on the performance of the cesium and technetium separation processes are to be determined.  The separation processes must achieve a minimum cesium decontamination factor of 400 and a minimum technetium decontamination factor of 4.  Decontamination factor is defined as:

Decontamination Factor = Initial Concentration / Final Concentration 

Separation of cesium and technetium from the Hanford Site tank wastes can be accomplished using ion exchange, fractional crystallization, electro-chemical separations, or other technique as envisioned by the vendor.  The vendor is to specify the proposed process flowsheet for separating cesium and technetium from the Hanford Site tank wastes within the constraints identified in this RFI.  The vendor must provide a material balance for the proposed cesium and technetium separation processes that is based on laboratory-scale testing of simulated and actual tank wastes samples.  The material balance must identify all chemical reagents and their concentrations, process conditions (e.g., mass addition rate, flow-rate, temperature, pressure) and the concentrations of the major analytes and radionuclides present in the liquid, solid, and gaseous phases at each step of the vendor?s proposed flowsheet for cesium and technetium separation. 
The technical approach described above is CHG?s current concept of how this program should proceed.  However, we welcome alternative approaches and we solicit your ideas to accelerate and/or improve the process of implementing Cesium and Technetium Separation Technology.


In order to be considered for any resulting Request For Proposal, firms must meet the following qualifications:

?	Your firm must be committed to working safely and must demonstrate this commitment by having an Experience Modification Rate (EMR) of 1.0, or less, for the past three years and show an improving trend in safety performance.  Please provide this information with your response.

?	Your firm must have previous experience in cesium and technetium separations or related work within the past three years.  Please provide a brief synopsis of your experience and references with your response.

?	Your firm should have had revenues in excess of $1 million/year for the past three years derived from cesium and technetium separations, or related work.  Please provide this information with your response.

?	As a government contractor in a nuclear facility, CHG is subject to enforcement actions under 10 CFR 820, General Statement of Enforcement Policy, (Price Anderson Amendment Act).  The enforcement actions require compliance with 10 CFR 820, Procedural Rules for DOE Nuclear Activities; 10 CFR 830, Nuclear Safety Management; 10 CFR 835, Occupational Radiation Protection; and 10 CFR 708, Contractor Employee Protection.  Depending on the nature of the services being provided, suppliers and subcontractors may be subject to enforcement actions of these regulations.  Please advise if your firm has quality programs in place to comply with these PAAA requirements.

<SUBJECT>11 -- Cesium and Technetium Separations Technology
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-CHG02
<RESPDATE>073102
<ARCHDATE>08152002
<CONTACT>Reese+ Bang, Contract+Administrator, Phone 509-372-0528, Fax 509-376-0825, Email reese_bang@rl.gov
<DESC>CH2M Hill Hanford Group (CHG), in conjunction with the U.S. Department of Energy River Protection Project, is soliciting interest and information from firms having the capability to separate cesium and technetium from Hanford Site tank wastes.  This capability will be demonstrated in GFY03 by performing limited radioactive laboratory tests independently or by teaming with a laboratory that has the capability to possess radioactive materials and perform tests that simulate cesium and technetium separation conditions.  The requirement is to determine and verify the process conditions to optimize cesium and technetium separation from simulated Hanford tank wastes.  Cesium and technetium can be jointly or independently separated from the alkaline, Hanford Site tank wastes. 

The laboratory tests will use radioactive waste samples and material that simulates Hanford tank waste, the composition of which will be provided by CHG.  The radioactive tank waste samples, to be specified and provided by CHG, will be representative of various radioactive tank wastes found at the Hanford Site.  The simulant and radioactive waste samples will contain RCRA metals such as barium, chromium, cadmium, lead, silver, and zinc to the extent that these metals are soluble in the alkaline waste solutions.  Technetium is primarily present as the pertechnetate anion in the Hanford Site tank wastes whereas cesium is present as a cation.  

The anticipated scope of work involves the preparation of the simulated waste and performing laboratory-scale cesium and technetium separation tests to demonstrate the steps of the proposed flow sheet.  These tests are to be conducted without acidifying the alkaline tank waste simulant and radioactive samples.  The effect of pH and specific constituents of radioactive tank wastes, such as aluminum, carbonate, nitrate, nitrite, phosphate, potassium, sodium, uranium, and halides on the performance of the cesium and technetium separation processes are to be determined.  The separation processes must achieve a minimum cesium decontamination factor of 400 and a minimum technetium decontamination factor of 4.  Decontamination factor is defined as:

Decontamination Factor = Initial Concentration / Final Concentration 

Separation of cesium and technetium from the Hanford Site tank wastes can be accomplished using ion exchange, fractional crystallization, electro-chemical separations, or other technique as envisioned by the vendor.  The vendor is to specify the proposed process flowsheet for separating cesium and technetium from the Hanford Site tank wastes within the constraints identified in this RFI.  The vendor must provide a material balance for the proposed cesium and technetium separation processes that is based on laboratory-scale testing of simulated and actual tank wastes samples.  The material balance must identify all chemical reagents and their concentrations, process conditions (e.g., mass addition rate, flow-rate, temperature, pressure) and the concentrations of the major analytes and radionuclides present in the liquid, solid, and gaseous phases at each step of the vendor?s proposed flowsheet for cesium and technetium separation. 
The technical approach described above is CHG?s current concept of how this program should proceed.  However, we welcome alternative approaches and we solicit your ideas to accelerate and/or improve the process of implementing Cesium and Technetium Separation Technology.


In order to be considered for any resulting Request For Proposal, firms must meet the following qualifications:

?	Your firm must be committed to working safely and must demonstrate this commitment by having an Experience Modification Rate (EMR) of 1.0, or less, for the past three years and show an improving trend in safety performance.  Please provide this information with your response.

?	Your firm must have previous experience in cesium and technetium separations or related work within the past three years.  Please provide a brief synopsis of your experience and references with your response.

?	Your firm should have had revenues in excess of $1 million/year for the past three years derived from cesium and technetium separations, or related work.  Please provide this information with your response.

?	As a government contractor in a nuclear facility, CHG is subject to enforcement actions under 10 CFR 820, General Statement of Enforcement Policy, (Price Anderson Amendment Act).  The enforcement actions require compliance with 10 CFR 820, Procedural Rules for DOE Nuclear Activities; 10 CFR 830, Nuclear Safety Management; 10 CFR 835, Occupational Radiation Protection; and 10 CFR 708, Contractor Employee Protection.  Depending on the nature of the services being provided, suppliers and subcontractors may be subject to enforcement actions of these regulations.  Please advise if your firm has quality programs in place to comply with these PAAA requirements.

<DESC>CH2M Hill Hanford Group (CHG), in conjunction with the U.S. Department of Energy River Protection Project, is soliciting interest and information from firms having the capability to bulk vitrify Hanford tank waste.  This capability will be demonstrated in GFY03 by performing limited radioactive laboratory tests independently or by teaming with a laboratory that has the capability to possess radioactive materials and perform tests that simulate bulk vitrification conditions.  The requirement is to determine and verify, in a simulated bulk vitrification system, the process conditions to optimize bulk vitrification of Hanford tank wastes.  The laboratory tests will use material that simulates Hanford tank waste mixed with aluminum-silicates.  The tank waste, to be specified and provided by CHG, will be representative of various radioactive tank wastes found at Hanford.

The anticipated scope of work involves the preparation of the simulated waste and performing laboratory scale vitrification per the steps of the proposed flow sheet, included below.  The vitrification tests are to be conducted at temperatures as high as 2000oC to determine the retention in the melt of the key radioactive and non-radioactive constituents.  The constituents in the off gas stream will also be identified and quantified.  The resulting cooled product from the vitrification process will be tested to determine its characteristics including, as a minimum, leachability of key constituents and strength.

<DESC>CH2M Hill Hanford Group (CHG), in conjunction with the U.S. Department of Energy River Protection Project, is soliciting interest and information from firms having the capability to separate sulfate from Hanford tank wastes.  This capability will be demonstrated in GFY03 by performing limited radioactive laboratory tests independently or by teaming with a laboratory that has the capability to possess radioactive materials and perform tests that simulate sulfate separation conditions.  The requirement is to determine and verify, in a simulated sulfate removal system, the process conditions to optimize sulfate removal from simulated Hanford tank wastes.  

The laboratory tests will use material that simulates Hanford tank waste, the composition of which will be provided by CHG.  The radioactive tank waste samples, to be specified and provided by CHG, will be representative of various radioactive tank wastes found at Hanford.  The simulant and radioactive waste samples will contain RCRA metals such as barium, chromium, cadmium, lead, silver, and zinc to the extent that these metals are soluble in the alkaline solutions.

The anticipated scope of work involves the preparation of the simulated waste and performing laboratory-scale sulfate removal tests per the steps of the proposed process flow sheet (see Figure 1). 

 The sulfate removal tests are to be conducted under acidic conditions by adding nitric acid to the alkaline tank waste simulant and radioactive samples.  The amount of nitric acid added to the alkaline tank waste should be minimized.  The constituents in the off gas stream from the sulfate removal process will be identified and quantified.  The effect of pH and specific constituents of radioactive tank wastes, such as aluminum, sodium, potassium, phosphate, carbonate, and halides on sulfate removal are to be determined.  The partitioning of strontium, cesium, technetium, and actinides into the sulfate product and the sulfate depleted liquid waste phase is to be determined.  The vendor is to test other, non-RCRA metals (e.g. calcium) for effectiveness as the reagent for separating sulfate from the tank waste simulants.  The sulfate product is to be subjected to the Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure (TCLP) per 40 CFR Part 261 to determine the concentration of metals compared to the Universal Treatment Standards (UTS) specified in 40 CFR Part 268.48.

Based on the results of the TCLP test results, further solidification of the sulfate product may be necessary to meet UTS limits for metals.  The vendor is to recommend and conduct testing of the low-level waste solidification process, if warranted based on the results of the TCLP test results.  The vendor is to conduct testing or demonstrate through analyses the sulfate product (or solidified low-level waste form) meets the criteria for low-level waste forms as defined in the U. S. Nuclear regulatory Commission Technical Position on Waste Form, revision 1 dated January 1991. 

The vendor is to provide a proposed flowsheet and material balance for removing sulfate from the Hanford Site tank wastes within the constraints identified in this RFI.  The material balance for the proposed sulfate removal process must be based on laboratory-scale testing of simulated and actual tank wastes samples.  The material balance must identify all chemical reagents and their concentrations, process conditions (e.g., mass addition rate, flow-rate, temperature, pressure) and the concentrations of the major analytes and radionuclides present in the liquid, solid, and gaseous phases at each step of the vendor?s proposed flowsheet.

<DESC>The Marine Corps Systems Command is the lead procuring activity on a joint U.S. Air Force, Army, Navy, and Marine Corps requirement for a Joint Warning and Reporting Network (JWARN).  This requirement will be procured utilizing best value, full and open competition.  The intent of the JWARN program is to provide the Joint Forces with a comprehensive analysis and response capability to minimize the effects of hostile Nuclear Biological Chemical (NBC) attacks or accidents/incidents.  Currently, the NBC community follows manual procedures to initiate the warning and reporting of NBC threats and hazards.  JWARN will automate these functions, as well as the transfer of NBC detector/sensor data to the Command and Control Center or NBC Control Centers.  The consolidated information, in conjunction with weather and Position Location Information (PLI), will support the development of NBC warnings, contaminated area predictions and overlays showing areas of actual contamination (in accordance with ATP-45).  The NBC information then automatically becomes a part of the Commander's Critical Information Requirements (CCIR), and Essential Elements of Information (EEI) supporting the decision making process.  In this manner, JWARN will support the near-real time warning and reporting of NBC attacks.  Furthermore, JWARN data will support the generation of plans and reports, and provide access to specific NBC information to improve the efficiency of warning and reporting procedures.  
The JWARN program is using an evolutionary acquisition approach that divides the program into three (3) blocks and a Pre-Planned Product Improvement effort to meet the emerging needs of the warfighter.  Acquisition of Block I software quantities has been completed.  This solicitation supports the procurement of Block II System Development and Demonstration (SDD), and Block III SDD and Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) which encompasses the entire scope cited above, on a Cost Plus Incentive Fee (CPIF) basis with Firm Fixed Price (FFP) options for training and technical support.  The Government intends to award a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) follow-on production contract to the successful offeror for this Block II and III SDD effort. The JWARN solicitation and other applicable documents have been posted to the JWARN website.  Potential offerors should view the JWARN website as no further information will be posted to FEDBIZOPPS.  Questions and comments should be submitted to the POC indicated herein.  The JWARN website is located at www.marcorsyscom.usmc.mil/mcscctq/oppor.htm

STATEMENT OF WORK

Conduct and Independent Analysis and Validation of Information Resources Management Organization Structure, Staffing, and Mission, and Work Assignments and Recommend Any Necessary Changes and Improvements Necessary to Improve the Effectiveness and Efficiency of the Rural Development Information Resource Management and Information Technology Support Programs

1.0	General

1.1	Background

Information technology (IT) in both the private and public sectors has undergone a significant transformation within the past several years which has expanded and altered the type of automation support activities now delivered by organizations assigned this responsibility.  The emergence of web-based applications and systems has expanded automation support activities by emphasizing the need for increased telecommunications capabilities and improved security processes to protect information assets.  The deployment of mainframe applications has been superceded with the design, development, and implementation of web-centric applications hosted on servers.  Organizational constructs such as ?web farms? have been introduced.  New automation technologies have been introduced such as firewalls, intrusion detection, public key identification (PKI), electronic data interchange (EDI), data warehouses/data marts, imaging and workflow management, fully automated call centers, automated mail handling, and many others.  New software tools have been introduced which has and continues to alter the landscape of IT organizations as they struggle to keep pace with the accelerating availability of new automation technology.  Organizational structures that, in the past, supported a mainframe environment and a limited array of tools, operating systems, and data base management systems are no longer effective to responding to the automation support demands of today.

In addition to this technical evolution, congressional mandates have emerged that require government agencies to better plan and manage IT capital investments.  IT managers must now be knowledgeable in financial management concepts such as the computation of present values, pay-back period computations, and the computation of return on investment.  Performance goals must be defined and measured continually throughout the life of an investment.  The Department of Agriculture has developed and deployed an Information Technology Investment Planning System (ITIPS) to monitor the performance of agencies in the accomplishment of all capital planning activities.  Annual reporting and review processes are coordinated through the Department with the Office of Management and Budget.  These new capital planning activities have been absorbed by IRM but not efficiently integrated into the organization.

Over the past several years, like most organizations within the federal government, the Information Resources Management organization has been impacted by staffing cuts and decreased budget allocations.  In some divisions and branches reductions in supervisory staff has increased supervisory-to-employee ratios above 25 to 1 while other parts of the IRM organization experience significantly lower ratios. Although this allows IRM to maintain an overall acceptable ratio, realignment of managerial and supervisory ratios is imperative to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of managers in IRM divisions and branches with the extremely high ratios. Secondly, as a result of hiring restrictions and budgetary limitations, the IRM organization has been unable to transform itself to keep pace with the changing technical environment as well as the emerging legislative and Departmental mandates impacting on its mission.  New mission and work assignments have been made to divisions and branches based on the availability of personnel and not necessarily on assigned mission.  This has resulted in much overlapping of work assignments and conflictsin carrying out assigned missions. Thirdly, the reduction in staff has caused many tasks performed within IRM that are directed to monitoring and improving IRM efficiency and effectiveness have been abandoned and the performance of other tasks has been reduced in frequency.   Some examples of such tasks include the constant monitoring and analysis of cost reports related to National Information Technology Center billings, strategic IRM planning efforts,  and the analysis of National Finance Center costs.
 

1.2 Objective

This Statement of Work (SOW) is directed toward the completion of an analysis of the current organizational and staffing make up of Rural Development?s Information Resources Management organization.  This includes the development of recommendations that will allow the Agency to build an IT organization better able to provide the automation support required by the Agency and better positioned to meet the ever changing automation technologies that are rapidly emerging through out the industry.


1.3	Scope

The Agency requires the analysis of current mission responsibilities and workload assignments throughout the IRM organization both in Washington, D.C. and St. Louis, Mo.  The organization structure of the Rural Development IRM should be studied, evaluated, and compared to the structure in other government agencies and in private industry.  Recommendations for organizational and staffing changes should be based on an assessment of ?best practices? throughout the IT community.  Interviews of key IRM managers including the Chief Information Officer, Deputy Chief Information Officer, all division directors, and selected branch chiefs should be conducted.

The Agency requires this analysis and the resulting recommendations in order to effect changes in the IRM organization that will improve the efficiency and effectiveness of automation support program throughout the Agency.


2.0	Description of Service

The contractor shall provide services necessary to perform a review of all RD Information Technology (IT) programs and organizations including the Information Resources Management (IRM) and Office of Chief Information Officer (OCIO) and other RD organizations performing IT related work.

<DESC>CH2M Hill Hanford Group (CHG), in conjunction with the U.S. Department of Energy River Protection Project, is soliciting interest and information from firms having the capability to separate solids from Hanford Site tank wastes. The solid-liquid separation processes must be capable of producing a solids-free liquid solution.  This capability will be demonstrated in GFY03 by performing limited radioactive laboratory tests independently or by teaming with a laboratory that has the capability to possess radioactive materials and perform tests that simulate solid-liquid separation conditions.  The requirement is to determine and verify the process conditions to optimize solid-liquid separation from simulated and radioactive Hanford tank wastes.  

Laboratory tests will be conducted with a type of tanks waste known as saltcake.  Saltcake waste consists primarily of crystallized sodium, potassium, and aluminum salts compounds containing carbonate, chloride, fluoride, hydroxide, nitrate, nitrite, oxalate, phosphate, and sulfate.  Saltcake waste also includes soluble radionuclides (e.g. Cs-137, Tc-99), insoluble radionuclides (e.g. Sr-90, transuranic elements) and other soluble and insoluble cations.  The saltcake waste will be dissolved by addition of water.  The solids present in the dissolved saltcake waste range in particle size from 0.1 to 100 microns. The laboratory tests will use radioactive waste samples and material that simulates the dissolved saltcake waste, the composition of which will be provided by CHG.  The radioactive tank waste samples, to be specified and provided by CHG, will be representative of various radioactive tank wastes found at the Hanford Site.  The simulant and radioactive waste samples will contain RCRA regulated metals such as barium, chromium, cadmium, lead, silver, and zinc.  

The vendor is to specify the proposed process flowsheet for separating solids from the liquid phase of the Hanford Site tank wastes within the constraints identified in this RFI.  The vendor proposed flowsheet must identify all modes of operation of the solid-liquid separation equipment, including maintenance and cleaning of the equipment with chemical reagents.  

The anticipated scope of work involves the preparation of the simulated waste and performing laboratory-scale solid-liquid separation tests to demonstrate the steps of the proposed process.  These tests are to be conducted without acidifying the alkaline tank waste simulant and radioactive samples.  The effects of equipment operating parameters such as slurry velocity or pressure across the solid-liquid separation media are to be determined for the simulants and radioactive waste samples.  

The vendor must provide a material balance for the proposed solid-liquid separation process that is based on laboratory-scale testing of simulated and actual tank wastes samples.  The material balance must identify all chemical reagents and their concentrations, process conditions (e.g., mass addition rate, flow-rate, temperature, pressure) and the concentrations of the major analytes and radionuclides present in the liquid, solid, and gaseous phases at each step of the vendor?s proposed flowsheet.  The technical approach described above is CHG?s current concept of how this program should proceed.  However, we welcome alternative approaches and we solicit your ideas to accelerate and/or improve the process of implementing Solid-Liquid Separations Technology.


In order to be considered for any resulting Request For Proposal, firms must meet the following qualifications:

?	Your firm must be committed to working safely and must demonstrate this commitment by having an Experience Modification Rate (EMR) of 1.0, or less, for the past three years and show an improving trend in safety performance.  Please provide this information with your response.

?	Your firm must have previous experience in solids-liquids separations or related work within the past three years.  Please provide a brief synopsis of your experience and references with your response.

?	Your firm should have had revenues in excess of $1 million/year for the past three years derived from solids-liquids separations, or related work.  Please provide this information with your response.

?	As a government contractor in a nuclear facility, CHG is subject to enforcement actions under 10 CFR 820, General Statement of Enforcement Policy, (Price Anderson Amendment Act).  The enforcement actions require compliance with 10 CFR 820, Procedural Rules for DOE Nuclear Activities; 10 CFR 830, Nuclear Safety Management; 10 CFR 835, Occupational Radiation Protection; and 10 CFR 708, Contractor Employee Protection.  Depending on the nature of the services being provided, suppliers and subcontractors may be subject to enforcement actions of these regulations.  Please advise if your firm has quality programs in place to comply with these PAAA requirements.

<DESC>CH2M Hill Hanford Group (CHG), in connection with the U.S. Department of Energy River Protection Project, is soliciting interest and information from firms having the capability in GFY03 to run radioactive laboratory tests or the ability to team with a laboratory that has the capability to run radioactive laboratory tests that simulate containerized grout conditions.  The requirement is to determine the effect of specific constituents, such as sodium, cesium, technetium, nitrates, sulfates, and halides, on the properties of grout in a simulated containerized grout system.  The laboratory tests will use material that simulates Hanford tank waste mixed with grout forming materials.  The tank waste will be representative of the waste contained in certain Hanford tanks or another formulation, to be specified by CHG, that represents saltcake waste.

The engineering evaluation will consist of determining process equipment necessary to blend, cure, and dispose of grouted tank waste in containers.  The vendor must identify the blending technology to be used and the container design.  The performance of these design parameters on grout curing times must be explained.

The vendor is to specify the proposed process flowsheet for grouting the tank wastes within the constraints identified in this RFI.  The vendor must provide a material balance for the proposed tank waste treatment process that is based on laboratory-scale testing of simulated and actual tank wastes samples.  The material balance must identify all chemical reagents and their concentrations, process conditions (e.g., mass addition rate, flow-rate, temperature, pressure) and the concentrations of the major analytes and radionuclides present in the liquids, solid, and gaseous phases at each step of the vendors proposed flowsheet.

The laboratory tests will use radioactive waste samples and materials that simulate Hanford tank waste, the composition of which will be provided by CHG.  The radioactive tank waste samples, to be specified and provided by CHG, will be representative of various tank wastes found at the Hanford Site.  The simulant and radioactive waste samples will contain Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) regulated metals including but not limited to antimony, barium, chromium, cadmium, lead, nickel, silver, and zinc to the extent that these metals are present in the actual tank wastes and other metals, anions and organic compounds such as aluminum, bismuth, iron, lanthanum, manganese, sodium, chloride, fluoride, hydroxide, nitrate, nitrite, phosphate, sulfate, oxalate.  The tank wastes are not known to contain polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) at concentrations above 50 ppm.

The laboratory-scale work involves the preparation of the simulated waste and performing laboratory-scale waste treatment tests per the steps of the vendor proposed process flowsheet.  Figure 1 provides a preliminary flowsheet concept for grouting the waste, however the vendor is responsible for developing the final flowsheet.  The steps to be demonstrated are blending, curing, container handling, as well as any other process steps identified in the vendors proposed flowsheet.  The constituents in the off gas stream from the waste treatment and immobilization process will be identified and quantified.  Formulations for the solidified tank waste are to be developed and tested to demonstrate compliance with the applicable EPA and DOE disposal requirements.

Your firm must have previous experience in grouted waste solidification or related work within the past three years.  Your firm must have a demonstrated knowledge of mixed low-level disposal criteria.  Please provide a brief synopsis of your experience and references with your response.

Your firm should have had revenues in excess of $1 million/year for the past three years derived from grouted waste solidification or related work.  Please provide this information with your response.

<DESC>CH2M Hill Hanford Group (CHG), in conjunction with the U.S. Department of Energy River Protection Project, is soliciting interest and information from firms having the capability to separate solids from Hanford Site tank wastes. The solid-liquid separation processes must be capable of producing a solids-free liquid solution.  This capability will be demonstrated in GFY03 by performing limited radioactive laboratory tests independently or by teaming with a laboratory that has the capability to possess radioactive materials and perform tests that simulate solid-liquid separation conditions.  The requirement is to determine and verify the process conditions to optimize solid-liquid separation from simulated and radioactive Hanford tank wastes.  

Laboratory tests will be conducted with a type of tanks waste known as saltcake.  Saltcake waste consists primarily of crystallized sodium, potassium, and aluminum salts compounds containing carbonate, chloride, fluoride, hydroxide, nitrate, nitrite, oxalate, phosphate, and sulfate.  Saltcake waste also includes soluble radionuclides (e.g. Cs-137, Tc-99), insoluble radionuclides (e.g. Sr-90, transuranic elements) and other soluble and insoluble cations.  The saltcake waste will be dissolved by addition of water.  The solids present in the dissolved saltcake waste range in particle size from 0.1 to 100 microns. The laboratory tests will use radioactive waste samples and material that simulates the dissolved saltcake waste, the composition of which will be provided by CHG.  The radioactive tank waste samples, to be specified and provided by CHG, will be representative of various radioactive tank wastes found at the Hanford Site.  The simulant and radioactive waste samples will contain RCRA regulated metals such as barium, chromium, cadmium, lead, silver, and zinc.  

The vendor is to specify the proposed process flowsheet for separating solids from the liquid phase of the Hanford Site tank wastes within the constraints identified in this RFI.  The vendor proposed flowsheet must identify all modes of operation of the solid-liquid separation equipment, including maintenance and cleaning of the equipment with chemical reagents.  

The anticipated scope of work involves the preparation of the simulated waste and performing laboratory-scale solid-liquid separation tests to demonstrate the steps of the proposed process.  These tests are to be conducted without acidifying the alkaline tank waste simulant and radioactive samples.  The effects of equipment operating parameters such as slurry velocity or pressure across the solid-liquid separation media are to be determined for the simulants and radioactive waste samples.  

The vendor must provide a material balance for the proposed solid-liquid separation process that is based on laboratory-scale testing of simulated and actual tank wastes samples.  The material balance must identify all chemical reagents and their concentrations, process conditions (e.g., mass addition rate, flow-rate, temperature, pressure) and the concentrations of the major analytes and radionuclides present in the liquid, solid, and gaseous phases at each step of the vendor?s proposed flowsheet.  The technical approach described above is CHG?s current concept of how this program should proceed.  However, we welcome alternative approaches and we solicit your ideas to accelerate and/or improve the process of implementing Solid-Liquid Separations Technology.


In order to be considered for any resulting Request For Proposal, firms must meet the following qualifications:

?	Your firm must be committed to working safely and must demonstrate this commitment by having an Experience Modification Rate (EMR) of 1.0, or less, for the past three years and show an improving trend in safety performance.  Please provide this information with your response.

?	Your firm must have previous experience in solids-liquids separations or related work within the past three years.  Please provide a brief synopsis of your experience and references with your response.

?	Your firm should have had revenues in excess of $1 million/year for the past three years derived from solids-liquids separations, or related work.  Please provide this information with your response.

?	As a government contractor in a nuclear facility, CHG is subject to enforcement actions under 10 CFR 820, General Statement of Enforcement Policy, (Price Anderson Amendment Act).  The enforcement actions require compliance with 10 CFR 820, Procedural Rules for DOE Nuclear Activities; 10 CFR 830, Nuclear Safety Management; 10 CFR 835, Occupational Radiation Protection; and 10 CFR 708, Contractor Employee Protection.  Depending on the nature of the services being provided, suppliers and subcontractors may be subject to enforcement actions of these regulations.  Please advise if your firm has quality programs in place to comply with these PAAA requirements.

<SUBJECT>11 -- TRU Tank Waste Solidification for Disposal at the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-CHG06
<RESPDATE>073102
<ARCHDATE>08152002
<CONTACT>Reese+ Bang, Contract+Administrator, Phone 509-372-0528, Fax 509-376-0825, Email reese_bang@rl.gov
<DESC>CH2M Hill Hanford Group (CHG), in conjunction with the U.S. Department of Energy River Protection Project, is soliciting interest and information from firms having the capability to solidify transuranic (TRU) waste presently stored as sludges (metal precipitates) in several of the Hanford Site underground waste storage tanks.  This capability will be demonstrated in GFY03 by performing limited radioactive laboratory tests independently or by teaming with a laboratory that has the capability to possess radioactive materials and perform tests that simulate TRU tank waste solidification conditions.  The requirement is to determine, verify, and optimize the process conditions for TRU tank waste solidification using simulated and radioactive Hanford tank wastes.  

The engineering evaluation will consist of determining process equipment necessary to separate soluble salts (e.g., sodium fluoride, sodium nitrate, cesium nitrate, and sodium pertechnetate) and solidify the TRU tank wastes to meet waste acceptance criteria for the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP).  Waste acceptance criteria for the WIPP is available at http://www.wipp.carlsbad.nm.us/library/caolib.htm listed under DOE/WIPP-02-3122 for contact-handled and NRC Docket 71-9212, revision 1 for remote-handled TRU waste.  The engineering evaluation will also determine whether the solidified TRU waste should classified as contact-handled (radiation dose rate less than or equal to 200-mrem/hr at waste package surface) or remote-handled (radiation dose rate greater than 200-mrem/hr at waste package surface).  

The vendor is to specify the proposed flowsheet for treating the TRU tank wastes within the constraints identified in this RFI.  The vendor must provide a material balance for the proposed TRU tank waste treatment process that is based on laboratory-scale testing of simulated and actual tank wastes samples.  The material balance must identify all chemical reagents and their concentrations, process conditions (e.g., mass addition rate, flow-rate, temperature, pressure) and the concentrations of the major analytes and radionuclides present in the liquids, solid, and gaseous phases at each step of the vendor?s proposed flowsheet.

The laboratory tests will use radioactive waste samples and materials that simulate Hanford tank waste, the composition of which will be provided by CHG.  The radioactive tank waste samples, to be specified and provided by CHG, will be representative of various TRU tank wastes found at the Hanford Site.  The simulant and radioactive waste samples will contain Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) regulated metals including but not limited to antimony, barium, chromium, cadmium, lead, nickel, silver, and zinc to the extent that these metals are present in the actual tank wastes and other metals, anions and organic compounds such as aluminum, bismuth, iron, lanthanum, manganese, sodium, chloride, fluoride, hydroxide, nitrate, nitrite, phosphate, sulfate, oxalate.  The TRU tank wastes are not known to contain polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) at concentrations above 50 ppm.

The laboratory-scale work involves the preparation of the simulated waste and performing laboratory-scale TRU waste treatment tests per the steps of the vendor proposed flowsheet.  Figure 1 provides a preliminary flowsheet concept for treatment of the TRU waste, however the vendor is responsible for developing the final flowsheet.  The steps to be demonstrated are solid-liquid separation and TRU immobilization, as well as any other process steps identified in the vendor?s proposed flowsheet.  The TRU waste treatment tests are to be conducted without acidifying the TRU tank waste simulant or radioactive samples.  The constituents in the off gas stream from the TRU waste treatment and immobilization process will be identified and quantified.  The removal of soluble salts from the TRU tank waste sludges is to be demonstrated.  The concentrations in each phase of the major components are to be quantified during the washing of the TRU tank waste samples and simulants.  The solids removal efficiency and partitioning of radionuclides (strontium-90, cesium-137, technetium-99, plutonium-239/240, and americium-241) versus operating parameters for the solid-liquid separation process are to be determined.  Formulations for the immobilized TRU tank waste are to be developed and tested to demonstrate compliance with the applicable WIPP waste acceptance criteria.

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to answer questions with regard to this solicitation.  They are as follows: 1.  What are the mechanical specifications required for the diodes?  I.E., what type of physical of package is requested? The mechanical dimensions correspond to those of the C-package discontinued by SDL, Inc., which was previously uploaded. 2.  What are the optical specifications required for the diodes, such as wavelength +/- tolerance, pulse repetition rate, pulse duration, power per pulse? The required wavelength is 792 nm +/-3 nm at 15 C temperature, repetition rate of 10Hz, pulse duration of 1 ms, and total power of 600 watts (in, for example, an array of six 100 watt diode bars). 3.  What are the service utility/electrical specifications such as voltage and current requirements? The current/voltage requirements are flexible as long as they can be driven by typical diode current drivers commercially available. 4.  Are the diodes required to be water cooled or are they to be cooled by conductors? The diode array must be water cooled. All other terms and conditions of this modification remain unchanged.

<DESC>CH2M Hill Hanford Group (CHG), in conjunction with the U.S. Department of Energy River Protection Project, is soliciting interest and information from firms having the capability to separate sulfate from Hanford tank wastes.  This capability will be demonstrated in GFY03 by performing limited radioactive laboratory tests independently or by teaming with a laboratory that has the capability to possess radioactive materials and perform tests that simulate sulfate separation conditions.  The requirement is to determine and verify, in a simulated sulfate removal system, the process conditions to optimize sulfate removal from simulated Hanford tank wastes.  

The laboratory tests will use material that simulates Hanford tank waste, the composition of which will be provided by CHG.  The radioactive tank waste samples, to be specified and provided by CHG, will be representative of various radioactive tank wastes found at Hanford.  The simulant and radioactive waste samples will contain RCRA metals such as barium, chromium, cadmium, lead, silver, and zinc to the extent that these metals are soluble in the alkaline solutions.

The anticipated scope of work involves the preparation of the simulated waste and performing laboratory-scale sulfate removal tests per the steps of the proposed process flow sheet (see Figure 1). 

 The sulfate removal tests are to be conducted under acidic conditions by adding nitric acid to the alkaline tank waste simulant and radioactive samples.  The amount of nitric acid added to the alkaline tank waste should be minimized.  The constituents in the off gas stream from the sulfate removal process will be identified and quantified.  The effect of pH and specific constituents of radioactive tank wastes, such as aluminum, sodium, potassium, phosphate, carbonate, and halides on sulfate removal are to be determined.  The partitioning of strontium, cesium, technetium, and actinides into the sulfate product and the sulfate depleted liquid waste phase is to be determined.  The vendor is to test other, non-RCRA metals (e.g. calcium) for effectiveness as the reagent for separating sulfate from the tank waste simulants.  The sulfate product is to be subjected to the Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure (TCLP) per 40 CFR Part 261 to determine the concentration of metals compared to the Universal Treatment Standards (UTS) specified in 40 CFR Part 268.48.

Based on the results of the TCLP test results, further solidification of the sulfate product may be necessary to meet UTS limits for metals.  The vendor is to recommend and conduct testing of the low-level waste solidification process, if warranted based on the results of the TCLP test results.  The vendor is to conduct testing or demonstrate through analyses the sulfate product (or solidified low-level waste form) meets the criteria for low-level waste forms as defined in the U. S. Nuclear regulatory Commission Technical Position on Waste Form, revision 1 dated January 1991. 

The vendor is to provide a proposed flowsheet and material balance for removing sulfate from the Hanford Site tank wastes within the constraints identified in this RFI.  The material balance for the proposed sulfate removal process must be based on laboratory-scale testing of simulated and actual tank wastes samples.  The material balance must identify all chemical reagents and their concentrations, process conditions (e.g., mass addition rate, flow-rate, temperature, pressure) and the concentrations of the major analytes and radionuclides present in the liquid, solid, and gaseous phases at each step of the vendor?s proposed flowsheet.

STATEMENT OF WORK

Conduct and Independent Analysis and Validation of Information Resources Management Organization Structure, Staffing, and Mission, and Work Assignments and Recommend Any Necessary Changes and Improvements Necessary to Improve the Effectiveness and Efficiency of the Rural Development Information Resource Management and Information Technology Support Programs

1.0	General

1.1	Background

Information technology (IT) in both the private and public sectors has undergone a significant transformation within the past several years which has expanded and altered the type of automation support activities now delivered by organizations assigned this responsibility.  The emergence of web-based applications and systems has expanded automation support activities by emphasizing the need for increased telecommunications capabilities and improved security processes to protect information assets.  The deployment of mainframe applications has been superceded with the design, development, and implementation of web-centric applications hosted on servers.  Organizational constructs such as ?web farms? have been introduced.  New automation technologies have been introduced such as firewalls, intrusion detection, public key identification (PKI), electronic data interchange (EDI), data warehouses/data marts, imaging and workflow management, fully automated call centers, automated mail handling, and many others.  New software tools have been introduced which has and continues to alter the landscape of IT organizations as they struggle to keep pace with the accelerating availability of new automation technology.  Organizational structures that, in the past, supported a mainframe environment and a limited array of tools, operating systems, and data base management systems are no longer effective to responding to the automation support demands of today.

In addition to this technical evolution, congressional mandates have emerged that require government agencies to better plan and manage IT capital investments.  IT managers must now be knowledgeable in financial management concepts such as the computation of present values, pay-back period computations, and the computation of return on investment.  Performance goals must be defined and measured continually throughout the life of an investment.  The Department of Agriculture has developed and deployed an Information Technology Investment Planning System (ITIPS) to monitor the performance of agencies in the accomplishment of all capital planning activities.  Annual reporting and review processes are coordinated through the Department with the Office of Management and Budget.  These new capital planning activities have been absorbed by IRM but not efficiently integrated into the organization.

Over the past several years, like most organizations within the federal government, the Information Resources Management organization has been impacted by staffing cuts and decreased budget allocations.  In some divisions and branches reductions in supervisory staff has increased supervisory-to-employee ratios above 25 to 1 while other parts of the IRM organization experience significantly lower ratios. Although this allows IRM to maintain an overall acceptable ratio, realignment of managerial and supervisory ratios is imperative to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of managers in IRM divisions and branches with the extremely high ratios. Secondly, as a result of hiring restrictions and budgetary limitations, the IRM organization has been unable to transform itself to keep pace with the changing technical environment as well as the emerging legislative and Departmental mandates impacting on its mission.  New mission and work assignments have been made to divisions and branches based on the availability of personnel and not necessarily on assigned mission.  This has resulted in much overlapping of work assignments and conflicts in carrying out assigned missions. Thirdly, the reduction in staff has caused many tasks performed within IRM that are directed to monitoring and improving IRM efficiency and effectiveness have been abandoned and the performance of other tasks has been reduced in frequency.   Some examples of such tasks include the constant monitoring and analysis of cost reports related to National Information Technology Center billings, strategic IRM planning efforts,  and the analysis of National Finance Center costs.
 

1.2 Objective

This Statement of Work (SOW) is directed toward the completion of an analysis of the current organizational and staffing make up of Rural Development?s Information Resources Management organization.  This includes the development of recommendations that will allow the Agency to build an IT organization better able to provide the automation support required by the Agency and better positioned to meet the ever changing automation technologies that are rapidly emerging through out the industry.


1.3	Scope

The Agency requires the analysis of current mission responsibilities and workload assignments throughout the IRM organization both in Washington, D.C. and St. Louis, Mo.  The organization structure of the Rural Development IRM should be studied, evaluated, and compared to the structure in other government agencies and in private industry.  Recommendations for organizational and staffing changes should be based on an assessment of ?best practices? throughout the IT community.  Interviews of key IRM managers including the Chief Information Officer, Deputy Chief Information Officer, all division directors, and selected branch chiefs should be conducted.

The Agency requires this analysis and the resulting recommendations in order to effect changes in the IRM organization that will improve the efficiency and effectiveness of automation support program throughout the Agency.

<DESC>Points of Contact: Joetta Bernhard, Contracting Officer, 315/330-2308 (Joetta.Bernhard@rl.af.mil); David Ferris, Program Manager, 315/330-4408 (David.Ferris@rl.af.mil).  BAA 99-04-IFKPA is amended as follows:  Delete all information under "General Information" and substitute the following:  "GENERAL INFORMATION: Prospective offerors should first submit a 5 - 10 page white paper that describes their technical approach, an estimate of the cost, a schedule, a description of the deliverables (i.e. final report, breadboard, brassboard, etc.) and whether the proposal is intended to be short-term or long-term technology development. Based on the technical, financial and schedule content of the white paper the government will decide whether to request a proposal. Offerors are required to submit an original and (5) copies of their white paper with a cover letter indicating whether the offeror is a large, small, woman-owned small business, Historically Black College or University, or Minority Institution, to AFRL/IFEM, ATTN: David Ferris, 32 Brooks Road, Rome, NY 13441-4114.  White papers may be submitted throughout the life of this BAA.  Contract awards will be made throughout the life of this BAA as funding becomes available.  Also, small business only should send one (1) copy of the cover letter only (1st Class Mail, Unclassified only) to ATTN: Ms Janis Norelli, Director of Small Business, AFRL/IFB, 26 Electronic Parkway, Rome NY 13441-4514. Options are discouraged and unpriced options will not be considered. Offerors must mark their white papers with the restrictive language stated in FAR 15.609(a). Multiple white papers may be submitted in different areas of technology. White papers are limited to a total page count of 10 pages and shall be double-spaced with a font no smaller than 12 pitch. NIJ has budgeted approximately $4.0 million in FY99. Additional funding will be available in FY00, FY01, FY02 and FY03.  The total value of all efforts awarded under this BAA will not exceed $15 million. Proposals should be for up to 24-months of effort, and range in value between $500,000 - $1M. This effort should include those tasks necessary to get to a breadboard system (in the case of long term technology) or a brassboard system (in the case of near term technology). It is anticipated that the effort will be modified via an engineering change proposal for continued technology development with the ultimate goal of a demonstration. The demonstration will depend on the type of technology developed and whether the technology is considered near term or long term. Only government evaluators will make selections under this BAA.  Personnel from the Air Force Research Laboratory and the National Institute of Justice, as well as other federal agencies and state and local police agencies will evaluate proposals.  The cost of preparing proposals in response to this announcement is not an allowable direct charge to any resulting contract or any other contract, but may be an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect cost in FAR 31.205-18. An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear significant concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. Routine questions are not considered to be "significant concerns" and should be communicated directly to the Contracting Officer, Joetta A. Bernhard, and (315) 330-2308. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the Contracting Officer or Program Manager, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements and recommendations to the appropriate Government personnel.  The Ombudsman for this acquisition is Lt. Col. Reid S. Lerum, Chief, Contracting Division, AFRL/IFK at (315) 330-7746. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of the proposals or in the source selection process.

<DESC>This notice is a Request for Information only.  The Government may or may not issue a solicitation as a result of this announcement.  The Government will NOT pay for any information given in response to this call for information.



BACKGROUND

Pursuant to the authority established in the Clinger Cohen Act, the Senior Procurement Executive (SPE) of the General Services Administration is interested in receiving information from industry, specifically education institutions and test development experts, on the feasibility of offering examinations to measure the ability of the GSA acquisition workforce to apply knowledge gained through classroom and on-the-job training.  

Presently, there are nearly 3,000 associates that are considered to fall within the definition of GSA's acquisition workforce.  The distribution by series is as follows:

Job Title                                      Number of Employees
Contract Specialist--                        1,292
Property Disposal Specialist--             174
Purchasing Agent--                             103
Procurement Clerk--                             84
OTHER--                                               1354 
TOTAL                                                 2,957

Under current law, those in the contracting series, and those possessing a contracting officer?s warrant regardless of their series, are required to meet established educational requirements, depending on their grade.   It is envisioned that competency testing can help management understand where to focus learning resources as well as to identify those associates who are fully qualified in all competencies, even if they lack some of the classroom hours.  The goal of the SPE is to use a combination of competency testing and classroom instruction to fully qualify the entire acquisition workforce by 2005. The competencies as defined by the Acquisition Workforce Committee Competencies are detailed herein.


Those institutions that are interested in partnering with GSA to develop a competency testing solution may submit a response in the format outlined below.  More detailed statistical information is available at: www.gsa.gov/xxxxxx, or by contacting Kenneth J. Buck at 202-219-0311.  Responses are due by January 21 and may be submitted electronically to: Ken.Buck@gsa.gov.

The next step will be to hold face-to-face meetings with any respondent(s) to help refine the acquisition strategy.  Depending on the information received in response to this announcement, GSA is open to making a single award for these services.  Before making this determination, GSA will take into consideration the number of interested respondents, the estimated development costs and the number of GSA associates that need to take the test for the endeavor to be profitable for the industry partner.  Be assured that all information submitted is deemed to be confidential and not releasable to anyone outside of the Government evaluation team.








Please respond to the following statements and questions.

1)	Discuss the pros and cons of using competency testing to measure the quality of the GSA acquisition workforce.

2)	Discuss any known legal or regulatory barriers that might prohibit use of testing.

3)	Discuss the historic precedence for using such testing in the acquisition or other disciplines.

4)	It is envisioned that any test would include a combination of objective and subjective case studies to measure the capability of the GSA associate to apply knowledge in real life settings.  Is it feasible to develop such a comprehensive test?   If so, how would it be structured? 

5)	What program resources (number and qualifications) would GSA need to allocate to support industry partner(s) in any endeavor? 

6)	Given the potential pool of associates, would you consider a cost sharing arrangement where the development costs are borne by the industry partner and then recovered on a transaction basis through either preparatory classes and/or application of the test?

7)	If a cost sharing scenario is acceptable, identify any potential risk factors and what GSA could do to help minimize risk.  

8)	Based on the breakdown of the GSA workforce (see website), how many associates would need to be tested in order for you to recover your costs and realize a reasonable profit?  Please be as specific as possible.

9)	Are your services available on a GSA Schedule or another multiple/single award IDIQ contract?

PROJECT# FE212615T6

U.S. Army Medical Information Systems and Services Agency
Application Technology Division

Domino Application Development Support

Statement of Work
A.  DATE: 26 JUN 2002

B.  SHORT TITLE:  Domino Support

C.1  Scope of Work.   The U.S. Army Medical Command (MEDCOM) is responsible for obtaining and maintaining communications and functional information support systems throughout their respective commands.  MEDCOM has deployed Domino to facilitate communications and increase staff productivity throughout the AMEDD.  Domino is a groupware application that allows workgroups to share information across local-area-networks, wide-area-networks, and dial-up lines.  Domino consists of two key components: The Domino server and the Domino workstation. The Domino server provides services to Lotus Notes workstations including storage and replication of shared databases and mail routing.  MEDCOM has established a 20-server Domino Network worldwide.  

	Reference Memorandum, MCIM, 3 May 01, subject:  Action Plans for U.S. Army Medical Department (AMEDD) Information Management Priority Projects, the ACSIM tasked USAMISSA to provide a recommendation and plan 	for Domino migration to a Microsoft-compatible application that will operate on the enterprise mail system. USAMISSA recommended and provided a plan for limited migration and coexistence between Domino and Microsoft.  The main solution for Microsoft will be Webstore, which is implemented in Sharepoint Portal Server and Exchange 2000.  As Exchange 2000 is deployed, Public Folder replication will be used to extend the reach of the applications.  Contractors engaged in the coexistence/migration must have an understanding of both Lotus Notes/Domino and Microsoft Exchange Server. It is critical that we approach the coexistence/migration with a deep technological comprehension of both products.  

C.1.2   Objectives. To establish coexistence and limited migration between Domino and Microsoft as well as obtain central 
support for Domino application development for the AMEDD.  Activities include, but not limited to, registration, re-registration, deletion of servers and users, monitoring and adjustment of network resources, development and monitoring of replication schedules, development and monitoring of mail routing.
	
C.1.3	Hours of Operation.  Work will normally be performed during normal duty hours, Monday-Friday, excluding federal holidays, 8 hours per day during the period 0700 to 1630 with one hour for lunch.  A tour of duty shall be established with the Technical Manager  (TM) and the Contracting Officer Representative (COR) upon contract award.  Total hours of performance shall not exceed the number of hours ordered in the schedule.  Subject to prior approval, variation in work schedule is acceptable when the total contract hours are not exceeded and no obligation is incurred requiring contract personnel to be paid overtime.  If required, overtime will be worked ONLY with approval from an authorized Government agent, such as the TM, COR, or Contracting Officer (KO).  In the event of office closure due to inclement weather, the contractor shall report to work unless otherwise directed by their company supervisor and/or the COR/TM/KO.  This is a non-severable task due to the continuous nature of these services.  Management information requirements would be at risk if support were not maintained during the transition between program periods.

C.1.3.1	Place of Performance.    Work shall be performed on-site at USAMISSA, , 2455 NE Loop 410, Ste 150, San Antonio, TX  78217-5607.

C.1.3.2 Level of Effort.   The Government estimates approximate hours as follows:  Senior Information Engineer (2 FTE).

C.1.3.3	Travel. Contractor travel expenses will be equivalent to the JTR and a request will be submitted prior to performance of the travel to the COR for approval.  After travel has occurred, a detailed invoice with a breakdown of expenses will be submitted to the COR. Contractor personnel may be required to perform temporary duty (TDY) to accomplish taskings.  The contractor shall be responsible for airline scheduling and ticket costs.  The approval authority for travel will be the government TM.
 

C.1.3.4  Travel Security Briefing. Contractor personnel traveling for the purpose of performing temporary duty (TDY) outside the 50 United States, its territories and possessions, require an Antiterrorism (AT) and Force Protection (FP) briefing within 6 months of travel.  The briefing includes viewing a Force Protection video, and receiving an additional briefing from a certified AT/FP instructor (including area specific information).  The TM and USAMISSA Security Manger shall assist in scheduling these briefings.

C.1.3.5  Guidance from Headquarters, U.S. Army, Europe, and Seventh Army, DOD Contractor  Personnel Office, requires that ALL Contractor personnel complete a Request for Confirmation 
of Exemption from the Requirement to Obtain a Work Permit (via fax) through the European 
Regional Medical Command to the German BadenWurt Office in Stuttgart if Contractor personnel who will be entering the country of Germany for short-term TDY travel.  (A short-term TDY consists of 90 days or less.)  Any individual, as well as the corporation who employees the individual, who stays 91 days or longer is automatically subject to payment of German taxes and/or fine(s) upon departure from Germany.  If approved, by the German Government, this exemption will allow tax-free status for the duration of the approved TDY period.  Failure to comply with this requirement puts the individual, the corporation that employs the individual, as well as the Government, at risk for potential fines, German taxes, and/or other actions.  Compliance is mandatory.  The TM shall provide assistance for this requirement.

<DESC>The Naval Air (NAVAIR) Systems Command, (NAVAIR Lakehurst, NJ) anticipates the need for a temperature bath procurement to update/replace the current inventory of older model temperature baths and is seeking sources and /or information.  The temperature bath or baths must be commercially available, "off the shelf" items with existing product specifications, manuals, technical information and test results that can be made available for comprehensive review and/or evaluation as required.  As previously stated, this is NOT a developmental item and, as such, the Navy's goal is to avoid the prolonged waits, developmental costs and re-engineering associated with developmental type procurements. 
     NAVAIR Lakehurst is requesting information regarding any commercially available products capable of meeting the requirements as set forth below (spec's, tech manuals, product brochure's, etc).  Product availability for evaluation, if required, is requested.  NOTE:  While this is not a complete specification, it serves to set the approximate technical parameters for any potential competition should the government decide to issue a request for procurement (RFP).  Temperature bath standards are used primarily in NAVAIR depot-level calibration facilities, including the regional labs, Mobil Calibration Complexes (MCCs) and several FCAs (field calibration activities) having special capability.  These standards are used to support a wide range of workload items that cannot physically fit into the Portable Temperature Calibrators (PTCs) and/or require a higher degree of calibration accuracy than the PTCs can provide.  Furthermore, their larger access opening size enables calibration of the multiple Test Instruments (TIs) simultaneously.  The following provides a listing of several types of TIs that are calibrated with the temperature baths:
Liquid In Glass Thermometers
Bi-Metallic Thermometers
Remote Indicating Thermometers
Temperature Switches
Thermistors
Digital Multimeters
Pyrometers
Digital Indicators
Thermocouple Thermometers
Digital Thermometers
     Unless otherwise indicated, the specifications below are written around a single bath; although, it may be necessary to employ a system of baths in order to satisfy all of the requirements. The requirements for the temperature baths are as follows:  
POWER: The temperature bath shall operate on 115 VAC and less than 20 amps.     DRAINAGE: The temperature bath shall have a drainage system to permit drainage of the bath fluid.
TEMPERATURE RANGE: The bath, or system of baths, shall cover a temperature range of -40 ?F to 1000 ?F.
  


FUME HOODS:  The bath and corresponding bath fluid shall be chosen such that they can be safely operated over the required temperature range (provided in TEMPERATURE RANGE) and the permissible exposure limits set forth in the 29 Code Of Federal Regulations 1910 (Occupational Safety and Health Standards) for any substances generated or intrinsic to the specific bath fluids without requiring the use of a fume hood.    NOTE:  Navy testing has indicated that certain bath fluids used over specific temperature ranges will not exceed the Short-Term Exposure Limit (STEL) and Permissible Exposure Limit (PEL) set forth in the 29 Code Of Federal Regulations 1910: 
          Dow Corning Corporation- Dow Corning 200? Fluid, 5 CST:  -40 to 80 ?C
          Dow Corning Corporation- Dow Corning 200? Fluid, 50 CST:  60 to 180 ?C
          Heatbath Corporation- Tempering A-HTS PINK/PETRO AG:  180 to 550?C
     Although the temperature bath mediums are not limited to those indicated above, any and all conditions outside those previously stated must demonstrate the capability of satisfying the exposure limits set forth in the 29 Code Of Federal Regulations 1910 without the use of a fume hood or other similar ventilation device.  Documented proof by an accredited Occupational Safety and Health Standards Agency must be provided.
TEMPERATURE STABILITY:  The stability for the bath and fluid shall be 0.011 ?F (0.006 ?C) or better at any temperature set point within the temperature range requirements for approximately a 30-minute duration (sufficient time for TI to stabilize and to make a measurement).  This stability shall be achievable while using the same fluid.  If multiple bath units are necessary to cover the temperature range, then each bath shall provide the aforementioned stability over the range the bath and fluid will be used.  A stirring mechanism within the bath is preferred in order to expedite and maintain stability and uniformity throughout the bath fluid or medium.
IMMERSION DEPTH:  The temperature bath shall be able to provide a minimum immersion depth of 12 inches.  
WORKING VOLUME / ACCESS OPENING:   The access opening shall be at least 4" in diameter (circular), 4" x 4" (rectangular or square) or equivalent.  Larger access opening is preferred to facilitate the calibration of multiple workload items simultaneously.  The working volume shall be comprised of, at a minimum, a depth of 12 inches and a diameter of 4 inches.  This volume shall be unobstructed.
TEMPERATURE BATH MEDIUM:  The temperature bath medium shall be chosen such that the following hold:
1)	One bath fluid or medium for the temperature range over which the bath will be used.  If more than one bath is used to cover the temperature range requirement (-40 to 1000 ?F), then a bath fluid shall be selected such that it is not necessary to change / exchange the fluid in order to cover the range over which the bath will be used.
2)	The use of the bath fluid or medium over the operating temperature range of the bath shall not require the use of a fume hood as a result of hazardous substances (i.e., fumes/vapors) generated by the fluids and/or to remove displaced particles (i.e., aluminum oxide, sand, etc.) in the air due to use.
3)	To reiterate from the TEMPERATURE STABILITY requirement, the bath fluid or medium shall satisfy the stability requirement over the temperature range requirement.  If more than one bath is used to satisfy the temperature range requirement, then the fluid in each bath shall be stable over the entire temperature range that the bath is used.
SAFETY FEATURES:  A label with the maximum safe operating temperature in accordance with the temperature bath medium requirements is preferred.  If the temperature bath is capable of operating at temperatures that exceed the safe operating temperature range of the bath fluid, there shall be some mechanism to prevent the operator from operating the bath beyond the safe operating temperature of the bath fluid.  Additionally, there shall be some mechanism to disable the unit or shut the unit down in the event of thermal runaway.
TEMPERATURE CONTROLLER AND DISPLAY:  The temperature display shall provide a visual indication of the current bath temperature.  Additionally, the following shall be prevalent:
SET-POINT RESOLUTION:  The temperature bath display shall provide a set-point resolution of 0.001 ?C / ?F or better.
TEMPERATURE SET-POINT:  The temperature controller shall accept a desired temperature set point and the bath able to achieve that set point within an acceptable time period.
TEMPERATURE UNITS:  The temperature display shall provide temperature indications in the following measurement units:
1)	Celsius (?C)
2)	Fahrenheit (?F).
HEATING AND COOLING TIME:  The bath shall permit the calibration of a test instrument at a minimum of 4 equally spaced test points (including -40 ?F and 1000 ?F as the minimum and maximum test point values, respectively) within a 6-hour period.  This time period includes the time necessary for the bath and the corresponding fluid to heat and/or cool while in transit to the test points and also to stabilize with the test instrument and/or standard monitoring device for measurements made at all four test points.
FLUID LEVELING CAPABILITY:  There shall be a mechanism/fixture that permits the bath fluid or medium to be brought to a suitable working depth for particular workload such as the liquid in glass thermometers and short-stem dial thermometers.  This fluid-leveling capability may result from the actual construction of the bath or an appropriate adjustable leveling fixture that permits the TI to be brought to the level of the bath fluid.
MULTIPLE BATH UNITS:  Although a single bath capable of satisfying all of the requirements is desired, there are limitations imposed by the bath fluids themselves.  Hence, it may be necessary to employ a system of baths in order to satisfy the requirements.  If more than one bath is necessary to satisfy the requirements (i.e., cover the temperature range), the following shall be considered during the evaluation (i.e., all else being equal, a three-bath system occupying only x amount of space will be selected over another system occupying 2x amount of space):
1.	Combined total volume of the system, including additional equipment necessary for operation (i.e., compressor).
2.	Total square footage of lab space occupied by the baths.
INTERFACE:  The temperature bath shall have at least one standard IEEE-488 parallel interface for data transmission and reception for automated calibration and bath monitoring.

Be prepared to eat lunch at your own expense at any authorized base civilian facility; if you go off base for lunch, it may be di fficult reentering the base.  Prior to Industry Day, the Government requests responses to the following questions;  1. With this acquisition potentially being an IDIQ Cost Plus Award Fee type contracting, would your firm (Small or Large Business) have the financial capability or be able to obtain the financial capability to purchase Materials, or provide other required services prior to invoicing? Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA) reviews and approves invoicing, once materials have been purchased and/or work has commenced, prior to submission to the Corps of Engineers  for payment.   2. The contractor will be required to purchase/acquire the equipment and or lab space required by the Scope of Work, approximately $2,500,000, then amortize that cost over the expected five year life of the contract (see Section 3.3.3 in the draft Scope of  Work).   Will this requirement affect your financial capabilities? 3. In the current contract, the government convenes an Award Fee board every six months to determine the award fee the contractor is entitled to. If the contract strategy would change to a 2% Base Fee plus an Award Fee, would that action aid in your obtain ing financial capability? 4. Does your firm currently have the necessary approved purchasing system required for a Cost Plus type contract, to receive an award of such a contract?  If not, how would you perform the contract while meeting the requirements for an approved purchasing system? 5. Because of the anticipated size of this acquisition, would offerors potentially enter into a Joint Venture or other teaming arrangement in order to meet the performance requirements of the solicitation? 6. How long a transition period would industry feel necessary to ensure that it was able to perform the contract and present a seamless transition of contract performance to the Government? 7. Could industry hire adequate workforce at time of award of contract with the knowledge and skills needed to perform the contract?   Would it take an extended period of time (30, 60, 90 days) for hiring of qualified personnel to have them in place and tr ained?  8. Would the Colorado Springs local economy support the manpower requirements with the security clearances necessary to perform a contract of this size over an extended period of time? Minimum security requirement for required  personnel is SECRET.  9. What method of security or mode of protection would industry provide for the Government furnished property that would be transitioned to a newly awarded contractor?

<SUBJECT>R -- Core Competencies for GSA Acquisition Workforce
<DESC>This notice is a Request for Information only.  The Government may or may not issue a solicitation as a result of this announcement.  The Government will NOT pay for any information given in response to this call for information.



BACKGROUND

Pursuant to the authority established in the Clinger Cohen Act, the Senior Procurement Executive (SPE) of the General Services Administration is interested in receiving information from industry, specifically education institutions and test development experts, on the feasibility of offering examinations to measure the ability of the GSA acquisition workforce to apply knowledge gained through classroom and on-the-job training.  

Presently, there are nearly 3,000 associates that are considered to fall within the definition of GSA's acquisition workforce.  The distribution by series is as follows:

Job Title                                      Number of Employees
Contract Specialist--                        1,292
Property Disposal Specialist--             174
Purchasing Agent--                             103
Procurement Clerk--                             84
OTHER--                                               1354 
TOTAL                                                 2,957

Under current law, those in the contracting series, and those possessing a contracting officer?s warrant regardless of their series, are required to meet established educational requirements, depending on their grade.   It is envisioned that competency testing can help management understand where to focus learning resources as well as to identify those associates who are fully qualified in all competencies, even if they lack some of the classroom hours.  The goal of the SPE is to use a combination of competency testing and classroom instruction to fully qualify the entire acquisition workforce by 2005. The competencies as defined by the Acquisition Workforce Committee Competencies are detailed herein.


Those institutions that are interested in partnering with GSA to develop a competency testing solution may submit a response in the format outlined below.  More detailed statistical information is available at: www.gsa.gov/xxxxxx, or by contacting Kenneth J. Buck at 202-219-0311.  Responses are due by January 21 and may be submitted electronically to: Ken.Buck@gsa.gov.

The next step will be to hold face-to-face meetings with any respondent(s) to help refine the acquisition strategy.  Depending on the information received in response to this announcement, GSA is open to making a single award for these services.  Before making this determination, GSA will take into consideration the number of interested respondents, the estimated development costs and the number of GSA associates that need to take the test for the endeavor to be profitable for the industry partner.  Be assured that all information submitted is deemed to be confidential and not releasable to anyone outside of the Government evaluation team.








Please respond to the following statements and questions.

1)	Discuss the pros and cons of using competency testing to measure the quality of the GSA acquisition workforce.

2)	Discuss any known legal or regulatory barriers that might prohibit use of testing.

3)	Discuss the historic precedence for using such testing in the acquisition or other disciplines.

4)	It is envisioned that any test would include a combination of objective and subjective case studies to measure the capability of the GSA associate to apply knowledge in real life settings.  Is it feasible to develop such a comprehensive test?   If so, how would it be structured? 

5)	What program resources (number and qualifications) would GSA need to allocate to support industry partner(s) in any endeavor? 

6)	Given the potential pool of associates, would you consider a cost sharing arrangement where the development costs are borne by the industry partner and then recovered on a transaction basis through either preparatory classes and/or application of the test?

7)	If a cost sharing scenario is acceptable, identify any potential risk factors and what GSA could do to help minimize risk.  

8)	Based on the breakdown of the GSA workforce (see website), how many associates would need to be tested in order for you to recover your costs and realize a reasonable profit?  Please be as specific as possible.

9)	Are your services available on a GSA Schedule or another multiple/single award IDIQ contract?

Description:

Smart cards provide a number of security services, including identification and authentication of the card holder.  However, a lack of interoperability standards and systems oriented architectural models has hampered adoption of smart card technology within the United States.

The National Institute of Standards and Technology has been working with industry and other federal agencies under the auspices of the Government Smart Card(GSC) program to establish an interoperability framework for smart card based systems.  As part of the effort to promote smart card interoperability, NIST wishes to initiate collaborations with industry to explore and develop object oriented smart card interoperability models within the context of the GSC interoperability framework.  The goal of this collaboration is to produce consistent, standardized models and toolkits for GSC smart card integrators.

Interested parties should send an email message to james.dray@nist.gov with the subject line "Smart Card Collaboration" on or before October 1, 2002.

<SUBJECT>A -- Secondary Spectrum Usage
<DESC>DARPA's Advanced Technology Office (ATO) intends to enter into sole source negotiations with Shared Spectrum Company to determine the utilization of the RF spectrum in the vicinity of several sites inclusive of DoD test ranges within the continental United States for use in the development of secondary spectrum sharing technology.  The measurements will cover primarily non-federal bands from 54 MHz to 3,000 MHz to explore the possibility of the sharing spectrum.  The measurement locations will be proposed for approval to the DARPA PM.  Locations will include, but not limited to, the regions surrounding Pax River NAS, Edwards AFB, Eglin AFB, and White Sands Missile Range. 

The measurements will be constructed to identify large temporal and spatial spectrum holes and will consider a wide range of primary user characteristics (high power, low power, high duty cycle, low duty cycle, omni-antennas, and directional antennas).  A single point, contractor furnished measurement system will be used. The measurements will include a combination of non-simultaneous ground and airborne spectrum measurements, with each measurement period lasting at hours and with measurements repeated over multiple days to obtain statistically valid samples.  This announcement is not a request for proposals, or an RFP of any kind.
