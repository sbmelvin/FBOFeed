<DESC>NASA/ARC has a requirement to extend the performance period of the FacilitiesMaintenance Contract  (FMC) for an additional six months with an additional two-monthoption period. This extension will provide on-going facilities maintenance servicespending completion of the procurement process and award of the follow-on contract. Amodification reflecting this extension will be issued on or before January 31, 2010,which is the expiration date of the current contract. NASA/ARC intends to extend the period of performance of contract NNA04CB37C which wasawarded as a single, hybrid contract with firm fixed price work, indefinitedelivery/indefinite quantity (IDIQ), and cost plus elements to Johnson Controls WorldServices, Inc. (now IAP Worlds Services) on July 30, 2004. This award was the result offull and open competition. The current contract, inclusive of a two-month phase-inperiod, consists of a five (5) year, four month performance period, commencing fromOctober 1, 2004, to January 31, 2010.  The six-month extension of the contract, and thetwo-month option period, if exercised by the Government, would result in a six (6)year performance period, commencing from October 1, 2004 to September 30, 2010. Thisperformance period  includes the basic requirement and all options.  NASA is using the authority for Other Than Full and Open Competition provided by 10U.S.C. 2304(c)(1). The work under the FMS contract includes (1) responding to troublecalls; (2) accomplishing recurring services such as PM that involves routine periodicmaintenance, incidental repair requirements associated with facilities, utility systems,and dynamic equipment for which no specific operators are assigned, and PredictiveTesting and Inspection (PT&I) of equipment and systems; (3) operations that involveattendance type work; and (4) emergency response support.  Indefinite Delivery IndefiniteQuantity (IDIQ) work consists of unit priced tasks and craft hour unit price work. Noalternate source could adequately provide this support during this brief extensionperiod.  The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intendsto solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302.  Thepurpose of this action is to bridge the performance period between the end of the currentcontract and the anticipated award of the follow-on requirement.  Procurement activityfor the follow-on contract has been initiated under NNA08226867R, Facilities MaintenanceServices (FMS) and market research has been performed.	The follow-on contract	wassolicited on a competitive basis. It is the intent of the government to award this action on a sole source basis. Award toanother source at the same the evaluation phase of the procurement process is takingplace for the follow-on contract would result in substantial duplication of costs andunacceptable delays in fulfilling the Government's requirements.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. A determination by theGovernment not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice issolely within the discretion of the Government.  Notwithstanding this stated intent, interested parties may submit their capabilities andqualifications to perform the effort IN WRITING to the identified point of contact notlater than 4:30 p.m. local time on January 04, 2010. Such communication ofcapabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determiningwhether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. Oral communicationsare not acceptable in response to this notice.The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.An Ombudsman has been appointed. See NASA Specific Note "B".

Due date for receipt of proposal will be indicated in the solicitation document when it is released.

<p>The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsive responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the government. The following factors shall be used to evaluate proposals:</p>
<p>The Government will award a purchase order using FAR Part 12 and 13 resulting from this solicitation to the responsive responsible offeror who has been determined they are certified through Wright Patterson at the lowest price. Initially, offerors who pass the certification shall be ranked according to price. An offeror's proposed prices will be determined by multiplying the quantities identified in the Pricing Schedule by the unit price for each item to confirm the extended amount for each. When applicable, the price evaluation adjustment for HUB Zone small business concerns will be applied in accordance with FAR 52.219-4, Notice of Price Evaluation Preference for HUB Zone Small Business Concerns, to arrive at an evaluated price. The Government intends to evaluate offers and make an award without discussions; however, this does not preclude the government from having discussions if it is in the best interest of the government to do so.</p>
<p>5352.201-9101 OMBUDSMAN (AUG 2005)</p>
<p>(a) An ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition. When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official. Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern.</p>
<p>(b) Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution. Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMB Circular A-76 competition performance decisions).</p>
<p>(c) If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the USAF Academy Ombudsmen, <br />Kelly Snyder<br />8110 Industrial Drive, Ste 103<br />USAFA, CO 80840<br />Telephone number 719-333-2074<br />FAX 719-333-2379<br />email: kelly.snyder@usafa.af.mil</p>

<p>(d) The ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds the agency.</p>

<DESC>RECOVERY - THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY. THIS OPPORTUNITY WILL ONLY BE AVAILABLE to Lockheed Martin Management Systems Designers, Inc. for reasons as described below.  The Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA) of 1985 provides extended health care insurance coverage for workers who would have otherwise lost health insurance coverage upon becoming unemployed.  The individual was responsible for 100% of the insurance premiums due under COBRA continuation coverage.   Under Recovery Act legislation, individuals whose employment was involuntarily terminated after Aug. 31, 2008 and before Jan. 1, 2010, and who elect COBRA health continuation coverage, are entitled to receive a 65% subsidy on their COBRA insurance premiums.   The involuntarily terminated individual is required to pay 35% of the COBRA insurance premium.  The former employer (or, in some cases, multiemployer health plan or insurer) pays 65%, and may recover their payment by claiming the amount as a credit on their quarterly employment tax return.

This opportunity will provide software development, testing, configuration management and project management support to the IRS Integrated Customer Communications Environment (ICCE) program.  ICCE provides software applications and connections for both phone and web interactive applications, including economic stimulus related applications.  The existing economic stimulus component of ICCE is being modified to accommodate Voice Response Unit (VRU) message changes that are in response to legislative initiatives resulting from the recent enactment of  COBRA changes contained in the American Recovery & Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009 (PL 111-05).  The work is planned to be accomplished by award of a modification to a previously competed ICCE task order under the authority of FAR 16.505 utilizing the existing IRS Total Information Processing Support Services-3 (TIPSS-3) Indefinite Quantities (IDIQ) contract.  The modification will be executed as a performance-based fixed-price action.

<DESC>In compliance with the transparency and accountability requirements associated with the supplemental appropriations provided by the American Recovery and Re-investment Act (ARRA) of 2009 Pub.L.111-5, the Government posts this notice of Request for Quotation No. TIRNO-10-Q-00012 to purchase additional SAS Software MIPS ( millions of instructions per second) required for continued support of existing SAS proprietary software residing on the IBM Mainframe computers at the IRS - Enterprise Computing Center (IRS - ECC) located in Martinsburg, WVA. 

This requirement is to increase SAS Software MIPS as a result of increased workloads to the IRS z Series mainframe environment. These new workloads consist of processing new BMF tax forms within the Modernized eFile tax processing application.  Mission critical tax applications such as BMF, IMF, and CADE will be affected by the changes implemented by ARRA such that increased volumes and changes to programs will require additional processing resources.  In addition, it is anticipated that other IRS tax application systems (such as Corporate File Online (CFO)) that run within this environment will handle increased volumes of queries to support customer interactions. 

THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY. THIS OPPORTUNITY IS AVAILABLE ONLY TO SAS INSTITUTE, INC. as a modification will be issued against the current contract TIRNO-06-C-00077 with SAS Institute, Inc., a large business under the authority of FAR 6.302-01.

<SUBJECT>Supplemental Journal Issue: Menthol Cigarette Smoking
<SOLNBR>NCI100036-AV
<RESPDATE>123109
<CONTACT>Ashley L. Virts, Email virtsa@mail.nih.gov
<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences (DCCPS), Behavioral Research Program (BRP), Tabacco Control Research Branch (TCRB) intends to procure on a sole-source basis with Blackwell Publishing Ltd.; 9600 Garsington Road; Oxford, Great Britain OX4 2DQ for services regarding a supplemental journal issue regarding Menthol Cigarette Smoking.

This acquisition will be processed in accordance with simplified acquisition procedures as stated in FAR Part 13.106-1(b)(1). The North American Industry Classification System Code is 511120 and the business size standard is 500 employees. Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation. This will be awarded as a firm fixed price type contract.

Period of performance:  Shall be for twelve (12) months from date of award.

In 2002, the U.S. National Cancer Institute and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention collaborated with others vendors to host the First Conference on Menthol Cigarettes: Setting the Research Agenda to increase understanding of the sociology, marketing, epidemiology, smoking initiation, biochemistry and the physiological impact of menthol. Since the 2002 Conference, little progress has been made to increase the understanding of menthols role in cancer and other tobacco-related diseases including nicotine dependence, and smoking trajectories.  Some researchers and advocates have hypothesized that menthol might explain the disproportionate tobacco-related cancer burden among African Americans and explain difficulty in quitting among other menthol cigarette smokers. U.S. Food and Drug Administrations legislation on the regulation of tobacco products bans flavored cigarettes, but menthol flavoring has been excluded from the ban due to a lack of conclusive research demonstrating increased harm. This supplement issue aims to examine the association between menthol cigarettes and smoking initiation, cessation, relapse, and addiction.  More specifically, the supplement will examine 1) factors associated with initiation, 2) demographics factors associated with dependence, cessation, and use, 3) neighborhood and community level factors, 4) dependence among menthol smokers, 5) consumption patterns, 6) treatment seeking, use of treatment aids, and quitting and relapse, and 7) policy effects on menthol smoking.  The outcomes of these papers will stimulate additional research on this topic; increase the understanding of the potential harm of menthol in smoking trajectories, and how to ultimately develop interventions to help reduce menthol smoking. These quantitative papers will provide valuable information for policy makers, researchers, and practitioners.   

Blackwell Publishing is solely authorized to publish Addiction, as it is their journal. As such, the contractor is uniquely qualified to carry out this effort.  Addiction is a prestigious monthly international peer-reviewed journal, publishing more than 2,000 pages every year with an impact factor of 4.014 in 2007.  Addiction publishes peer-reviewed research reports on alcohol, illicit drugs and tobacco bringing together research conducted within many different disciplines. Addiction aims to stimulate debate with the field of addiction on matters relating to the science or its translation into clinical practice or policy and promote high quality research in the field of addiction. In addition to original research, the journal features editorials, commentaries, reviews, historical articles and interviews with leading figures in addiction.
Addiction is disseminated around the world and has a diverse readership.  It is read in over 60 countries and has been in continuous publication since the Society for the Study of Addiction was founded in 1884. The readership and scope spans human clinical, epidemiological, experimental, policy and historical research. Addiction will bring menthol cigarette smoking to the attention of scientists who are unfamiliar with this phenomenon, as well as bring the larger context of menthol smoking to the attention of researchers worldwide where menthol is being marketed. 
Addiction is the best vehicle for reinvigorating the topic of menthol smoking, particularly as it relates to dependence, where the strength of its publication record lies. Addiction combines high quality research reports with an interest in ethical aspects of substance abuse related sciences.  This journal is of particular value to public decision makers and these efforts will ultimately help the United States better assess and reduce menthol smoking and inform public policy worldwide about the harms of menthol.  Because Addiction is highly respected, has a 4.014 (2007) impact factor, and is focused on tobacco use and addictive behaviors, it is the belief of the NCI that Addiction is solely positioned to widely disseminate the papers that examine the potential harm of menthol cigarette smoking as a means to reduce tobacco-related disease and deaths. No other journal cross cuts such a wide readership or provide information to the public policy makers, researchers and scientists specifically focusing on addictive behaviors. The aforementioned make Blackwell Publishing uniquely qualified to perform this work.
This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes they can meet the above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities. All information furnished must be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications described herein.

No electronic capability statements will be accepted (i.e. email or fax). An original and one copy must be sent to the NCI Office of Acquisitions at the address stated above.  All questions must be in writing and can be faxed (301) 402-4513 or emailed to Ashley Virts, Contract Specialist at virtsa@mail.nih.gov.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  In order to receive an award, contractors must have valid registration and certification in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) www.ccr.gov and the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA), http://orca.bpn.gov.

<p>This acquisition will be processed under FAR Part 12 - Acquisition for Commercial Items and will be made pursuant to the authority in FAR 13.106-1(b)(2) and 13.501-(a)(1)  using simplified acquisition procedures for commercial acquisitions.</p>
<p>Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation.  This will be awarded as a firm fixed price type contract.</p>
<p>Period of performance shall be for twelve months from date of award.</p>
<p>The Vaccine Branch of the CCR at the NCI is engaged in the study of novel vaccine platforms and immune-based therapies that harness the immune response to control, eradicate or prevent cancer and HIV infection.  The purpose of this contract is to acquire cGMP adenoviral vector expressing the human 	HER2/neu oncogene for use in therapeutic cancer vaccine trials. These trials will allow evaluation of vaccine immunogenicity and the ability of vaccine-induced immune responses to eradicate, reduce or stabilize cancers expressing HER2/neu, specifically breast cancer.<br /> <br />For this project, a total of 7 x 1013 to 1.2 x 1014 total viral particles of clinical grade recombinant adenoviral Ad5f35 vector expressing the extracellular (EC) and transmembrane (TM) portions components of the human HER2/neu oncogene will be required for initial clinical studies.  An additional clinical lot of 7 x 1013 to 1.2 x 1014 total viral particles will be generated for future clinical trials utilizing this vector.  This adenoviral vector must be produced under current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) guidelines in accordance with the CGMP Regulations outlined in 21CFR Parts 210 and 211, in its manufacture and testing as required by the FDA to permit its investigational use in human subjects.  Vector manufacture will include sequence verification, testing for lot toxicity, stability and quality control, and certification of analysis according to Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) as outlined in the Statement of Work.  In addition, all other Chemistry, Manufacturing and Control (CMC) documentation required for IND filing with the FDA is to be provided.<br /> <br />Baylor College of Medicine is the only known source capable of providing the combination of resources required for the project.Baylor College of Medicine has developed the recombinant Ad5f35 vector and has extensive experience in specifically generating this type of recombinant vector under cGMP conditions.  The Ad5f35 vectors generated by Baylor College of Medicine have targeted several different oncogenes and been investigated in multiple clinical trials for different types of cancer. The reason a recombinant Ad5f35 vector is required is because this type of vector:</p>
<p>a)	permits a high transduction efficiency of human B cells and dendritic cells, thereby ensuring greater expression of the HER2/neu oncogene.  <br />b)	makes gene expression less susceptible to neutralization by pre-existing antibodies to Ad5 in patients undergoing treatment with platforms utilizing the Ad5f35 recombinant vector.</p>
<p>Baylor College of Medicine is the only known source that has extensive experience with this Ad5f35 vector.  Baylor College of Medicine also made the pre-clinical grade Ad5f35 recombinant vector expressing the extracellular and transmembrane domains of human HER2/neu, which the Center for Cancer Research has tested and found to have an excellent expression level.  Baylor College will be using these vectors to generate the Master Virus Bank as requested in the current requirement.   Use of the recombinant Ad5f35 vector will maximize expression of HER2/neu ECTM and in turn the immunogenicity of the vaccine platform.  HER2/neu oncogene expression is associated with high recurrence rates and reduced survival following standard treatment.  .  Importantly, vaccines that elicit antibodies targeting HER2/neu are currently not available.</p>
<p>The production of adenoviral vectors for clinical applications requires a multitude of steps all of which are subject to failure.  The Center for Cell and Gene Therapy at Baylor College of Medicine has developed a rigorous series of safety testing protocols (QC/QA) that minimize production failures.</p>
<p>The development of effective alternative treatments as well as treatments that can be combined to enhance the efficacy of current treatment is critical. For the foregoing reasons, the Center for Cell and Gene Therapy, Baylor College of Medicine-BCM is the only known facility that is capable of supplying the adenoviral vector needed to carry out these trials.</p>
<p>This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes they can meet the above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities.   All information furnished must be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications described herein.

<DESC>"THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY". THIS OPPORTUNITY IS AVAILBLE ONLY TO HSMM/HOK AS A SOLE SOURCE PROCUREMENT
TITLE: DESIGN BUILD RFP FOR THE MAIN OPERATING ROOM UNITS AT NATIONAL NAVAL MEDICAL CENTER, BETHESDA, MARYLAND.
This proposed contract action, based on other than full and open competition will be a firm-fixed price, sole source award to HSMM/HOK for Design-Build RFP development and Post Award Construction Services (PCAS). There was requested that other than full and open competition be permitted pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (2) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, Only one responsible source. 
The HSMM/HOK A/E team will be required to develope a RPP for the Main Operating Room Units in Building 9 at Water Reed National Naval Medical Center. The HSMM/HOK A/E team was selected through a competitive process that included a national search for qualified designers, and selection based upon the winning design.  HSMM/HOK has been involved from the onset of the project and developed the original DB RFP for three (3) operating rooms currently undergoing renovation.  In support of the increased need generated by Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC), the renovation of seventeen (17) additional operating room units has been added as a requirement.  Due to their long-term involvement with the project, the HSMM/HOK Medical Planning Staff is well versed in the hospital's requirements, as they are nearly identical to those of the original 3 operating rooms.  This knowledge can be applied in the development of a new RFP for the additional operating rooms, fulfilling the Government's current needs. 
The estimated release of the RFP is 22nd December 2009. The time frame for receipt of proposals will be provided in the solicitation notice.

<DESC>The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) has a requirement to obtain contractor support to aid in code integration, assessment, and application of an evaluation model for the Next Generation Nuclear Plant (NGNP) Project in the reactor systems analysis area, to include aiding in code integration, assessment, and application of an evaluation model for the NGNP in the reactor systems analysis area.  The principal deliverables of this contract will be: (1) an integrated code suite that composes the NGNP evaluation model, (2) an implementation of an uncertainty methodology for this EM, and (3) a code applicability report for the application of this EM to the NGNP design.  The code applicability report will be similar to those produced for the analyses of the ESBWR and the AP-1000 designs with the TRACE code.  The scope of this contract will be limited to code integration, assessment, and application of an Evaluation Model for the NGNP in the area of reactor/plant systems analysis, including thermal-fluid dynamics, nuclear analysis, accident fission product transport and source-term analysis.  The performance of this contract will require close collaboration with other NRC contractors as development of the individual codes from which the EM will be assembled may be performed elsewhere.  

NRC intends to award a single award indefinite quantity/indefinite delivery task order contract. As tasks are identified, NRC will issue individual task order statements of work that specify objectives, scope, deliverables, schedule, and other requirements.  

The solicitation is expected to be posted on or about December 14, 2009. The solicitation package is only available through FEDBIZOPS.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

FAXED OR EMAILED PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED.

Enclosed please find the formal solicitation package you requested. The Postal Service has determined that Highway Contract Route (HCR) transportation services will no longer be advertised to the public as an Invitation to Bid. Accordingly, this solicitation is being offered to the public as a Request for Proposal. There are significant changes in this process. Some of these changes are as follows:

1. As stated under Clause 2.2.8 in the Terms and Conditions, the Postal Service has implemented a program under which postal highway contract route (HCR) suppliers may obtain fuel at certain designated wholesale fuel servicing facilities and retail fuel servicing facilities; all suppliers are required to participate in the Fuel Management Program (see the Fuel Management Program document enclosed dated February 11, 2009).  For evaluation purposes, the contract baseline fuel price per gallon will be determined by the Contracting Officer based on the fueling locations provided by the HCR supplier on the enclosed Fuel Purchase Form (HC 131). The contracting officer will use the average quarterly Department of Energy Regional Fuel Index cost per gallon on the solicitation closing date to evaluate proposals (based on the Fuel Purchase Form submitted). For bulk fuel purchases, the quarterly average USPS Bulk Fuel Program Price Per Gallon will be used for proposal evaluation.  Therefore, for line 6 (fuel) on Form 7468A, Highway Transportation Contract  Bid or Renewal Worksheet, the supplier should include the number of gallons only; the cost per gallon and total cost should be set to zero ($0.00).

2. All parties submitting a proposal will continue to receive a formal notification of contract award. The notification will identify the successful vendor and price.

3. Under Clause 2.1, as stated in the Terms and Conditions, this is a fixed rate contract for highway transportation service to be provided according to the Statement of work and Specifications indicated in the solicitation, schedule, and special notes.

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-weight: normal;">The Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (USUHS) located in Bethesda, MD on the National Naval Medical Campus, intends to negotiate, on a single source basis per FAR Part 13.106-1(b)(1), a service contract with one base year and four option years with Fibergate, Inc. (947600235), 6076 Franconia Road, Suite C, Alexandria, VA 22310, for lease and maintenance of existing fiber cables connecting USUHS (Building 71A) Bethesda, MD to CIM Center (Building 163) Walter Reed Forest Glenn Campus. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-weight: normal;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-weight: normal;">This acquisition will be processed in accordance with simplified acquisition procedures, as stated in FAR 13.106(b)(1) and in accordance with FAR Part 12 (Acquisition of Commercial Items).

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-weight: normal;">(1) For purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, contracting officers may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g., urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, or industrial mobilization).</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-weight: normal;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-weight: normal;">USUHS has determined that Fibergate is the only reasonably available source to meet the government&rsquo;s requirement. This is a follow-on contract for the continued lease and maintenance of fiber cables originally installed by Fibergate. USUHS has determined that award to another source would result in substantial duplication of cost at a price much higher than is expected to be recoverd through competition. Further, installation by a new vendor would lead to unnecessary delays and subsequent loss of coverage/productivity.</span></p>

The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms.

<DESC>Under Statutory Authority of 41 USC 253(c) (1) the Government anticipates entering into a sole source procurement with the University of Wisconsin Hospital and Clinics, Madison, Wisconsin for Radiopharmaceuticals.  The requirement calls for routine patient products to be delivered to the department within 60 minutes of ordering.  The above authority is cited and justification was based on the determination that the Government's minimum needs can best be satisfied by supplies available from one source.  This contract action is for supplies for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under FAR 6.302-1.  Other persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement by January 6, 2010.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all interest received on or before January 6, 2010 will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received as a result of the notice of intent will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No solicitation document is available.

<DESC>The Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP) is seeking interested business parties in supporting the demand for the Modern Burner Unit (MBU), 7310-01-507-9310, and its associated spare parts and accessories.


DSCP anticipates issuing a solicitation for the referenced item(s) under indefinite Quantity Contract (IQC).  The IQC is a long term contract designed to provide for an indefinite quantity, within stated limits, of supplies or services to be furnished during a specific period, with deliveries or performance to schedule by placing an order with the contractor.  The contract is intended for use with items for which recurring demands may be anticipated, as a means of reducing the time and expense required soliciting and making repetitive awards.  Based on the indefinite quantities the awarded may receive awards on unknown quantities for the award year, with a guaranteed minimum and a stated not to exceed maximum.  The contract may be for a term of one year or two years.  Further it may contain an option to extend the term of the contract.  If an option to extend the term of the contract provision is included in the solicitation, each option term would be one year.  However, the total contract term (base year plus options) will not exceed five years.  The answer to the questions concerning pricing will be one of the factors that will help the Government to determine the term of the contract.


Specifications, plans or drawings are not available.  This acquisition is for supplies for which the Government does not possess complete, unrestrictive technical data; therefore, the Government intends to solicit and contract with only approved sources under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1).   Approved sources are: Cage 3AD06, for multiple Part Numbered Items, Part Number MS0003.  Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services.  However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Governments requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.

A COPY OF THE WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL BE POSTED ON THE FOLLOWING WEBSITE: https://www.dibbs.bsm.dla.mil/rfp

***DLA INTERNET BID BOARD SYSTEM (DIBBS) QUOTATIONS ARE NOT ACCEPTABLE FOR THIS SOLICITATION. QUOTES MUST BE SUBMITTED ON A HARD COPY OF THIS REQUEST FOR QUOTE AND FAXED TO DAVID SHARP AT 215-737-0313 OR EMAIL: david.sharp@dla.mil

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Office of Acquisitions and Grants Services (OAGS), Division of Acquisition Operations (DAO) is seeking to identify sources with capabilities or prior experience in CAPACITY BUILDING TRAINING  ANALYSIS OF CURRENT DYNAMICS AROUND THE GLOBE. 


Overview:  FDAs responsibilities have increased greatly in recent years, as globalization, emerging areas of science, and evolving technologies present the Agency with unprecedented challenges and opportunities.  As FDA increases its global engagement, requests for training  seminars, workshops, technical/scientific conferences, teaching forums, lectures, web-based courses and other training mechanisms  will increase significantly in those areas that relate directly to FDAs mission and goals.  For FDA to be strategic in its investments in training as part of its overall capacity building efforts, in capacity building, the Agency needs to clearly understand the range and scope of the current training environment around the globe in areas that align well with FDAs mission to protect the public health by assuring the safety, efficacy, and security of human and veterinary drugs, biological products, medical devices, our nations food supply, cosmetics, products that emit radiation and tobacco products.  As part of increasing FDAs understanding of the global training landscape, the Agency also needs to understand what works well (and less well) to improve the global public health: and which training methods and modalities work best for what circumstances.  

There are governments, multi-country consortia, organizations, FDA-regulated industry sector and academia that performing similar types of training within the foods/feed/medical products/biologics/cosmetics regulatory context, resulting in a duplication of efforts and dilution of scarce resources.  In terms of governments, this includes the large donor countries such as the United Kingdom, Canada, the European Union, Australia, and Japan, among others.  Regarding organizations, there are a number of multilateral organizations, multi-country consortia, non-governmental organizations and foundations that provide training as part of their overall mission, in areas that align closely with FDAs regulatory portfolio.  Examples include the World Health Organization and its regional offices, the Pan American Health Organization; the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC); the Pharmaceutical Inspection Convention and Pharmaceutical Inspection Co-operation Scheme (PIC/S), International Conference of Harmonization, U.S. Pharmacopeia, the Drug Information Association, and the World Trade Organization (WTOs), e.g., WTOs Standards Development and Trade Facility, among others.  Sectors of industry provide some training at the country level, and in some areas of the globe, e.g., Central America, it is not uncommon for academia to play a role in training in areas where FDA has equities, as there governments may lack the capacity to do so.  

STATEMENT OF OBJECTIVES:  

(1) Apply a comprehensive, analytical, systematic review that would identify the current training landscape around the globe in areas that align well with FDAs mission, understand what works well, and which training methods and modalities work best for what circumstances, as well as the costs associated with the various trainings, and 
(2) Provide a report that contains a situational analyses of the landscape and a series of options for FDAs consideration on ways in which it can, in concert with other training stakeholders,(a)  identify a niche role for FDA training around the globe, (b) identify gaps and duplication of efforts in training, and (c) provide recommendations as to how FDA, in concern with other training stakeholders, can work together to expand its collective training reach and impact, in a sustainable, measurable way, in support of assuring the safety, efficacy, and security of human and veterinary drugs, biological products, medical devices, our nations food supply, cosmetics, products that emit radiation and tobacco products.  

Analyze the current investments being made in training, in terms of human and financial resources.  Based on the data, the report should also present options and recommendations for FDAs consideration on ways the Agency, in concert with other major stakeholders in the area of training (in the regulatory areas described above), can best address the needs and challenges of training globally that would best meet FDAs public health mission and goals while improving global regulatory capacity overall.

<DESC>Number: NFFR7400-10-03376 Reference Title: The Operations and Maintenance of the Marine Animal Life Support System at the National Oceanic &amp; Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Pacific Region Center (PRC), Ford Island, Pearl Harbor, HI.
<p>Contract Specialist: Alex Smith</p>
<p>I am requesting to post the following:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY. The Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is seeking sources capable of performing the requirements necessary to provide services for the operations and maintenance of the marine animal life support system at the PRC.</p>
<p>The Government is especially interested in responses from SBA certified small business concerns that are capable of performing the work described within this notice.</p>
<p>GENERAL: NOAA is building a campus of facilities on Ford Island, located in Pearl Harbor, on the island of Oahu in Hawaii. Part of the campus is a total of 15 marine animal tanks of various sizes and purposes with eleven life support systems supporting the 15 tanks to maintain specific water quality. As a consequence of these new tanks and support systems NOAA is seeking a service provider for their operations and maintenance. Operations are expected 365 days per year, with most all activities occurring during a normal eight-hour workday, and only emergency activities occurring off-hours.</p>
<p>In this announcement, NOAA seeks to determine if there are contractors with interest and ability to operate and maintain the newly constructed marine animal life support systems (LSS).</p>
<p>Life Support Systems (LSS) scope:</p>
<p>The systems salt water feed makeup is from an on-site deep well that supports both the marine animal tanks and also the campus main facilities cooling system; this well and its operations and maintenance will be performed by others.</p>
<p>The LSS design is a semi-closed system, and includes marine animals' tanks, pumps and individualized treatment equipment (standard in nature for these types of facilities).</p>
<p>Seawater will be pumped from a well and used to supply tanks containing fish, sea turtles, Hawaiian Monk Seals, and various corals. Six 8' diameter tanks will contain endangered turtles. Two 24' diameter and one 20'tanks are for fish. Four 20' diameter tanks will contain endangered Hawaiian monk seals. Two 8' diameter tanks will contain live coral, microalgae, and invertebrates.</p>
<p>The Life Support Systems salt water treatment processes include customized re-circulating treatment for each type of animal/fish tank.</p>
<p>The NAICS code for this requirement is 712130 and the small-business size standard is $7.0 million.</p>
<p><br />The Government anticipates awarding a fixed-price performance based contract for the operations and maintenance services.</p>
<p><br />This request for information does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that a procurement action will be issued. Nor does this request for information constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise that any procurement action that may be issued for the Government's requirements related to PRC.</p>
<p><br />No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of the submission of contractor's information. The Government shall not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for proprietary information not properly identified. Proprietary information will be safeguarded in accordance with the applicable Government regulations. Please submit information to include:</p>
<p>1) Your firm's DUNS number &amp; CAGE code;<br />2) Your firm's SBA certified small business concern status. Specifically identify if your firm is HUBZone-certified, Service Disabled Veteran Owned, or SBA 8(a) program certified;<br />3) A brief description of your firm's recent past experience (within past 3 years) performing operations and maintenance in support of marine animal life support systems, as described above;<br />4) Your firm's facility capabilities, <br />5) Identify from the list of major work components above those that your firm would likely subcontract out. Any subsequent contract will contain the mandatory FAR clause 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting, which limits subcontracting costs to 50% of the price of the contract.</p>
<p>Information must be received by the Contract Specialist, Mr. Alex Smith, at Alex.Smith@noaa.gov by close-of-business on Tuesday, January 12, 2010. Do not call regarding this sources sought notice. Any questions or responses regarding this notice must be submitted in writing via e-mail to the above e-mail address. Firms that are interested in sub-contracting opportunities related to this project should contact interested vendors directly with inquiries, not the Contracting Officer.</p>

<DESC>The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) is developing and refining business collaboration scenarios to derive the business requirements for a Unified Business Collaboration System. This system must meet the requirements set forth in Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act and be Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 140-2 compliant.  In conducting market research of commercially available communication and collaboration products, the USPTO is interested in products or prototype solutions that will enhance employee job performance, increase user adoption of new technologies, and make new technologies easier to use.
To support such an effort, the USPTO is interested in obtaining no cost trial software/hardware, virtual hard drives, and/or hosted solutions with multiple user accounts to perform business collaboration scenarios and research features that increase a collaboration tools usefulness and ease of use.

The USPTO is considering using products that satisfy the example collaboration scenarios and can integrate with USPTOs current communication systems.  

In addition, the USPTO is also interested in vendor site presentations highlighting the components of suitable systems to a group of key USPTO personnel.  Web presentations are also acceptable in cases where a site visit would cause undue hardship. This group intends to learn as much as possible about the solutions presented to them that satisfy the business collaboration scenarios.

The USPTO is seeking input/comments from interested parties who can provide vendor site presentations and/or provide no cost trial software/hardware, virtual hard drives, and/or hosted solutions with multiple user accounts.

The following table lists twelve business collaboration scenarios that the Unified IP Communication System would address. 

	Scenario	(a.k.a)
1.	External Customer Walkup Videoconferencing
Customer goes to a Video Teleconference (VTC) interview room on the USPTO campus and participates in a VTC with USPTO employees in remote offices.

2.	External Customer/Employee Videoconferencing
Customer uses their own Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), H.320, or H.323 VTC system and participates in a VTC with USPTO employees on campus or in remote offices.

3.       Virtual Employee Assistance
	Assistance initiated via chat to predefined support rooms.  Employee Contact information automatically accessible by Customer Support.  Customer support uses one click access capability to access remote workstation or call employee.

4.	Virtual Meetings Rooms
	Floor conference rooms outfitted to enable USPTO employees to chair videoconferences without additional assistance.  Users should be able to start videoconference within 5 minutes of entering the conference room.  Invite remote participants to conference via Outlook.  Participants join conference with one mouse click. From Outlook Calendar event.    

5.	Virtual Conferences (Webcasts)	
USPTO Auditoriums and Building Conference Centers outfitted with web-casting (i.e., robotic cameras and audio/video interface to audio-visual (AV) system).  Non-interactive meeting of 100+.  Participants can submit questions and respond to polling.  Remote presenters connect via VTC.

6.	Virtual Training Rooms
	Physical classroom outfitted with cameras and presentation tools that are integrated into a distance learning solution/system.  Interactive experience with <50 students.  Some students in physical classroom some students participating via distance learning solution/system.

7.	User Paced Remote Training (Learn Any Time, Anywhere).	Computer Based Training (CBT) modules available via Intranet pages.

8.	Production of content and Re-broadcast of content On Demand
	Broadcast/produce the live event via web-cast (see Virtual Conferences above.)   Ability for employee (or customer) to visit a web site and select a recording of a missed conference, training session, USPTO event, etc.... on demand.

9.                  Peer to Peer Collaboration 
	Starting with a visual representation of a persons availability (presence), quickly send an IM and seamlessly move to a call, add video, and escalate to a web conference to share applications or data files.  Extend conference to multiple parties with ease.

10.  Electronic Team Rooms (Virtual Communities)	
Repository for user supplied content.   Users maintain profile and collaborate via workflow, messaging, discussion forums, blogs, and wikis.  Widgets (SharePoint Web Parts) enable dynamic, interactive business intelligence portals that display information from disparate sources.  Users quickly locate posted information via Search. 
    
11.	Unified Communications	
Integrate all forms (e-mail, IM, audio, voicemail, and presence) of communication.   One employee = one telephone number.  Customer calls one number, employee receives call regardless of location, if working otherwise, and voice mail is activated.

12.	Jurisprudence Collaboration
 	Require a user friendly solution that would permit at least a three judge panel working remotely to meet and edit working documents which tie the edits to the author of the edits (Extended Peer to Peer).  Requirements will quickly expand to at least six members at one time.

Figure 1 provides an overview of USPTOs current communication systems.

 
The following table provides clarification to Figure 1.
	Topic	Page, Section	

1	
Multicast

<DESC>The Pacific Region Tri-Service Regional Business Office (TRBO) Region 12 announces a Request for Regional Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFRIAQ) for the standardization of Pulse Oximetry Sensors & Cables.<BR><BR>The primary objective of this program is to standardize the quality of care across the regions based on the critical balance of clinical efficacy and value. It is intended for this initiative to result in the standardization of a clinically preferred product and source at the best possible price.  It is also intended that standardized products be obtained through the Department of Defense Prime Vendor Program. As a clinically driven program, vendors and products must meet specific technical criteria <BR>plus products must meet or exceed specific clinical performance expectations as a primary consideration. Selection will be based clinical, technical, and pricing factors. The selection will be determined utilizing best value/trade-off criteria.<BR><BR>The major Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs) in the Pacific Region, TRBO Region 12 area include but are not limited to Tripler Army Medical Center, U.S. Naval Hospital Okinawa, U.S. Naval Hospital Guam, U.S. Naval Hospital Yokosuka, MEDDAC-K Seoul, 374th Medical Group Yokota Air Base, 18th Medical Group Kadena Air Base. <BR><BR>This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP), Directorate of Medical Materiel. In order to participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendors for the program, both Cardinal Health and Amerisource Bergen. This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their products. This RFRIAQ is a supplement to the Prime Vendor Program and is not a contract. For additional information regarding DSCPs Prime vendor program please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil<BR><BR>The resulting Regional Incentive Agreement (RIA) will be for a base period of two years (24 months) from date of selection with three one-year (12 months) option periods. Anticipated selection date is Mar 2010.  Products and vendors that pass the technical criteria and pass the clinical performance expectations will be considered clinically preferred products and sources.  Among these clinically preferred products and sources price will be the determining factor for this initiative.  <BR><BR>The selection of a single vendor is anticipated. However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Region, the Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs. In this event, selection would be based on a combination of MTF clinical preference and product availability.  <BR>   <BR>Point of Contact:<BR>Mary Summers, TRBO Technical Director <BR>808-433-3686, mary.summers1@us.army.mil<BR><BR><BR>Cheryl Janus, RN, TRBO Clinical Analyst<BR>808-433-7985, cheryl.janus@amedd.army.mil<BR><BR>B.

<DESC><p style="text-align: center;">PROPOSERS' DAY ANNOUNCEMENT FOR:<br />INTEGRATED COGNITIVE-NEUROSCIENCE ARCHITECTURES FOR UNDERSTANDING SENSEMAKING (ICARUS)</p>
<p>SYNOPSIS<br />The Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA) will host a Proposers' Day Conference for the Integrated Cognitive-Neuroscience Architectures for Understanding Sensemaking (ICArUS) Program on January 19, 2010 in anticipation of the release of a new solicitation in support of the program. The Conference will be held from 8:30am to 4:00pm in the Washington DC metropolitan area. The purpose of the conference will be to provide information on the ICArUS Program, to address questions from potential proposers and to provide a forum for potential proposers to present their capabilities for teaming opportunities.<br />This announcement serves as a pre-solicitation notice and is issued solely for information and planning purposes. The Proposers' Day Conference does not constitute a formal solicitation for proposals or proposal abstracts. Conference attendance is voluntary and is not required to propose to future solicitations (if any) associated with this program.</p>
<p>PROGRAM DESCRIPTION AND GOALS<br />Intelligence analysts are required to interpret data that is sparse, uncertain, and potentially deceptive. The process of generating and evaluating hypotheses to explain ambiguous data is known as "sensemaking" in the psychology literature. In contrast with simple pattern recognition, sensemaking is a volitional process that involves actively seeking and weighing evidence for and against one or more explanatory hypotheses. Yet despite the centrality of sensemaking in intelligence analysis, current models of sensemaking remain descriptive and qualitative in nature and thus are of limited utility to the Intelligence Community.</p>
<p>The human brain is the only known example of a general-purpose sensemaking system. Recent advances in our understanding of brain function, coupled with emerging insights into the nature of learning, memory, decision making, and related cognitive functions, have laid the groundwork for an ambitious new effort to understand human sensemaking. Insights gleaned from these discoveries hold the potential to substantially improve our ability to model, in an explanatory and predictive sense, the human element of the analytic process. These insights will enable us to develop new tools and processes that complement human sensemaking strengths and weaknesses, and to develop new automated analysis tools for assisting overburdened analysts with routine, low-level analytic tasks.<br />The objective of the ICArUS program is to develop integrated computational cognitive neuroscience models that predict and explain human sensemaking behavior. The models are to capture not only positive aspects of human sensemaking, but also relevant cognitive biases in the areas of decision making, attention, and memory. Phase 1 of the ICArUS program will focus on developing integrated (i.e., multiple brain areas functioning as a whole system) computational neuroscience models of sensemaking that are able to learn and apply spatial contextual information in order to make inferences regarding ambiguous data. Phase 2 will expand the functionality of the models to include the ability to learn temporal structure in data (for example, event sequences) and apply this knowledge in a sensemaking task. Phase 3 will further extend the ability of the models to perform sensemaking under situations in which data (or the absence thereof) may be the result of denial and deception.</p>
<p>Models will be assessed based on: 1) their fidelity to the underlying neural and cognitive mechanisms of human sensemaking; and, 2) their ability to predict human performance patterns on challenging analytic/sensemaking tasks. An independent Test and Evaluation Team will be responsible for developing and administering the test problems and for collecting human performance data for comparison. The overall sensemaking task framework will involve the analysis of simulated geospatial intelligence data; however, models will not be required to perform visual feature extraction, object recognition, or other purely perceptual functions.</p>
<p>Successful proposals will involve a multidisciplinary approach combining insights from neuroscience, cognitive science, computer science and related disciplines. Consequently, a significant portion of the ICArUS Proposers' Day conference is dedicated to providing the opportunity to develop teaming arrangements.</p>
<p>REGISTRATION INFORMATION<br />Attendees must register no later than 5:00pm EST January 14, 2010 at https://conference.brtrc.com/ICArUS_pd/. Directions to the conference facility and other materials are available on the website.</p>
<p>Due to space limitations, attendance is limited to no more than 2 representatives per organization. All attendees will be required to present a government issued photo identification (e.g. driver's license or passport) to enter the conference.</p>
<p>ADDITIONAL INFORMATION<br />This event will include a Poster Session to provide an opportunity for attendees to present capabilities and explore teaming arrangements. Details on the poster formats will be provided after approval to register for the Conference has been granted. Poster areas will be provided to the first 40 registered respondents with approved posters. Presentations to the Government to solicit feedback are not intended, and government personnel and their representatives will not be present during the Poster Session.</p>
<p>This Proposers' Day is intended for participants who are eligible to compete on the anticipated BAA. Other Government Agencies, Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs), and University Affiliated Research Centers (UARCs) will not be eligible to submit proposals to the anticipated BAA or participate as team members under proposals submitted by eligible entities. While such entities are not prohibited from attending the Proposers Day, due to space limitations, preference will be given first to those organizations that are eligible to compete.</p>
<p>Attendees who wish to present organization capabilities for potential teaming opportunities may request to do so by sending an e-mail along with their presentation to DNI-IARPA-BAA-10-04@ugov.gov. Presentations will be limited to 5 minutes with a maximum of 5 slides (MS PowerPoint or PDF format). Opportunities to present will be limited by time and will therefore be on a "first ask" basis. Deadline for requests is close of business (5:00pm EST) January 14, 2010. It is the presenter's responsibility to ensure that all materials briefed are appropriately marked and approved for presentation by their organization (remember that this is an UNCLASSIFIED conference). The IARPA Program Manager will review and approve all presentations.</p>
<p>IARPA will not provide reimbursement for costs incurred to participate in this conference.</p>
<p>Electronic devices with the ability to record are prohibited at this event.</p>
<p>Questions concerning conference &amp; registration can be sent to IARPAevents@brtrc.com. <br />Questions regarding the program can be sent to dni-iarpa-baa-10-04@ugov.gov.</p>

<p>The purpose of this Work Assignment is to obligate $10,000 for the eligible Tribal work at Telles Ranch (CRIT002) site. The period of performance for this work is from December 8, 2009 to September 28, 2011. Site activities will include quarterly monitoring events, and the implementation, operation and maintenance of a groundwater treatment system. In addition, a treatment system optimization may also be required to enhance the cleanup of the site. The start-up of the remediation system may also require a phased in approach to evaluate the operational parameters for the full scale system. This work assignment may be amended with additional funding for the full implementation of the approved treatment system. The site is located on Colorado River Indian Tribes Reservation near Parker, Arizona in La Paz County.</p>
<p>The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) contains specific acquisition requirements that must be met when using appropriated funds from the Act, including the need for acquisitions to be in accordance with the FAR and, to the maximum extent practicable, awarded as fixed-price (FP) contracts using competitive procedures.

Although the Agency's Office of Underground Storage Tank (OUST) contracts were not awarded as FP contracts, each contract structure was selected to provide the contractor with the greatest incentive for efficient and economical performance, given the types of services to be performed. The existing OUST contracts have sufficient qualified acquisition personnel to provide appropriate contract administration and oversight to monitor contract performance to mitigate the Government's risk. In order to meet the requirements of the Act in the most prudent business manner within the time constraints imposed, existing OUST contracts are the most appropriate contractual vehicles consistent with Agency plans that promote the goals of the ARRA.</p>

<p>The purpose of this Work Assignment is to obligate $5,000.00 for the eligible tribal LUST Point of Pines Ranch (SANC 035) project. The period of performance for this work is from December 14, 2009 to September 28, 2011. Site activities will include the sampling and analysis of soil and potential groundwater, if encountered. In addition, all UST's associated piping and other related equipment shall be removed from the site to facilitate adequate sampling. Between 20 - 30 cubic yards of soil may be removed from this site. This work assignment may be amended with additional funding for additional site assessment activities, if necessary. The site is located on San Carlos Apache Tribal Trust Land near Point of Pines, Arizona in Graham County.</p>
<p>The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) contains specific acquisition requirements that must be met when using appropriated funds from the Act, including the need for acquisitions to be in accordance with the FAR and, to the maximum extent practicable, awarded as fixed-price (FP) contracts using competitive procedures. However, the Office of Management and Budget's guidance allows for the use of other than FP contracts. Although the Agency's Office of Underground Storage Tank (OUST) contracts were not awarded as FP contracts, each contract structure was selected to provide the contractor with the greatest incentive for efficient and economical performance, given the types of services to be performed. The existing OUST contracts have sufficient qualified acquisition personnel to provide appropriate contract administration and oversight to monitor contract performance to mitigate the Government's risk. In order to meet the requirements of the Act in the most prudent business manner within the time constraints imposed, existing OUST contracts are the most appropriate contractual vehicles consistent with Agency plans that promote the goals of the ARRA.</p>

If this contract requires that any of the contractor's personnel must submit to a National Agency Check with Inquiries (NACI) background check, the Government shall bear the expense of that background check. Contractor employees found in violation of this process will be immediately removed from Academy grounds, are subject to barment, and will not be allowed to re-enter until completion of the CAB process. <br /><br />(ii) Convictions. Based on the results of the background check, any felony conviction in the past ten (10) years shall constitute indisputable grounds for the Contracting Officer (CO), with coordination from the 10th Air Base Wing Commander, to immediately require denial of access or removal of the employee from the effort under this contract. For felony convictions more than ten (10) years ago, the contractor may recommend the employee be retained on the contract. In addition, any misdemeanor conviction in the past five (5) years shall also constitute indisputable grounds, with coordination from the 10th Air Base Wing Commander, to restrict or immediately remove employees from effort under this contract. <br /><br />(I) Applicable convictions include: Murder; Assault with intent to commit murder; Espionage; Sedition (Conspiracy); Kidnapping or hostage taking; Treason; Rape or aggravated sexual abuse; Unlawful possession, use, sale, distribution, or manufacture of an explosive or weapon; Extortion; Distribution or intent to distribute a controlled substance; Illegal possession of a controlled substance; and Any felony conviction involving: Armed or unarmed robbery, Arson, Acts involving a threat, Willful destruction of property, Importation or manufacture of a controlled substance, Burglary or theft, Dishonesty, fraud, or misrepresentation, Possession or distribution of stolen property, Aggravated assault, Bribery, Violence at international airports (18 USC 37), or Conspiracy or attempt to commit any of the criminal acts listed above or any violations of immigration and naturalization laws. <br /><br />(II) Actions that involve restrictions or removal do not relieve the contractor from complete and satisfactory performance of the contract tasks specified herein.<br /><br />(iii) Warrants. If during the course of the CABs processing, any contractor personnel are found to have an outstanding warrant, Security Forces may detain the contractor employee and may notify the appropriate law enforcement authorities. The 10th Air Base Wing Commander may issue a barment letter based upon the gravity of the offenses surrounding a warrant.<br /><br />(iv) Barment. Employees removed by the CO may also be subject to barment from entering the USAFA. <br /><br />(I) Barment appeals are processed through 10th Security Forces Squadron Commander to the 10th Air Base Wing Commander who may rescind the barment and permit the contractor employee to work on the installation. <br /><br />(II) Individuals have 30 days from the date of the initial contractor access denial letter to submit a justification in writing to 10 SFS/S5B, along with any notarized copies of court documents or other documents they determine necessary to rebut the disqualifying information.<br /><br />(III) In the case of a barment based on an outstanding warrant, the contractor may appeal the barment through the 10th Security Forces Squadron Commander to the 10th Air Base Wing Commander who may rescind the barment and permit the contractor employee to work on the installation. <br /><br />(IV) The CO may require the contractor to restrict the employee's use on this contract until the case is resolved. <br /><br />(V) Actions that involve barment do not relieve the contractor from complete and satisfactory performance of the contract tasks specified herein.<br /><br />(b) See USAFA implementation procedures below.<br /><br />(1) Added: The contractor shall submit a letter to the CO specifying contractor personnel authorized to sign a USAFA Form 111, Application for Personnel and Vehicle Pass to Work Under Air Force Contract. The contractor shall submit a USAFA Form 111 on each contractor employee requiring access to the installation to perform work cited in the contract. All contractors require issuance of a CAB from the Pass and Registration Center (PRC). CABs will be issued to contractors performing duties on USAFA as identified on the USAFA Form 111 and who require weekly access to the installation for a period of time exceeding 7 days. If required access is less than 7 days, contractors are issued an AF Form 75, Visitor Pass. CABs will be issued for a performance period not to exceed one year. <br /><br />(2) Added: The CO, Contract Specialist (CS) or Sponsoring Official will endorse the USAFA Form 111 and the individual requiring the badge will hand-carry the original USAFA Form 111 to the PRC for processing. Badges processed by contractors themselves will not be accepted. Contractor personnel are required to prominently display their CABs in a visible location above their waist while visiting or performing work on the installation. The Contracting Office may restrict the contractor's employees from accessing the installation(s) until CABs are obtained. The CO will maintain a copy of all USAFA Form 111s accomplished for each contract for accountability of badges issued.<br /><br />(c) During performance of the contract, the contractor shall be responsible for obtaining required identification for newly assigned personnel and for prompt return of credentials and vehicle passes for any employee who no longer requires access to work site.<br /><br />(1) Added: CABs shall be returned by the contractor to the PRC within 5 calendar days after the employee no longer requires access to the work site.<br /><br />(2) Added: Contractors are required to submit a letter to the CO immediately after employee(s) being terminated or otherwise leaving their employment on a contract. The letter shall contain the names(s) of the individuals(s) with their social security numbers. The CO will endorse the letter and forward it to PRC. The contractors shall collect CABs and return them to the PRC within 5 days.<br /><br />(3) Added: At the end of each performance period (i.e. options) and at the expiration of the contract, the contractor shall submit a letter to the CO containing the number of badges issued on each contract, the names of the individuals with their social security numbers, and identify those badges being returned. The CO will verify the names and number of badges on the letter utilizing their copy of the USAFA Form 111. The CO will maintain a copy of the letter and forward the contractor's original letter to PRC. By endorsement of the letter, the PRC will notify the CO of receipt of all badges or of any discrepancies. <br /><br />(4) Added: Denial of Access of Contractor Employees. The Government reserves the right to deny access of contractor employee(s) for substantiated misconduct (has the potential to jeopardize the mission, put themselves or others at risk, etc.) or security reasons. This action does not relieve the contractor from complete and satisfactory performance of the contract tasks specified herein.<br /><br />(d) When work under this contract requires unescorted entry to controlled or restricted areas, the contractor shall comply with AFI 31-101, Volume 1 Air Force Installation Security Program and AFI 31-501, Personnel Security Program Management, Paragraphs 3.24 and 3.27. <br /><br />(e) Upon completion or termination of the contract or expiration of the identification passes, the prime contractor shall ensure that all base identification passes issued to employees and subcontractor employees are returned to the issuing office.<br /><br />(f) Failure to comply with these requirements may result in withholding of final payment.<br /><br />(End of clause)</p>

SECTION C   DESCRIPTION/SPECIFICATIONS/STATEMENT OF WORK

C.1 BACKGROUND

The 20th Century was a time of increased technological and societal change for the transportation planning community.  Innovations such as GIS, GPS, remote sensing, and ITS monitoring technology have provided the transportation professional and the general public a potential overwhelming wealth of information about personal travel, goods movement and system performance.  While rapid change in the field of transportation is not unprecedented, the increase in information and ability to analyze and display information may be.

At the same time, understanding and responding to transportation needs has become greater and more complex.  The transportation system in the United States continues to serve an increasing population and even faster increase in vehicle travel.  More areas have become urbanized and some of the fastest growing areas are in smaller urban areas.  Both personal trips and goods movements are more diverse in origin and destination, time of day, and purpose.  The transportation system serving these increasing needs is aging.  At the same time, there is increasing consideration of other societal goals in the development of transportation programs, from promoting environmental stewardship to incorporating local community involvement.

The role of transportation planning is changing to emphasize the movement of people and goods as well as environmental, social, economic, land development, and financial parameters of alternative futures.  The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) is being asked to assist the transportation community in addressing these issues within a transportation schema. This is reflected in the FHWA research agenda  crosscutting and multi-disciplinary in response to the issues facing planners today.

Within this context, the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (ISTEA), the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21), the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users (SAFETEA-LU), and closely related legislation such as the Clean Air Act Amendments (CAAA) charge FHWA and transportation planning at all levels of government with meeting the complex demands of identifying and responding to future transportation needs. In particular, SAFETEA-LU promotes the assessment of multi-modal transportation needs and the analysis of the transportation, environmental, economic and social impacts of proposed investment and operational alternatives in support of decision-making.  Because of this, the research universe the FHWA operates in is fluid, dynamic, and flexible. To realize its research, development and technical assistance objectives, FHWA requires the support of multi-disciplined contractor teams to meet the challenges of transportation planning as we continue into the twenty-first century.

C.2 CONTRACT OBJECTIVE

The indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity task order contracts resulting from this request for proposals are intended to give FHWA and its U.S. Department of Transportation partners the flexibility to address a number of issue areas without specifically identifying each required task for the life of the contract.

<DESC><p style="text-align: justify;">The U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE) National Nuclear Security Administration's (NNSA) Office of Second Line of Defense (SLD) established the Megaports Initiative in 2003 to screen containerized cargo for special nuclear and other radiological materials as it moves through the global maritime shipping network. To reduce the risk of illicit trafficking of these proliferation-concern materials, the Megaports Initiative installs radiation detection systems at high-volume international seaports. The Initiative is a key component of a layered, multi-agency approach designed to prevent terrorist from acquiring, smuggling, and using these dangerous materials to develop a weapon of mass destruction or radiological dispersal device that could be used in an attack against the United States or its global partners. In recognition of the fact that in today's global economy a nuclear or radiological incident at one port could adversely impact nearly every major economy, the Megaports Initiative also serves to enhance the security of the global maritime shipping system and helps protect global economic stability.<br /><br />In support of the Megaports Initiative and to provide the program with greater capabilities and flexibility in its mission to deter, detect, and interdict illicit trafficking in special nuclear and other radiological materials through the global maritimesystem, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) is soliciting proposals to provide a mobile radiation detection and identification system (MRDIS).<br /><br />The RFP documents are attached to this solicitation.</p>

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS 
United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.<br />Listed End Product Listed Countries of Origin <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />(2) Certification.

For statistical purposes only, the offeror shall indicate whether the place of manufacture of the end products it expects to provide in response to this solicitation is predominantly- <br />(1) o In the United States (Check this box if the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured in the United States exceeds the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured outside the United States); or <br />(2) o Outside the United States. <br />(k) Certificates regarding exemptions from the application of the Service Contract Act. (Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.) [The contracting officer is to check a box to indicate if paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) applies.] <br />[ ] (1) Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror o does o does not certify that- <br />(i) The items of equipment to be serviced under this contract are used regularly for other than Governmental purposes and are sold or traded by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) in substantial quantities to the general public in the course of normal business operations; <br />(ii) The services will be furnished at prices which are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(c)(2)(ii)) for the maintenance, calibration, or repair of such equipment; and <br />(iii) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract will be the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing the same equipment of commercial customers. <br />[ ] (2) Certain services as described in FAR 22.1003-4(d)(1).

(Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to a central contractor registration database to be eligible for award.) <br />(1) All offerors must submit the information required in paragraphs (l)(3) through (l)(5) of this provision to comply with debt collection requirements of 31 U.S.C. 7701(c) and 3325(d), reporting requirements of 26 U.S.C. 6041, 6041A, and 6050M, and implementing regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). <br />(2) The TIN may be used by the Government to collect and report on any delinquent amounts arising out of the offeror's relationship with the Government (31 U.S.C. 7701(c)(3)).

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). 
Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

<DESC>**Modification** NIHDK-00-000 changed to NIHDK2010228 <br /><br />This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a separate written solicitation will not be issued. This solicitation number is NIHDK2010225 and is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation/contract will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-37. The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 561990 and the business size standard is $7.0. This solicitation is being conducted using Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK), in providing the services of independent program evaluator on numerous federal, state and local projects. This work has involved evaluation and survey design, development, implementation, analysis and reporting. BACKGROUND: Diabetes was rare among American Indian and Alaska Native peoples until about 50 years ago. Since then, diabetes has become one of the most common and serious illness in the Tribal Nations of North America (Narayan, 1997). In 2002, more than 100,000 American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) adults, or nearly 15 percent of those receiving care from the Indian Health Service (IHS), were estimated to have diabetes. The total prevalence of diabetes is at least three times that for non-Hispanic whites of similar age. Prevalence rates vary by Tribal Nations, rising to 15.9 percent among the Plains Tribes (CDC, 1998). In a new and alarming turn of events, type 2 diabetes, typically considered an adult disorder, is now emerging in all populations of youth in the United States, including AI/AN populations (Narayan et al., 2000). In 2001, the congressionally authorized Diabetes Mellitus Coordinating Committee, chaired by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK), part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), hosted a meeting with the Indian Health Service Division of Diabetes Treatment and Prevention (IHS/DDTP) and the Tribal Leaders Diabetes Committee (TLDC) to address the seriousness of type 2 diabetes in AI/AN communities. At the meeting, NIDDK accepted the challenge from the TLDC to lead the effort to prevent type 2 diabetes in AI/AN youth by developing a curriculum that would teach the science of diabetes in tribal schools. What followed was a unique, collaborative effort that included NIDDK, IHS/DDTP, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Native Diabetes Wellness Program (CDC/NDWP), eight Tribal Colleges and Universities (TCUs), and the NIH Office of Science Education (NIH/OSE). The result of this collaboration is the DETS Health Is Life in Balance K12 curriculum. The DETS Project is part of a national effort to decrease the incidence and improve the care of type 2 diabetes among American Indian and Alaska Natives (AI/AN). The DETS Project is a K - 12 Curriculum that was developed using a multidisciplinary approach. The DETS Curriculum consists of units that incorporate National Science Education Standards, Inquiry-Learning (5E model), and AI/AN cultural and community knowledge. It is the intent of NIDDK to procure the services of Dr. Doug Coulson, as an independent program evaluator. The following tasks are identified: Task Order One: Tribal Colleges and Universities (TCU) recruitment activity and distribution of DETS curriculum materials: Receive TCU 2009 data; Analyze TCU generated self-reports on DETS recruitment activity; Receive Indian Health Service (IHS) data; Analyze geographic distribution of IHS order database activity; Analyze trend information from HIS order database; Produce interim report #1. Task Order Two: Present findings at Steering Committee meeting: Compare TCU recruitment reports with HIS curriculum order database activity; Travel to DETS meeting to present findings. Task Order Three: TCU recruitment activity and distribution of DETS curriculum materials: Receive TCU 2010 data; Analyze TCU generated self-reports on DETS recruitment activity; Receive HIS data; Analyze geographic distribution of HIS order database activity; Analyze trend information from HIS order database; Produce interim report #2. Task Order Four: Curriculum use in schools: Receive DETS teacher web survey data; Analyze web data for extent of curriculum use; Produce interim report #3. Present finding at Steering Committee meeting: Compare curriculum use to recruitment effort; Compare curriculum use to HIS orders; Travel to DETS meeting to present findings. Final integrated report on TCU recruitment activity, distribution of DETS curriculum materials and use of curriculum in schools: Analyze DETS recruitment efforts, HIS orders and curriculum use statistics; Produce final integrated report on findings. Since 1985 Dr. Doug Coulson has worked as an independent program evaluator on numerous federal, state and local projects. This work has involved evaluation and survey design, development, implementation, analysis and reporting. In September of 2003 Dr. Coulson joined the NIDDK Diabetes Education in Tribal Schools (DETS) Project as a evaluator. Since joining the project Dr. Coulson has designed and implemented practical national evaluation efforts for beta testing and field testing the DETS curriculum. In the course of this work he has visited many tribal schools across the United States observing DETS lessons, and interviewing DETS teachers and students.

<DESC>This modification extends the date for submission of the SF-330 packages through 01/11/2010.<br /><br />This requirement is set aside 100% for small businesses. These services will be acquired in accordance with the Brooks Architect-Engineer (AE) Act as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 36.6. AE services are required for two (2) Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts for commissioning services for the Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Office of the Chief Administrative Officer (OCAO), Silver Spring, MD.
<p>One contract will be awarded by the NOAA Western Region Acquisition Division to include the approximate areas of Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Texas, Utah, Washington and Wyoming, as well as other NOAA locations in the Pacific including: America Samoa, Federated States of Micronesia, Guam, Marshall Islands, Northern Marianas Islands, Republic of Palau and Wake Island.</p>
<p>One contract will be awarded by the NOAA Eastern Region Acquisition Division to include the approximate areas of Alabama, Arkansas, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Vermont, West Virginia, Wisconsin, Virginia, and Washington D.C., including the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.</p>
<p>The purpose of commissioning services is to ensure existing and new facilities are provided with properly designed and energy efficient systems prior to facility acceptance. Additionally commissioning services ensure the staff is provided with proper systems documentation, receive adequate training, and understand proper maintenance procedures. The services sought under this contract include a selected range of Architectural and Engineering (AE) services for commissioning, re-commissioning, and other engineering services to DOC/NOAA building systems. In this context, "systems" refer to systems and equipment to be evaluated or commissioned and will be further defined under each issued Task Order (T.O.). The best qualified firm will be selected to provide commissioning support services in the technical discipline areas of mechanical engineering, including but not limited to, Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems and controls, plumbing, seawater systems, laboratory fume hood exhaust systems, fire alarm and protection systems; electrical engineering, including but not limited to, Uninterrupted Power Supply (UPS), emergency generator, radio systems, fire and burglar alarm systems; energy efficiency audits; life cycle cost analysis; value engineering; building control and automation systems; lighting systems; building systems; specialty items, including but not limited to voice/data, telecommunications, security, and Closed Circuit Television (CCTV); and environmental engineering, including but not limited to storm water management, site utility studies, Leadership in Environmental and Energy Design (LEED) certification, site investigation and analysis. A general knowledge of other technical disciplines (e.g., architectural and geological) could be required to a lesser degree.</p>
<p>NOAA and its Line Offices have ongoing and continuous requirements to commission newly constructed buildings, and to re-commission existing buildings. Before a newly constructed building is accepted by DOC/NOAA, various building systems, in particular its energy systems, such as HVAC, emergency generators, and Automatic Transfer Switches, are commissioned (i.e., tested for functionality, and in the case of HVAC, efficiency is measured, and air flow rates tested and balanced). Typically, a few weeks after a successful commissioning inspection, the building is declared suitable for beneficial occupancy, and DOC/NOAA takes possession of the building. Because new facilities are being added to DOC/NOAA's inventory each year, the demand for commissioning services is required continuously.</p>
<p>Similarly, when an existing building's HVAC system, or its controls are significantly upgraded or replaced, the HVAC system is usually re-commissioned prior to accepting the work as complete.</p>
<p>The Government shall seek the most highly qualified firm. Cost will not be used as an evaluation criteria for offers.</p>
<p>Under the IDIQ contracting scheme mentioned above, the upper limit of the 5 year life of each of the two (2) contracts will be less than $4,500,000.00. The minimum guaranteed amount will be no less than $100,000.00. Each Task Order (T.O.) under this contract will have its own negotiated cost.</p>
<p>The successful offeror must have a sufficient number of personnel knowledgeable and current with the responsibilities of a commissioning agent, as described in the latest LEED standards for New Construction. The successful offeror must have on his staff, and provide resumes for: <br />&bull; At least 2 persons to serve as commissioning agents with expertise in HVAC systems and controls, plumbing, emergency generators, and automatic transfer switches, and demonstrated ability to perform well as an on-site inspector, especially in the role of a commissioning agent;<br />&bull; At least 2 persons to serve as commissioning agent with expertise in electrical systems, lighting systems and controls, telecommunications and alarm systems, and experience serving as a commissioning agent or in support of a commissioning agent;<br />The above personnel should be willing to travel anywhere there are DOC/NOAA facilities, based on project schedules requiring commissioning services. Additional personnel with commissioning experience, and depth of experience of all personnel, shall be taken into account during the selection process.<br />The successful offeror must also have additional staff to provide other areas of expertise as required, including the ability to design and/or replace systems found to be inadequate.<br />This IDIQ contract will be issued for a period of 5 years. During this time, the offeror must continue to provide excellent services.<br />The present IDIQ commissioning contract expires on March 14, 2010. The projected performance period of this acquisition is expected to be May 2010 - May 2015. <br />The successful firm must be able to perform work anywhere within the United States, including Alaska, Hawaii, and the Caribbean and Pacific Island territories, though it is expected that most work will occur in the region related to their award, as stated above.</p>
<p>The minimum ordering limitation for this contract shall be $10,000.00. The maximum ordering limitation shall be $1,000,000.00 for any single task order in a given calendar year. <br /><br />SELECTION CRITERIA: The selection criteria for this action are listed below in descending order of importance.</p>
<p>A. Demonstrated knowledge and relevant experience in performing a full range of commissioning services, including examples of specialized experience in the commissioning of newly constructed buildings, conducting energy audits and HVAC studies and related analysis and design, supporting a LEED submittal as a third party commissioning agent, and the re-commissioning of a commercial building after HVAC controls have been replaced.</p>
<p>B. Professional qualifications of the staff to be assigned to this commissioning contract, with emphasis on commissioning experience and professional certifications and licenses for key personnel, including consultants and subcontractor personnel.</p>
<p>C. Recent past performance on Federal Government projects, requiring commissioning services similar to those described in the Scope of Work.</p>
<p>D. Demonstrated capability to provide recommendations and work efficiently and constructively with other AE firms and contractors when deficiencies are discovered.</p>
<p>E. Demonstrated plan and capacity of the firm to manage multiple concurrent projects across the country.</p>

<DESC>Contract N62470-10-R-2005 Indefinite Quantity Contract for Geotechnical Engineering Services at Various Activities located within the Atlantic Division, Naval Facilities Engineering Command's Geographic Area
Amendment 0002
Question 5:  We are a small business; however, due to the scope of the work included in the referenced solicitation, we would need to retain subcontractors to provide some of the required services.  Do all the firms that we would subcontract for this solicitation have to be small business entities?  
Response:  Sub-consultants do not have to be small businesses; however, the prime contractor must be a small business and perform at least 50% of the work.
Question 6:  The solicitation states "Provide evidence that your firm is permitted by law to practice the professions of architecture or engineering (i.e., state registration number)."  To permit responding to this presolicitation within the December 23 deadline, would it be acceptable for us to use subcontractors who are licensed in these states and for us to begin the firm licensing and individual licensing process in those states during the contract negotiation period?  
The solicitation states that the services "are required primarily for Virginia, North Carolina, and West Virginia, but shall include other various activities within the Geographic area of responsibility of Naval Facilities Engineering Command Atlantic, including the Continental United States, the Caribbean, Africa, and Europe."  How do the licensing requirements, mentioned in Question 2 above, apply for the submittal regarding the other states and other areas outside of the U.S.?
Response:  The intent of the wording "Provide evidence that your firm is permitted by law to practice the professions of architecture or engineering (i.e. state registration number)" is not meant to imply that a firm is ineligible to submit their SF-330 qualifications if they do not have architects and/or engineers permitted by law to practice in each and every possible location of work.  It is meant to direct the A&E to provide documentation that the key personal listed for the firm are registered architects-engineers, if applicable.
The synopsis states under Technical Evaluation Factors - The A&E must demonstrate its and each key consultant's qualifications with respect to the published evaluation factors for all services.  
Firms that feel they do not meet certain technical evaluation factors often form Joint Ventures with other firms.  Firms submitting, typically list their key consultants and/or sub-contractors proposed to meet the technical evaluation factors.
We cannot recommend or offer advice to firms as to how to build their team to meet the criteria listed in the evaluation factors.  The only advice that we can offer is that a firm's SF-330 should properly provide responses to each and every technical evaluation factor listed in the solicitation.

<DESC>This amends the previous synopsis in its entirety.

The U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has a requirement for Survey Statistics Support. This requirement will support the EPA in its survey statistics analyses for research and regulation development to: comply with various Executive Orders; and to support the Agency?s initiatives.  
The successful contractor will be required to provide survey statistics support to the Office of Water and any other EPA offices that require technical support within the scope of the PWS.  
This contract is primarily focused on obtaining survey statistics support for data collection planning and analysis. (Survey statistics are often applied to data from a statistically drawn sample to make inferences about a larger population.) To a lesser extent, the contract also supports survey instrument development (e.g., questionnaires) and web surveys.
Examples of potential survey statistical support under this contract may include the following:
Statistical sample designs for a survey of the steam electric industry;  Population estimates from a survey of coalbed methane extraction projects; Comparison of survey results from different studies related to biosolids at publicly owned treatment works; and Confidence intervals for national estimates based upon data from a survey of Superfund sites.
The RFP PR-CI-09-10584 will be solicited under full and open competition with the NAICS code designation for the acquisition being 541620.  It is anticipated that a Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee/Level-of-Effort contract will result from the award of this solicitation. The base period is expected to begin on June 1, 2010. The base period and each available option period will consist of 1,500 direct labor hours with each period having the potential of an additional 4,500 direct labor hours. It is anticipated that the contract will have one (1) base period with four (4) option periods consisting of 12-months each for a total maximum potential performance period of five (5) years and a total of 30,000 direct labor hours. 
Sources will not be excluded from consideration for award, however, the successful awardee will be subject to the limitation of future contracting and during the life of this contract, will be ineligible to enter into any business or financial relationships which would support or affect efforts to contest, oppose, or influence regulations, policies, limitations, standards, or criteria for which it has provided, is providing, or has work assignments to provide survey statistics, technical, or database support to the Agency under this contract, without prior written authorization from the cognizant EPA Contracting Officer. Also, all offerors will be required to disclose whether they are one of the following firms or they have any business or financial relationships with firms that could potentially discharge wastewater from point sources (e.g., industrial facilities, service industries), associated wastewater, and/or associated stormwater into a sanitary sewer system ("indirect dischargers"), stormwater or combined sewer system, or directly into a water of the US ("direct dischargers"), firms that could potentially provide treatment of wastewater and/or stormwater, associated wastewater, and/or associated stormwater, firms that develop, manufacture or sell water treatment equipment and/or water treatment chemicals,
firms that provide consulting and/or technical services to wastewater and stormwater dischargers relating to waste minimization and water quality, firms that act in consulting, advisory, or legal capacities with, or for, firms trying to overturn or circumvent regulations on wastewater, stormwater discharge, and water quality, firms engaged in airport deicing, engaged in coalbed methane extraction, engaged in construction and development issues, firms that specialize in cooling water intake structures, that specialize in drinking water treatment, that specialize in health services, publicly owned treatment works, or engaged in steam electric generation, or whether they are performing any work that potentially conflicts with work under this contract for EPA or other Government agencies.
The solicitation is expected to be issued between December 2009 and January 2010 on EPA?s website: http://www.epa.gov/oam/cinn_cmd.  This office does not intend to mail hard copies of the solicitation.  It is the responsibility of the offerors to frequently check the EPA website for updates or changes.

The intent is to renovate an existing deteriorating federal facility in the building inventory and in doing so modernize the facility into an economically and operationally efficient High-Performance Green Building (HPGB) that is a highly leasable office facility that agencies will be excited to occupy, and do this following principles of Design Excellence and Sustainable Design. Interested parties are encouraged to register through FBO using the "Add Me to the Interested Vendors" link on the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website. Vendors are also encouraged to register to receive notices about this announcement by using the "Watch This Opportunity" link on the FBO website. NOTE: GSA PBS Region 10 will NOT be maintaining a manual list of interested vendors.</p>
<p>
<p>PROJECT BACKGROUND/DESCRIPTION: The project is a modernization project in which the Design-Build (D/B) Contractor and its Team shall design and construct renovations and improvements to modernize the existing Thomas S. Foley Courthouse into an economically and operationally efficient high-performance green building. This modernization project will include replacement and upgrades to building systems (electrical, HVAC, and lighting) and will also include an expansion and relocation of the United States Marshals Services (USMS) to the second floor of the building. LEED-EB Gold certification will be pursued by the D/B Team, with LEED-EB Silver being an alternate certification level if LEED-EB Gold cannot be reached. The specific activities, tasks, and deliverables required of the D/B Team will be further delineated in the Statement of Work during Phase Two of this two-phase D/B solicitation.</p>
<p>The Design Build project shall include the performance of architectural/engineering services based on an approved concept selected during the Request for Proposal (RFP) stage of the acquisition process. The design will be in accordance with GSA quality standards. As required by the ARRA legislation, the facility will be designed to be a high performing green building (HPGB) and as such will meet the most current federal energy goals.</p>
<p>PROJECT SCOPE: This project includes the modernization of the building through a strategy of structure and materials reuse to the greatest practicable extent, introduction of modern building systems and use of innovative technologies to meet HPGB strategies. The scope of professional services will require at a minimum: Professional architectural, engineering, interior design, HPGB consulting service, and related consulting services for concept design documents, design development documents, metric and English construction documents, specifications, cost estimates, schedules, space planning, value engineering services, LEED-AP services, computer-aided design and drafting (CADD). The project shall comply with GSA design standards, and United States Marshal Services (USMS) tenant standards/requirements.</p>
<p>PROJECT MAGNITUDE: The maximum Estimated Cost of Construction is between $30,000,000.00 and $50,000,000.00.</p>
<p>PROJECT DURATION: 30 - 36 months (Design and Construction)</p>
<p>MARKET RESEARCH: A survey was conducted with industry to assist in the development of the Acquisition Plan for this project. Following are the results:<br /><br />Delivery Method: Design Build is the most appropriate acquisition approach<br />Contract Type: Preference for Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP) vs Firm Fixed Price because it is more representative of a collaborative delivery effort.<br />Design Competition: Recommendation to limit the design competition (Phase 2) to no more than 5 offerors. <br />Stipend: A stipend would help defray costs to participate in the Design Competition.<br />Award Fee: Preference for good partnering<br /><br />COMPETITION: Unrestricted<br />This procurement will be open to large and small business firms. Any qualified responsible firm, including small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business is encouraged to participate as a prime contractor or as a member of a joint venture with other small businesses, or as a subcontractor Pursuant to Section 8(d) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(d), FAR subpart 19.702 and FAR subpart 19.12. An Offeror that is not a small business concern, offering to perform a contract that has subcontracting possibilities, will be required to submit a Subcontracting Plan that is acceptable to the Contracting Officer which provides subcontracting opportunities to small businesses, HUBZone small businesses, small disadvantaged businesses, and woman-owned small businesses to the maximum extent practicable.</p>
<p>PROCUREMENT STRATGY: The Design Build contractor will be selected using the Best Value Source Selection process pursuant to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Two-Phase Design-Build Selection Procedures and FAR Subpart 36.3, Source Selection Procedures, FAR subpart 15.3. For this contract award process, GSA will issue two Solicitations in sequence: 1) Phase One, and 2) Phase Two. The Phase One procedure (which is analogous to a Request for Qualifications (RFQ)) is designed to select a "short list" of the most highly qualified Offerors who will then be requested to submit Phase Two proposals. The short list will not be published in FedBizOpps. All responsible sources may submit a Phase One Proposal.</p>
<p>In Phase One, the Government shall identify the evaluation factors other than cost or price that will serve as the basis for the determination of the most highly qualified Offerors. Interested Offerors will be required to submit their responses to the RFQ by the due date established in the RFQ. The Government will evaluate all the responses to the RFQ in accordance with the criteria in the RFQ, and advise each Offeror in writing whether it will be invited to participate in the Phase Two process. Offerors that do not submit a timely RFQ response in Phase One will not be allowed to participate in the remaining phase of the procurement.</p>
<p>In Phase Two, the Government will issue the RFP to the most highly qualified Offerors from Phase One and request that they submit Phase Two proposals. Phase Two of the solicitation shall be prepared in accordance with FAR Part 15 and include Phase Two evaluation factors, developed in accordance with FAR 15.304. Phase Two of the solicitation shall require submission of technical and price proposals, which shall be evaluated separately in accordance with FAR Part 15. The Government will reserve the right to make an award upon the basis of the initial Phase One and Phase Two offers without discussions.</p>
<p>CONTRACT AWARD: GSA PBS R10 contemplates awarding a Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP) type contract provided all waivers, deviations, and approvals are authorized prior to issuance of the Phase Two solicitation. Failure to obtain the necessary GMP type contract approvals will result in solicitation for and awarding a Firm Fixed Price Contract. The Phase Two RFP will identify which pricing methodology will be awarded, and will contain special provisions and clauses as necessary.</p>
<p>SOLICITATION ISSUE DATE: The RFQ will be issued electronically on or about 09/30/2009 on the internet at: http://www.fbo.gov/.<br />CLOSING DATE: The closing date for receipt of Phase I submittals shall be specified in the RFQ but is estimated to be 10/29/09.</p>
<p>This project will be funded by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act for 2009. THERE IS REASONABLE CERTAINTY FUNDS WILL BE AVAILABLE. All reporting requirements from the Contractor are mandated per the Act. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PRICE OR TECHNICAL PROPOSALS.</p>

The United States Coast Guard identified a requirement for a contractor to provide all labor, materials, equipment, supervision, and other items and services necessary to unearth seven 

Excavation Areas and two surface areas, and transport and dispose of PCB-contaminated soil and PCB electrical components encountered during the excavation process.  

The Contractor shall also conduct a geophysical investigation at an adjacent site and excavate suspected electrical components, sample the surrounding soil, and transport and dispose of PCB-contaminated soil and electrical components in a United States facility that is licensed, permitted or otherwise approved by the US EPA and state regulatory agencies to accept the waste.  The clean-up standard (i.e., the action level) for PCBs is 10 parts per million.  The project also entails preparing work plans and related documents required to implement this remedial action, and to prepare a Remediation Verification Report (RVR) that summarizes all field activities conducted.  

The Government will be looking for the Contractors Past Performance, Qualifications of Key Personnel, and Technical Approach to demonstrate an understanding of the problem. 

On-site Construction is targeted for January 2010 through May 2010.  All close-out submittals to include manifests from landfills must be received and accepted by 1 September 2010.  The Government Estimate is between $1 and $5 million.  A contract will be awarded to the contractor that provides the best value to the Government.  

This procurement is no longer unrestricted as interest from more than two small businesses has been expressed.  This procurement has subsequently been set aside for small businesses.  

The solicitation document will be available at www.fbo.gov approximately 1 July 2009.
To receive further information, please contact Contracting Officer Stephanie Garnett at Stephanie.M.Garnett@uscg.mil.  

The NAICS code for this procurement is 562910 with a size standard of 500 employees.

<DESC>CANCELLATION NOTICE:
 
Re: Solicitation DJMS-09-R-0104

Court Security Officers Services for the Central District of Illinois and Northern District of Florida.
This is not a solicitation. A written proposal is NOT requested in response to this announcement. The purpose of this announcement is to notify potential offerors of the intent of the Unites States Marshal Service to cancel solicitation DJMS-09-R-0104 pursuant to FAR 3.101-1. The solicitation does not accurately reflect the USMSs requirements as posted.
The release of answers to Solicitation DJMS-09-R-0104 has been delayed, and an amendment to this solicitation would be so substantial as to exceed what prospective offerors reasonably could have anticipated. In an interest to give those offerors adequate time to address this requirement and as to not to preclude those sources who likely would have submitted offers had the substance of the amendment been known to them, this solicitation will be re-advertised.
THIS SOLICITATION HAS BEEN CANCELLED 12/16/2009.

THE USMS INTENDS TO ISSUE A REPLACEMENT TO THE SOLICITATION.
 
Please continue checking this site for any further notices. Thank you for your interest in this acquisition

<p>The purpose of this announcement is to proclaim that the Work Assignment Amendment is to obligate a total of $118,393 in Recovery funding to perform this requirement at the site. The general requirement of this work is to implement corrective action activities which shall consist of the pumping and recovery of free product and dissolved phase groundwater from a groundwater monitoring well. Pumping activities shall be conducted on a monthly basis for two years, unless a determination is made to discontinue recovery operations. At the conclusion of each pumping event, the contractor shall document the amount of free product and dissolved phase groundwater recovered. Free product and dissolved phase groundwater shall be recycled/disposed of at an approved facility. The site is located on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in Denby, South Dakota.</p>
<p>The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) contains specific acquisition requirements that must be met when using appropriated funds from the Act, including the need for acquisitions to be in accordance with the FAR and, to the maximum extent practicable, awarded as fixed-price (FP) contracts using competitive procedures. However, the Office of Management and Budget's guidance allows for the use of other than FP contracts. Although the Agency's Office of Underground Storage Tank (OUST) contracts were not awarded as FP contracts, each contract structure was selected to provide the contractor with the greatest incentive for efficient and economical performance, given the types of services to be performed. The existing OUST contracts have sufficient qualified acquisition personnel to provide appropriate contract administration and oversight to monitor contract performance to mitigate the Government's risk. In order to meet the requirements of the Act in the most prudent business manner within the time constraints imposed, existing OUST contracts are the most appropriate contractual vehicles consistent with Agency plans that promote the goals of the ARRA.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY<br />THIS REQUIREMENT IS TO BE AWARDED TO AN EXISTING EPA CONTRACTHOLDER. <br />REQUESTS AND/OR INQUIRIES WILL NOT BE ANSWERED.</strong></span></p>
