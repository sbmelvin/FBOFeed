<DESC>Request for Information for Digital CATV Upgrade.The West Palm Beach VA Medical Center located in West Palm Beach, Florida, is looking to upgrade the analog CATV system. Our goal is to educate our veterans using the new system to document education and provide entertainment to make every experience a memorable one.  The current system delivers a degraded signal level (900 MHz). All signals are analog except for the digital DirecTV input. The new digital system will take advantage of the current wiring infrastructure to provide digital service throughout the entire medical center increasing programming from 48 analog channels to 60-100 digital channels. Approximately 30 conference rooms would require A/V and video conferencing equipment. Existing upgrades include LCD flat panels already installed in 47 waiting rooms, 8 visitor rooms, 2 family rooms and 154 patient rooms. System will be menu driven requiring the replacement of Head-in equipment. An HL7 interface would need to be created to accommodate to VA security standards for on demand content to work with current medical record system accepting from 200 to 500 users. Provide employee education channels and interaction with the VA Knowledge Network via desktop computers already in place as well as recording feedback from patients who have fulfilled doctor prescribed video viewing requirements and deliver patient satisfaction surveys and questionnaires. Finally, System must comply with Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.Please provide answers to the following questions and/or information on companies that have the capability and knowledge to upgrade the CATV.   "	Identify digital CATV solution using current RF cable wiring to allow proper bandwidth and high quality digital signal out to 200+ hospitals LG LCD TV monitors."	Identify solution to provide menu driven on demand patient education and entertainment that interfaces with HL7 medical record system."	Identify solution for patient questionnaires and satisfaction surveys over digital TV to interface into the medical record and to provide a way to respond back to patients."	What would be the bandwidth requirements for streaming 60-100 digital channels?"	What would be the bandwidth requirement for a potential 200 to 500 on-demand users?"	Would the system require an outside connection or can it be isolated?West Palm Beach VA is seeking a company to help design the CATV or one that they sell and install.  Please respond through Fedbizopps to Jose Delgado, Contracting Officer, 7305 N. Military Trail, West Palm Beach, FL 33410.  If for any reason responses can not be sent through Fedbizopps, send an email to jose.delado@va.gov.  Questions regarding the RFI must be submitted in writing to the contracting officer.

<DESC><p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.
<p>(ii) This solicitation, FA2517-08-T-6165, is being issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).</p>
<p>(iii) A statement that the solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-26.</p>
<p>(iv) This procurement is full and open competition. The NAICS code is 334119 and the size standard is 1,000 employees</p>
<p>(vi) The following commercial item is requested in this solicitation:</p>
<p>CISCO network equipment (brand name or equal). Vendor shall certify that it is a Manufacturer Authorized Channel Partner as of the date of the submission of their offer, and that it has the certification/specialization level required by the Manufacturer to support both the product sale and product pricing, in accordance with the applicable Manufacturer certification/specialization requirements. Unless otherwise specified, Vendor shall warrant that the products are new, in their original box. The Vendor confirms to have sourced all Manufacturer products submitted in this offer from Manufacturer or through Manufacturer Authorized Channels only, in accordance with all applicable laws and policies at the time of purchase.

Please see attached excel spreadsheet of salient characteristics.</p>
<p>(vii) Items will be delivered to Peterson AFB, CO.</p>
<p>(viii) IAW Memorandum for Chief Acquisition Officer, Chief Information Officers, Senior Procurement Executives entitled "Use of Brand Name Specifications" dated April 11, 2005 the Brand Name Letter will be published with the solicitation through the Government Point of Entry.</p>
<p>Description of Acquisition: This request is for the purchase of brand name items of network equipment, to include servers, switches, routers, firewalls, software, and associated peripherals for the NORAD and USNORTHCOM Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) Test and Integration Lab (TIL). This request is authorized under FAR 13.5.</p>
<p>Statutory authority: FAR 6.302-1(c), Brand Name.</p>
<p>Description of Requirement: NORAD and USNORTHCOM requires a standardization of all IPv6 TIL network assets, to include all hardware and software, which includes all CISCO Blades, CISCO Switches, HPCompaq Servers, printers and secure and non-secure workstations. The TIL is being established to provide a test bed for testing new software/hardware, applications, security configurations and network upgrades-to include Internet protocol version 6 testing. The equipment being purchased must be the brand names specified, as it is essential to have an identical mirror of the existing production NIPRNet and SIPRNet. If the IPv6 addition to the TIL does not match the NIPRNet and SIPRNet, the testing results are invalidated in reference to our production network. This is essential for our hardware/software configuration baseline and for Network Administration purposes. The testing needs to be accomplished on an identical network so that any problems or issues that are discovered can be corrected before moving the item or software being tested into the production network.</p>
<p>Efforts to Obtain Competition: Other than brand name acquisition will be exercised when the technical refresh process takes place, which is currently on a 3 year cycle. Because this requirement is an addition to the existing requirement, hardware and software must match the existing equipment.</p>
<p>Market Survey : A market survey has been conducted, resulting in several authorized vendors that can provide these products.</p>

<DESC><p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional ifnormation included in this notice. The accouncement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. <br />(i) Solicitation FA2517-08-T-6168 is issued as a request for proposal (RFQ).
<p>(ii) This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-26.<br />(iii) The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541511, and the size standard is $18.0 million. This requirement is set-aside for small business. <br />(iv) Requirement is to provide NetApp Professional Services to expand and upgrade network storage (Model# FAS270)-Brand Name or equal. To be considered for award, offers of "equal" products, including "equal" products of the brand name manufacturer, must meet the salient characteristics listed in this attachment and must be identified by brand name (if any) and make or model number. Service requires upgrade and installation of software at eight geographically separated units. Additional details are outlined in the attached performance work statement. IAW Memorandum for Chief Acquisition Officer, Chief Information Officers, Senior Procurement Executives entitled "Use of Brand Name Specifications" dated April 11, 2005 the Brand Name Letter will be published with the solicitation through the Government Point of Entry.<br />a. Network General Products are the current standard for Network Storage and Backup System for our Enterprise. There are other products and manufacturers that provide this capability; however, Network Appliance provides the complete package that is currently utilized throughout the Enterprise.</p>
<p>Network Appliance Products will provide the most stable Storage and Backup environment with the continued lowest cost of ownership based on our initial investment. Changing to a new Storage and Backup system would result in significant duplication of costs.</p>
<p>In addition, this would result in two dissimilar systems existing on the network, potentially causing network interface problems. Further, with regard to technical support, should multiple companies exist, the company technicians will not address system faults and failures with a similar system existing on the network. Multiple systems and companies could possibly result in catastrophic network failure, loss of data, and mission degradation if neither system performed appropriately. In addition, the network failure could further cause the Government to incur costs to manually recover data. The lost data may not be recoverable depending on the severity of the incident. Again, if two similar systems are at work on the network, technical support would not be available, as neither would support the other's devices and software.</p>
<p>(v) The following provisions and clauses apply to this acquisition: The provision at FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Items (Jun2008). All firms must be registered in Wide Area Workflow (WAWF) at https://wawf.eb.mil at time of quote submittal. DUNS, Cage Code, tax ID, terms and conditions shall be submitted with quote. All firms must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration Database at www.ccr.gov in order to be considered for award.<br />(vi) FAR 52.212-2(a) Evaluation-Commercial Items (Jan 1999), applies to this acquisition. Quote will be based on price and past performance; price will have higher importance. Submit references (no more than three) related to the work outlined in the performance work statement.<br />(vii) The provision at FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certification-Commercial Items (June 2008), is applicable to this acquisition. All vendors must be registered in Online Representations and certifications (ORCA) (https://orca.bpn.gov)) at the time of Quote submittal.<br />(viii) The clause at FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items (Feb 2007), applies to the acquisition.<br />(ix) The clause at FAR 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statutes or Executive Orders--Commercial Items (Jun 2008), applies to this acquisition.<br />a) FAR 52.222-26, Equal Opportunity (Mar 2007)<br />b) FAR 52.222-35, Affirmative Action for Disabled Veterans and Veterans of the Vietnam Era (Sept 2006)<br />c) FAR 52.222-36, Affirmative Action for Handicapped Workers (June 1998)<br />d) FAR 52.222-37, Employment Reports on Disabled Veterans and Veterans of the Vietnam Era (Sept 2006) <br />e) FAR 52.224-1, Privacy Act Notification (Apr 1984)<br />f) FAR 52.224-2, Privacy Act (Apr 1984)<br />g) FAR 52.232-33, Payment by Electronic Funds-Central Contractor Registration (Oct 2003)<br />h) FAR 52.222-3, Convict Labor (June 2003)<br />i) FAR 52.222-21, Prohibition of Segregated Facility (Feb 1999)<br />j) FAR 52.222-43, Fair Labor Standards Act and Service Contract Act-Price Adjustment (Nov 2006)<br />k) FAR 52.203-3, Gratuities (Apr 1984)<br />l) FAR 52.219-4, Notice of Price Evaluation Preference for HUBZone Small Business Concerns (Jul 2005)<br />m) FAR 52.219-8, Utilization of Small Business Concerns (May 2004)<br />n) FAR 52.222-39, Notification of Employee Rights Concerning Payment of Union Dues or Fees (Jul 2005)<br />o) FAR 52.222-42, Statement of Equivalent Rates for Federal Hires (May 2004)<br />p) FAR 52.203-6, Restrictions on Subcontractor Sales to the Government (Dec 2004)<br />q) FAR 52.222-50, Combating Trafficking in Persons (May 1989)<br />r) FAR 52.225-1, Buy American Act-Supplies (June 2003)<br />s) FAR 52.237-2, Protection of Government Buildings, Equipment, and Vegetation (Apr 1984)<br />(x) FAR 52.204-7, Central Contractor Registration (Apr 2008), contractors will not be considered for award unless the are fully registered and approved in the CCR at the following internet address: http://www.ccr.gov.<br />(xi) FAR 52.204-8, Annual Representations and Certifications(Jan 2006), contractors are required to input their Representations and Certifications into the online representations and certifications application (ORCA) database which is located at the following internet address: http://www.bpn.gov prior to award. <br />(xii) FAR 52.222-41, Service Contract Act of 1965, as amended (Nov 2007) <br />(xiii) FAR 52.228-5, Insurance-Work on a Government Installation (Jan 1997)<br />(xiv) FAR 52.232-25, Prompt Payment (Oct 2003)<br />(xv) FAR 52.232-33, Payment By Electronic Funds Transfer-Central Contractor Registration (Oct 2003)<br />(xvi) FAR 52.252-2, Clauses Incorporated by Reference (Feb 1998).

Each vendor will be evaluated on its overall Past Performance under the existing or prior contracts for the same or similar supplies and/or equipment as well as Technical Capability.  Pricing will be evaluated to determine value offered for the price and the extent to which it is fair and reasonable in terms of the Governments requirement.  The Government reserves the right to evaluate quoted prices on the basis of price realism and will consider quoted prices as an indication of understanding the scope and complexity of the governments requirement. 2.

Technical capability and Past Performance, when combined, are significantly more important than price.  Price could become the determinative selection factor if the quality of the quotes are determined to be essentially equal, or if a quote deemed superior in technical quality is determined not to worth the high price premium.

<DESC><p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.
<p>(ii) This solicitation, FA2517-08-T-6165, is being issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).</p>
<p>(iii) A statement that the solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-26.</p>
<p>(iv) This procurement is full and open competition. The NAICS code is 334119 and the size standard is 1,000 employees</p>
<p>(vi) The following commercial item is requested in this solicitation:</p>
<p>CISCO network equipment (brand name or equal). Vendor shall certify that it is a Manufacturer Authorized Channel Partner as of the date of the submission of their offer, and that it has the certification/specialization level required by the Manufacturer to support both the product sale and product pricing, in accordance with the applicable Manufacturer certification/specialization requirements. Unless otherwise specified, Vendor shall warrant that the products are new, in their original box. The Vendor confirms to have sourced all Manufacturer products submitted in this offer from Manufacturer or through Manufacturer Authorized Channels only, in accordance with all applicable laws and policies at the time of purchase. Vendor shall provide Buyer with a copy of the End User license agreement, and shall warrant that all Manufacturer software is licensed originally to Buyer as the original licensee authorized to use the Manufacturer Software. Please see attached excel spreadsheet of salient characteristics.</p>
<p>(vii) Items will be delivered to Peterson AFB, CO.</p>
<p>(viii) IAW Memorandum for Chief Acquisition Officer, Chief Information Officers, Senior Procurement Executives entitled "Use of Brand Name Specifications" dated April 11, 2005 the Brand Name Letter will be published with the solicitation through the Government Point of Entry.</p>
<p>Description of Acquisition: This request is for the purchase of brand name items of network equipment, to include servers, switches, routers, firewalls, software, and associated peripherals for the NORAD and USNORTHCOM Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) Test and Integration Lab (TIL). This request is authorized under FAR 13.5.</p>
<p>Statutory authority: FAR 6.302-1(c), Brand Name.</p>
<p>Description of Requirement: NORAD and USNORTHCOM requires a standardization of all IPv6 TIL network assets, to include all hardware and software, which includes all CISCO Blades, CISCO Switches, HPCompaq Servers, printers and secure and non-secure workstations. The TIL is being established to provide a test bed for testing new software/hardware, applications, security configurations and network upgrades-to include Internet protocol version 6 testing. The equipment being purchased must be the brand names specified, as it is essential to have an identical mirror of the existing production NIPRNet and SIPRNet. If the IPv6 addition to the TIL does not match the NIPRNet and SIPRNet, the testing results are invalidated in reference to our production network. This is essential for our hardware/software configuration baseline and for Network Administration purposes. The testing needs to be accomplished on an identical network so that any problems or issues that are discovered can be corrected before moving the item or software being tested into the production network.</p>
<p>Efforts to Obtain Competition: Other than brand name acquisition will be exercised when the technical refresh process takes place, which is currently on a 3 year cycle. Because this requirement is an addition to the existing requirement, hardware and software must match the existing equipment.</p>

<DESC><p>The purpose of this amendment is to incorporate the following responses to the&nbsp;inquiries received.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: #000080; font-family: Arial;">The resolution on the new sign is a 34 mm (1.33") center-to-center pixel pitch, with 82 pixels per square foot.&nbsp;The new sign is to be full color with 32,768 color capability. The new sign is to be exactly 24x64 matrix size in order to match the existing width on the double faced cabinet being removed (7'8").&nbsp;The new double faced sign will be mounted on an existing sign pole @ approximately 12' off of the ground level.&nbsp;The sign pole is 8" diameter steel with a 12" x 24" fabricated cover over the pylon.&nbsp;A existing illuminated cabinet, approximately 6'4" high x 7'10" wide, will have to be removed during the replacement of the sign and re-installed back on top of the new double faced sign.&nbsp;The new sign is required to be an outdoor unit.&nbsp;The existing sign will be removed and placed within the service unit's storage area, thus, re-mounting of the sign will not be required.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: x-small; color: #000080; font-family: Arial;">The existing sign is receiving data via a "flat satin" telephone line that is connected to a computer within the Administration Department.&nbsp; Last fall the service unit installed a new fiber optic line from the facility manager's office over to the sign location. Thus, the new sign will be controlled from the facility manager's computer through the fiber optic wiring. The end connections at the new sign and within the facility manager's office will be the responsibility of the contractor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: x-small; color: #000080; font-family: Arial;">All other terms and conditions remain unchanged.</span></p>
