<CONTACT>Dick Bolick Contract Specialist 7037871395     richard.bolick@mms.gov;
<DESC>PLEASE READ THIS ENTIRE NOTICE CAREFULLY, AS IT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY NOTICE THAT WILL BE ISSUED. This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulations Subpart 12.6 and the provisions of Subpart 13.5, Test Program for Certain Commercial Items, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a separate written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-11. The following provisions and clauses apply to this acquisition and are incorporated by reference: 1) 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors-Commercial; 2) 52.212-3, Offeror, Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items; 3) 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items, with an addendum; and 4) 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial Items. Solicitation Number 1435-04-03-RP-71248 applies; the solicitation is issued as a request for proposals (RFP).  BACKGROUND: In 1998 and 1999 the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Federal Crop Insurance Corporation (FCIC), established several pilot programs to evaluate crop yield and cost-incurrence coverage for limited resource farmers of certain crops. Melons and lawn seed are not currently among them. The USDA Risk Management Agency (RMA) is seeking research, feasibility and design reports on the potential for establishing crop insurance programs to support growers of melons and lawn seed.  This solicitation consists of two line items. Prospective Offerors may propose on one or both line items, but each line item must be proposed separately.  ITEM 1.  Melons. In 1999 a yield-based crop insurance pilot program was established for melons.  The pilot program had approximately 400 policies sold covering 78,000 acres for the 1999 crop year.  The program was subsequently terminated due to a perceived negative economic impact on the melon market as well as fraud and abuse issues, leaving producers without a crop insurance program available.  This RFP is to provide information to determine if a melon program is feasible.  The Contractor shall research the feasibility of development of a crop insurance program for melons, and for recommending a program design if it is in fact feasible to do so.  Research encompasses identifying strategies for product development for melons; the process used to eliminate strategies not recommended as best; and the justification used to select the recommended strategy (including a possible recommendation of no further development) in relation to possible product development.  The contractor shall produce a research and program design report for melons.  The work will require skills and experience in: project planning, scheduling, and quality control; interviewing techniques; active listening skills; categorizing, analyzing, and summarizing verbal information; data collection and analyses; cost benefit analyses; research; critical thinking; innovative problem solving techniques; oral presentations; and report writing.  The task will also require travel.  The government anticipates that this will be a Fixed-Price award.  ITEM 2.  Lawn Seed.  This is the first in what may be a series of contract awards intended to ultimately result in a new crop insurance program for producers of lawn seed.  A lawn seed crop insurance program is not currently available for producers.  This project will require the contractor to investigate the practices and management that producers follow in the production of lawn seed, and will assist RMA in determining the feasibility and design for a crop insurance program to meet the needs of producers of lawn seed.  The objective is to provide RMA a research and feasibility report that recommends the best approach to develop a crop insurance program for producers of lawn seed.  In conducting this study, the Contractor shall investigate lawn seed production management practices and other data, develop prioritized options, and recommend courses of action to be used by RMA to decide on a strategy for developing a crop insurance program to meet lawn seed producers' needs. This task will involve interviews; travel; data collection, validation and analysis; listening sessions; statistical modeling; and report writing.  The Government anticipates that this will be a Time & Materials award.  OBJECTIVE. The primary objective of these requirements is to secure the services of technical experts who will provide RMA with the necessary information and resources to determine whether and how to establish crop insurance programs in support of melon and lawn seed growers.  Offeror(s) shall include quality control standards for the successful accomplishment of the required tasks, a method to monitor and report task progress, corrective actions to be taken to meet deliverable dates if tasks are off schedule, and a quality control matrix of the productive hours for each skill type that will be devoted to quality control on each.

<DESC>The US Army TACOM-ARDEC intends to issue a solicitation for a contract award for production of the Remote Activation Munitions System (RAMS) and the Time Delay  Sympathetic Detonator (TD-SYDET) to Raytheon Technical Services Company (RTSC), Indianapolis, Indiana on a sole source basis. RAMS is a remote firing device comprised of the M152 or MK152, M16, M17, XM18 and XM85 inert trainer.  TD-SYDET consists of the XM15 and its inert trainer, the XM316.  Based upon results of a sources sought notice conducted and the System Development and Demonstration phase of Contract N00019-96-D-0159, we are utilizing the authority of 10 USC 2304(c)(1), Only Once Responsible Source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  Sole source rationale is duplication costs and unacceptable delays to the Government given that this is a follow-on effort.  This procurement action is intended to be a five-year Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity contract for FY03 through FY07.  See notes 22 and 26.

<DESC>The Government intends to acquire via full and open competition procedures, integrated logistic support services, including inventory and logistics distribution for the contract period necessary to:
      a. operate a full service walk-in retail store at Naval Station Norfolk (Super Servmart); 
      b. operate a full service walk-in retail store at Naval Air Station Oceana (Oceana Touch-N-Go Servmart);
      c. operate a mobile retail store(s), which shall service Hampton Roads Area VA and Elizabeth City NC Area U.S. Government activities;
      d. provide a free delivery service (with no minimum order required) to Hampton Roads Area and Elizabeth City NC Area U.S. Government activities; 
      e. participate in the DoD E-Mall by providing an electronic file of the Contractor's catalog; and
      f. provide floppy diskettes of each walk-in store catalog to customers upon request and each time the catalog is updated.  

The purpose of the resultant contract is to provide all U.S. Naval activities (defined as all U.S. Naval ashore and afloat units in the Hampton Roads Area and Elizabeth City NC Area) with a full range of quality items, at discount prices, with either customer pickup or delivery in accordance with the delivery schedules contained in the contract.  The supplies/equipment offered shall be of the type that is typically carried and offered in standard office, hardware, electrical, and restaurant supply warehouses and retail stores.  The Contractor is encouraged to add items to the list based upon its corporate capability.  However, all new items shall be reviewed by the COR/ACOR to ensure compliance with the performance statement of work prior to being added to the store or catalog. 

By entering into a contract, the U.S. Navy does not acquire, nor is it required to acquire, any item from the Contractor.  The purchase of supplies/equipment will only be made by the way of individual U.S. Government activity purchase orders, U.S. Government Credit Card purchases, or via FISC Norfolk or NAS Oceana delivery orders.  Sales are neither guaranteed nor promised under the contract.  Currently, at the Norfolk Super Servmart, the Virginia Industries for the Blind (VIB) are a subcontractor.  Offerors are encouraged to subcontract/partner with VIB.

The proposed acquisition is a follow-on effort to two current contracts: N00189-00-A-7018 (Norfolk Super Servmart administered by FISC Norfolk) and N00140-97C-0682 (Oceana Touch-N-Go Servmart administered by FISC Norfolk, Philadelphia Detachment), both of which are no cost contracts. An IDIQ type no cost contract will be utilized for a base year with the option to procure services for four additional one-year option periods.  The periods of performance for the Norfolk Super Servmart (approximate start date is mid-December 2002) are different from the Oceana Touch-N-Go Servmart (1 October 2002).  The minimum guarantee of $50,000.00 will be met by U.S. Government customers of both Servmarts placing orders via any of the methods mentioned above.  Currently, the annual sales have averaged $25M for the Norfolk Super Servmart and $3M for the Naval Air Station Oceana Touch-N-Go Servmart.  

The U.S. Government will provide the buildings and some maintenance services.  The Contractor will provide the necessary management, personnel furnishings, fixtures, equipment and supplies to operate the retail stores.  Supplies and equipment required to perform under this contract may include shelving, display cases, cash registers, point of sale system, material handling equipment (MHE), and battery charging stations if MHE is battery driven.  The Contractor shall be required to offer and distribute JWOD/UNICOR products and shall not offer for sale, commercial items that are identical or essentially the same as the JWOD/UNICOR items.  

The solicitation will contain clause 52.217-8, Option to Extend Services.  Solicitation issuance is anticipated as 03 June 2002 with a pre-proposal conference (date and exact location to be specified in the solicitation) to be held in Norfolk and Virginia Beach, Virginia. Offerors will be restricted to two representatives for the pre-proposal conference.    

Award will be based upon a best value evaluation of price, technical proposal and past performance.  In those instances of a large business proposal, the Small Business Subcontracting Plan will be evaluated for compliance with the solicitation provisions.

<DESC>This PRDA is being posted in two parts. This first part contains sections called SOLICITATION, BACKGROUND, PROGRAM DESCRIPTION, TECHNICAL GOALS, and TECHNICAL APPROACH. The second part, posted separately, contains sections called BASIS FOR AWARD, DELIVERABLES WILL INCLUDE, and PROPOSAL PREPARATION INSTRUCTIONS. SOLICITATION. Mr. David Curtis, AFRL/SNHA, Laboratory Program Manager, david.curtis@hanscom.afrl.af. mil, 781-377-2049, Dr. Stephen Hary, AFRL/SNRP, Technical Consultant, stephen.hary@wpafb .af.mil, 937-255-6127 x4175, and Mr. Gino Cascieri, ESC/PKR, Contracting Officer, gino. cascieri@hanscom.af.mil, 781-377-4981, representing the AFRL Sensors Directorate, Hanscom Research Site, located at Hanscom Air Force Base, are soliciting proposals for new and innovative solutions to digital beamforming receiver technology.  This is a single-step, 45-day, Program Research and Development Announcement (PRDA) to solicit research and development proposals for the AFRL/SN X-Band Digital Beamforming Receiver program. BACKGROUND Digital beamforming (DBF) is a rapidly developing technology which is the most advanced approach to phased array antenna pattern control.  When implemented at the array element level, DBF enables full utilization of the maximum number of degrees of freedom in the array.  This can lead to significant improvements in beamforming of simultaneous multiple independent beams, adaptive pattern nulling, space-time adaptive processing (STAP), and direction finding (DF), compared to traditional analog array control techniques.  Because of its flexibility, DBF may find use in a wide range of phased array antenna applications.  One near-term application for subarray-level DBF is in large, relocatable ground-based phased arrays for Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) and theater air defense. Mid-term DBF applications include conformal arrays for low profile aircraft such as Unmanned Air Vehicles (UAV), Unmanned Combat Air Vehicles (UCAV), and in next-generation manned airborne reconnaissance platforms.  Sensors aboard these airborne platforms would typically support Airborne / Ground Moving Target Indication (AMTI / GMTI) radar and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) for Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) mission applications. Subarray-level DBF also applies to very large planar arrays for space-based radar, where very low power and extremely low mass density are key requirements for satellite applications.  Today's state-of-the-art DBF phased arrays are primarily of laboratory prototype quality, and employ digital receivers only at the subarray-level.  This is due to challenges both with RF receiver hardware, including reduction of size, mass, and DC power consumption, as well as digital challenges that include increasing ADC sampling rate, implementing digital sub-banding and digital time delays, and processing enormous data loads associated with DBF algorithms. Digital receiver (Rx) technology tailored for the DBF array application is a newly emerging avenue of research and development that will significantly impact architectural trends in DBF phased array antennas and enable accelerated implementation of DBF.   DBF Rx technology will likely adopt many of the features found in today's state-of-the-art Multi-Function Radar (MFR) receivers and/or Electronic Warfare (EW) receivers.  Currently, digital radar receivers include, but are not limited to the following features: RF receiver front-end for RF-to-IF or RF-to-baseband demodulation, Automatic Gain Control (AGC) for RF front-end protection against strong interfering signals, analog-to-digital converters (ADC) for bandpass or baseband sampling, and digital finite impulse response (FIR) filtering for decomposition of sampled signals into in-phase and quadrature (I/Q) components. DBF Rx technology requires all of these core digital Rx capabilities, plus many others which are essential for digital control and optimization of phased array antenna patterns.  These include, but are not limited to the following:  FIR digital filtering for DBF Rx channel equalization to enable wideband array-level channel-to-channel calibration; use of either digital sub-banding schemes such as multi-rate digital filtering or implementation of fractional sample digital time delays, to enable wideband beamforming and adaptive nulling; pulse compression and data reduction techniques for radar processing; programmability of bandwidth vs. resolution for MTI / SAR mission flexibility; novel data formatting schemes optimized for fast complex-valued channel-level digital processing; a high degree of built-in programmability for implementation of advanced algorithms for beamforming, channel filtering and sub-banding; module-level digital self-registration capabilities with respect to the system-level distribution and temporal aligning of digital clock and synchronization signals, coherent phasing of RF local oscillator (LO) signals, and array channel calibration RF pilot tones; and module-level self-assessment capabilities that monitor the overall in-situ performance of the DBF Rx array channel. The use of miniturized modular tile-like packaging concepts is also desired in order to advance the state-of-the-art of low-profile DBF phased array architectures that are both scalable and modular.  Recent trends in DBF Rx technology development have utilized commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) standardized VME and VXI electronic mainframes and circuit boards which support a modular building-block approach to DBF system implementation.  In many cases, however, it is desirable to implement DBF in a much smaller volume and with a much lower mass density.  One concept now being explored by AFRL/SN is the layered integration of a planar digital signal processor architecture with a planar DBF phased array architecture, using modular tile-based DBF Rx technology in the interface between the array and processor layers.  One potential benefit of this modular, scalable approach is the reuse of key electronic sub-systems across many different DBF arrays architectures. It is anticipated that the Air Force may achieve significant cost savings using modular DBF Rx components in scalable DBF phased array sensor architectures, with the most significant savings derived from reduced life-cycle system maintenance costs and multi-system amortization of non-recurring engineering costs of the modular array electronics. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION This solicitation is open only to companies headquartered within the United States of America.  This effort shall not use or produce any classified information.  This effort will have funding over a three (3) year performance period.  The Air Force estimates its investment in this effort to be approximately equivalent to 10 man-years, fully burdened. The actual amount of labor will be less, assuming an approximate 60/40 spending ratio between manpower and all other costs.  Since this is the first of potentially many related contractual efforts to come from the AFRL/SN X-Band Digital Beamforming Receiver Program, the vast majority of the technical output from this effort must be non-proprietary.  This must be done to ensure that what is learned in this contractual effort may be freely utilized by the Air force to advance the technical base of the AFRL/SN X-Band Digital Beamforming Receiver Program, and to advance the state-of-the-art of DBF Rx technology in general.  Outputs may be used by the Government to guide future contractual efforts, including contracts with other vendors. The use of Internal Research and Development funding (IR&D) is invited, but not required, for consideration of award.  If IR&D is proposed, the proposal must clearly specify which portions of the resultant intellectual property and technical output from the proposed effort will be the direct result of funding from this contract versus IR&D.  Proposals which include IR&D but which do not clearly make this distinction will not be considered for award.  As stated above, the vast majority of what is proposed as output from this contract must be made available to AFRL/SN on a non-proprietary basis. TECHNICAL GOALS The goal of this effort is to develop a new class of compact digital receiver technology tailored to handle the unique challenges of DBF at X-band.  The primary emphasis of this effort will be to develop a new digital receiver architectural approach which adds several DBF-specific features and performance capabilities, while leveraging appropriate techniques and capabilities from the existing state-of-the-art of digital receiver technology used for radar and EW systems.  DBF-specific capabilities that are of particular interest should include, but are not limited to the following: implementation of digital time delays; implementation of digital sub-banding; and implementation of module-level self-registration features that will allow a DBF Rx module to precisely adjust its timing of digital clock and synchronization signals, phasing of incident RF local oscillator signals, and phasing of RF calibrator pilot tones, injected at the module-level.  This program seeks to establish new techniques and design approaches that can be used to implement these and other DBF-specific performance capabilities.  These features should be organized into the following four (4) main sub-systems of the DBF Rx: a) RF sub-system, b) digital channelization sub-system, c) digital time delay and filtering sub-system, and d) digital self-registration sub-system.  Engineering design trade analyses and design simulation and modeling performance analyses will be used to identify candidate approaches and to simulate the expected performance of all DBF Rx technology developed in this effort.  This program also will rigorously demonstrate the validity of the new DBF receiver capabilities by the fabrication and testing of at least four (4), but preferably sixteen (16), prototype DBF receivers at X-band.  This program also requires the design, fabrication and testing of a DBF Receiver Test and Evaluation Board, as described in the Technical Approach section of this solicitation. High RF and digital performance is key to the success of this DBF Rx technology research and development program.  In an effort to promote new and highly innovative solutions to DBF Rx challenges, a fixed set of technical specifications will not be given for this program.  However, the following basic guidelines, which are commensurate with the current state-of-the-art of digital receiver technology, shall serve as performance goals for this program: 1)   RF Spurious Free Dynamic Range (SFDR): 72-84 dB;  2)   Effective linear digital resolution: 12-14 bits;  3)   Noise figure: 2-4 dB;  4)   Continuous frequency tuning range: 8-12 GHz;  5)   Instantaneous bandwidth: 200-1000 MHz;  6)   Maximum length of digital time delays: 4 RF wavelengths at low end of tuning range;  7)   Resolution of digital time delays: 0.125 RF wavelengths at high end of tuning range;  8)   Digital clock jitter and ADC sampling synchronization: 2-10 picoseconds;  9)   Number of digital sub-bands within instantaneous bandwidth: 20-100, of equal width;  10) DC power consumption: 1-5 W;  11) Physical Size:  Not to exceed 1 x 4 x 4 inches;  12) Packaging Approach: Modular Tile.  In addition to the guidelines given above, significant performance and cost savings advantages may be realized by using COTS components and subsystems, as well as components which were previously developed under IR&D efforts or previously completed contractual programs for the Government.  This effort does not seek to develop new electronic components, but does seek to leverage, where practical, available COTS and state-of-the-art components.  Although not a requirement for this program, it may also be desirable that the X-band digital receiver technology developed under this effort be applicable to L-band applications, with minor redesign changes, such as changing the LO frequency in the first stage of the RF receiver, or by removal of the first stage of the X-band RF receiver design to yield an L-band design. TECHNICAL APPROACH This technical effort will, first and foremost, include a Concept Development Task where new and innovative DBF Rx functions and implementation techniques are to be developed and integrated with existing capabilities and implementation techniques found in state-of-the-art digital receivers for radar applications.  Several candidate approaches should be identified for all major sub-systems of the DBF receiver. For more information on these sub-systems, refer to both the Background and Technical Goals sections of this solicitation. An engineering Trade Space Analysis task will be performed as a major portion of this task, to clearly show the anticipated benefits and weaknesses of the design, as well as technical challenges in development and implementation of the proposed technology. A second task will be the DBF Receiver Design Task.  This will include selection of one of the leading design options for each of the DBF Rx sub-systems, as identified in the Concept Development Task.  This task will further develop the selected design options and integrate them into a single DBF Rx design, at the point design level.  Significant computer modeling and simulation of all RF and digital functions of the selected DBF Rx design will be performed.  The output of this task will include both preliminary and critical design reviews, to be held with AFRL/SN. The third task will be the DBF Receiver Implementation Task.  The engineering effort of this task will focus on developing and refining the details of achieving physical integration and the functional integration of the selected DBF Receiver point design into fully functioning prototype hardware demonstration deliverables.  Packaging, size, weight and power will be issues of great interest.  Projections on the cost of producing hundreds to thousands of the DBF Receivers is also of interest.  This task will produce between four to sixteen (4 - 16), fully functioning prototype DBF Receivers based on the final design approved by AFRL/SN in the DBF Receiver Design Task.  It is critical to make the prototype DBF receivers as identical as possible, and where possible, to use realistic manufacturing and assembly practices that would be typical of limited run initial production (LRIP) fabrication runs. The fourth task will be the DBF Receiver Test and Evaluation Board Task. This task will design, develop, fabricate, and test a separate circuit board which serves as a life-support system to the prototype DBF Receivers.  This board must provide LO to the RF sub-system, digital clock and timing synchronization signals to the digital channelization sub-system, and DC-biasing to all sub-systems, and this board must connect to and interface with a laptop computer or PC workstation.  All programmable features of the DBF Receiver, including digital filtering, digital time delays, digital sub-banding, etc., must be directly accessible from this board, and must be directly testable using the laptop or workstation.  Since data generated by the DBF Rx will be outputted to this board, a large-volume digital data recording medium must be connected to this board, for temporary and permanent storage of output test data.  The board must also have an extensive set of test connections, so that all critical points within the RF and digital portions of the DBF Rx module may be injected with appropriate test signals, and so that measurements of the output may be made at all critical points within the DBF Receiver. The fifth task will be DBF Receiver Test and Evaluation.  This task will utilize the DBF Receiver Test and Evaluation Board Task to test and demonstrate the performance of all aspects of the prototype DBF receivers. A specific test plan will be developed as part of this task, and must be approved by AFRL/SN.  In addition to testing and collection of measured performance data, a significant portion of this task will carefully compare the measured performance vs. the computed simulated performance, modeled in the DBF Receiver Design Task, for all major sub-systems in the DBF Receiver. See Note 26.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to enter into a sole source purchase order with George Washington University in support of the Metrology for System-on-a Chip (SoC) Project. The needed contractor will provide skilled individual(s) to work with NIST staff in performing design fabrication, post-processing of a test-bench on a chip and characterization of the designed system on a chip (test-bench) performance via computer interfact. The work will involve the layout, simuation, and fabrication of A-D converters and other relevant signal conditioning circuitry for the sensors, BIST (build-In-Self-Test) system block for internal-external testing of the performance of the sensor interfaces, signal conditiioning circuitry. Expertise in the layout and fabrication of fluidic, optical and gas sensor structures to be tested with the test bench constructed is required to complete this work in a timely fashion. George Washington University is the only institution that we are aware of with the expertise and familarity to meet the milestones of this work within the time that is alloted. Initiating work at another research organization less skilled in this area would require considerable start-up time and would result in the inability to meet milestones critical to the successful completion of the research. The George Washington University has demonstrated in the past outstanding work in related research areas as evidenced by their technical publications. Research staff with the University are considered to be experts within this area.
The Government anticipates the award of a firm-fixed price purchase order on or about January 22, 2003.  The proposed requirement is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106(b).  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations.  However, the government will consider all capability statements received by January 22, 2003.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  A Request for Quotation (RFQ) package is not available.

<CONTACT>Point of Contact - https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop/Public/ASP/dcop.asp
<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>NA The purpose of this notice is to answer questions submitted in response to the Sources Sought and to notify Responders that the Government is revising the statement of work, working on an acquisition plan, and anticipates releasing a solicitation some time  in February. ========================================= Question 1.  The contract award amount is expected to be $100,000.  You also state that the contractor may be required to travel to Army facilities to conduct the feedback and planning sessions.  Does the $100,000 include travel?  Are we to assume that t ravel will be reimbursed according to the Federal Travel Regulation? The $100,000 does not include travel for the feedback and planning sessions.  Those costs will likely be paid for by the requesting organizations.  Army may add resources to the existing contract or require the contractor directly bill the requesting organ ization.  In either case, travel will be reimbursed according to the Federal Travel Regulation. Question 2.  You state, the contractor may be required to host up to 2 1/2 day sessions.    Does this mean 2 sessions, each of which is a half a day (4 hours) long?  If not, what does this mean?  If the contractor hosts the training sessions, does this p reclude travel to Army facilities?  If so, how should offerors price this work to account for both possibilities?  Or, if you anticipate a contractor hosting training sessions as well as traveling to Army facilities, how should this be priced? Feedback and planning sessions could range from  day (four hours long) to 2  days (20 hours long), based on experience with our previous contract and the needs of the requesting Army organization.  If Army feels it is more desirable to travel to the cont ractor facilities, then we will require the contractor to travel to Army facilities.  Contractors should describe all costs in the cost proposal based on both possibilities.     Question 3.  In stating the $100,000 ceiling, you mention that the length of the contract will extend a year.  What levels of effort do you anticipate over the yearlong timeframe (e.g., consistent level of effort across the entire time frame, or peaks and valleys based on specified milestones)? The level of effort will be most during the second, third, and fourth months of the contract, through the end of the data-reporting phase of the contract.   Question 4.  The SOW indicates a need to show change from the FY01 survey results.  However, we were told data from the 2001 survey will not be available.  Will this require additional hand entry of summary data from the FY01 survey?  If so, it would be very time consuming.   At the very least, Army will provide an ASCII database containing FY01 survey raw data.     Question 5.  The SOW indicates Task 4 costs should be included in the cost proposal.  Are these costs intended to be included in the $100,000 project cost estimate? No, Task 4 is onsite consultation that should be considered optional, at the request of specific Army organizations over and above the $100,000 ceiling. Question 6.  Were FY01 data analyzed to improve the quality of the survey instrument? With respect to the survey items, most of the supplemental, non-core items will differ from the FY01 survey.  Some core items also may be reviewed and revised.  Concerning the web-based system per se, Army analyzed open-ended comments made by survey partic ipants.  We will review this analysis and identify lessons learned as we develop the FY03 web survey system.   Question 7.  Key driver analysis is not an automated process.  It must be done individually for each reporting unit for employees (400) and supervisors (400) and entered into each report as stand-alone data.  The $100,000 estimate allows for only $250.00 p er report and tasks one and two plus key driver analysis.  This is not realistic. We acknowledge that key driver analysis is not a totally automated process.  However, the successf ul contractor should be able to come up with a creative method of automating as much of the process as possible.  For example, because Army requires a fairly large number of key driver reports, the contractor may be able to come up with reasonable automate d rules for identifying breakpoints across Army and apply them to individual Army organizations. Question 8.  Using just a web-based survey introduces a bias to the survey as it excludes the following: a) those respondents with no access to the internet; b) those with limited access to the internet; and c) individuals who do not trust the computers an d will not give any information out on the internet.  This bias is particularly crucial when evaluating employee attitudes, as these individuals might perceive their work place differently from those who are responding.  Thus, limiting the survey to be pur ely web-based is introducing this non-respondent bias in the results making them less credible. Army analyzed FY01 survey results against the survey population and found them to be reasonably representative.  Points concerning trust and access to the web are well taken.  In FY01, we asked all Army supervisors, especially supervisors of wage grade emp loyees that have limited access to computers, to ensure all employees have access to the web-based survey.  We included a letter from the Secretary of the Army addressing the security issue.   Question 9.  The draft SOW does not say a lot about the Web survey and whether or not usability testing has been conducted in the past or whether it might be of value this time.  However, it could provide some valuable information for DCC-W.  For example, if confidentiality was an issue in previous administrations, one could conduct usability testing to determine how much of an issue that is, explore possible solutions, and offer recommendations on this or any other usability issues.  Hypothetically, woul d the owner of the attitude survey be interested in some form of usability testing? Usability testing of web-based surveys is a relatively new area of research.  Generally speaking, it refers to the methods (e.g., focus groups, one-on-one interviews, field observations, and surveys) that are used to evaluate usability.  The usability of a  web-based survey can greatly impact the experience of the users of the system, and can contribute to a variety of problems, including user confusion, non-response, and confidentiality concerns.  This may ultimately impact overall system credibility.  Army  would be interested in incorporating some form of usability testing within the confines of the present budget ceiling.  For example, analysis of FY01s open-ended comments may be used to evaluate usability so that Army could create marketing pieces (perha ps in the form of Frequently Asked Questions) that serve to alleviate some of the potential problems.   Question 10.  The draft SOW mentions open-ended comments but does not say that comments will need to be tied to actual survey responses.  Is that something that will be necessary in the next administration?  If so, perhaps pre-administration focus groups o r some other qualitative approach (e.g., one-on-one or telephone interviews) could help determine the level of concern and ways to alleviate that concern.  As mentioned above, this could also be explored via usability testing. The FY01 open-ended comments were not tied to actual survey responses.  However, it may be useful to tie comments to certain important Army demographics.  This is something that contractor should explore with Army during Task 1, when the contractor is cons ulting with Army as we develop the web-based survey system.  Question 11.  DMDC has been doing some interesting work with non-responders.  A brief non-responder survey may shed light on why some Army civilians choose not to respond and could provide valuable insight into ways to increase future response rates.  Is t his something that may be of interest to the survey process owner? Yes, within the specifications of the first task.   Question 12.  The draft SOW mentions 2  days onsite feedback and action planning sessions and the desire to end those days with a specific plan of action.  Would the process owner be open to alternative approaches?  For example, contractor could come out to do feedback and action planning training in one day.  After some time (say 2 weeks), contractor returns and helps develop action plan.  The 2 weeks in between would allow trainees to go out and gather information from their reports and bring that back t o the second meeting.  Alternatively, if budget is an issue, day 2 could be handled via conference call.  Are those alternative solutions of interest? The contractor should list alternative solutions such as the one described above.

PROGRAM OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION
DARPA?s Advanced Technology Office (ATO) is soliciting proposals for innovative concepts and technologies relating to advances in Robust Networking and Communications, Intelligence Preparation of the Battlesphere (IPB), and Information Assurance (IA), Bio-tech systems, Maritime, Special Operations and technologies that provide unconventional advantages over adversaries or potential adversaries.  The objective is to enable revolutionary advances in warfighting capability.  To achieve this objective, offerors should emphasize radical concepts that may contain high technical risk but if enabled would have commensurate high military payoff.  Multiple awards during CY 2003 are anticipated.

TECHNICAL TOPIC AREAS
Any technical areas that fall within the scope of the topics listed in the Program Objectives are acceptable.  The following, but not limited to, areas are of specific interest.  Concepts for:  (1) trustworthy computing in mobile environments, (2) defenses against large-scale malicious code attacks, (3) improvements to and acceleration of Battle Damage Assessment, with a particular interest in opportunities to provide real-time quantitative functional damage assessments from within the small radius of the target aimpoint, (4) ultra-maneuverable, supersonic munitions for air/land/sea engagements, (5) earth-penetrating payload carriers capable of holding buried and hardened targets at risk (6) flight controls & Human Machine Interface to minimize pilot training time, (7) multi-mode dynamic waveforms, (8) dynamic wireless topology control for bursty channels with highly directional antenna, (9) hybrid router for dynamic links/channels with dual physical layers (radio frequency/optical), (10), hybrid radio frequency/free space optical aperture concepts, (11) common radio frequency/optical backend, (12) high data rate underwater communication, (13) sensor development, for unambiguous determination of multiple chemical species, (14) identification and geolocation of threats to mobile U. S. forces, (15) all optical networks, (16) novel approaches to the development, implementation and control of networked weapons systems, (17) enabling technologies for littoral warfare.  Additional technical areas and proposal instructions may be added through an amendment to this BAA throughout CY 2003.

GENERAL INFORMATION
This notice, in conjunction with the BAA03-06 Proposer Information Pamphlet (PIP), constitutes the total BAA.  Therefore, proposers should obtain a pamphlet entitled ?BAA03-06 Advanced Technologies? Proposer Information Pamphlet (PIP) in order to submit information under this BAA.

For this BAA, IN PARTICULAR, offerors, are cautioned to pay special attention to the instructions delineated in the PIP with respect to submission of information for funding consideration.  The Government has delineated a three-step, sequential process, that offerors should follow including the submission of an Executive Summary, Proposal Abstract, and finally a Full Proposal, in that order.  This sequential review is intended to expedite Government review of submitted information and minimize unnecessary expense on the part of those responding to this BAA.  

The Government reserves the right to select for award all, some, or none of the ideas presented for review.  Furthermore, the Government reserves the right to fund all, some, or none of the total effort associated with these ideas.  All responsible sources capable of satisfying the Government?s needs are encouraged to submit their ideas.  Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Minority Institutions (MIs) are encouraged to submit ideas and join others in doing so; however, no portion of this BAA will be set aside for HBCU and MI participation due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas of research in the technologies sought.

All questions pertaining to this BAA, including requests for information on how to submit information under this BAA, should be directed to the administrative contact phone number, fax number, physical address, or email listed below (NOTE:  e-mail is highly preferred).  DARPA intends to use electronic mail, WWW, and/or fax for correspondence regarding BAA03-06.  Information formally submitted in response to this BAA by offerors, however, to include Executive Summary?s, Proposal Abstracts, and Full Proposals, must strictly adhere to the instructions contained in the PIP.  Failure to adhere to the instructions in the PIP may result in the offeror?s submission being rejected. 

This notice, in conjunction with the BAA03-06 Proposer Information Pamphlet, constitutes the total BAA.  Updates to this BAA, including additional technical topic areas of specific interest, and other changes as necessary, may be posted throughout the year at the FedBizOpps website: http://www.fedbizopps.gov, and World Wide Web (WWW) at URL http://www.darpa.mil/ato/solicit.htm.  In the event of any discrepancy between the information delineated at http://www.fedbizopps.gov and http://www.darpa.mil/ato/solicit.htm, the http://www.fedbizopps.gov site takes precedence.

EVALUATION CRITERIA
The evaluation of proposals will be accomplished through a technical review of each proposal using the following criteria: (l) Overall scientific and technical merit in relationship to the revolutionary aspects of approach, (2) Contribution to the DARPA Mission, (3) Offeror's Capabilities and Related Experience, (4) Approach/Ability to Technology Transition, and (5) Cost Realism.

<SUBJECT>59-- Draft Specification for the Array Processing Subsystem (APS) for the Acoustic Observatory (AO)
<DESC>Purpose of the Notice
The Office of Naval Research (ONR) is currently conducting market research for the Array Processing Subsystem (APS) of the Acoustic Observatory (AO).  ONR is seeking comments on its draft performance specification.  Additionally, any rough order of magnitude cost estimates would be greatly appreciated. 
 
Comment Period
Public comments on the draft specification will be accepted through COB 15-Feb-2003. 

E-mail Address of Responses
Comments should be submitted electronically to the following e-mail address: LOPS@onr.navy.mil.

Draft Performance Specification
ONR has prepared a draft performance specification which is available at http://www.onr.navy.mil/sci_tech/ocean/321_sensing/prog_us.htm.  Paper copies are not available.

Background
The AO has the exploratory development objective of defining the spatial and temporal properties of the shallow water environment that pose the fundamental limit to the performance of passive sonar systems. In addition, the AO has the equally important engineering objective of optimizing spatio-temporal signal processing methods for an environmentally matched spatial aperture configured as either a mobile towed or a fixed deployed array of hydrophones.

The Array Processing Subsystem (APS) APS has a notional concept that includes a Data Recording, Archiving and Management Segment (DRAMS) and a Beamformer and Output Processing Segment (BOPS). The DRAMS shall provide Short-Term data disc drive based Archive Files (STAF) and Long-Term magnetic tape based Archive Files (LTAF) for selected data sets from the AO sensor. The STAF/LTAF shall be accessible by means of a keyword description of ambient acoustic activity in the AO area on a 24 hour cycle. The DRAMS shall be implemented as a scalable architecture that facilitates simple, cost-effective expansion of the archived data base size and access speed capability with improved commercially available data base hardware and software. The BOPS shall be implemented in three steps: (1) mandatory start-up capability for partial array aperture conventional beamforming (CBF) and spectrum analysis to ensure data quality at recording, (2) optional hardware and software for full array CBF and Measure of Performance (MOP) monitoring and analysis, and (3) optional hardware and software for full array Adaptive Beamforming (ABF) and MOP monitoring and analysis. The MOP capability shall provide for the continuous estimation and statistical analysis of sonar array and beamforming signal and noise gain metrics for both cooperative and opportunistic acoustic sources.  The BOPS shall provide an operator summary display of both acoustic and nonacoustic (radar) ship traffic locations and environmental sound velocity profile data for a 24-hour period to provide a basis for down-selecting the STAF time series to LTAF status. 

Points of Contact
Additional questions or inquiries should be directed to Brian Glance via telephone at (703)696-2596 or via e-mail at glanceb@onr.navy.mil.
 

Other
It is not the intention of the Government to respond to comments individually.  Announcement of the APS draft specification does not obligate ONR to follow through with a Request for Proposal (RFP).  The Navy has not yet determined whether to conduct this effort in-house or through contract.

<SUBJECT>A -- Hybrid Chirped Pulsed Amplification Technology
<DESC>LAWRENCE LIVERMORE NATIONAL LABORATORY SEEKS LICENSEE TO PRODUCE LASERS USING A HYBRID CHIRPED PULSE AMPLIFICATION TECHNOLOGY


Announcement:  Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by the University of California under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), seeks to license the technology to build a high power, short pulse laser using Hybrid Chirped Pulsed Amplification.

Researchers at LLNL have a new approach for building a high power, short pulse laser.  Traditionally, high power, short pulse laser designs fall into one of two types.  The first type of laser uses a large multipass or regenerative solid state laser amplifier which is pumped by a Q-switched laser.  These designs use a Pockels cell to switch a chirped pulse output either prior to or following amplification.  The problems with this design are its high cost (mainly due to the use of a Pockels cell), the need for electronic drive circuitry, and the problem of narrowing the gain bandwidth which distorts the compressed output signal.

The alternate type of laser uses an Optical Parametric Amplifier (OPA).  The OPA offers the advantage of broadband large single pass gain and simplicity.  However, it suffers from the disadvantage of extremely low efficiency when commercial pump lasers are used (maximum demonstrated efficiency is 6%).

The new LLNL Hybrid Chirped Pulse Amplification system works in the following manner.  The system uses an oscillator, which feeds its signal into a stretcher.  The output of the stretcher then goes into an OPA.  This OPA amplifies the signal using a seeded Q-switched laser as a pump source.  The amplified OPA pulse and the residual pump beam then go into a multi-pass solid-state Ti:sapphire amplifier (or equivalent).  Ti:sapphire stores the total integrated pump energy and efficiently amplifies the output pulse.  The output pulse of the Ti:sapphire amplifier then goes through a pulse compressor to create a short femtosecond pulse output.  This design requires the following major subsystems:
?	Oscillator
?	Stretcher
?	Seeded Q-switched pump laser
      or for kHz systems a single longitudinal mode pump laser
?	OPA amplifier
?	Ti:sapphire (or equivalent) amplifier
?	Pulse Compressor



This new LLNL Hybrid Chirped Pulse Amplification system offers the following advantages:
?	Reduced cost  (No Pockels cell or electronic drive circuit needed)
?	Simplified passive design
?	No gain narrowing and possible gain broadening
?	High efficiency (should approach 50%)
?	Compact design

LLNL has developed a prototype multi-terawatt capable hybrid OPA-Ti:sapphire CPA system [1] based on a 7ns Q-switched 532 nm pump laser and an 820 nm, 30 fs oscillator.  Using 225mJ of pump energy, the two stage OPA based on a beta-barium borate amplifies the pulse to 2 mJ, while the final highly efficient multipass Ti:sapphire amplifier utilizes this same pump pulse produces 65 mJ of amplified pulse.  With Joule level pump pulses, peak powers in excess of 20TW can be produced using this simple technique.

Prototype systems operating at 1mm and utilizing Nd:glass as the amplifier media are also under construction.

Note:  THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.  Companies interested in commercializing LLNL's Hybrid Chirped Pulsed Amplification system for high power, short pulse lasers should provide a written statement of interest, which includes the following:
1.	Company Name and address.
2.	The name, address, and telephone number of a point of contact.
3.	A description of corporate expertise and facilities relevant to commercializing the technology.

TESTING REQUIREMENTS: Test rolls will be inspected to ensure compliance with specifications. Test rolls will be held in SSA's printer area for three calendar days to allow for proper acclimatizing. The rolls will then be used on the appropriate machinery to ensure that the paper meets all requirements for surface stability, vapor emissions, print quality maintenance and fusing quality. The core must function properly without shifting of the paper or jamming. More than one non-compliant roll in the test group constitutes failure. If the test rolls pass these requirements, SSA will give "conditional approval of the test rolls. The Government will have an additional 30 days to ensure that the paper has no detrimental effects on the printing equipment. Additional criteria that may be assessed during this period are: (1) the continued use of the paper must not result in the emission of odor-causing compounds such as sulfur compounds, chlorides, rein-based aerosols or organics; 2) any coatings on the paper must not cause fusing failures; 3) the paper must not cause fusing failures due to the inclusion of synthetic resins synthetic sizing agents or plastics; 4) the paper must not create excessive dust. The amount of paper dust generated must not exceed 75-260 micrograms per cubic meter (SSA Health code standard) or cause printer malfunctions and operator interventions; and, 5) paper must not have additives or other conditions that reduce print quality. If the paper fails to meet these criteria during this period, SSA reserves the right to cancel the order.
