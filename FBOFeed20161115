This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application.  The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined.  Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation, regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small business set aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors).
Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. 
Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made.

A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.
It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement make contract with the firms(s) listed.  
Note:  While price will be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final contract award decision may be based upon a combination of price and past performance factors as detailed in the solicitation.

<DESC>Exception is taken to this requirement FD2030-16-01387 of the synopsis publicizing IAW with FAR part 5.202(a)(13), exception:
(i)	 Is for an amount not expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold
(ii)	Will be made through a means that provides access to the notice of proposed contract action through the GPE.
(iii)	Permits the public to respond to the solicitation electronically.
Electronic commerce is defined at 41 USC sec. 426 as electronic techniques for accomplishing business transactions, including electronic mail.  Thus, provided the complete solicitation package is available through the GPE and offerors are permitted to respond electronically (i.e., email in this case), the proposed contract action would not need to be synopsized.
Therefore, synopsis is hereby waived as this acquisition is not expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold, request for proposal will be made through Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOps), and the offerors will be able to respond electronically.

<p>GENERAL INFORMATION: The U.S. Government appreciates the time and effort taken to respond to this survey. The U.S. Government acknowledges its obligations under 18 U.S.C. 1905 to protect information qualifying as PROPRIETARY under this statute. Pursuant to this statute, the U.S. Government is willing to accept any trade secret or confidential restrictions placed on qualifying data forwarded in response to the survey questions and to protect it from unauthorized disclosure subject to the following:</p>
<p>1. Clearly and conspicuously mark qualifying data as trade secret or confidential with the restrictive legend (all caps) PROPRIETARY with any explanatory text, so that the U.S. Government is clearly notified of what data needs to be appropriately protected.</p>
<p>2. In marking such data, please take care to mark only those portions of the data or materials that are truly trade secret or confidential (over breadth in marking inappropriate data as PROPRIETARY may diminish or eliminate the usefulness of your response - see item 6 under Instructions for Completing the Questionnaire, below). Use circling, underscoring, highlighting or any other appropriate means to indicate those portions of a single page which are to be protected.</p>
<p>3. The U.S. Government is not obligated to protect unmarked data. Additionally, marked data that is already in the public domain or in the possession of the U.S. Government or third parties, or is afterward placed into the public domain by the owner or another party through no fault of the U.S. Government will not be protected once in the public domain. Data already in the possession of the U.S. Government will be protected in accordance with the U.S. Government's rights in the data.</p>
<p>4. Proprietary or Confidential data transmitted electronically, whether by physical media or not, whether by the respondent or by the U.S. Government, shall contain any restrictive legend, with any explanatory text, on both the cover of the transmittal e-mail and at the beginning of the file itself.

<p>5. In any reproductions of technical data or any portions thereof subject to asserted restrictions, the U.S. Government shall also reproduce the asserted restriction legend and any explanatory text.</p>
<p><br />DESCRIPTION OF INTENT:</p>
<p>THIS IS A MARKET SURVEY REQUESTING INFORMATION IN SUPPORT OF THE FOLLOWING PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENT. No contract will be awarded from this announcement. This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an announcement of a forthcoming solicitation. Also, it is not a request seeking contractors interested in being placed on a solicitation mailing list. Response to this questionnaire is voluntary and no reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this Market Survey and any follow-on information requests. Data submitted in response to this "Project Manager, Force Projection - MAC-50 and RTCH services Market Research" will not be returned. No solicitation document exists at this time, and calls requesting a solicitation will not be answered.</p>
<p>The anticipated requirement is for 3 years of maintenance services (1 base year and two 1-year options) supporting the Rough Terrain Container Handler (RTCH) RT-240 and U.S. Army MAC-50 Crane. The Kalmar RTCH is an Army Program of Record (POR) system for which the Army does not own the Technical Data Package (TDP). The Terex MAC 50T Crane is an Army non-POR, non-standard equipment system for which the Army does not own the TDP. In both instances, there are no plans for the Government to obtain the TDPs. Project Manager, Force Projection (PM FP) works with the TACOM Life Cycle Management Command (LCMC) Integrated Logistics Support Center (ILSC), Defense Logistics Agency Land and Maritime (DLA L&amp;M) and the OEMs to meet its mission to train unit operator personnel and maintain equipment readiness in the Central Command (CENTCOM) Area of Responsibility (AOR). The Kalmar RT-240 RTCH and Terex MAC-50T Crane are low density/high demand equipment essential to AOR operations. The primary locations of performance are the CENTCOM AOR (Kuwait, Afghanistan, Iraq) and Sierra Army Depot.</p>
<p>Contractor personnel will require the technical skills to inspect, assess, and repair the MAC-50 Crane and RTCH. Field Service Representatives (FSRs) shall have in-depth knowledge and expertise necessary to complete all diagnostics and repairs to the system, subsystems, and any associated armor packages. The anticipated requirement is for contractor augmentation support in CENTCOM AOR to provide equipment training, technical assessment and evaluation, maintenance support, repair of the equipment and administrative logistics services in the CENTCOM AOR. System specific FSRs are required for each of these two separate systems in order to continue to meet the needs of the warfighter. FSRs must have experience with all variants of the Kalmar RTCH or the MAC-50 Crane, and must have capability from very specialized maintenance and diagnostics unique to each system through general repair.</p>
<p>Previous actions for service support for these systems have been on a sole-source basis to each of the system manufacturers due to specialized skills and knowledge required for all levels of maintenance.</p>
<p>INSTRUCTIONS FOR COMPLETING THE QUESTIONNAIRE:</p>
<p>1. Number each response with the appropriate question number.</p>
<p>2. You do not have to repeat the question in your response.</p>
<p>3. If you cannot answer a question, please indicate No Response.</p>
<p>4. If a response will satisfy another question, state: "See response to Question XXX."</p>
<p>5. Include relevant sales media and product manuals. If providing a manual formatted as an Acrobat Portable Document File (PDF), annotate the manual to indicate which material is applicable to the questions. If appropriate and preferred, include Internet Web links to locations where animations/videos may be viewed.</p>
<p>6. If your sales media and/or manuals contain a restricted distribution statement, issue a release statement indicating that the restricted material may be distributed to Army personnel involved with this market survey.</p>
<p>7. Spell out any acronyms in their first instance.</p>
<p>8. Clearly mark any proprietary information. If applicable, the front page of your response package should state: "Proprietary Information Contained." Provide a release statement indicating that the proprietary information may be distributed to Army personnel involved with this Market Survey.</p>
<p>9. Please note that Email submissions cannot exceed ten megabytes per message. If your response exceeds ten megabytes, please break it into two or more messages and title each appropriately in the subject line, for example: "Project Manager, Force Projection - MAC-50 and RTCH services Market Research - 1 of 2". This will ensure that we are aware of the number of messages we should expect to receive as your complete response.</p>

<DESC>Mission and Installation Contracting Command - Yuma Proving Ground, AZ. The requirement is for Tropics Test Support Services (TTSS) for the Tropics Region Test Center located at U.S Army Yuma Proving Ground (USAYPG), Yuma AZ with full performance in the Republic of Panama and various other tropical locations Outside the Continental United States (OCONUS) to include, but not limited to, Suriname, Honduras, Hawaii, etc. The contractor will be required to provide non-personal services to include TTSS for the following major task areas: Test and Evaluation, Technical and Engineering Special Services, Logistical Support Services, Administrative Support Services, Operations and Maintenance Services, Test Facilities/Range Management, Fabrication and Repair and Significant Event Reporting. The contractor shall furnish engineering, technical, administrative, maintenance and support service necessary and incidental to performance of the requirement. It is anticipated that the solicitation will be released on or about 30 November 2016 with an estimated closing date of 3 January 2017. Award will be made using Best Value Tradeoff. A Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) type contract is anticipated.
<p>The solicitation and subsequent contract will be awarded for a Phase-In period of 60 days, a ten (10) month base period and four (4) one-year options, with the inclusion of FAR Clause 52.217-8 Option to Extend Services for a period Not To Exceed (NTE) 6 months, for a total potential period of performance of five (5) years, six (6) months. This requirement is being solicited under full and open competition. The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 541330, Engineering Services, with a size standard of $38.5M. The acquisition will be conducted in two phases. The first phase is an Advisory Multi-Step Process in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 15.202. The second phase begins upon issuance of the solicitation. Offerors shall submit a statement of qualifications demonstrating they are capable of performing the above mentioned task areas. Offerors shall also submit information regarding past experience they have in providing non-personal services in OCONUS locations in the above mentioned task areas.</p>
<p>The Army Test and Evaluation Command (ATEC) plans, integrates, and conducts experiments, developmental testing, independent operational testing, and independent evaluations and assessments in order to provide essential information to acquisition decision-makers and commanders. To accomplish this mission, ATEC relies on contractors to provide test and evaluation support services in the areas of instrumentation, modeling and simulation, test support, data collection, data assessment, and range support services.</p>
<p>Department of Defense (DoD) Directive 5000.01 defines operational testing and evaluation by requiring that military departments establish independent Operational Test Agencies (OTAs). As an independent OTA, ATEC is required to conduct operational testing and evaluation independent of the system developer, the program management office, and the acquiring organization.</p>
<p>Title 10, United States Code (USC) Section 2399(d) also requires that independent operational test and evaluation of Major Defense Acquisition Programs (MDAPs) is conducted independent of system contractor manipulation or influence, unless the system contractor is involved in the actual operation, maintenance, and support of the tested system when deployed in combat. Department of Army Regulation (AR) 73-1 extends this requirement to the independent operational test and evaluation of all programs.</p>
<p>USAYPG test executing centers currently conduct about five (5) percent integrated operational/developmental testing on behalf of ATEC. Although operational and developmental testing serve fundamentally different purposes, they are becoming more structured as unified programs that obtain data from many sources and are seamless throughout the acquisition cycle. This approach results in increased opportunities for the use of common support contracts, data collection and instrumentation for operational and developmental testing, resulting in greater efficiencies and lower costs. However, it also increases the risk of a statutory Organizational Conflicts of Interest (OCI) in a combined developmental/operational environment. It is therefore imperative that ATEC test and evaluation mission support contracts remain OCI-free.</p>
<p>Potential offerors and each of its planned subcontractors shall submit information that allows the Government to advise the offeror about the potential to be viable competitors. This information shall include a statement of qualifications and experience submission as described above. In addition, offerors and each of its planned subcontractors must describe any work performed on Government contracts that would create a potential or actual OCI, and rationale, with supporting information, why the cited development work does not create an OCI. OCI submissions shall include details of the offeror and planned subcontractors, involvement in any DoD system development or support of a system development contractor as either a "Prime" or a "Sub." Submissions shall be limited&nbsp;to no more than 40 pages and must be received by November 28th, 3:00 PM MST. Submissions can be submitted via email to the point of contact identified. <br /><br />Offerors may direct any questions to the point of contact identified.&nbsp;</p>

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION <br />Reconfigurable Hybrid Horizontal Planar Near-Field/Compact Antenna Range
<p>1.0 Description</p>
<p>1.1 The Communications and Intelligent Systems Division of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Glenn Research Center (GRC) is seeking information on how an interested contractor would propose designing a reconfigurable hybrid horizontal planar near-field and compact antenna range. The nominal test frequency range is 1 GHz to 100 GHz and it is desired to accommodate parabolic reflectors up to a diameter of approximately 33 feet (i.e., 10 m) in the near-field facility. The available chamber dimensions are: 80' x 60' x 50'.</p>
<p><br />1.2 THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes - it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. This request for information does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. Further, NASA is not at this time seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals. Responding organizations are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI; all costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested party's expense. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any is issued. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website. It is the responsibility of the potential offerors to monitor these sites for additional information pertaining to this requirement.</p>
<p>2.0 Background</p>
<p>This project is part of a major recapitalization effort under the GRC Master Plan which will allow the consolidation of research spaces across the center into a single, state-of-the-art (SOA) research facility. The Aerospace Communications Facility (ACF) will be comprised of multiple research and development (R&amp;D) laboratories in support of aerospace communications research activities throughout the NASA GRC. These laboratory spaces will be highly reconfigurable, providing the flexibility needed to adapt to pursuit of new technologies and capabilities over the span of several decades. The ACF is visualized as a SOA research facility, featuring Glenn's communications competencies and their partnerships with NASA missions, academia and industry. As such, a prime purpose of the inquiry is to glean key information that would help us design the 80x60 space for the future integration and development of a Hybrid Horizontal Planar Near field/Compact Antenna Range system.</p>
<p><br />3.0 Requested Information</p>
<p>Those organizations responding to this solicitation should provide the following pertinent information:</p>
<p>&#61656; Specific details on implementation approaches of a Reconfigurable Hybrid Horizontal Planar Near-Field/Compact Antenna Range (HPNF/CAR) within the available planned space of 80' x 60' x 50'. GRC currently has a 12' x 10' x 26' compact range with a 6' x 6&lsquo;cross-section blended edge off-set parabolic reflector. The dimensions of the compact range are provided for information purposes and could be changed as needed as part of the process of creating the desired HPNF/CAR facility. <br />&#61656; Technical details of that main space construction that would be key to integrating the HPNF/CAR equipment in it. For example, approximate column loads/weights for foundation design, vibration abatement approaches, thermal/humidity controls, and electrical requirements, among others.<br />&#61656; Configuration arrangements that will allow for the use of either range at a time or the use of both ranges at the same time while maintaining quality and integrity of antenna metrology. For example, for the former while the Horizontal Planar Near Field Range is in use it is conceivable that compact range blended edge antennae could be placed in a &lsquo;bump out' of the main space that could be cordoned off when needed to remove it from the line of sight of the NF.<br />&#61656; Specific power requirements (voltage, amperage, etc.), recommended crane capacity (e.g. overhead bridge crane), lighting requirements, and any shielding or radiofrequency interference/electromagnetic interference (RFI/EMI) noise generation concerns.<br />&#61656; Finally, a typical flow of testing from delivery to setup to testing to tear-down that could provide a sense of door opening sizes, staging areas, etc. in our building design would be desirable.</p>
<p>4.0 Responses</p>
<p>4.1 Interested parties are requested to respond to this RFI with a white paper.</p>
<p>4.2 White papers are due no later than October 21, 2016, 12:00 am PST. Responses shall be limited to 10 pages and submitted via e-mail only to Jason Siewert. Proprietary information, if any, should be minimized and MUST BE CLEARLY MARKED. To aid the Government, please segregate proprietary information. Please be advised that all submissions become Government property and will not be returned.</p>
<p>4.3. Section 1 of the white paper shall provide administrative information, and shall include the following as a minimum:</p>
<p>4.3.1. Name, mailing address, overnight delivery address (if different from mailing address), phone number, fax number, and e-mail of designated point of contact.</p>
<p>4.3.2. Recommended contracting strategy.</p>
<p>4.3.3. Either 1) copies of executed non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) with the contractors supporting NASA's ACF in technical evaluations or 2) a statement that the responding organization will not allow the Government to release its proprietary data to the Government support contractors. In the absence of either of the foregoing, the Government will assume that the responding organization does NOT agree to the release of its submission to Government support contractors.</p>
<p>4.3.4. Business type (large business, small business, small disadvantaged business, 8(a)-certified small disadvantaged business, HUBZone small business, woman-owned small business, very small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business) based upon North American Industry Classification System (NAICS)541712. "Small business concern" means a concern, including its affiliates, that is independently owned and operated, not dominant in the field of operation in which it is bidding on Government contracts, and qualified as a small business under the criteria and size standards in 13 CFR part 121. A small business concern for the purposes of this procurement is generally defined as a business, including its affiliates, averaging no more than 1000 employees. The number of employees of a concern is its average number of persons employed for each pay period over the concern's latest 12 months. Any person on the payroll must be included as one employee regardless of hours worked or temporary status. That is, it is a "head count." The number of employees of a concern in business under 12 months is based on the average for each pay period it has been in business. The responding organizations are cautioned, however, that this is a general description only. Additional standards and conditions apply. Please refer to Federal Acquisition Regulation FAR 19 for additional detailed information on Small Business Size Standards.</p>
<p>4.3.5 The facility security clearance of the offeror.</p>
<p>The number of pages in Section 1 of the white paper shall not be included in the 10-page limitation, i.e., the 10-page limitation applies only to Section 2 of the white paper.</p>
<p>4.4 Section 2 of the white paper shall answer the issues addressed in Section 3 of this RFI and shall be limited to 10 pages.</p>
<p>5.0 Industry Discussions</p>
<p>NASA GRC representatives may or may not choose to meet with potential offerors. Such discussions would only be intended to get further clarification of potential capability to meet the requirements, especially any development and certification risks.</p>
<p>6.0 Questions</p>
<p>Questions regarding this announcement shall be submitted in writing by e-mail to the Contracting Officer, email address. Verbal questions will NOT be accepted. Questions shall NOT contain proprietary or classified information. The Government does not guarantee that questions received after October 21, 2016 will be answered.</p>
<p><br />7.0 Summary</p>
<p>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY to identify sources that can provide Reconfigurable Hybrid Planar Near-Field/Compact Antenna Range. The information provided in the RFI is subject to change and is not binding on the Government. NASA GRC has not made a commitment to procure any of the items discussed, and release of this RFI should not be construed as such a commitment or as authorization to incur cost for which reimbursement would be required or sought. All submissions become Government property and will not be returned.</p>

<DESC><p><br />PRESOLICITATION NOTICE</p>
<p>The National Institute on Aging (NIA), National Institutes of Health (NIH), Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) intends to negotiate under authority of FAR 6.302-1, on a non competitive, sole source basis, with Wake Forest University, entitled "The Women's Health Initiative Memory Study (WHIMS) Suite of Studies". This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, responsible sources may express their interest by submitting a capability statement or proposal. All capability statement/proposals received within fifteen days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. This effort will be for five years.</p>
<p>The WHIMS Suite of Studies is in accordance with the authority 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) as set forth in FAR 6.302-1.</p>
<p><br />The purpose of this contract is to continue prospective follow-ups, including adjudicated diagnostic assessments and cognitive evaluations, of women in the WHIMS-ECHO studies, to provide the scientific community with biostatistical support and infrastructure for analysis of existing and new cognitive and MRI outcomes collected through the WHIMS Suite of Studies, and to provide support for retrieval of WHI biospecimens for investigations of factors related to cognitive and brain aging.</p>
<p>The proposed extension of support for the WHIMS Suite of Studies will provide a unique opportunity to gain further insights into the antecedents of cognitive impairment and resilience in a large sample of the "oldest-old" women who have been followed for 20 years. In addition, the vast array of data and biospecimens available through the ongoing WHI studies will provide an opportunity to elucidate the mechanisms underlying age-related cognitive decline, impairment, and resilience. <br /><br /><br />Wake Forest University is uniquely qualified to conduct these studies as the WHIMS study began at the University with private funding and Wake Forest has developed and maintained the cohorts and procedures in the initial assessment periods. The raw data resulting from the initial contract period of this study under private funding are owned by Wake Forest University and are not publicly available or transferable. These initial data include the information at pre-treatment baseline evaluation (before any hormone or other intervention) that are necessary to examine the earliest risk and protective factors that may be associated with cognitive impairment, including dementia, and cognitive resilience as long as 20 years later. <br /><br />It is not possible for another vendor to perform the follow-on study because the required data collected at study baseline are owned by Wake Forest University and are not transferable. In addition, Wake Forest University has permission to conduct the WHIMS study as an ancillary study to the WHI parent study and obtained informed consent from participants at the initiation of the study. Neither is transferable and a new contractor would have to submit a new request for an ancillary study to WHI and would have to reconsent participants, resulting in a 6 to 9 month delay of the study and added costs.</p>
<p>Additionally, these baseline data will be used to identify risk and protective factors for cognitive decline and impairment more than 20 years later in relation to the HT interventions administered through 2002 and 2004 for combination HT and CEE-Alone, respectively. It is not possible to repeat this study as it is no longer ethical to conduct a large scale study investigating effects of these hormonal treatments on cognition in older postmenopausal hormone therapy because the WHI studies showed that the health risks of these treatments in older women exceeded the benefits. The FDA now recommends HT use for treatment of menopausal symptoms for the shortest possible duration. Thus, the WHIMS study, including data collected under the initial private funding to Wake Forest University, provides a unique opportunity to investigate risk and protective factors on long-term cognitive outcomes within the context of a randomized clinical trial of HT.</p>
<p><br />Background:</p>
<p>The Women's Health Initiative (WHI) randomized clinical trials of hormone therapy (HT) were designed to determine whether HT had beneficial effects on health outcomes, especially cardiovascular health, in postmenopausal women. Women without uteri were randomly assigned to take one daily tablet containing either conjugated equine estrogens (CEE), 0.625 mg (Premarin, Wyeth Pharmaceuticals), or a matching placebo, and women with uteri were randomly assigned to take one daily tablet containing either CEE, 0.625 mg, and medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA), 2.5 mg, (Prempro, Wyeth Pharmaceuticals) or a matching placebo. The WHI Memory Study (WHIMS) was an ancillary study to the WHI and enrolled 7,427 women aged 65 years and older. WHIMS investigated the effects of HT on risk of probable dementia and any cognitive impairment and on changes in global cognition over time. Because WHIMS did not include detailed cognitive assessments of women without cognitive impairment, the WHI Study of Cognitive Aging (WHISCA) was designed as an ancillary study to WHIMS to assess memory and other domain-specific cognitive functions in women free of dementia. WHISCA enrolled 2,305 WHIMS participants at 14 clinical sites on average 3 years after WHI randomization and was conducted under contract number N01-AG-9-2115. The WHI and ancillary WHIMS and WHISCA studies were stopped earlier than planned for both the combination therapy (in 2002) and CEE-Alone (in 2004) because these treatments increased health risks and did not protect against coronary heart disease.</p>
<p>Although study medications were discontinued, follow-up assessments have continued. Contrary to expectations, the WHIMS studies showed that CEE+ MPA versus placebo was associated with a significant increase in risk for probable dementia and mild cognitive impairment (Shumaker, Legault et al. 2003), poorer performance on a measure of global cognition (Rapp, Espeland et al. 2003), and greater verbal memory decline over time (Resnick, Maki et al. 2006). CEE-Alone treatment versus placebo in women with prior hysterectomy was associated with a trend toward increased dementia risk (Shumaker, Legault et al. 2004), significantly poorer performance on a measure of global cognition (Espeland, Rapp et al. 2004), but no significant effects on domain-specific cognitive change over time (Resnick, Espeland et al. 2009). <br /><br />WHIMS-MRI was conducted post-trial in approximately 1,400 WHIMS participants to determine whether potential effects of HT on cerebral ischemic disease could explain the adverse effects of HT on cognitive outcomes. Contrary to expectation, HT was not significantly associated with ischemic lesion burden on MRI (Coker, Hogan et al. 2009), but women who had been randomized to active treatment had smaller total brain, frontal and hippocampal volumes compared with women who had been randomized to placebo (Resnick, Espeland et al. 2009).</p>
<p>In 2008, WHI clinic visits ceased and WHIMS transitioned to an annual telephone-administered cognitive assessment battery (Rapp, Legault et al. 2012) for the WHIMS Epidemiology of Cognitive Health Outcomes (ECHO) study, which remains active and incorporates some components of the WHISCA assessment. In addition to the WHIMS-ECHO continuation, the WHIMS-Y study to test the "window of opportunity" hypothesis was initiated in 2008, using the telephone assessment protocol to evaluate cognition in WHI participants who had been randomized to HT or placebo at age 50-55 but had not previously received cognitive testing. The WHIMS-Y study tested the clinically relevant hypothesis that HT shortly after menopause would confer benefit to cognitive health later in life. The recently published initial results from WHIMS-Y showed neither harm nor benefit of early postmenopausal HT treatment on cognition more than 10 years later (Espeland, Shumaker et al. 2013).</p>
<p>The WHIMS-ECHO and WHIMS-Y studies continue through 2016 (under contract HHSN271201100004C). By the end of the current contract, data collection for WHIMS-Y will be sufficient to address the original scientific questions. It is expected that approximately 2,000 older women in WHIMS-ECHO will remain active in 2016 and that these women will have an average age of 88.2 years.<br /><br /><br />This proposed acquisition was previously publicized under sources sought notices HHS-NIH-NIDA(AG)-RDSS-15-006 and HHS-NIH-NIDA(AG)-SBSS-15-006.</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by the agency. This notice does not commit the Government to award a contract. No collect calls will be accepted. No facsimile transmissions will be accepted.</p>

<DESC>Intent to Sole Source:
<p>Pursuant to the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1)(i), the Contracting Officer may solicit from one source if the Contracting Officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source is reasonably available. The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), Program Support Center (PSC), Acquisition Management Services (AMS) on behalf of PSC, Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) intends to sole source to:</p>
<p>Elsworth Dory Support System<br />6101 Marlin Ln<br />Camp Spring, MD 20748-2513</p>
<p>The Elsworth Dory Support System is uniquely qualified to do this work. The Elsworth Dory Support System formerly supported the Division of Scientific Investigations with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The Elsworth Dory Support System works with large Governmental, private and corporate organizations, Federal, and State decision makers and consortia of community treatment programs and agencies. They help to plan, evaluate, implement and/or improve the delivery of treatment services. The Elsworth Dory Support System's projects have ranged from assisting over 1,000 corporate clients to design, and implement treatment program plans to establish and maintain treatment facilities according to and in compliance with The Narcotic Addict Treatment Act of 1974.</p>
<p>While working with the FDA, they were responsible for all of the activities of the team and responsible for assuring treatment program compliance. The Elsworth Dory Support System is recognized as a primary authority on OTPs and opioid treatment by State and Federal agencies.</p>
<p>Trained in both investigative and compliance methods, the Elsworth Dory Support System has taught the first and every update of courses on compliance with the FDA Narcotic Addict Treatment Act Regulations. They have been a member of the Interagency Narcotics Treatment Policy Review Board and as such are a key resource to Federal Agencies: including SAMHSA, CDC, DVA, DEA, NIDA, ONDCP, DHHS, and FDA. They are National experts in exception and investigational techniques with intensive knowledge of monitoring OTPs to ensure their compliance with Federal and State narcotic regulations. They have exhibited exception skills to influence, mediate and negotiate in sensitive highly controversial areas with Federal, State, public, and private organizations.</p>
<p>The Elsworth Dory Support System investigations led to the landmark precedent case against a Methadone Treatment Program sponsor for violations of the regulations at 42 CFR Part 2. (Detroit-DO Andrew Pettress, et al.)</p>
<p>As a lead member of the Narcotic Treatment Program Team, the Elsworth Dory Support System have routinely guided the team through a myriad of functions to include: (1) review and approval of methadone maintenance, LAAM outpatient and hospital treatment program applications; (2) review and approval of patient exception requests and program updates; (3) maintenance of the National Directory of Approved Narcotic Treatment Programs; (4) Liaison with the Drug Enforcement Agency and State/local Narcotic Treatment Program officials; and (5) enforcement activities, including review of inspection reports, issuance of warning letters, and taking action to withdraw treatment program approval.</p>
<p>The Elsworth Dory Support System is available to do this work immediately. For all of the above reasons, the Elsworth Dory Support System is uniquely and exceptionally qualified for this project. There are no other firms possessing the Elsworth Dory Support Systems unique experience of more than thirty-three years consulting with corporations and Government Agencies on the provision of Narcotic Treatment services, and his experience within government developing and evaluating narcotic treatment compliance programs make them uniquely ideal for this project.</p>
<p>This is not a solicitation for competitive proposal. No solicitation document is available. All responsible sources that have determined that they can provide the same services may submit product information and a capabilities statement addressing their specific abilities regarding this requirement. The email subject line must reference SAM188355. All responses are due by November 29, 2016, 10:00 AM Eastern Time and can be sent to Kevin Ceponis at Kevin.Ceponis@psc.hhs.gov. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract base upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Los Angeles District is soliciting for award of a construction contract to Renovate Overflow Processing Center, Nogales Border Patrol Station, Nogales AZ.
<p>Scope of Work: The Overflow Processing Center (OPC) is located at the Nogales (NGL) Border Patrol Station (BPS) on Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) owned property and is in a 175,003 square foot pre-engineered metal building, called the Warehouse Area. This building is a one-story high-bay structure on the north side of the Administration Area, which also houses general storage along with Detention &amp; Sally Port, and Vehicle Maintenance. Currently the OPC has the capacity to process up to 1,100 Detainees.<br />The objective of the project is to segregate/separate the current OPC from the adjacent functions (sally port, vehicle maintenance, storage, etc.) currently occupying the warehouse, which is required because of the recent need for increased processing at the NGL BPS. To do this, the warehouse will be renovated in two phases.</p>
<p>Phase I will consist of installation of a new HVAC system and the construction of a fire-rated separation wall to segregate/separate the OPC from the adjacent functions. Installation of magnetic locks on detention cell doors will be awarded as an option item, pending available funding. The HVAC system will provide heating, ventilation, and air conditioning for the OPC. Evaporative coolers will also be added to the vehicle maintenance area.</p>
<p>Phase II will consist of installation of a new fire alarm system and modifying the existing fire control systems, upgrading electrical power to the dining area in the OPC, repairing existing HVAC pressurization issues in the detention area, installing exhaust and ventilation in the vehicle maintenance area, repair cross-bracing for structural elements in the warehouse, and upgrading certain existing walls and doors to meet fire protection code.</p>
<p>Phase I will be issued as an 8(a) Set Aside to 8(a) contractors in SBA's Region 9, which include California, Arizona, and Nevada, as a Competitive Request for Proposal (RFP), using BEST VALUE - LOWEST PRICE TECHINICALLY ACCEPTABLE (LPTA) procedures resulting in a firm fixed-price contract. Phase II will be awarded as an 8(a) Sole Source negotiated contract to the awardee of the Phase I, which will also result in a firm fixed-price contract.</p>
<p>Phase I will be based on the best value approach considering technical evaluation factors and price. Both a technical proposal and a price proposal will be required. Evaluation factors may consist of the following:</p>
<p>EXPERIENCE ON SIMILAR CONTRACTS, PAST PERFORMANCE, SPECIALIZED EXPERIENCE (HVAC &amp; FIRE CONTROL), KEY PERSONNEL QUALIFICATIONS AND CONSTRUCTION EXPERIENCE, and SCHEDULE. The aforementioned evaluation factors may not be all inclusive.</p>
<p>There will be one pricing schedule for this project with a Performance Period of 270 days for Phase I and for Phase II approximately 150 days after receipt of Notice to Proceed (NTP). The North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) for this procurement is NAICS code 236220-Commercial and Institutional Building Construction, will be a more appropriate NAICS code for the entire project (Phase I and Phase II), $36,500,000.00 average annual gross revenue for the last three (3) fiscal years.</p>
<p>Estimated cost range for this project for Phase I is between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000 and Phase II is between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000.</p>
<p>The solicitation will be available on or about 28 July 2016 with submittals due on or about 29 August 2016. Solicitation W912PL-16-R-0036 and all amendments for this acquisition will be posted on FedBizOpps (FBO) (www.fbo.gov). THE GOVERNMENT INTENDS TO ISSUE THIS SOLICITATION AND ALL AMENDMENTS THROUGH THE USE OF THE INTERNET (WEB ONLY). No additional media (CD ROMs, Floppy Disks, Faxes, or paper) will be provided unless the Government determines that it is necessary.</p>

The new WEAC facility shall be designed and constructed in accordance with the 2015 International Building Code and the National Institute of Health (NIH) Design Requirements Manual for Biomedical Laboratories and Animal Research Facilities (DRM). The WEAC is a multi-disciplinary, full-service specialty laboratory with capabilities in the areas of medical device/radiation-emitting products testing, radionuclides research, and microbiology analyses. This facility is the FDA's only major laboratory installation to provide services in these specialty areas.

The existing facility no longer meets current program requirements or FDA's updated lab and office standards.</p>
<p>The new building shall provide approximately 75,000 Building Gross Square Feet (BGSF) to house the Engineering Branch; the Radionuclides Branch; and the Bioeffects Branch; support office areas, such as the Director's Office, WEAC headquarters, and shared support areas. Existing site electrical, water, sewer, gas, telecom, and storm drainage are available on or adjacent to the site and shall be provided from points of connection to the new building. The work is located immediately adjacent to and within the site of the occupied existing WEAC facility. Testing and analytical work will be ongoing in the existing facility during the construction of the new WEAC facility. Any impacts to on-going operations must be kept to a minimum and carefully coordinated in advance.</p>
<p>This is not a request for proposals at this time, the solicitation requirements and documents will include instructions for submission and the response date, will be available around December 2016. Neither telephonic, mailed nor faxed requests for hard copies of this solicitation will be accepted. The solicitation will only be available online; in order to download the solicitation offerors must access the Federal Business Opportunities website (www.fbo.gov).

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Technology Acquisition Center (TAC), located at 23 Christopher Way, Eatontown, NJ 07724 intends to exercise Option Period One under Contract VA118-16-C-0834 (attached) for VA Northern Indiana Health Care System at the Fort Wayne Campus in Fort Wayne, IN for brand name Extension Engage software maintenance.  This contract was awarded on April 25, 2016 to Extension Healthcare, 1950 West Cook Road, Suite 101 Fort Wayne, Indiana (IN) 46818 on the basis of other than full and open competition pursuant to authority 41 U.S.C. 3304(a)(1) as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1 entitled,  Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.   The Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition prior to award of this contract is attached.
Due to Government oversight, Option Period 1 was not exercised on or prior to October 01, 2016, which was the Government s intent.  The period of performance for Option Period 1 was from October 01, 2016 through September 30, 2017.  The purpose of this announcement is to notify industry of the Government s intent to exercise Option Period 1 via bilateral modification of contract VA118-16-C-0834 with Extension Healthcare notwithstanding the Government s inadvertent failure to exercise the option in a timely manner.  The foundation of this approach to modify contract VA118-16-C-0834, as opposed to conducting a new procurement, is that only Extension Healthcare can provide the required Extension Engage software maintenance (regardless of the acquisition strategy utilized).  
Any vendor wishing to dispute the Government s intent to exercise Option Period 1 shall provide detailed rationale to Keiahna Brewer, Contract Specialist, Keiahna.Brewer@va.gov and Robert C. Kately, Contracting Officer, Robert.Kately@va.gov no later than November 22, 2016 at 4PM EST.

<CONTACT>Johnny L. Keith , Mr., Email johnny.l.keith.civ@mail.mil
<DESC>The US Army Program Executive Office, Missiles and Space Cruise Missile Defense Systems (CMDS) Project Office is conducting market research to determine if there are potential sources with the capability to provide a high performance modification, designated as the Sentinel A4, for the AN/MPQ-64A3 (Sentinel A3) short range Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD) radar.
<p>Pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.2, this notice is being issued as a REQUEST FOR INFORMATION. In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not an offer and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. No contract award is intended as a result of this request. THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY. This Request for Information is issued solely for information and planning purposes - it does not constitute a Request for Proposal or a promise to issue a Request for Proposal in the future. This request for information does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. The Government will not pay for the information received. The Government Point of Contact (POC) will be Mr. Johnny L. Keith, US Army Contracting Command-Redstone, Attn: CCAM-SM-T, Redstone Arsenal, AL 35898, and can be contacted via e-mail: johnny.l.keith.civ@mail.mil. Mail or Email responses only, no phone calls. The response cut off time is Monday, 2 May 2016 by 1500 CST.</p>
<p>Per FAR 52.215-3, Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes:</p>
<p>a.) The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this solicitation or to otherwise pay for the information solicited except as an allowable cost under other contracts as provided in subsection 31.205-18, bid and proposal costs, of the FAR.</p>
<p>b.) Although "proposed", "proposal", and "offeror" may be used in this Request for Information, your response will be treated as information only. It shall not be used as a proposal.</p>
<p>c.) This solicitation is issued for the purpose of acquiring information to modify or replace the Army's AN/MPQ-64A3 Sentinel A3 radar.</p>
<p>SENTINEL RADAR.</p>
<p>The Sentinel Radar is a major component of the Army IAMD System of Systems architecture, providing a surveillance and fire control capability against low altitude air breathing threats, to include Cruise Missiles (CM), Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS), fixed wing, rotary-wing, and future capabilities against Rocket, Artillery and Mortar (RAM) threats.</p>
<p>Sentinel, currently deployed in its A3 configuration, provides a critical capability for the acquisition, tracking, classification, discrimination, and identification of aerial threats and cueing and track data to support Beyond Line of Site engagements. It provides air coverage in the forward area (Corps, Division, and Brigade sectors) by providing vital information for timely decision making by the commander, and accurate targeting information to the supported weapon systems. Sentinel also tracks friendly UAS and aircraft, providing support for airspace management de-confliction and fires de-confliction. It provides continuous volume surveillance of friendly and hostile aircraft to enhance protection of friendly aircraft from fratricide.</p>
<p>The Sentinel A3 is an X-band, three dimensional, 360&deg; azimuth coverage, phased array air defense radar with a nominal 75 kilometer instrumented range. The system is equipped with Electronic Counter-Counter-Measure (ECCM) capabilities, a Mode 5 Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) subsystem for positive identification of friendly aircraft, and a suite of Non-Cooperative Target Recognition (NCTR) capabilities to identify threat aircraft. Sentinel is mounted on a Family of Medium Tactical Vehicles (FMTV) trailer, pulled by a M1082 FMTV truck hosting a 10 kW tactical generator and the command and control interface. Sentinel interfaces with the IAMD Battle Command system, the Forward Area Air Defense Command and Control (FAAD C2) system, and the National Capital Region Integrated Air Defense command and control system.</p>
<p>In order to ensure meeting its mission requirements and to address future Counter-RAM requirements, CMDS plans to modify the Sentinel A3 radar to an A4 configuration that will employ advanced sensor technologies to improve capabilities and performance. The Sentinel A4 will counter the advancing threat evolution in the short range IAMD mission area. These future threats include reduced signature CM targets, smaller and slower UAS targets, and RAM. The RAM threats include both short range (couple/few km) and longer range (low hundreds of km) large caliber rockets (240mm, 300mm), rockets (107mm, 122mm), artillery (122mm, 152mm), and mortars (60mm, 82mm, 120mm).</p>
<p>SENTINEL A4 REQUIREMENTS. <br /><br />Respondents to this Request for Information (RFI) must satisfactorily address the following requirements in their response:</p>
<p>1. The Sentinel A4 must meet or exceed all current Sentinel A3 requirements contained in the Draft Revised Sentinel A3 Requirements Document. The Sentinel Product Office will make this Requirements Document (DRAFT, classified SECRET) available to potential respondents to this RFI.</p>
<p>2. To counter the new threat, the Sentinel A4 must exceed selected A3 threshold performance requirements. The Sentinel A4 requires a greater than 75% increase in range performance, three times the search volume, and twice the track loading capability. A greater than two times increase in track accuracy is required. Performance is required while operating under very stressing radar environments (e.g., electronic attack; anti-radiation weapons; direction finding sensors; mountain, sea, and urban clutter; biological fliers; etc.).</p>
<p>3. Candidate technical solutions to this RFI must currently be at a demonstrated Technology Readiness Level of six or higher (TRL 6).</p>
<p>4. To support a modification of the current Sentinel A3 to a Sentinel A4 capability, the Sentinel Product Office plans to make available a defined interface to the existing Sentinel A3 Signal Data Processor (SDP) and software, to which a new antenna assembly can be added. This antenna assembly would include advanced technologies (e.g., Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) technology) and interface to the existing SDP. A new antenna assembly will also require new equipment solutions or modifications to the platform, power systems, cooling systems, rotational assembly, and beam steering. The Sentinel Product Office will consider changes to the SDP or a new SDP hardware solution to support a new antenna assembly design. We encourage respondents to suggest alternatives to this approach.</p>
<p>5. Candidate technical solutions must be ready to enter Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD as defined in DoD Instruction 5000.02), without a prior Government funded technology demonstration, in Fiscal Year (FY) 2019. Should an award be made, the selected contractor must be ready to hold a Preliminary Design Review in FY 2020 and must have prototype hardware ready for developmental testing, to include qualification and performance testing, in FY 2021 (28 months following EMD contract award).</p>
<p>6. Candidate technical solutions must address the ability and risks to enter Low Rate Initial Production in FY 2023 and Full Rate Production in FY 2025.</p>
<p>7. Candidate technical solutions must be supported by production facilities and proven processes to deliver up to 30 Sentinel A4 antenna assemblies per year. The Government plans to procure 199 antenna assemblies through FY 2032.</p>
<p>8. Candidate technical solutions must include a cost-effective 20-year sustainment plan for the 199 radars that includes Government organic support.</p>
<p>9. The desired Sentinel A4 technology is primarily for United States employment but must have a variant that can be approved for Foreign Military Sales (FMS) to existing and new Sentinel FMS customers.</p>
<p>10. Candidate technical solutions must be supported by current demonstrated company experience with advanced X-Band radars.<br />11. Candidate technical solutions must demonstrate that the resulting Sentinel A4 can be produced and sustained in a cost-effective manner.</p>

<DESC>INTRODUCTION<br />This is a Small Business Sources Sought (SBSS) notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.<br /> <br />This notice is issued to help determine the availability and type of qualified Small Business companies technically capable of meeting this potential government requirement and to determine the method of acquisition. It is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract.   Responses will not be considered as proposals or quotes. No award will be made as a result of this notice. The Government will NOT be responsible for any costs incurred by the respondents to this notice.  The notice is strictly for research and information purposes only.
<p>The information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method including small business socio-economic set-aside possibilities and to determine the availability of qualified Small Business companies technically capable of meeting the Government's potential requirement.  All Small Business companies with the capability and availability to perform the requirement under the applicable NAICS code are invited to submit a response to this notice.</p>
<p>NORTH AMERICAN CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM (NAICS) CODE<br />The NAICS code applicable to this requirement is  541990 -- All Other Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services with associated business size standard $15,000,000.00.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND<br />The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) is one of 27 Institute Centers at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) committed to making important discoveries that improve health and save lives. NIMH is the lead federal agency for research on mental disorders. The mission of NIMH is to transform the understanding and treatment of mental illnesses through basic and clinical research, paving the way for prevention, recovery, and cure.</p>
<p>The Section on Neuroadaptation &amp; Protein Metabolism (SNPM) at the NIMH studies the role of protein metabolism in adaptive responses of the nervous system. Long-term changes in the nervous system occur during development and aging, in response to synaptic activity and hormones, and as a result of disease or injury. These changes produce regional adjustments in protein metabolism that underlie growth, remodeling, degeneration, regeneration, and involution. SNPM has developed imaging methods for measuring rates of synthesis of proteins in all regions of the brain simultaneously. These methods can be applied to studies of both animals and human subjects. Measurements of protein synthesis can give a unique window into the normal adaptive responses of nervous tissue and may provide a means of monitoring both disease progression and treatment response.</p>
<p>PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES<br />The purpose of this potential requirement is for SNPM to obtain contractor support to provide data analysis services for the Section's positron emission tomography (PET) and quantitative auto-radiographic studies. Contractor shall provide data analyses for determining regional rates of Cerebral Protein Synthesis (rCPS) with the C-11 Leucine PET Method and the C 14 Leucine Quantitative Auto-radiographic Method.</p>
<p>The SNPM developed a fully quantitative method for measuring rCPS with L-[1-11C]leucine and PET.  The method was validated in rhesus monkeys by direct comparison of PET results with those from quantitative auto-radiographic and biochemical methods.  Subsequently, SNPM performed PET studies to measure rCPS in healthy human subjects in the awake state and under propofol sedation and in subjects with Fragile X Syndrome. The section will conduct further PET studies in healthy subjects during sleep and memory consolidation, and in FrX subjects who can be studied awake or under an alternative sedating agent that does not alter rCPS in these subjects.</p>
<p>PROJECT REQUIREMENTS<br />Offerors to this Small Business Sources Sought notice MUST document evidence of being able to achieve the following critical elements of this potential requirement. Offerors shall specify the sensitivity, reproducibility, and throughput factors, and any other qualifications the Offeror deems applicable, for PET and Quantitative data analysis of rCPS for auto-radiographic studies.</p>
<p>Contractors submitting a response to this Small Business Sources Sought notice shall possess the ability to achieve the salient government features of this potential requirement. Specifically, Offerors shall possess the ability to successfully perform the following, for each PET or auto-radiographic study, data analyses to include:</p>
<p>1. Evaluation of measured input functions, including smoothing and/or error-correction as necessary.</p>
<p>2. Estimation of arterial input functions from venous blood measurements.</p>
<p>3. Transformation of PET data to align with MRI data, and inverse transformation of MRI data to align with PET data as necessary.</p>
<p>4. Calculation of tissue time-activity curves (PET studies) or final tissue activity (auto-radiographic studies) for all regions of interest to the PI.  Performance of data quality control, including examination of possible motion artifacts, coordination of additional reconstructions of the data if errors are found, performance of smoothing and/or error-correction as necessary.</p>
<p>5. Employment of the C-11 or C-14 Leucine Tracer Kinetic Model to estimate model parameters for the tracer in each region.  Troubleshooting and correction of any problems that arise from ill-conditioned or outlier data.</p>
<p>6. Determination of rCPS for all regions of interest.</p>
<p>7. Updating Matlab software used for determining rates of cerebral protein synthesis with L [1-11C]leucine and positron emission tomography; performing additional analyses to include interconnected software of more than 500 Matlab scripts and functions that carry out all calculations; modifying the software to incorporate changes in data acquisition and/or analysis requirements; implementing input and instructions with thorough knowledge of the L-[1-11C]leucine method in order to set it up correctly; identifying and correcting any source of errors that arise during the analyses.</p>
<p>Contractor will also be required to provide on an as needed basis the following tasks:</p>
<p>1. Advise Government officials on optimal methods of analysis independently performing the requisite analyses.</p>
<p>2. Respond to questions from any government laboratory personnel with the necessary mathematical and computational background who wish to perform analyses for future studies.</p>
<p>3. The contractor will furnish all necessary labor, material, supplies, and equipment other than a computer workstation that will be provided by the Government.</p>
<p>4. Data reports for each PET or auto-radiographic study analyzed.  As each study is completed, the contractor will provide an interim summary report covering all subjects or animals in the protocol. A final summary report will be delivered upon completion of all studies in the protocol.</p>
<p>All work will be monitored by the Government Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) or delegated official.</p>
<p>Period of Performance: The anticipated period of performance for this potential requirement will be effective on or around February 10, 2017 through February 9, 2018 with the option to exercise two (2) additional subsequent one-year Periods of Performance.</p>

<DESC>THIS SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE IS FOR MARKET RESEARCH AND PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY. IT DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A SOLICITATION AND SHALL NOT BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT TO AWARD A CONTRACT FROM RESPONSES TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. ANY INFORMATION SUBMITTED BY INTERESTED PARTIES IS STRICTLY VOLUNTARY AND NO MONETARY COMPENSATION WILL BE PROVIDED FOR RESPONSE PREPARATION.
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA), Washington DC, is seeking information from potential sources able to provide engineering and technical services to support the U.S. Navy's Surface Ship Maintenance, Repair and Modernization (SSMRM) requirements. The results of this Sources Sought will be utilized to determine whether any Small Business set-aside opportunities exist. All Small Business set-aside categories will be considered. In accordance with FAR 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting, Small Businesses concerns are reminded that in the performance of contracts awarded under small business set-aside procedures, at least 50 percent of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the concern.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>PMS 505, Fleet Introduction and Sustainment, is responsible for the life-cycle management of Littoral Combat Ships in the US Navy. In-service life cycle support of these ships comprises: integrated planning, programming, and execution of the maintenance; repair and modernization, and the provision of all technical and logistics support required to maintain, repair, modernize, and improve performance of these ships.</p>
<p>PMS 505 is evolving its surface ship modernization and maintenance/repair contracting strategy to implement a "family" of contracts that will maximize competition and the use of fixed price type contracts across the spectrum of surface ship availabilities. This strategy will leverage multiple types of contracts "right-sized" to best complete each type of ship availability, reflecting the specifics of the volume of work for each class and the industrial base in each port. This approach is intended to improve cost, schedule and quality while maintaining flexibility and responsiveness to the Fleet.</p>
<p>Specific engineering and technical requirements that are covered under this Sources Sought notice include, but are not limited to: General Requirements, Availability Planning Support, Availability Execution Support, Availability Assessment Execution, Integrated Logistic Support (ILS), Special Projects and Long Lead Time Material (LLTM). A draft Performance Work Statement (PWS) with specific details is provided as an attachment to this notice.</p>
<p>ACQUISITION STRATEGY</p>
<p>The Government is contemplating procuring this effort under one (1) Class applicable Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) Level of Effort (LOE) contract, with a contract duration of one (1) 12-month base year and four 12-month option years.</p>
<p>The contract size is estimated by total planned product (or depot level work item) development volume. This volume is defined by work items that typically support Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) type availability planning, and work items that support Continuous Maintenance (CM), Window Of Opportunity (WOO), and Emergent Availability planning.</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE ONLY for market research purposes to identify interested vendors for the potential requirement detailed below. A formal solicitation and performance work statement are not available. Additionally, in accordance with FAR 19.5, Set-Asides for Small Business, the Government will review the information requested in this announcement to determine the type of set-aside (if any) for this requirement, should it come to fruition.

The US Geological Survey (USGS) has a potential need for genetic analyses using single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) developed using regionally standardized baseline data sets that are the current recovery program protocols, with species validation and parentage assessment using microsatellite DNA genotyping at 19 loci. Our mission is engaged in cooperative studies to aid in the recovery of the endangered pallid sturgeon. Free-embryo and larval stages of pallid sturgeon are being collected below known spawning sites and at fixed locations on the Yellowstone River.  Collected specimens must be separated from other sympatric species of sturgeons and paddlefish, and identified to species.  In the case of specimens collected at known spawning sites and identified as pallid sturgeon, the DNA of the specimen must be compared to known (previously genotyped) adults to assess parentage and purity. 

The accurate identification of pallid sturgeon larvae and assignment of individual specimens to specific known parents requires complex genetic procedures which include, but are not limited to: DNA isolation, DNA purification, DNA sequencing, microsatellite analysis, and amplification of microsatellite loci via the polymerase chain reaction, automated DNA sequencing, multi-locus genotype data generation, and genotype analysis.  The analysis requires expertise and experience with pallid sturgeon genetics and hybridization with closely related species.  The interpretation of the data requires a readily available standardized baseline data set to perform accurate identification, account for regional variability, and to assign parentage of individuals to known parents.


The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541711 and the size standard is $15 million. There is no incumbent contractor. 

All business concerns who believe they can responsibly perform this requirement should submit the following information to the contracting officer no later than 4PM EST Wednesday November 30, 2016:

1.	Capability statement describing corporate expertise and technical qualifications in the work described above.
2.	Past performance information describing other contracts for similar services your company has been awarded. Past performance information should be submitted for projects conducted within the last three years and include: project title, location, whether the work was as a prime or subcontractor, contract/subcontract dollar value, type of contract, percentage of self-performed work, and overall performance rating received. 
3.	Small business status of vendor (8(a), HUBZone, SDVOSB, etc.)
4.	Point of contact information for vendor, Cage Code, and D&B Number.
5.	Any other information that will prove the vendor is capable of performing the required effort.

Submissions should be emailed Beth Wilson, Contracting Specialist at bwilson@usgs.gov. Responses should be limited to 10 pages (single-sided). 

NOTE: All information submitted in response to this announcement is voluntary - the Government will not pay for information requested nor will it compensate any respondent for any cost incurred in developing information provided to the Government. Materials submitted to the Government for review will not be returned. Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation. This is not a request for proposals. The Government does not intend to award a contract based on responses received under this announcement. 

All questions and concerns may be submitted to the contracting officer via email only at bwilson@usgs.gov.

Portions of the ground grid may be removed or replaced as necessary to facilitate the improvements and to meet IEEE design requirements for minimum depth. Demolition and potential removal of numerous piers will also be required. High voltage power line relocation and replacement of the exterior perimeter fence may be performed. Currently, the location of the Garrison Generator Yard no longer has positive drainage toward the perimeter of the yard, resulting in water ponding. Ponding of water is a reoccurring problem in the generator yard and is causing a safety hazard at the Garrison Dam. In addition, the water extends through the aggregate to subgrade level and the effective depth of the ponded water is greater than what is observed from the surface. The standing water and saturated soils are causing numerous problems to include but not limited to: accessibility of loaded machinery, degradation of the grounding materials, and durability of the ground mat.<br />Interested parties are requested to provide the information below in response to this synopsis.<br />CAPABILITY/EXPERIENCE: <br />1. Offeror/Contractor's name, address, point of contact, phone number, and email address.</p>
<p>2. Provide your firm's business size: Large Business or Small Business (HUBZone, Service Disabled Veteran Owned, 8(a), small disadvantaged, or woman-owned) with regards to the NAICS code 237990.</p>
<p>3. Cage Code and DUNS number.</p>
<p>4. Experience:</p>
<p>a. Working on large civil/site work projects.</p>
<p>b. Performing similar projects in the vicinity of high voltage power supply, including switchyard.</p>

The intent of this Sources Sought Notice is to identify potential vendors that would be interested and capable of providing a pool (at least three) of Internal Medicine and/or Family Practice Physicians to provide services on an  AS NEEDED  basis at the FHCC and/or any of its three Community Based Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs)   Evanston CBOC, Kenosha CBOC, and McHenry CBOC. These CBOCs are located at 1942 Dempster Street in Evanston, IL 60202; 8207 22nd Avenue, Suite 150 in Kenosha, WI 53143; and 3715 Municipal Dr in McHenry, IL 60050, respectively. 
When the need for Physician Services at the FHCC arises, which will typically be to cover vacancies within the Patient Aligned Care Team (PACT), the required period of performance will range from 2 to 32 consecutive weeks. The required duty hours are Monday through Friday from 8:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. The FHCC will not require weekends, after normal duty hours, or Federal Holidays.
It is the intent of the FHCC to establish two-year Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPA) with multiple vendors in accordance with FAR 13.303.

A BPA contains (1) the terms and conditions applying to future orders between the parties during the term of the BPA, (2) a description of the services to be provided, (3) pricing, and (4) methods for issuing and accepting future orders under the BPA. The establishment of a BPA does not obligate any funds or guarantee or imply that any orders for services will be placed.
Upon establishment of the BPA, each identified physician in the pool shall undergo a mandatory Access National Agency Check and Inquires (ANACI) Background Investigation (BI). Concurrently with the BI, the FHCC will conduct the credentialing and privileging process.  Physicians cannot perform any services at the FHCC prior to being both successfully adjudicated and granted privileges. The current fees associated with the ANACI background investigations are $645.00 per individual.
This Sources Sought Notice is for market research purposes only and shall not be considered as a request for quote or as an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any services. No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of the contractor submission of this Sources Sought Notice or the Government's use of such information. The Government reserves the right to reject, in whole or in part, any contractor's input resulting from this Sources Sought Notice. No contractual arrangement will be made as a result of this announcement. Information submitted in response to this Sources Sought Notice will not be returned.

Provide CVs for all physicians identified on the list above.
Provide a brief description of the company background, capabilities relating to this requirement, socioeconomic status, past performance with Government contracts, and contractor DUNS number.

<DESC>This special notice is a Synopsis of a Proposed Contract Action in accordance with the requirements of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 5.2 as the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available. Accordingly, the Government intends to solicit from a single source for a commercial service purchase not estimated to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold in accordance with the authority at FAR 13.106-1(b)(1).
<p>The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) / Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) / Preparedness Section on behalf of the Emergency Management Institute (EMI), located at the National Emergency Training Center (NETC), intends to&nbsp;contract on a sole source basis with the American Council on Education (ACE), located at One DuPont Circle, N.W., Washington, DC 20036. DHS / FEMA intends shortly after the expiration of this special notice to issue a non-competitive award with a period of performance that is estimated to be twelve (12) months from the date of award.</p>
<p>The purpose of the contemplated award is for ACE to review and evaluate the content of numerous NETC / EMI offered courses and for the subsequent college credit equivalency recommendations of those courses for vocational, associate, baccalaureate, and graduate credit. As ACE publishes and maintains for students' reference The National Guide to College Credit for Workforce Training, the award shall also cover the maintenance and listing therein of all EMI courses that have ever received an ACE college credit equivalency recommendation.</p>
<p>Market Research has determined that ACE is the only source reasonably available due to ACE being uniquely positioned to assist an EMI objective of furthering the professionalism of the emergency management field as the ACE College Credit Recommendation Service (CREDIT) College and University Network consists of approximately 2,000 higher educational institutions that consider ACE credit recommendations. As such, an ACE review and evaluation of NETC / EMI courses provides NETC / EMI students with the broadest opportunity to use EMI courses as credit toward their educational goals in emergency management related degrees and only serves to increase the number and quality of emergency management related personnel to respond to emergencies in their communities.</p>
<p>This special notice is not a request for competitive quotes and no solicitation document yet exists for this requirement. All parties interested in receiving the subsequent solicitation, which will not be made available through the Governmentwide point of entry (GPE), shall respond to this notice and:<br /><br />1) Include information on the proposed services that clearly supports the above described requirements;<br />&nbsp;<br />2) Fully explain your capabilities and qualifications by submitting a detailed capability statement that at a minimum must demonstrate the following: <br />&#61607;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A comparable United States nationwide College and University network base (i.e. approximately 2,000 higher education institutions) that currently considers the Contractor's credit recommendations for transfer to degree programs.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; A comparable existence of relationships with United States educational organizations and related associations (i.e. approximately 1,800) whereby the Contractor represents and is supported by them in aggregate concerning higher education policies and issues. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; The capability to publish and maintain an Online Guide that is publicly accessible and provides a current listing of all NETC courses that have received credit recommendations. This Guide must include course information for each course; i.e., course name, course code, length of course, course description, objective, learning outcome, credit recommendation.<br />&#61607; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; The capability to make award credit recommendations in various categories i.e. vocational, associate, baccalaureate, graduate and evidence these recommendations have been accepted by the Contractor's College and University network base. <br />&#61607; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; The capability to immediately provide an electronic transcript service as well as paper format transcripts, both of which can be sent to the NETC student's requested college or university.<br />&#61607; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Acceptance of the credit recommendation given to NETC courses that were previously reviewed and recommended by another organization (ACE).</p>

<DESC>WL GORE TISSUE
CONSIGNMENT AGREEMENT FOR VISN6
This request for information (RFI) is posted for market research purposes.  It is a solicitation for sources interested in a consignment agreement to provide WL GORE TISSUE.
The Department of Veterans Affairs Mid-Atlantic Health Care Network Veterans Integrated Service Network (VISN6) is seeking Contractors that can supply consignment inventory of WL GORE TISSUE, in various styles, sizes, and diameters for clinicians providing medical care throughout the VISN 6 Medical Centers. VA attending physicians have the responsibility for determining which products to use and which will best meet the individual patient's medical needs.

VISN6 intends to award an IDC Consignment Agreement to fulfill this requirement.

SPECIFICATIONS
Any subsequent solicitation will include (but is not limited to) the following requirements:
The base contract period for this consignment agreement will be for one year, with four unilateral one-year option periods that may be exercised by the individual medical centers providing this care in VISN 6. The effective date of the consignment shall be 30 days (or sooner upon mutual agreement) after the date of award

Contractor will coordinate with medical center Point of Contact (POC s) and have the requested items stocked at the medical facility. Delivery of products shall be made to the individual VAMCs, at no cost to the Government.

The Government is obligated only to the extent if and when use of the item is made by the Government; except as provided otherwise.  Unused (unopened and undamaged) items shall be returned to the Contractor at the end of the effective period of the agreement, without reimbursement or other expense to the Government

 The term  Products  as used herein shall mean all medical devices which are owned by THE CONTRACTOR but located on Customer s premises (or within customer s control). Each Medical Center is responsible for storing the product to use as indicated by the product s labeling.  Once used, the Medical Center orders a replacement, and is invoiced at the agreed upon price for the replacement product. 
NOTE: The individual Medical Centers will have the responsibility for determining the product(s) that will be utilized from the entire product line.  If a Medical Center determines that a patient s circumstance warrants use of a product that is unavailable from the Contractor product line, the Medical Center will be free to use another contract or if needed, a non-contract source to meet the particular need.
 
The contractor will be required to provide a quarterly report of sales by line item, no later than 15 calendar days after the end of each calendar quarter ending March, June, September and December. The report shall include, but not be limited to, name of the VAMC where implantation is performed, date of implantation, description of item sold, model and serial number of the implanted items, price of each item.  Reports shall be sent electronically to the designated Contracting Officer Representative (COR) responsible for the Consignment Agreement.
Each medical center decides which products best meet the needs of the facility taking into account the contractor s ability to provide service and the physician s medical determination as to which products will best meet the needs of his/her patients. Upon selection of contractor(s), the medical center will provide written notice of its intent to use the contract and its requirements.  Medical centers may change contractors at any time or use more than one contractor. All changes must be approved by the Contracting Officer.

The contractors shall provide an efficient delivery system for the use of a  Consignment Agreement . The delivery system is to meet the needs of medical centers that perform occasional procedures and/or the needs of those that perform significant number of implant procedures.  After award, the Medical Centers will inform the contractor of the chosen method of delivery. Normal delivery will be within two (2) business days. In emergency situations, the contractor must be capable of delivering within a few hours on the same day as per the facility s needs and instructions.  The Government will pay the difference between Normal and Urgent/Emergency freight charges. The implants shall arrive pre-sterilized.  Orders must be received and delivered seven days per week in these situations. All intraocular lenses delivered to VAMC s shall be accompanied by a complete inventory listing to include lot numbers and expiration dates. 

The contractor shall deliver the product pre-sterilized. When required, the POC, or his or her designate, will call up a contractor s field representative and inform him or her of the requirement for an emergency shipment to replace a shortage of supplies under consignment.

The title of all products furnished under this agreement shall remain with the Contractor until such time as said item(s) are used by the Government.  

 A typical acceptable initial inventory will include varying levels of inventory of different types of implants depending on the needs of the individual facility.  Initial consignment inventory shall be placed in the medical center within 15 calendar days after receipt of the fully executed Agreement. Inventory will be placed in a location designated by the individual Medical Centers Staff. The Medical Centers will provide adequate space/shelving for the consignment items.

VISN6 intends to award an IDC Consignment Agreement to fulfill this requirement.

SPECIFICATIONS
Any subsequent solicitation will include (but is not limited to) the following requirements:
The base contract period for this consignment agreement will be for one year, with four unilateral one-year option periods that may be exercised by the individual medical centers providing this care in VISN 6.

Each Medical Center is responsible for storing the product to use as indicated by the product s labeling.  Once used, the Medical Center orders a replacement, and is invoiced at the agreed upon price for the replacement product. 
NOTE: The individual Medical Centers will have the responsibility for determining the product(s) that will be utilized from the entire product line.

<SUBJECT>Innovation Crossroads: Business Mentoring Services for Energy Technology Innovation
<SOLNBR>ORNL-IC-2016-11
<RESPDATE>011517
<CONTACT>Tom Rogers, Director, Industrial & Economic Development Partnerships, Email rogerstc@ornl.gov - Beth Conerty, Project Manager, Entrepreneurship , Email conertyba@ornl.gov
<DESC><strong>Background</strong>
<p>The U.S. and the world require new approaches to energy that are reliable, affordable, and carbon neutral.  While important progress has been made in cost reduction and deployment of clean energy technologies, the pace of innovation and the scale of transformation and dissemination remains significantly short of what is needed.</p>
<p>Innovation Crossroads was established by the U.S. Department of Energy's Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) to provide entrepreneurs with a unique support system to enable them to transform their early stage ideas into scalable companies that can address solutions in clean energy. This is not an easy journey. It usually requires extensive R&amp;D work and the development of business models, partners, and financing mechanisms, often simultaneously. Through an annual call, Innovation Crossroads will select up to five energy innovators to explore their ideas at ORNL, providing the resources they need to address these challenges.  With up to two years of funding from ORNL and DOE's Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, innovators will have the opportunity to focus full-time on their energy idea, on R&amp;D collaborations with top ORNL researchers, on entrepreneurial training and mentoring, and on introductions to potential industry partners and investors.</p>
<p>ORNL is the US Department of Energy's largest science and energy laboratory. With an annual budget of $1.5 billion, ORNL's diverse capabilities enable the lab to explore fundamental science challenges and to carry out the research needed to accelerate the delivery of solutions to the marketplace. From energy-efficient buildings, transportation, and manufacturing to new biofuels, bioproducts, and materials, ORNL delivers technology solutions for the nation's growing energy demands. With access to one-of-a-kind resources and facilities, selected Innovation Crossroads innovators will be uniquely positioned to advance their transformative energy ideas. <br /> <br />This solicitation seeks responses from qualified entities who desire to partner with Innovation Crossroads by providing business mentoring to selected technology innovators.  Although selected respondents are not guaranteed the opportunity to work with an energy innovator, selected respondents may be identified as preferred mentors in the Innovation Crossroads program.</p>
<p><strong>Opportunity</strong></p>
<p>Oak Ridge National Laboratory believes that the impact of Innovation Crossroads is maximized via a public-private partnership. The public- private partnership model provides an opportunity for a private sector partner to play an active role in transforming the nation's energy systems. ORNL is seeking one or more business mentor partners to expand the scope and impact of Innovation Crossroads. In particular, ORNL seeks one or more non-profit entities that can:</p>
<p>&bull; Provide key business mentorship and venture development services in areas that will enhance the impact of the program and success of selected technology innovators, e.g. assistance with company formation, business development assistance and guidance, community and network development, investor advising, customer discovery, techno-economic analysis, etc.;<br />&bull; Support administration of compliance requirements for selected technology innovators who lack infrastructure and require business support at the earliest stages;<br />&bull; Work closely with technology innovators in their efforts to attract private sector funding and engagement.</p>
<p><strong>Nature of the Partnership</strong></p>
<p>No Department of Energy or Oak Ridge National Laboratory funds are being offered for services provided under this agreement.</p>
<p>Selected business mentor partners will benefit from the ability to visibly impact the region by supporting domestic technology innovators in the physical sciences/energy domain.  Selected technology innovators will benefit from the experience of Oak Ridge National Lab, as well as potential federal funding to develop their technology.</p>
<p>ORNL may engage with the mentor partner in any or all of the following ways:</p>
<p>&bull; coordinating service offerings to the program and mentorship to Innovation Crossroads technology innovators; and<br />&bull; providing the mentor partner appropriate access to Oak Ridge National Laboratory resources and facilities as required for the partnership.</p>
<p>Respondents may propose a preferred partnership structure. ORNL may consider one or more mechanisms through which to formalize the partnership. Examples include listing on a preferred service provider list and a Memorandum of Understanding.</p>
<p>Any work in connection with Innovation Crossroads must comply with ORNL's Prime Contract, as well as applicable policies - including those pertaining to the avoidance of apparent or actual conflicts of interest.  Entities affiliated with Oak Ridge National Lab, and its operator UT-Battelle LLC are eligible to apply.  However, any selected entity may be subject to an organizational conflict of interest (OCI) management plan.  If a selected entity raises apparent or actual conflicts of interests, for example entities associated with Oak Ridge National Lab or its operator UT-Battelle LLC, there will be an organizational conflict of interest (OCI) management plan developed and approved by the DOE for their participation.  If the OCI issues cannot be effectively mitigated to the satisfaction of the DOE, the selected entity will not be able to participate as a business mentor in the Innovation Crossroads program.</p>
<p><strong>Requirements for Respondents</strong></p>
<p>1. Must be a domestic, tax-exempt 501(c)(3) non-profit organization;<br />2. Must demonstrate significant experience in supporting physical-science or energy-based technology innovators using objective measures, such as amount of funding raised by mentored technology innovators, growth in revenue, growth in sales, etc.;<br />3. Must include team member(s) with demonstrated ability and/or successful experience in working with large institutional research organizations; <br />4. May not charge the technology innovators for mentoring services as part of the Innovation Crossroads program.</p>
<p>Technology innovators participating in the Innovation Crossroads program will be encouraged to work with selected business mentorship organizations to provide the technology innovator with commercialization and business support service to help expedite commercialization of their technologies.  Subject to the limitations below, the relationship and/or agreement between an innovator and a business mentorship organization shall be independently negotiated between those entities. Innovation Crossroads technology innovators will not be required to use any particular mentorship organization to be a part of the program, and no mentorship organizations will have an exclusive relationship with ORNL or with individual innovators.</p>
<p><strong>Additional Evaluation Criteria </strong></p>
<p>Applicants will be evaluated based on their commitment to and experience with mentoring and fostering successful science and technology-based innovators through entrepreneurial mentorship programming.  Applicants will also be evaluated by the following criteria:</p>
<p>&bull; Demonstrated experience in the mentoring and fostering success of science and technology-based innovators;<br />&bull; Experience in the selection and evaluation of business proposals by startups with physical hardware technologies;<br />&bull; Experience in the scientific evaluation of the efficacy and potential impact of energy technologies;<br />&bull; Capabilities to provide business advice to science and technology-based innovators; <br />&bull; Demonstrated ability to maintain positive working relationships with large R&amp;D institutions;<br />&bull; A proactive approach to managing individual and institutional conflicts of interest; and<br />&bull; Must be structured to provide close interactions with technology innovators at Oak Ridge National Laboratory.</p>
<p>All respondents will be reviewed by Oak Ridge National Laboratory, and must be selected by a Federal Official from DOE's Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE).</p>
<p><strong>How to Respond</strong></p>
<p>Submit the following documents to Tom Rogers of Oak Ridge National Laboratory by January 15, 2017:</p>
<p>&bull; Executive summary (2-page maximum)<br />&bull; Description of the proposed partnership structure addressing roles and responsibilities of both the public and private side of the partnership including:</p>
<p>o the structure of the public-private partnership with Oak Ridge National Laboratory addressing the requirements described in this notice,<br />o services to be made available to Innovation Crossroads technology innovators,<br />o a description of how the mentor partner's resources and services complement innovation services at Oak Ridge National Laboratory,<br />o Statement of Qualifications, including resumes of proposed team members<br />o Demonstration of sufficient non-DOE funds available on an on-going basis to provide the support services and the proposed partnership or a plan for obtaining such funds<br />o Timeline for implementation</p>

<a href="mailto:kelly.gustafson@navy.mil">Contract Specialist</a>
<DESC>This synopsis is for a proposed contract modification to increase funding to Contract N00039-16-C-0073  The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWAR), on behalf of the Navy Enterprise Networks (NEN) PMW-205, intends to issue a modification to contract N00039-16-C-0073.  The original J&A No. 17,827 provided for one base year and four options years. The contract was awarded to Ridgewood Technology Partners, LLC of Reston, VA 20191 on 03 June 2016 as a Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF). The contract had one 12-month base year and one 12-month Option Year.  This synopsis is for a proposed contract action to modify contract N00039-16-C-0073 by adding the additional three option years.  Justification to procure using other than full and open competition is made pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements. This synopsis is for the anticipated engineering and maintenance services from Ridgewood Technology Partners, LLC for the COMPASS software tool. The intent of the modification is to incorporate three option years to the contract for services in the sustainment of the front-end user interface: Program Management, Software Engineering, Software Testing, Implementation and Integration Support, and User Training.  Each option year will provide for engineering and maintenance labor hours, as well as the annual renewal of the COMPASS software license. The estimated performance completion date is 02 June 2021; should the Government wish to exercise all option years.  The estimated value for the contract modification is $8,939,580.48.  Ridgewood is the developer, capability architect, and engineer/designer of the analytical engine known as COMPASS, and is the only source able to provide the IT service-specific engineering and maintenance to the web based application front-end user tool known as the Business and Market Intelligence (BMI) Planning Tool that supports the NGEN System Program Office.  The COMPASS tool consists of a front-end user interface and a back-end logic engine. Ridgewood has restricted rights to the back-end logic engine (COMPASS), and the front-end user interface (BMI) is dependent upon the back-end. The Government determined that competing the back-end logic engine would most likely result in compatibility issues with the already developed front-end (BMI). Front-end technology consists of the User Interface functionality of the COMPASS software, including user experience, static workflow, user interface logic, and user screens.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals or a solicitation of offers. However, all expressions of interest received within 15 days after the date of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. Any submissions will not be reimbursed by the Government and the entire costs of any submission will be at the sole expense of the source submitting the information. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. This synopsis is for informational purposes only. Any expression of interest shall be submitted to Kelly Gustafson, Contract Specialist, at Kelly.Gustafson@navy.mil.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 541512.  Contracting Office Address: 4301 Pacific Highway Bldg OT4 Code 2.0, San Diego, CA 92110-3127  Place of Performance Address: 1325 10th Street SW, Suite 301, Washington, DC 20374  Points of Contact: Kim Reavis, Contracting Officer, Kim.Reavis@navy.mil Kelly Gustafson, Contract Specialist, Kelly.Gustafson@navy.mil

Presentations will be provided on future USACE Israel FMS construction Best Value contracts and the existing FY15 Israel Multiple Award Task Order Contract (MATOC).</p>
<p>The objective of the industry days is to provide information to interested United States construction contractors and architect engineer firms on the general scope of USACE design build and design bid build projects within Israel; typical infrastructure and facilities being procured; potential repair, maintenance and construction opportunities to support MoD facilities in Israel; as well as information on the solicitation and proposal process for best value and the FY15 Israel MATOC. All briefings will be presented in English with no translations.</p>
<p>Currently the Israel FMS Construction Program has $400,000,000 in on-going construction projects and $165,000,000 in Pre-award actions. The Program projects six (6) to ten (10) Best Value acquisitions ranging from $15M to $250M and approximately thirty (30) $1M to $15M additional task orders on the FY15 Israel MATOC over the next 2 years.</p>
<p>The FY15 Israel MATOC permits bringing on additional United States Contractor(s) under the On-Ramp procedures as planned for in the original Indefinite Deliver Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Solicitation W012GB-14-R-0030. Solicitation W912GB-17-R-0002 will be posted on FedBizOpps immediately after the completion of the Industry Days to solicit interested Contractors to submit Best Value proposals.</p>
<p>The FY15 Israel MATOC is a $249.5M construction IDIQ with a base year ($49.9M) and four (4) option years ($49.9M each). Six (6) contracts were awarded on 18 Jun 2015. The contracts are currently in Option Year 1 with Option Year 2 to be exercised in Jun 2017. The number of current active contracts is five (5). The On-Ramp procedures as provided in the initial solicitation and contracts awarded are:</p>
<p>"The Government reserves the right to re-open competition at any time during the term of the contract. The KO intends to periodically review the need for additional Contractors during the contract period of performance (PoP). If it is determined to be in the Government's best interest to add Contractors, an on-ramp may be executed. When an on-ramp is used, the Government will advertise the reopening of the competition on FedBizOpps. All new awardees shall meet the criteria established in the initial solicitation. The evaluation and selection of awardees for any on-ramp will be the same as the evaluation and award criteria used for the initial basic contract awards. The anticipated number of awards will be announced in the reopening announcement posted to FedBizOpps; however the PCO has the discretion to award more or fewer contracts than the number anticipated in the solicitation depending upon the quality of the offers received."</p>
<p>"Any Contractor that received a basic contract award shall not re-compete. The new awardee(s) will compete with any existing or remaining Contractors for all task orders. Any additions due to on-ramps will not impact the contract ceiling. The ordering period for new awardees will not extend the overall maximum term of the original contract, nor shall it re-establish the contract base period. The new awardee(s) will be eligible to compete for future task order requests for proposal issued against the basic IDIQ contract. The Government will not consider unsolicited request for additional Contractors."</p>

Components of the network infrastructure for the GE patient monitoring standalone network (3COM switches) are no longer available for purchase or repair parts. These switches need to be upgraded to HP switches, which are far more reliable and sustainable. The network infrastructure is what allows the patient monitors at the bedside to display and communicate with the central stations at the nurses' stations. The switches will be required to be installed in the GE monitoring closets on the various nursing units.
The requested network equipment for the existing GE Patient Monitoring system and must be installed by GE, as the installation requires proprietary configuration and interfacing with existing GE equipment. 
The manufacturer (GE) advised that as this requirement is considered a service/replacement part; the only time that the GE distributors would qualify for this requirement, is when it is considered capital equipment. GE does not work with any SDVOSB or VOSB business which could provide the requirement in this case.
The total award amount is estimated to be $36,101.59. The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is 10USC 2304(c)(1), only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirement. The applicable NAICS Code is 334510 and the size standard is 1,250 employees. 
Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit quotes. This notice of intent is not a request for quotation or a solicitation of offers. However, all quotes received by November 22, 2016 will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement upon receipt of response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. There will be no solicitation available.

The specific evaluation criteria to be included in paragraph (a) of that provision are as follows:</em><br /><br />The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforms to the solicitation and will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: Technical, Past Performance and Price. <br /><br />The Technical element of the evaluation will first be a determination as to whether the proposed product meets the performance characteristics and specifications in the solicitation. Those offers that meet or exceed the stated performance characteristics and specifications will then be evaluated in terms of technical aspects above the minimum requirements and of those aspects not addressed in the solicitation performance characteristics and specifications that would be most beneficial to the Government. In particular, the Government is willing to trade-off on price for offerors that exceed the following performance characteristics/specifications.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Per-rotation triggering method directly from a rotating susceptor (or wafer) instead of a trigger from a motor shaft for more accurate measurement (reference number 3 on salient characteristics document).<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. MODBUS TCP/IP interface for integration with the existing metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) control software for temperature control (reference number 4 on salient characteristics document).<br /><br />The Technical element of the evaluation shall be based solely on information furnished by the vendor. The Government is not responsible for locating or securing any information, which is not identified in the proposal. To ensure sufficient information is available, vendors must furnish as part of their proposal all descriptive material (such as cuts, illustrations, drawings, or other information) necessary for the Government to determine whether the product meets or exceeds the performance characteristics and specifications of the requirement. If the offeror proposes to modify a product so as to conform to the requirement of this solicitation, the offeror shall include a clear description of such proposed modifications and clearly mark any descriptive materials to show modifications. <br /><br />Past performance will be evaluated based on information provided by the offeror as to actual sales of the proposed product to industry or Government agencies. Past performance will consider the ability of the offeror to meet technical specifications, delivery schedules (with warranty fulfillment and maintenance reputation included as applicable). Offerors shall include 2 records of sales from the previous 24 months. Offerors shall identify a point of contact for each sale by providing a name and telephone number. <br /><br />Price will be evaluated based on the total proposed price, including options, (if any).<br /><br />Technical and past performance are of equal importance and when combined are significantly more important than price. The Government reserves the right to award to other than the lowest price and to award without discussions.<br /><span><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Delivery Information:<br /><br /></strong></span>Delivery is required no later than twelve (12) weeks after contract award.

 Press releases, marketing material or any other printed or electronic documentation related to this project, shall not be publicized without the written approval of the CO. 

Q.  Earned Value Management System

1.  An Earned Value Management System (EVMS) is required for major acquisitions for development, in accordance with OMB Circular A-11. The Government may also require an EVMS for other acquisitions, in accordance with agency policy contained in VA Directive 6061. Contractors that are required to have their own EVMS shall follow procedures contained in the VA EVMS Application Guide. 

2.  The following paragraphs reflect EVMS requirements and may be modified as necessary for selected use.[Choose one of the subparagraph a s below.] 

a. Integrated Contractor Services. This contract requires that contractors providing direct support services to VA staff will be required to participate in the VA EVMS and submit timesheets. Contractor personnel integrated into VA Staff and providing direct support in the completion of VA project tasks as part of the Government Earned Value Management System must provide assigned task planning, executing, controlling, and closing information to government project management staff. Gathering this information would include having individual contractor resources enter their planned and actual work time against their assigned activities into the government project tracking/timesheet application. The contractor shall be responsible for ensuring all work information is correct. 
Or-

a. Contractor Independent Deliverables. This contract requires the contractor to operate as a distinct entity to produce a deliverable(s). The contractor is required to have its own compliant EVMS, per VA Directive 6061, Table B-1, and provide EVM reports to the VA. 

(1). Non-Compliant EVMS. If the offeror proposes to use a system that has not been determined to be in compliance with the American National Standards Institute /Electronics Industries Alliance (ANSI/EIA) Standard-748, Earned Value Management Systems, the offeror shall submit a comprehensive plan for compliance with these EVMS standards. Offerors shall not be eliminated from consideration for contract award because they do not have an EVMS that complies with these standards. 

(2). EVMS Reports. As a minimum, contracting officers shall require contractors to submit EVMS monthly reports for those contracts for which an EVMS applies. 

(3). Subcontractors. EVMS requirements will be applied to subcontractors using the same rules as applied to the prime contractor. VA will decide the flow down of the EVM requirement to subcontractors. In all cases, the prime contractor is responsible for reporting EVM data.

(4). EVMS Plan. When an offeror is required to provide an EVMS plan as part of its proposal, the contracting officer will determine the adequacy of the proposed EVMS plan prior to contract award. 

(5). Performance Measurement Baseline. Contractors are required to resource load schedules in order to set a performance measurement baseline. Resources do not have to be specifically named.

(6). Program Management Reviews. The Contractor shall conduct Program Management Review (PMR) meetings at mutually agreed upon dates and locations. During these reviews, the contractor shall present integrated cost, schedule, and technical performance status. Government Integrated Product Team (IPT) leads or functional managers shall include cost information in discussions of schedule status, technical performance, and risk using earned value as an integrating tool. The following shall be addressed: Cost/schedule trends, significant cost/schedule/technical variances, projected impacts, quantified risk assessments, and corrective action plans. 

(7). Contractor Earned Value Management. The Cost Performance Report Description (VA-DI-MGMT-81466A), and Integrated Master Schedule Description (VA-DI-MGMT-81650) shall be developed, maintained, updated/statused and reported on a monthly basis per deliverable requirements, respectively. The contractor shall establish, maintain, and use in the performance of this contract, an integrated management system compliant with the Industry Guidelines for Earned Value Management Systems (EVMS) ANSI/EIA-748 as determined by the Government. 

An EVMS that has been formally validated and accepted by the cognizant contracting officer is required for all (fixed price, cost, or incentive) contracts, subcontracts, and other agreements valued at or greater than $50 million in then-year dollars. The application of these concepts shall provide for early indicators of contract cost and schedule problems.

For contracts valued at or greater than $20 million but less than $50 million then-year dollars, the following statement applies: The contractor is required to have an Earned Value Management System that complies with ANSI/EIA-748; however, the government will not formally validate/accept the contractor's management system (no formal review). The contractor will submit an EVMS description and proof of prior certification with its bid.

(8). Integrated Baseline Review (IBR). The contractor shall review its performance measurement baseline plan with the Government within six months of contract award or initiation of an Undefinitized Contract Action, and subsequently, when required, following major changes to the baseline. The Government will verify during the IBR, and follow-on IBRs when required that the contractor has established and maintains a reliable performance measurement baseline. The contractor will ensure that the baseline includes the entire contract technical scope of work consistent with contract schedule requirements, and has adequate resources assigned. The contractor will assure the Government that effective earned value methodologies are used to accurately measure work accomplished and determine contract cost, schedule, and technical performance. The IBR will be used to achieve a mutual understanding of the baseline plan, cost and schedule risk, and the underlying management processes used for planning and controlling the project. 

(9). Subcontract Cost/Schedule Management and Reporting. Subcontracts exceeding $20M in then-year dollars will apply the requirements of the Integrated Master Schedule Description (VA-DI-MGMT-81650) and the Cost Performance Report Description (VA-DI-MGMT-81466). For contracts valued at or greater than $20 million but less than $50 million, the following statement applies: The contractor is required to have an Earned Value Management System that complies with ANSI/EIA-748; however, the Government will not formally validate/accept the contractor's management system (no formal review). EVMS flow down to contracts of less than $20M in then-year dollars or Firm Fixed Price contracts that exceed 12 months duration is a risk-based decision and will be as mutually agreed between the contractor and the Government. 

(10). Contract Work Breakdown Structure (CWBS). The contractor shall develop and maintain the CWBS and CWBS dictionary. 

(11). over Target Baseline (OTB)/Restructure. The contractor may conclude the baseline no longer represents a realistic plan in terms of budget/schedule execution. In the event the contractor determines an OTB/Restructuring action is necessary, the contractor must obtain Government approval prior to implementing an OTB/Restructuring action. The request should also include detailed implementation procedures as well as an implementation timeframe. The contractor will not implement the OTB/Restructuring prior to receiving written approval from the Contracting Officer. 

(12). Award Fee Criteria. For contracts that include an award fee, the contractor will demonstrate the use of Earned Value Management (EVM) as a tool for cost and schedule control and as a basis for communicating with the Government. The Government will determine the eligibility for of and amount of any award fee granted. In addition to demonstrating the use of EVM award fee criteria for the contractor will include the following:

(a).  Maintain timely detail planning as far in advance as practical; 

(b). Ensure the system provides accurate cost/schedule performance status, reliable and timely cost/schedule projections, and quantified risk assessments; 

(c).  Provide clear and comprehensive explanations of performance problems and associated impacts, and establish and carry out effective recovery plans; 

(d).  Control and minimize changes to the baseline particularly in the near term; 

(e).  Ensure all subcontractor-authorized effort is detail planned into measurable objective work packages to the extent possible; 

(f).  Provide program-level Estimate at Completion (EAC) assessments that include consideration of potential risks and cost containment plans; and 

(g).  Demonstrate responsiveness regarding management system and cost/schedule performance questions and issues/concerns raised by the Government.

<p>252.204-7011 ALTERNATIVE LINE-ITEM STRUCTURE (SEP 2011)</p>
<p>(a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal <br />Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to <br />ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.<br /><br />(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71. A sample solicitation line-item structure and a corresponding offer of a proposed alternative line-item structure follow.<br />Solicitation:</p>
<p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Item No. Supplies/Service Quantity Unit Unit price Amount<br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />0001............................ Computer, Desktop with 20 EA ............ ...........<br />CPU, Monitor, Keyboard<br />and Mouse.<br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

<DESC>This requirement consists of 1 line item: 
  
 VH-4000 Hempro 2   

The following salient characteristics are detailed description of the requirements for this solicitation:
VASOVIEW HEMOPRO 2
Brand Name Specific:  VASOVIEW HEMOPRO 2  
VASOVIEW HEMOPRO 2 is the latest generation of VASOVIEW simultaneous cut-and-seal technology for Endoscopic Vessel Harvesting (EVH). An embodiment of the Maquet commitment to highly refined technology and robust design, VASOVIEW HEMOPRO 2 virtually eliminates thermal spread and helps harvesters safely acquire high-quality conduits for coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery.* The VASOVIEW HEMOPRO 2 Endoscopic Vessel Harvesting (EVH) System offers the highest level of design innovation and ergonomic sophistication. It represents the gold standard in vessel harvesting for both the saphenous vein and radial artery delivering superb visualization and exceptional maneuverability to enable harvesters to work more efficiently and effectively for improved patient outcomes. VASOVIEW HEMOPRO 2 now also comes packaged with the VASOSHIELD Pressure Controlling Syringe inside as a convenience to users taking every advantage of tools that help maximize conduit quality. The VASOSHIELD Pressure Controlling Syringe is a device that protects vessels from over distension and potential endothelial injury. Vessels flushed at controlled, lower pressures also have been shown to more effectively overcome spasm and maintain their endothelial and medial layers.
The insulated Jaws are a key feature of the VASOVIEW HEMOPRO 2 System, providing maximum protection for the saphenous vein or radial artery. A new spot cautery feature allows harvesters to respond quickly and easily to maintain clear working tunnels and to ensure hemostasis.
Easy-to-learn techniques enable harvesters to position the Jaws while protecting the main conduit.* 
Enhanced cutting capability for easier fasciotomy
Advanced system design helps to enhance the efficiency and safety of vessel harvest
The new, more  natural grip  handle is comfortable to hold and features an easy-activation toggle. Harvesters have a simple, smooth, and highly responsive one-fingertip control.
Qty. 200 Each

Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.<br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>"Data Universal Numbering System+4 (DUNS+4) number" means the DUNS number assigned by D&amp;B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern. (D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at subpart 32.11) for the same concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the SAM registration process; and</p>
<p>(4) The Government has marked the record "Active".</p>
<p>"System for Award Management (SAM)" means the primary Government repository for prospective Federal awardee and Federal awardee information and the centralized Government system for certain contracting, grants, and other assistance-related processes. It includes-</p>

<p>(2) Prospective contractor-submitted annual representations and certifications in accordance with FAR subpart 4.12; and</p>
<p>(3) Identification of those parties excluded from receiving Federal contracts, certain subcontracts, and certain types of Federal financial and non-financial assistance and benefits.</p>
<p>(b) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>

<p>252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure (Sep 2011)</p>
<p>a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA <br /><br />Alternative line item structure offer where monitors are shipped separately:</p>

<p>(d) Nothing in the terms of this contract adds, changes, supersedes, or waives any of the requirements of applicable Federal laws, Executive orders, and regulations, including but not limited to-</p>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract.

<p>252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure (Sep 2011)</p>
<p>a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA <br /><br />Alternative line item structure offer where monitors are shipped separately:</p>

The Contractor shall consult with the Department of State regarding any questions relating to compliance with the ITAR and shall consult with the Department of Commerce regarding any questions relating to compliance with the EAR.</p>
<p>(c) The Contractor's responsibility to comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items exists independent of, and is not established or limited by, the information provided by this clause.</p>
<p>(d) Nothing in the terms of this contract adds, changes, supersedes, or waives any of the requirements of applicable Federal laws, Executive orders, and regulations, including but not limited to-</p>
<p>(1) The Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (50 U.S.C. App. 2401, et seq.);</p>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />____________________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>ALL OCCUPATIONS LISTED ABOVE RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING BENEFITS:</p>
<p>HEALTH &amp; WELFARE: $4.27 per hour or $170.80 per week or $740.13 per month</p>
<p>VACATION: 2 weeks paid vacation after 1 year of service with a contractor or<br />successor, 3 weeks after 8 years, and 4 weeks after 15 years. Length of service<br />includes the whole span of continuous service with the present contractor or<br />successor, wherever employed, and with the predecessor contractors in the<br />performance of similar work at the same Federal facility. (See 29 CFR 4.173)</p>
<p>HOLIDAYS: A minimum of ten paid holidays per year: New Year's Day, Martin Luther<br />King Jr.'s Birthday, Washington's Birthday, Memorial Day, Independence Day,<br />Labor Day, Columbus Day, Veterans' Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day. (A<br />contractor may substitute for any of the named holidays another day off with pay in<br />accordance with a plan communicated to the employees involved.) (See 29 CFR 4.174)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>THE OCCUPATIONS WHICH HAVE NUMBERED FOOTNOTES IN PARENTHESES RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING:</p>
<p>1) COMPUTER EMPLOYEES: Under the SCA at section 8(b), this wage determination does<br />not apply to any employee who individually qualifies as a bona fide executive,<br />administrative, or professional employee as defined in 29 C.F.R. Part 541. Because<br />most Computer System Analysts and Computer Programmers who are compensated at a rate<br />not less than $27.63 (or on a salary or fee basis at a rate not less than $455 per<br />week) an hour would likely qualify as exempt computer professionals, (29 C.F.R. 541.<br />400) wage rates may not be listed on this wage determination for all occupations<br />within those job families. In addition, because this wage determination may not<br />list a wage rate for some or all occupations within those job families if the survey<br />data indicates that the prevailing wage rate for the occupation equals or exceeds<br />$27.63 per hour conformances may be necessary for certain nonexempt employees. For<br />example, if an individual employee is nonexempt but nevertheless performs duties<br />within the scope of one of the Computer Systems Analyst or Computer Programmer<br />occupations for which this wage determination does not specify an SCA wage rate,<br />then the wage rate for that employee must be conformed in accordance with the<br />conformance procedures described in the conformance note included on this wage<br />determination.</p>
<p>Additionally, because job titles vary widely and change quickly in the computer<br />industry, job titles are not determinative of the application of the computer<br />professional exemption. Therefore, the exemption applies only to computer employees<br />who satisfy the compensation requirements and whose primary duty consists of:<br />(1) The application of systems analysis techniques and procedures, including<br />consulting with users, to determine hardware, software or system functional<br />specifications;<br />(2) The design, development, documentation, analysis, creation, testing or<br />modification of computer systems or programs, including prototypes, based on and<br />related to user or system design specifications;<br />(3) The design, documentation, testing, creation or modification of computer<br />programs related to machine operating systems; or<br />(4) A combination of the aforementioned duties, the performance of which<br />requires the same level of skills. (29 C.F.R. 541.400).</p>
<p>2) AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS AND WEATHER OBSERVERS - NIGHT PAY &amp; SUNDAY PAY: If you<br />work at night as part of a regular tour of duty, you will earn a night differential<br />and receive an additional 10% of basic pay for any hours worked between 6pm and 6am.<br />If you are a full-time employed (40 hours a week) and Sunday is part of your<br />regularly scheduled workweek, you are paid at your rate of basic pay plus a Sunday<br />premium of 25% of your basic rate for each hour of Sunday work which is not overtime<br />(i.e. occasional work on Sunday outside the normal tour of duty is considered<br />overtime work).</p>
<p><br />** HAZARDOUS PAY DIFFERENTIAL **</p>
<p>An 8 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that<br />represents a high degree of hazard when working with or in close proximity to<br />ordnance, explosives, and incendiary materials. This includes work such as<br />screening, blending, dying, mixing, and pressing of sensitive ordnance, explosives,<br />and pyrotechnic compositions such as lead azide, black powder and photoflash powder.<br />All dry-house activities involving propellants or explosives. Demilitarization,<br />modification, renovation, demolition, and maintenance operations on sensitive<br />ordnance, explosives and incendiary materials. All operations involving re-grading<br />and cleaning of artillery ranges.</p>
<p>A 4 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that<br />represents a low degree of hazard when working with, or in close proximity to<br />ordnance, (or employees possibly adjacent to) explosives and incendiary materials<br />which involves potential injury such as laceration of hands, face, or arms of the<br />employee engaged in the operation, irritation of the skin, minor burns and the like;<br />minimal damage to immediate or adjacent work area or equipment being used. All<br />operations involving, unloading, storage, and hauling of ordnance, explosive, and<br />incendiary ordnance material other than small arms ammunition. These differentials<br />are only applicable to work that has been specifically designated by the agency for<br />ordnance, explosives, and incendiary material differential pay.</p>
<p>** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE **</p>
<p>If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract<br />(either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state or<br />local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by<br />laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by an<br />employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wage<br />determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the<br />following standards as compliance:</p>
<p>The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an<br />adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the actual<br />cost of the uniforms. In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made<br />the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors subject to<br />this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining<br />agreement providing for a different amount, or the furnishing of contrary<br />affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all employees for such cleaning<br />and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day). However, in<br />those instances where the uniforms furnished are made of "wash and wear"<br />materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments, and do<br />not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning, daily washing, or commercial<br />laundering in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms<br />of the Government contract, by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work,<br />there is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs.</p>
<p>** SERVICE CONTRACT ACT DIRECTORY OF OCCUPATIONS **</p>
<p>The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the<br />"Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations", Fifth Edition (Revision 1),<br />dated September 2015, unless otherwise indicated.</p>
<p>** REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE, Standard<br />Form 1444 (SF-1444) **</p>
<p>Conformance Process:</p>
<p>The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which is<br />not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to<br />be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage<br />determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable<br />relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted<br />classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination (See 29 CFR<br />4.6(b)(2)(i)). Such conforming procedures shall be initiated by the contractor<br />prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted class(es) of employees<br />(See 29 CFR 4.6(b)(2)(ii)). The Wage and Hour Division shall make a final<br />determination of conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits which<br />shall be paid to all employees performing in the classification from the first day<br />of work on which contract work is performed by them in the classification. Failure<br />to pay such unlisted employees the compensation agreed upon by the interested<br />parties and/or fully determined by the Wage and Hour Division retroactive to the<br />date such class of employees commenced contract work shall be a violation of the Act<br />and this contract. (See 29 CFR 4.6(b)(2)(v)). When multiple wage determinations are<br />included in a contract, a separate SF-1444 should be prepared for each wage<br />determination to which a class(es) is to be conformed.</p>
<p>The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows:</p>
<p>1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed<br />occupation(s) and computes a proposed rate(s).</p>
<p>2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in order<br />the proposed classification title(s), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for each<br />proposed classification(s), job description(s), and rationale for proposed wage<br />rate(s), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the<br />authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no authorized<br />representative, the employees themselves. This report should be submitted to the<br />contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of employees<br />performs any contract work.</p>
<p>3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report<br />of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent<br />information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the U.S.<br />Department of Labor, Wage and Hour Division, for review (See 29 CFR 4.6(b)(2)(ii)).</p>
<p>4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or<br />disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or<br />notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to process<br />the request.</p>
<p>5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour Division's decision to the<br />contractor.</p>
<p>6) Each affected employee shall be furnished by the contractor with a written copy<br />of such determination or it shall be posted as a part of the wage determination (See<br />29 CFR 4.6(b)(2)(iii)).</p>
<p>Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF-1444 or bond paper.</p>
<p>When preparing a conformance request, the "Service Contract Act Directory of<br />Occupations" should be used to compare job definitions to ensure that duties<br />requested are not performed by a classification already listed in the wage<br />determination. Remember, it is not the job title, but the required tasks that<br />determine whether a class is included in an established wage determination.<br />Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or subdivide<br />classifications listed in the wage determination (See 29 CFR 4.152(c)(1)).</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer. <br />Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protester agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external forum, the agency protest will be dismissed. <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS
United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract
awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was
established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and timeconsuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a
prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an
Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some
external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file
a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.

Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG
procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable
Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested
parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under
this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of
an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or
other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following
information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting
Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest,
protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer
through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an Independent
Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either
the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.
Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award
or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in
writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in
less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth
in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the
protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed
within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program
should be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand
delivery to the Contracting Officer.

Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the
Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protester agrees not
to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external
forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.

The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation seeking Firm Fixed Price (FFP) quotes for commercial aircraft component repair/overhaul services prepared in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulations and the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. In the alternative, Test, Teardown, and Evaluation (TT&amp;E) with estimated (AVERAGE) overhaul cost quotes may be submitted for consideration. When in receipt of evaluation or baseline price quotes only, the government reserves the right to issue a purchase order based on the government's historical pricing data. The purpose of this solicitation is to determine the best value to the government with regard to the repair/overhaul of an aircraft component(s). This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and no other solicitation document will be issued. Request for Quotation (RFQ) number HSCG38-17-Q-010024 is assigned for tracking purposes only. Federal Acquisition Regulations 52.212-1, 52.212-2, 52.212-3, 52.212-4, and 52.212-5 apply.

<p>Any vendor, except the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) or a Production Approval Holder (PAH), servicing Coast Guard Aircraft Components MUST be FAA 145 certified and perform at least fifty percent (50%) of the work at their own company's FAA certified facility. Unless otherwise directed by the Contracting Officer, awards for the repair or overhaul of Coast Guard Aircraft Repairable Components shall only be awarded directly to service vendors who have been deemed fully capable of performing such services by division level command-appointed Coast Guard Engineers or Equipment Specialists. Vendors who do not meet the above stated capability requirement will not be considered and should not respond to this solicitation/request for quote.</p>
<p>This solicitation will not be extended or the award delayed for a vendor to submit their repair/overhaul data for capability determination or for registration in SAM.GOV.

The Coast Guard does not own nor can acquire or provide service manuals or OEM service data.

DE ARAGON 404, MADRID, ESP E-28022, Cage Code 0117B, and their domestic service facility Cage Code is 0DAF1.

This is an Unrestricted Solicitation. NAICS Code 488190 is applicable. This solicitation is for the overhaul of HC-144 Aircraft Component/Part(s):</p>

<p>Smart Grid Technologies Project:  The India Power Corporation Limited ("Grantee") invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms that are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a technical assistance (TA) for the Grantee that will assist the Grantee in selecting the optimal technologies to improve the efficiency of its operations, particularly at its Gaya Distribution Franchise in the State of Bihar.</p>
<p>India Power Corporation Limited (IPCL) is a private sector utility headquartered in Kolkata, West Bengal. IPCL was selected as a distribution franchisee for the Gaya Distribution Franchise (DF) in the State of Bihar. In this role, IPCL is responsible for the distribution of electric power, handling utility customer inquiries, issuing new network connections as well as performing metering, billing and network maintenance operations over a 1,500 square kilometer area.  Historically, this area has been plagued by high transmission and distribution losses. To address challenges at the Gaya DF, IPCL has requested technical assistance to create a smart grid technology implementation plan to reduce technical and commercial power losses, design specifications for a series of pilot projects to demonstrate smart grid technologies, and develop an integrated IT system for key operations of IPCL's utility businesses. In addition to the Gaya DF, IPCL's portfolio includes renewable and conventional power generation, transmission, distribution and power trading.</p>
<p>IPCL requires a detailed technical assistance (TA) to be conducted in the Gaya DF to review and analyze the issues within the franchise area and recommend smart grid technologies that could be deployed.  The TA will develop detailed plans for pilot projects to demonstrate the recommended technologies. The TA will also include a technology needs assessment and a comprehensive, scalable technology solutions package that can be progressively implemented across all businesses of IPCL in the power generation and distribution space.  In addition, the TA will recommend IT systems for key operations at IPCL's utility businesses and develop an integrated IT systems plan for deployment of those systems.</p>
<p>The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $593,400 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).</p>
<p>A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and portions of a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  To request the RFP in PDF format, please go to: <br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">http://www.ustda.gov/business-opportunities/request-proposal-form</span></strong>.  <br /><br />Requests for a mailed hardcopy version of the RFP may also be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm's name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response. Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored. Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.</p>
<p>Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity. Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity. All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.

<DESC>Exception is taken to this requirement FD2030-16-01387 of the synopsis publicizing IAW with FAR part 5.202(a)(13), exception: (i) Is for an amount not expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold (ii) Will be made through a means that provides access to the notice of proposed contract action through the GPE. (iii) Permits the public to respond to the solicitation electronically. Electronic commerce is defined at 41 USC sec. 426 as electronic techniques for accomplishing business transactions, including electronic mail. Thus, provided the complete solicitation package is available through the GPE and offerors are permitted to respond electronically (i.e., email in this case), the proposed contract action would not need to be synopsized. Therefore, synopsis is hereby waived as this acquisition is not expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold, request for proposal will be made through Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOps), and the offerors will be able to respond electronically.

<p>(11)&nbsp; A. Objective:&nbsp; To find sources that are qualified to meet the requirements. Note that the specific requirements are subject to change prior to the release of any solicitation.<br /><br />B. Requirements:&nbsp; The Army Contracting Command-Aberdeen Proving Ground (ACC-APG), Adelphi Division on behalf of the Army Research Laboratory (ARL), is conducting market research in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 10. The purpose of this Market Research is to identify concerns that have the skills, experience, knowledge, and capabilities necessary to provide Research and Development (R&amp;D) and technical services needed to support the CyberSecurity Service Provider (CSSP) and its evolution in the face of a changing threat environment. This Sources Sought is issued to communicate the ARL's program requirement to industry. ARL intends to use information gathered from these responses to gain awareness of capabilities, determine interested parties, and to support formulation of an acquisition strategy. Early industry involvement in creating a properly scaled enterprise solution is critical to the success of this contemplated acquisition. <br /><br />C. Specifications: This effort is for the Research and Development (R&amp;D) and technical services needed to support the CyberSecurity Service Provider (CSSP) and its evolution in the face of a changing threat environment. This work includes research and technical services supporting mission areas defined in Technology Program Agreements with Research, Development and Engineering Command (RDECOM) centers in information assurance (IA) and computer network operations. ARL collaborates with partners in other CSSPs, the law enforcement and counter intelligence communities in the areas of technology development and computer security research. The focus across the effort is defense against the sophisticated cyber adversaries to ARL, the Army, DoD, and the United States (US) Government. This effort strives to improve the state of the art in cyber defense. Cyber defense R&amp;D is reliant on raw data from real-world networks that contain vital evidence of the threats being perpetrated by hostiles against the network. Analysis of the data and the ability to improve attack detection accuracy and timeliness is intrinsically coupled with the agile development of new tools and techniques to combat adversaries. This ARL cyber defense effort partners with many organizations; some of which use the ARL CSSP services to provide primary or supplementary network defense services. Some are research partners using ARL-developed cyber defense tools and test-beds, and others are intelligence and law enforcement organizations that leverage ARL technology and share vital information about current threats. The extensive network view is a key enabler to the cyber research and technology enhancement mission. This effort's initiative is particularly focused on improving capabilities to combat sophisticated cyber adversaries as well as investigating the next generation of Defensive Cyber Operational Tools, Techniques, and Procedures (TTP), tactical network security, exploring prospective sensor capabilities, executing components of the Information Security Continuous Monitoring (ISCM) strategy, risk measurement and monitoring, improving adversary attribution, and insider threat analysis. The ARL cyber mission uniquely derives its strength from the close synergistic bond between research and the technical services answering operational necessities. These activities demand skilled, forward-thinking staff at every position.<br />The objective of this effort is research and develop a fundamental understanding of the dynamic cyber domain while providing 24x7 Cyber Defense Operations and Services within the environment of the Department of Defense<br /><br />D. Industry Day: Additionally, this Sources Sought is to inform interested parties of an upcoming Industry Day being hosted at Building 205 2800 Powder Mill Rd, 20783-1197 tentatively scheduled for 13 December 2016 at 9:00AM. <br /><br />All parties interested in the Industry Day shall notify this office by email NO LATER THAN 3:00 pm EST on 01 December 2016.

<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY for novel fabric materials that may be suitable for use in a tropical wet environment and are capable of meeting the basic requirements described below. This is not a Request for Quotation (RFQ), Request for Proposal (RFP) or an Invitation for Bid (IFB). It is a market research tool being used to determine the availability and adequacy of potential sources for planning purposes only. Responses to this notice are not considered as offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of responses nor otherwise pay for the preparation of any information presented or the use of any such information.
<p>DESCRIPTION:</p>
<p>The U.S. Army Natick Soldier Research Development and Engineering Center (NSRDEC) is requesting information on novel materials that may be used in a Jungle Combat Clothing Ensemble. Materials may include novel fiber types/blends, weave constructions and functional finishes. These materials may have potential use as base fabrics, design features and/or reinforcement patches within a Jungle Combat Clothing Ensemble. A separate RFI&nbsp;has been&nbsp;posted for&nbsp;commercial material (W911QY-17-LtWeightMatl-Commercial).</p>
<p>The objective of this RFI is to determine the availability in the&nbsp;marketplace of materials that may be suitable for use in a tropical wet environment, where temperatures range from 75 to 95&deg;F and relative humidity ranges from 75% to 100%. Further considerations are as follows:</p>
<p>&bull; Soldier priorities for a uniform are quick-drying followed by, durable, breathable and lighter weight. <br />&bull; Materials of interest are novel woven, knit, mesh, spacer, auxetic and phase-change materials that meet Soldier priorities. Materials must be machine washable. <br />&bull; Attributes such as no melt/no-drip materials and vector protection (via permethrin treatment or other modes of action) are required. Fabrics should contain an EPA-approved treatment (e.g. Permethrin, etc.) that is in accordance with EPA-approved levels to protect against vector-borne diseases.<br />&bull; Desired material durability and other performance attributes are listed in Table 1.<br />&bull; Fabrics should have the ability to be camouflage printed via rotary screen printing or dyed, depending on the intended application.<br />&bull; According to Soldiers, the 50/50 Nylon/Cotton rip stop uniform (~6.5 osy) takes more than 4 hours to dry in a tropical wet environment. A more acceptable range in a hot, humid environment (i.e., 75-95&deg;F and 70-100% RH) is 1-2 hours.</p>
<p>REQUESTED INFORMATION:</p>
<p>Vendors who believe they have materials capable of meeting the above requirements are requested to submit a short (no more than 5 pages total per sample) summary, including Company name and address, point of contact with phone number, DUNS number, CAGE Code and a statement regarding any small business designation (if applicable), by the date and to the address noted below. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 313310 and the small business size is 1,000 employees. Responses should include</p>
<p>1. A description of the tropical combat materials being submitted or developed, a summary of the technical approaches taken to meet the performance requirements of this RFI, and the ability to scale up production if required.<br />2. Estimated cost per linear yard.<br />3. Test data demonstrating the performance of the material being submitted as it compares to the technical requirements of this RFI in Table 1 (attached).<br />4. Samples equivalent to a minimum of one (1) linear yard of material (in any color) with written assurance that the shade, color fastness and spectral reflectance requirements can be met if printed in a multi-color earth tone camouflage pattern. Submitted materials must be permethrin or etofenprox treated by an EPA-registered facility.<br />5. A material description including fiber blend percentages and Berry compliance documentation (all textile-based technology products-all materials and manufacturing-must comply with Berry Amendment Restrictions, per DFARS 252.225-7012).</p>
<p>Respondents may submit up to five (5) different fabric candidates, but should clearly identify the advantages/disadvantages of each. Any finishes added to the fabric should be identified in the response. Respondents should clearly identify any areas where the samples do not meet the attribute thresholds in Table 1 and discuss tradeoffs.</p>
<p>The submissions may be used by the Government in formulating a program to assess the performance of the submitted materials and design concepts for functionality in a tropical environment. While there is no guarantee that a subsequent solicitation will be issued and/or a contract awarded, currently, it is the Government's interest to explore the feasibility of procuring lighter weight textile materials for use in tropical uniforms.</p>
<p>Respondents are requested to provide information and sample materials by Wednesday, 29 March 2017/3:00PM Eastern Standard Time.</p>
<p>Responses to this notice are to be sent to Ms. Melynda Perry, NSRDEC, ATTN: RDNS-SEW-TDT, 15 General Greene Ave., Natick, MA 01760-5019. This notice is for information and sample materials only.

<DESC>The US Army Program Executive Office, Missiles and Space Cruise Missile Defense Systems (CMDS) Project Office is conducting market research to determine if there are potential sources with the capability to provide a high performance modification, designated as the Sentinel A4, for the AN/MPQ-64A3 (Sentinel A3) short range Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD) radar.
<p>Pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.2, this notice is being issued as a REQUEST FOR INFORMATION. In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not an offer and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. No contract award is intended as a result of this request. THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY. This Request for Information is issued solely for information and planning purposes - it does not constitute a Request for Proposal or a promise to issue a Request for Proposal in the future. This request for information does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. The Government will not pay for the information received. The Government Point of Contact (POC) will be Mr. Johnny L. Keith, US Army Contracting Command-Redstone, Attn: CCAM-SM-T, Redstone Arsenal, AL 35898, and can be contacted via e-mail: johnny.l.keith.civ@mail.mil. Mail or Email responses only, no phone calls. The response cut off time is Monday, 2 May 2016 by 1500 CST.</p>
<p>Per FAR 52.215-3, Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes:</p>
<p>a.) The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this solicitation or to otherwise pay for the information solicited except as an allowable cost under other contracts as provided in subsection 31.205-18, bid and proposal costs, of the FAR.</p>
<p>b.) Although "proposed", "proposal", and "offeror" may be used in this Request for Information, your response will be treated as information only. It shall not be used as a proposal.</p>
<p>c.) This solicitation is issued for the purpose of acquiring information to modify or replace the Army's AN/MPQ-64A3 Sentinel A3 radar.</p>
<p>SENTINEL RADAR.</p>
<p>The Sentinel Radar is a major component of the Army IAMD System of Systems architecture, providing a surveillance and fire control capability against low altitude air breathing threats, to include Cruise Missiles (CM), Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS), fixed wing, rotary-wing, and future capabilities against Rocket, Artillery and Mortar (RAM) threats.</p>
<p>Sentinel, currently deployed in its A3 configuration, provides a critical capability for the acquisition, tracking, classification, discrimination, and identification of aerial threats and cueing and track data to support Beyond Line of Site engagements. It provides air coverage in the forward area (Corps, Division, and Brigade sectors) by providing vital information for timely decision making by the commander, and accurate targeting information to the supported weapon systems. Sentinel also tracks friendly UAS and aircraft, providing support for airspace management de-confliction and fires de-confliction. It provides continuous volume surveillance of friendly and hostile aircraft to enhance protection of friendly aircraft from fratricide.</p>
<p>The Sentinel A3 is an X-band, three dimensional, 360&deg; azimuth coverage, phased array air defense radar with a nominal 75 kilometer instrumented range. The system is equipped with Electronic Counter-Counter-Measure (ECCM) capabilities, a Mode 5 Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) subsystem for positive identification of friendly aircraft, and a suite of Non-Cooperative Target Recognition (NCTR) capabilities to identify threat aircraft. Sentinel is mounted on a Family of Medium Tactical Vehicles (FMTV) trailer, pulled by a M1082 FMTV truck hosting a 10 kW tactical generator and the command and control interface. Sentinel interfaces with the IAMD Battle Command system, the Forward Area Air Defense Command and Control (FAAD C2) system, and the National Capital Region Integrated Air Defense command and control system.</p>
<p>In order to ensure meeting its mission requirements and to address future Counter-RAM requirements, CMDS plans to modify the Sentinel A3 radar to an A4 configuration that will employ advanced sensor technologies to improve capabilities and performance. The Sentinel A4 will counter the advancing threat evolution in the short range IAMD mission area. These future threats include reduced signature CM targets, smaller and slower UAS targets, and RAM. The RAM threats include both short range (couple/few km) and longer range (low hundreds of km) large caliber rockets (240mm, 300mm), rockets (107mm, 122mm), artillery (122mm, 152mm), and mortars (60mm, 82mm, 120mm).</p>
<p>SENTINEL A4 REQUIREMENTS. <br /><br />Respondents to this Request for Information (RFI) must satisfactorily address the following requirements in their response:</p>
<p>1. The Sentinel A4 must meet or exceed all current Sentinel A3 requirements contained in the Draft Revised Sentinel A3 Requirements Document. The Sentinel Product Office will make this Requirements Document (DRAFT, classified SECRET) available to potential respondents to this RFI.</p>
<p>2. To counter the new threat, the Sentinel A4 must exceed selected A3 threshold performance requirements. The Sentinel A4 requires a greater than 75% increase in range performance, three times the search volume, and twice the track loading capability. A greater than two times increase in track accuracy is required. Performance is required while operating under very stressing radar environments (e.g., electronic attack; anti-radiation weapons; direction finding sensors; mountain, sea, and urban clutter; biological fliers; etc.).</p>
<p>3. Candidate technical solutions to this RFI must currently be at a demonstrated Technology Readiness Level of six or higher (TRL 6).</p>
<p>4. To support a modification of the current Sentinel A3 to a Sentinel A4 capability, the Sentinel Product Office plans to make available a defined interface to the existing Sentinel A3 Signal Data Processor (SDP) and software, to which a new antenna assembly can be added. This antenna assembly would include advanced technologies (e.g., Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) technology) and interface to the existing SDP. A new antenna assembly will also require new equipment solutions or modifications to the platform, power systems, cooling systems, rotational assembly, and beam steering. The Sentinel Product Office will consider changes to the SDP or a new SDP hardware solution to support a new antenna assembly design. We encourage respondents to suggest alternatives to this approach.</p>
<p>5. Candidate technical solutions must be ready to enter Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD as defined in DoD Instruction 5000.02), without a prior Government funded technology demonstration, in Fiscal Year (FY) 2019. Should an award be made, the selected contractor must be ready to hold a Preliminary Design Review in FY 2020 and must have prototype hardware ready for developmental testing, to include qualification and performance testing, in FY 2021 (28 months following EMD contract award).</p>
<p>6. Candidate technical solutions must address the ability and risks to enter Low Rate Initial Production in FY 2023 and Full Rate Production in FY 2025.</p>
<p>7. Candidate technical solutions must be supported by production facilities and proven processes to deliver up to 30 Sentinel A4 antenna assemblies per year. The Government plans to procure 199 antenna assemblies through FY 2032.</p>
<p>8. Candidate technical solutions must include a cost-effective 20-year sustainment plan for the 199 radars that includes Government organic support.</p>
<p>9. The desired Sentinel A4 technology is primarily for United States employment but must have a variant that can be approved for Foreign Military Sales (FMS) to existing and new Sentinel FMS customers.</p>
<p>10. Candidate technical solutions must be supported by current demonstrated company experience with advanced X-Band radars.<br />11. Candidate technical solutions must demonstrate that the resulting Sentinel A4 can be produced and sustained in a cost-effective manner.</p>

The response cut off time is Monday,&nbsp;16 May 2016 by 1500 CST.</p>
<p>Per FAR 52.215-3, Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes:</p>
<p>a.) The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this solicitation or to otherwise pay for the information solicited except as an allowable cost under other contracts as provided in subsection 31.205-18, bid and proposal costs, of the FAR.</p>
<p>b.) Although "proposed", "proposal", and "offeror" may be used in this Request for Information, your response will be treated as information only. It shall not be used as a proposal.</p>
<p>c.) This solicitation is issued for the purpose of acquiring information to modify or replace the Army's AN/MPQ-64A3 Sentinel A3 radar.</p>
<p>SENTINEL RADAR.</p>
<p>The Sentinel Radar is a major component of the Army IAMD System of Systems architecture, providing a surveillance and fire control capability against low altitude air breathing threats, to include Cruise Missiles (CM), Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS), fixed wing, rotary-wing, and future capabilities against Rocket, Artillery and Mortar (RAM) threats.</p>

It provides air coverage in the forward area (Corps, Division, and Brigade sectors) by providing vital information for timely decision making by the commander, and accurate targeting information to the supported weapon systems. Sentinel also tracks friendly UAS and aircraft, providing support for airspace management de-confliction and fires de-confliction. It provides continuous volume surveillance of friendly and hostile aircraft to enhance protection of friendly aircraft from fratricide.</p>
<p>The Sentinel A3 is an X-band, three dimensional, 360&deg; azimuth coverage, phased array air defense radar with a nominal 75 kilometer instrumented range. The system is equipped with Electronic Counter-Counter-Measure (ECCM) capabilities, a Mode 5 Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) subsystem for positive identification of friendly aircraft, and a suite of Non-Cooperative Target Recognition (NCTR) capabilities to identify threat aircraft. Sentinel is mounted on a Family of Medium Tactical Vehicles (FMTV) trailer, pulled by a M1082 FMTV truck hosting a 10 kW tactical generator and the command and control interface. Sentinel interfaces with the IAMD Battle Command system, the Forward Area Air Defense Command and Control (FAAD C2) system, and the National Capital Region Integrated Air Defense command and control system.</p>
<p>In order to ensure meeting its mission requirements and to address future Counter-RAM requirements, CMDS plans to modify the Sentinel A3 radar to an A4 configuration that will employ advanced sensor technologies to improve capabilities and performance. The Sentinel A4 will counter the advancing threat evolution in the short range IAMD mission area. These future threats include reduced signature CM targets, smaller and slower UAS targets, and RAM. The RAM threats include both short range (couple/few km) and longer range (low hundreds of km) large caliber rockets (240mm, 300mm), rockets (107mm, 122mm), artillery (122mm, 152mm), and mortars (60mm, 82mm, 120mm).</p>
<p>SENTINEL A4 REQUIREMENTS. <br /><br />Respondents to this Request for Information (RFI) must satisfactorily address the following requirements in their response:</p>
<p>1. The Sentinel A4 must meet or exceed all current Sentinel A3 requirements contained in the Draft Revised Sentinel A3 Requirements Document. The Sentinel Product Office will make this Requirements Document (DRAFT, classified SECRET) available to potential respondents to this RFI.</p>
<p>2. To counter the new threat, the Sentinel A4 must exceed selected A3 threshold performance requirements. The Sentinel A4 requires a greater than 75% increase in range performance, three times the search volume, and twice the track loading capability. A greater than two times increase in track accuracy is required. Performance is required while operating under very stressing radar environments (e.g., electronic attack; anti-radiation weapons; direction finding sensors; mountain, sea, and urban clutter; biological fliers; etc.).</p>
<p>3. Candidate technical solutions to this RFI must currently be at a demonstrated Technology Readiness Level of six or higher (TRL 6).</p>
<p>4. To support a modification of the current Sentinel A3 to a Sentinel A4 capability, the Sentinel Product Office plans to make available a defined interface to the existing Sentinel A3 Signal Data Processor (SDP) and software, to which a new antenna assembly can be added. This antenna assembly would include advanced technologies (e.g., Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) technology) and interface to the existing SDP. A new antenna assembly will also require new equipment solutions or modifications to the platform, power systems, cooling systems, rotational assembly, and beam steering. The Sentinel Product Office will consider changes to the SDP or a new SDP hardware solution to support a new antenna assembly design. We encourage respondents to suggest alternatives to this approach.</p>
<p>5. Candidate technical solutions must be ready to enter Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD as defined in DoD Instruction 5000.02), without a prior Government funded technology demonstration, in Fiscal Year (FY) 2019. Should an award be made, the selected contractor must be ready to hold a Preliminary Design Review in FY 2020 and must have prototype hardware ready for developmental testing, to include qualification and performance testing, in FY 2021 (28 months following EMD contract award).</p>
<p>6. Candidate technical solutions must address the ability and risks to enter Low Rate Initial Production in FY 2023 and Full Rate Production in FY 2025.</p>
<p>7. Candidate technical solutions must be supported by production facilities and proven processes to deliver up to 30 Sentinel A4 antenna assemblies per year. The Government plans to procure 199 antenna assemblies through FY 2032.</p>
<p>8. Candidate technical solutions must include a cost-effective 20-year sustainment plan for the 199 radars that includes Government organic support.</p>
<p>9. The desired Sentinel A4 technology is primarily for United States employment but must have a variant that can be approved for Foreign Military Sales (FMS) to existing and new Sentinel FMS customers.</p>
<p>10. Candidate technical solutions must be supported by current demonstrated company experience with advanced X-Band radars.<br />11. Candidate technical solutions must demonstrate that the resulting Sentinel A4 can be produced and sustained in a cost-effective manner.</p>

<DESC>The US Army Program Executive Office, Missiles and Space Cruise Missile Defense Systems (CMDS) Project Office is conducting market research to determine if there are potential sources with the capability to provide a high performance modification, designated as the Sentinel A4, for the AN/MPQ-64A3 (Sentinel A3) short range Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD) radar.
<p>Pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.2, this notice is being issued as a REQUEST FOR INFORMATION. In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not an offer and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. No contract award is intended as a result of this request. THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY. This Request for Information is issued solely for information and planning purposes - it does not constitute a Request for Proposal or a promise to issue a Request for Proposal in the future. This request for information does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. The Government will not pay for the information received. The Government Point of Contact (POC) will be Mr. Johnny L. Keith, US Army Contracting Command-Redstone, Attn: CCAM-SM-T, Redstone Arsenal, AL 35898, and can be contacted via e-mail: johnny.l.keith.civ@mail.mil. Mail or Email responses only, no phone calls. The response cut off time is Monday,&nbsp;23 May 2016 by 1500 CST.</p>
<p>Per FAR 52.215-3, Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes:</p>
<p>a.) The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this solicitation or to otherwise pay for the information solicited except as an allowable cost under other contracts as provided in subsection 31.205-18, bid and proposal costs, of the FAR.</p>
<p>b.) Although "proposed", "proposal", and "offeror" may be used in this Request for Information, your response will be treated as information only. It shall not be used as a proposal.</p>
<p>c.) This solicitation is issued for the purpose of acquiring information to modify or replace the Army's AN/MPQ-64A3 Sentinel A3 radar.</p>
<p>SENTINEL RADAR.</p>
<p>The Sentinel Radar is a major component of the Army IAMD System of Systems architecture, providing a surveillance and fire control capability against low altitude air breathing threats, to include Cruise Missiles (CM), Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS), fixed wing, rotary-wing, and future capabilities against Rocket, Artillery and Mortar (RAM) threats.</p>
<p>Sentinel, currently deployed in its A3 configuration, provides a critical capability for the acquisition, tracking, classification, discrimination, and identification of aerial threats and cueing and track data to support Beyond Line of Site engagements. It provides air coverage in the forward area (Corps, Division, and Brigade sectors) by providing vital information for timely decision making by the commander, and accurate targeting information to the supported weapon systems. Sentinel also tracks friendly UAS and aircraft, providing support for airspace management de-confliction and fires de-confliction. It provides continuous volume surveillance of friendly and hostile aircraft to enhance protection of friendly aircraft from fratricide.</p>
<p>The Sentinel A3 is an X-band, three dimensional, 360&deg; azimuth coverage, phased array air defense radar with a nominal 75 kilometer instrumented range. The system is equipped with Electronic Counter-Counter-Measure (ECCM) capabilities, a Mode 5 Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) subsystem for positive identification of friendly aircraft, and a suite of Non-Cooperative Target Recognition (NCTR) capabilities to identify threat aircraft. Sentinel is mounted on a Family of Medium Tactical Vehicles (FMTV) trailer, pulled by a M1082 FMTV truck hosting a 10 kW tactical generator and the command and control interface. Sentinel interfaces with the IAMD Battle Command system, the Forward Area Air Defense Command and Control (FAAD C2) system, and the National Capital Region Integrated Air Defense command and control system.</p>
<p>In order to ensure meeting its mission requirements and to address future Counter-RAM requirements, CMDS plans to modify the Sentinel A3 radar to an A4 configuration that will employ advanced sensor technologies to improve capabilities and performance. The Sentinel A4 will counter the advancing threat evolution in the short range IAMD mission area. These future threats include reduced signature CM targets, smaller and slower UAS targets, and RAM. The RAM threats include both short range (couple/few km) and longer range (low hundreds of km) large caliber rockets (240mm, 300mm), rockets (107mm, 122mm), artillery (122mm, 152mm), and mortars (60mm, 82mm, 120mm).</p>
<p>SENTINEL A4 REQUIREMENTS. <br /><br />Respondents to this Request for Information (RFI) must satisfactorily address the following requirements in their response:</p>
<p>1. The Sentinel A4 must meet or exceed all current Sentinel A3 requirements contained in the Draft Revised Sentinel A3 Requirements Document. The Sentinel Product Office will make this Requirements Document (DRAFT, classified SECRET) available to potential respondents to this RFI.</p>
<p>2. To counter the new threat, the Sentinel A4 must exceed selected A3 threshold performance requirements. The Sentinel A4 requires a greater than 75% increase in range performance, three times the search volume, and twice the track loading capability. A greater than two times increase in track accuracy is required. Performance is required while operating under very stressing radar environments (e.g., electronic attack; anti-radiation weapons; direction finding sensors; mountain, sea, and urban clutter; biological fliers; etc.).</p>
<p>3. Candidate technical solutions to this RFI must currently be at a demonstrated Technology Readiness Level of six or higher (TRL 6).</p>
<p>4. To support a modification of the current Sentinel A3 to a Sentinel A4 capability, the Sentinel Product Office plans to make available a defined interface to the existing Sentinel A3 Signal Data Processor (SDP) and software, to which a new antenna assembly can be added. This antenna assembly would include advanced technologies (e.g., Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) technology) and interface to the existing SDP. A new antenna assembly will also require new equipment solutions or modifications to the platform, power systems, cooling systems, rotational assembly, and beam steering. The Sentinel Product Office will consider changes to the SDP or a new SDP hardware solution to support a new antenna assembly design. We encourage respondents to suggest alternatives to this approach.</p>
<p>5. Candidate technical solutions must be ready to enter Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD as defined in DoD Instruction 5000.02), without a prior Government funded technology demonstration, in Fiscal Year (FY) 2019. Should an award be made, the selected contractor must be ready to hold a Preliminary Design Review in FY 2020 and must have prototype hardware ready for developmental testing, to include qualification and performance testing, in FY 2021 (28 months following EMD contract award).</p>
<p>6. Candidate technical solutions must address the ability and risks to enter Low Rate Initial Production in FY 2023 and Full Rate Production in FY 2025.</p>
<p>7. Candidate technical solutions must be supported by production facilities and proven processes to deliver up to 30 Sentinel A4 antenna assemblies per year. The Government plans to procure 199 antenna assemblies through FY 2032.</p>
<p>8. Candidate technical solutions must include a cost-effective 20-year sustainment plan for the 199 radars that includes Government organic support.</p>
<p>9. The desired Sentinel A4 technology is primarily for United States employment but must have a variant that can be approved for Foreign Military Sales (FMS) to existing and new Sentinel FMS customers.</p>
<p>10. Candidate technical solutions must be supported by current demonstrated company experience with advanced X-Band radars.<br />11. Candidate technical solutions must demonstrate that the resulting Sentinel A4 can be produced and sustained in a cost-effective manner.</p>

In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not an offer and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. No contract award is intended as a result of this request.  THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY.  This Request for Information is issued solely for information and planning purposes - it does not constitute a Request for Proposal or a promise to issue a Request for Proposal in the future.  This request for information does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever.  The Government Point of Contact (POC) will be Mr. Johnny L. Keith, US Army Contracting Command-Redstone, Attn: CCAM-SM-T, Redstone Arsenal, AL 35898, and can be contacted via e-mail: johnny.l.keith.civ@mail.mil. Mail or Email responses only, no phone calls. The response cut off time is Monday, 23 May 2016 by 1500 CST.</p>
<p>Per FAR 52.215-3, Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes:</p>
<p>a.)	The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this solicitation or to otherwise pay for the information solicited except as an allowable cost under other contracts as provided in subsection 31.205-18, bid and proposal costs, of the FAR.</p>
<p>b.)	Although "proposed", "proposal", and "offeror" may be used in this Request for Information, your response will be treated as information only.  It shall not be used as a proposal.</p>
<p>c.)	This solicitation is issued for the purpose of acquiring information to modify or replace the Army's AN/MPQ-64A3 Sentinel A3 radar.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>SENTINEL RADAR.</p>
<p>The Sentinel Radar is a major component of the Army IAMD System of Systems architecture, providing a surveillance and fire control capability against low altitude air breathing threats, to include Cruise Missiles (CM), Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS), fixed wing, rotary-wing, and future capabilities against Rocket, Artillery and Mortar (RAM) threats.</p>
<p>Sentinel, currently deployed in its A3 configuration, provides a critical capability for the acquisition, tracking, classification, discrimination, and identification of aerial threats and cueing and track data to support Beyond Line of Site engagements.  It provides air coverage in the forward area (Corps, Division, and Brigade sectors) by providing vital information for timely decision making by the commander, and accurate targeting information to the supported weapon systems.  Sentinel also tracks friendly UAS and aircraft, providing support for airspace management de-confliction and fires de-confliction.  It provides continuous volume surveillance of friendly and hostile aircraft to enhance protection of friendly aircraft from fratricide.</p>
<p>The Sentinel A3 is an X-band, three dimensional, 360&deg; azimuth coverage, phased array air defense radar with a nominal 75 kilometer instrumented range.  The system is equipped with Electronic Counter-Counter-Measure (ECCM) capabilities, a Mode 5 Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) subsystem for positive identification of friendly aircraft, and a suite of Non-Cooperative Target Recognition (NCTR) capabilities to identify threat aircraft.  Sentinel is mounted on a Family of Medium Tactical Vehicles (FMTV) trailer, pulled by a M1082 FMTV truck hosting a 10 kW tactical generator and the command and control interface.   Sentinel interfaces with the IAMD Battle Command system, the Forward Area Air Defense Command and Control (FAAD C2) system, and the National Capital Region Integrated Air Defense command and control system.</p>
<p>In order to ensure meeting its mission requirements and to address future Counter-RAM requirements, CMDS plans to modify the Sentinel A3 radar to an A4 configuration that will employ advanced sensor technologies to improve capabilities and performance.  The Sentinel A4 will counter the advancing threat evolution in the short range IAMD mission area. These future threats include reduced signature CM targets, smaller and slower UAS targets, and RAM.  The RAM threats include both short range (couple/few km) and longer range (low hundreds of km) large caliber rockets (240mm, 300mm), rockets (107mm, 122mm), artillery (122mm, 152mm), and mortars (60mm, 82mm, 120mm).</p>
<p>SENTINEL A4 REQUIREMENTS. <br /> <br />Respondents to this Request for Information (RFI) must satisfactorily address the following requirements in their response: <br />1.	The Sentinel A4 must meet or exceed all current Sentinel A3 requirements contained in the Draft Revised Sentinel A3 Requirements Document. The Sentinel Product Office will make this Requirements Document (DRAFT, classified SECRET) available to potential respondents to this RFI.</p>
<p>2.	To counter the new threat, the Sentinel A4 must exceed selected A3 threshold performance requirements.   The Sentinel A4 requires a greater than 75% increase in range performance, three times the search volume, and twice the track loading capability.    A greater than two times increase in track accuracy is required.  Performance is required while operating under very stressing radar environments (e.g., electronic attack; anti-radiation weapons; direction finding sensors; mountain, sea, and urban clutter; biological fliers; etc.). While increasing range performance also increases search area, the Government is also interested in any increased elevation performance that a new antenna design may provide.</p>
<p>3.	Candidate technical solutions to this RFI must currently be at a demonstrated Technology Readiness Level of six or higher (TRL 6).</p>
<p>4.	To support a modification of the current Sentinel A3 to a Sentinel A4 capability, the Sentinel Product Office plans to make available a defined interface to the existing Sentinel A3 Signal Data Processor (SDP) and software, to which a new antenna assembly can be added.  This antenna assembly would include advanced technologies (e.g., Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) technology) and interface to the existing SDP.  A new antenna assembly will also require new equipment solutions or modifications to the platform, power systems, cooling systems, rotational assembly, and beam steering.  The Sentinel Product Office will consider changes to the SDP or a new SDP hardware solution to support a new antenna assembly design. We encourage respondents to suggest alternatives to this approach.</p>
<p>5.	Additional Information:</p>
<p>a.)	Classified appendix numbers are for the current radar unless specifically identified as IFPC requirements.  The Sentinel A4 Radar requirements are still in development but are expected to be at least 1.75 times the current specification values.</p>
<p>b.)	The current antenna with all accoutrements weights approximately 600 pounds.  A Sentinel A4 Radar is expected to be heavier and will require a new drive and mounting system.</p>
<p>c.)	The current Sentinel power requirement is 6.5KW 400HZ 3 phase 115V L-N.  This power is currently supplied by a 10 KW generator.  In addition to the Sentinel load, an additional 2KW load is required for additional systems mounted on Sentinel for a total of 8.5KW.  Standard MEP 30 and 60KW (or greater) generators will be provided as GFE dependent on Sentinel A4 Radar power requirements.</p>
<p>d.)	The IFF output power is currently 200W and a new antenna will be required to increase the IFF range so that it matches the radar maximum range.  A new IFF antenna will need to be part of the Sentinel A4 Radar effort.</p>
<p>e.)	The Sentinel A4 Radar will require an entirely new search, track, and classification balance scheme.  The current Sentinel A3 Radar scheme would not be valid for the Sentinel A4 Radar.</p>
<p>f.)	Currently, there are two X-band waveguides that pass through the rotary joint, and the rotary joint also supports several digital control lines and IFF data.  An exciter, power amplifier and receiver are below the rotary joint and the IFF connects to an A/D converter located on a daughter board in the signal data processor.  There are control lines from the SDP through a transmitted control unit that control the PAMs and Receiver/Exciter.  The IFF must function in a Stop and Stare configuration and needs to be steerable (either electronically or mechanically) over the Sentinel A4 Radar antenna field of view.  The comprehensive interface document is being developed but is not available at this time.  The interface documentation will be provided upon request with the release of the Final RFI, planned for next year.</p>
<p>6.	Candidate technical solutions must be ready to enter Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD as defined in DoD Instruction 5000.02), without a prior Government funded technology demonstration, in Fiscal Year (FY) 2019.  Should an award be made, the selected contractor must be ready to hold a Preliminary Design Review in FY 2020 and must have prototype hardware ready for developmental testing, to include qualification and performance testing, in FY 2021 (28 months following EMD contract award).</p>
<p>7.	Candidate technical solutions must address the ability and risks to enter Low Rate Initial Production in FY 2023 and Full Rate Production in FY 2025.</p>
<p>8.	Candidate technical solutions must be supported by production facilities and proven processes to deliver up to 30 Sentinel A4 antenna assemblies per year.  The Government plans to procure 199 antenna assemblies through FY 2032.</p>
<p>9.	Candidate technical solutions must include a cost-effective 20-year sustainment plan for the 199 radars that includes Government organic support.</p>
<p>10.	The desired Sentinel A4 technology is primarily for United States employment but must have a variant that can be approved for Foreign Military Sales (FMS) to existing and new Sentinel FMS customers.</p>
<p>11.	Candidate technical solutions must be supported by current demonstrated company experience with advanced X-Band radars.</p>
<p>12.	Candidate technical solutions must demonstrate that the resulting Sentinel A4 can be produced and sustained in a cost-effective manner.</p>

<CONTACT>Johnny L. Keith , Mr., Email johnny.l.keith.civ@mail.mil
<DESC>SYNOPSIS. <br /><br />The US Army Program Executive Office, Missiles and Space Cruise Missile Defense Systems (CMDS) Project Office is conducting market research to determine if there are potential sources with the capability to provide a high performance modification, designated as the Sentinel A4, for the AN/MPQ-64A3 (Sentinel A3) short range Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD) radar.
<p>Pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.2, this notice is being issued as a REQUEST FOR INFORMATION. In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not an offer and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. No contract award is intended as a result of this request. THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY. This Request for Information is issued solely for information and planning purposes - it does not constitute a Request for Proposal or a promise to issue a Request for Proposal in the future. This request for information does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. The Government Point of Contact (POC) will be Mr. Johnny L. Keith, US Army Contracting Command-Redstone, Attn: CCAM-SM-T, Redstone Arsenal, AL 35898, and can be contacted via e-mail: johnny.l.keith.civ@mail.mil. Mail or Email responses only, no phone calls. The response cut off time is Monday, 23 May 2016 by 1500 CST.</p>
<p>Per FAR 52.215-3, Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes:</p>
<p>a.) The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this solicitation or to otherwise pay for the information solicited except as an allowable cost under other contracts as provided in subsection 31.205-18, bid and proposal costs, of the FAR.</p>
<p>b.) Although "proposed", "proposal", and "offeror" may be used in this Request for Information, your response will be treated as information only. It shall not be used as a proposal.</p>
<p>c.) This solicitation is issued for the purpose of acquiring information to modify or replace the Army's AN/MPQ-64A3 Sentinel A3 radar.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>SENTINEL RADAR.</p>
<p>The Sentinel Radar is a major component of the Army IAMD System of Systems architecture, providing a surveillance and fire control capability against low altitude air breathing threats, to include Cruise Missiles (CM), Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS), fixed wing, rotary-wing, and future capabilities against Rocket, Artillery and Mortar (RAM) threats.</p>
<p>Sentinel, currently deployed in its A3 configuration, provides a critical capability for the acquisition, tracking, classification, discrimination, and identification of aerial threats and cueing and track data to support Beyond Line of Site engagements. It provides air coverage in the forward area (Corps, Division, and Brigade sectors) by providing vital information for timely decision making by the commander, and accurate targeting information to the supported weapon systems. Sentinel also tracks friendly UAS and aircraft, providing support for airspace management de-confliction and fires de-confliction. It provides continuous volume surveillance of friendly and hostile aircraft to enhance protection of friendly aircraft from fratricide.</p>
<p>The Sentinel A3 is an X-band, three dimensional, 360&deg; azimuth coverage, phased array air defense radar with a nominal 75 kilometer instrumented range. The system is equipped with Electronic Counter-Counter-Measure (ECCM) capabilities, a Mode 5 Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) subsystem for positive identification of friendly aircraft, and a suite of Non-Cooperative Target Recognition (NCTR) capabilities to identify threat aircraft. Sentinel is mounted on a Family of Medium Tactical Vehicles (FMTV) trailer, pulled by a M1082 FMTV truck hosting a 10 kW tactical generator and the command and control interface. Sentinel interfaces with the IAMD Battle Command system, the Forward Area Air Defense Command and Control (FAAD C2) system, and the National Capital Region Integrated Air Defense command and control system.</p>
<p>In order to ensure meeting its mission requirements and to address future Counter-RAM requirements, CMDS plans to modify the Sentinel A3 radar to an A4 configuration that will employ advanced sensor technologies to improve capabilities and performance. The Sentinel A4 will counter the advancing threat evolution in the short range IAMD mission area. These future threats include reduced signature CM targets, smaller and slower UAS targets, and RAM. The RAM threats include both short range (couple/few km) and longer range (low hundreds of km) large caliber rockets (240mm, 300mm), rockets (107mm, 122mm), artillery (122mm, 152mm), and mortars (60mm, 82mm, 120mm).</p>
<p>SENTINEL A4 REQUIREMENTS. <br /><br />Respondents to this Request for Information (RFI) must satisfactorily address the following requirements in their response: <br />1. The Sentinel A4 must meet or exceed all current Sentinel A3 requirements contained in the Draft Revised Sentinel A3 Requirements Document. The Sentinel Product Office will make this Requirements Document (DRAFT, classified SECRET) available to potential respondents to this RFI.</p>
<p>2. To counter the new threat, the Sentinel A4 must exceed selected A3 threshold performance requirements. The Sentinel A4 requires a greater than 75% increase in range performance, three times the search volume, and twice the track loading capability. A greater than two times increase in track accuracy is required. Performance is required while operating under very stressing radar environments (e.g., electronic attack; anti-radiation weapons; direction finding sensors; mountain, sea, and urban clutter; biological fliers; etc.). While increasing range performance also increases search area, the Government is also interested in any increased elevation performance that a new antenna design may provide.</p>
<p>3. Candidate technical solutions to this RFI must currently be at a demonstrated Technology Readiness Level of six or higher (TRL 6).</p>
<p>4. To support a modification of the current Sentinel A3 to a Sentinel A4 capability, the Sentinel Product Office plans to make available a defined interface to the existing Sentinel A3 Signal Data Processor (SDP) and software, to which a new antenna assembly can be added. This antenna assembly would include advanced technologies (e.g., Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) technology) and interface to the existing SDP. A new antenna assembly will also require new equipment solutions or modifications to the platform, power systems, cooling systems, rotational assembly, and beam steering. The Sentinel Product Office will consider changes to the SDP or a new SDP hardware solution to support a new antenna assembly design. We encourage respondents to suggest alternatives to this approach.</p>
<p>5. Additional Information: The Government is not asking for a fully new radar system. The following information is provided so that potential respondents can consider how their new antenna subsystem can best be designed and integrated into the existing Sentinel system to meet desired performance.</p>
<p>a.) Classified appendix numbers are for the current radar unless specifically identified as IFPC requirements. The Sentinel A4 Radar requirements are still in development but are expected to be at least 1.75 times the current specification values.</p>
<p>b.) The current antenna with all accoutrements weights approximately 600 pounds. A Sentinel A4 Radar is expected to be heavier and will require a new drive and mounting system.</p>
<p>c.) The current Sentinel power requirement is 6.5KW 400HZ 3 phase 115V L-N. This power is currently supplied by a 10 KW generator. In addition to the Sentinel load, an additional 2KW load is required for additional systems mounted on Sentinel for a total of 8.5KW. Standard MEP 30 and 60KW (or greater) generators will be provided as GFE dependent on Sentinel A4 Radar power requirements.</p>
<p>d.) The IFF output power is currently 200W and a new antenna will be required to increase the IFF range so that it matches the radar maximum range. A new IFF antenna will need to be part of the Sentinel A4 Radar effort.</p>
<p>e.) The Sentinel A4 Radar will require an entirely new search, track, and classification balance scheme. The current Sentinel A3 Radar scheme would not be valid for the Sentinel A4 Radar.</p>
<p>f.) Currently, there are two X-band waveguides that pass through the rotary joint, and the rotary joint also supports several digital control lines and IFF data. An exciter, power amplifier and receiver are below the rotary joint and the IFF connects to an A/D converter located on a daughter board in the signal data processor. There are control lines from the SDP through a transmitted control unit that control the PAMs and Receiver/Exciter. The IFF must function in a Stop and Stare configuration and needs to be steerable (either electronically or mechanically) over the Sentinel A4 Radar antenna field of view. The comprehensive interface document is being developed but is not available at this time. The interface documentation will be provided upon request with the release of the Final RFI, planned for next year.</p>
<p>6. Candidate technical solutions must be ready to enter Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD as defined in DoD Instruction 5000.02), without a prior Government funded technology demonstration, in Fiscal Year (FY) 2019. Should an award be made, the selected contractor must be ready to hold a Preliminary Design Review in FY 2020 and must have prototype hardware ready for developmental testing, to include qualification and performance testing, in FY 2021 (28 months following EMD contract award).</p>
<p>7. Candidate technical solutions must address the ability and risks to enter Low Rate Initial Production in FY 2023 and Full Rate Production in FY 2025.</p>
<p>8. Candidate technical solutions must be supported by production facilities and proven processes to deliver up to 30 Sentinel A4 antenna assemblies per year. The Government plans to procure 199 antenna assemblies through FY 2032.</p>
<p>9. Candidate technical solutions must include a cost-effective 20-year sustainment plan for the 199 radars that includes Government organic support.</p>
<p>10. The desired Sentinel A4 technology is primarily for United States employment but must have a variant that can be approved for Foreign Military Sales (FMS) to existing and new Sentinel FMS customers.</p>
<p>11. Candidate technical solutions must be supported by current demonstrated company experience with advanced X-Band radars.</p>
<p>12. Candidate technical solutions must demonstrate that the resulting Sentinel A4 can be produced and sustained in a cost-effective manner.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Sentinel A4 Development <br />Notification of Industry Day</p>
<p>SYNOPSIS.</p>
<p>The US Army Cruise Missile Defense Systems (CMDS) Project Office will be conducting exchanges of information among all interested parties to determine how the Government can best procure a high-performance modification of the Sentinel A3 (AN/MPQ-64A3) short-range Integrated Air and Missile Defense radar to result in the Sentinel A4 (AN/MPQ-64A4). The purpose of exchanging information is to improve the understanding of Government requirements and industry capabilities, thereby allowing potential offerors to judge whether or how they can satisfy the Government's requirements. This information exchange also enhances the Government's ability to obtain quality supplies and services at reasonable prices and increases efficiency in proposal preparation, proposal evaluation, negotiation, and contract award.</p>
<p>Pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.2, the Government is issuing this notice as a REQUEST FOR INFORMATION. THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY. In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not an offer and the Government cannot accept any resulting information to form a binding contract. The Government is issuing this Request for Information (RFI) solely to obtain information for planning purposes; it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. This RFI does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. The clause at FAR 52.215-3 (Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes) applies to this RFI.</p>
<p>The Government Contact is Mr. Johnny L. Keith, US Army Contracting Command-Redstone; Attn: CCAM-SM-T, Redstone Arsenal, AL 35898; e-mail: johnny.l.keith.civ@mail.mil. Mail or e-mail responses only; no phone calls.</p>
<p>SENTINEL RADAR.</p>
<p>The Government has a requirement to modify the Army's Sentinel A3 (AN/MPQ-64A3) air defense radar. The current Sentinel radar fills a unique position in the air and missile defense architecture not met by any other existing sensor. The Sentinel A3 is approaching obsolescence end-of-life on several components, and the current configuration requires modification to meet performance requirements against projected future threats. To address these concerns, the Government will modify the Sentinel A3 with new radar technologies.<br />The resulting modification, the Sentinel A4 (AN/MPQ-64A4), will be a mobile, three-dimensional X-band phased array radar system equipped to support beyond visual range air defense engagements. The Sentinel A4 will incorporate new technologies that address current Sentinel A3 obsolescence issues and improve existing Sentinel capability against Cruise Missile (CM), Unmanned Aerial System (UAS), rotary wing, and fixed wing threats. The Sentinel A4 also adds detection, classification, identification, and reporting capability against Rocket, Artillery, and Mortar (RAM) threats to support the Indirect Fire Protection Capability (IFPC) Increment 2-Intercept Block 2 mission.</p>
<p>To procure the Sentinel A4, the Government is planning to issue a full-and-open competitive RFP in early Fiscal Year (FY) 18, leading to a contract award in mid-FY19. The solicitation will cover the Sentinel A4 Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD), Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP), and initial fielding.</p>
<p>INITIAL INDUSTRY DAY.</p>
<p>CMDS invites interested Offerors to a Government-sponsored Industry Day to initially discuss the Sentinel A4 requirement. Industry Day is open to all interested U.S. firms. Offerors are encouraged to participate and ask questions to ensure a complete understanding of the Sentinel A4 requirement and schedule. Industry Day details follow.</p>

Following your registration, the Industry Day POC will provide additional information on the event.</p>
<p>The Government will conduct the Industry Day activities in two parts: (1) a session comprised of panel discussions providing acquisition-planning information for the Sentinel A4 requirement; and (2) an open Question and Answer (Q&amp;A) session between Sentinel A4 personnel and prospective industry teams. Industry teams are encouraged to submit written questions prior to the Industry Day to the Industry Day POC listed above. This event is an open exchange with industry and no answers given will be considered official or binding on the part of the Government. No unauthorized recording of an lndustry Day event is permitted.</p>
<p>INFORMATION EXCHANGES. <br /><br />This RFI is a follow-on to Sentinel A4 RFI number W31P4Q-16-R-0104, issued on 21 March 2016. Following Industry Day, the Government desires to hold one-on-one information exchange discussions with those parties that have a serious interest to bid as a prime contractor for this requirement, including those who responded to the prior Sentinel A4 RFI. The Government wishes to hold individual discussions to gain additional information and clarification and to offer industry the opportunity to discuss this requirement with the Government. If you did not respond to the previous RFI, please submit evidence of your intention to submit a bid as a prime contractor to this requirement prior to scheduling a discussion session.</p>
<p>The Government will limit each discussion session to one (1) hour. The Government requests that each respondent bring a team not to exceed four (4) people. Please include technical experts in addition to business development staff. The respondent should plan to spend the first twenty (20) minutes of the discussion session summarizing their Sentinel A4 concept. Hard-copy briefing charts are preferred. Send them to the Government prior to the session. The remaining time will be open discussions. The Government reserves the right to share any non-proprietary information exchanged during the one-on-one sessions with all potential offerors. The sessions will be at the SECRET classification level, and limited to the Sentinel A4 requirement. These one-on-one meetings require visit requests.</p>
<p>RESPONSE INSTRUCTIONS FOR DISCUSSION SESSIONS.</p>
<p>Please contact the Industry Day Government POC listed above to schedule a one-on-one discussion session. After your registration, the Government will provide additional details and where to send your read-ahead material.

Pursuant to FAR Part 9.505-4, non-Government support contractors must execute an agreement with each RFI industry respondent that states that they will (1) protect the respondent's information from unauthorized use or disclosure for as long as it remains proprietary and (2) refrain from using the information for any purpose other than which it was furnished. Each respondent must identify proprietary information and each respondent must be willing to sign non-disclosure agreements with the non-Government support contractors listed below so the Government can properly protect the proprietary information submitted.

<DESC>The Federal Bureau of Prisons is seeking concerns having the ability for providing Residential Reentry Center (RRC) services (in-house RRC beds) and Home Confinement services (home confinement placements) for male and female Federal offenders held under the authority of United States Statutes located within the counties of Cumberland, Ocean, Burlington, or Gloucester, New Jersey.
<p><br />Both the RRC services for in-house RRC beds and the Home Confinement services for home confinement placements shall be in accordance with the Federal Bureau of Prisons Statement of Work entitled, "Residential Reentry Center, May, 2015". Home Confinement services (for home confinement placements) are specifically defined in chapter 10, programs, of the aforementioned SOW.

<p>This will be a Firm-Fixed Price contract for services with a one year base period, and four one-year options periods.</p>
<p>The RRC In-House requirement will consist of a 25 bed facility in which 20 beds will be designated for males and 5 beds designated for females.</p>
<p>The Home Confinement requirement will consist of 10 placements to include both male and female. The Home Confinement Radius will be within 150 miles of the facility.</p>
<p>It is the intent of the Government to award both line items (RRC in-house beds and home confinement placements) to a single provider, as these services are interconnected and rely upon each other to ensure adequate programming and case management of offenders. The Government reserves the right to potentially make an award which is deemed to be in the best interest of the Government.</p>
<p>RFP-200-1354-ES will be available on or about August 9, 2016, and it will be distributed solely through the General Services Administration's Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website at http://www.fbo.gov.

<p>All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by this agency. No collect calls will be accepted. No telephone request or written requests for the solicitation will be accepted.</p>
<p>Faith-Based and Community Organizations can submit offers/bids/quotations equally with other organizations for contracts for which they are eligible.</p>

<DESC>Amendment 00001

The purpose of this amendment is to 1) clarify the due date. The due date for responses to this market survey is November 16, 2016 and 2) to provide a copy of the market survey questions and answers. See attached. 


______________________________________________________________
Introduction/Purpose 

This market survey announcement is issued in accordance with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Acquisition Management System (AMS) Policy section 3.2.1.2.1 Market Analysis. The purpose of this Market Survey is to seek and identify interest in the program and understand existing capabilities of the market. This will be accomplished by obtaining and assessing industry responses to specific market survey questions contained herein. 

Background 

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has a requirement to provide automated Invoice Financial Management Services (IFMS). The current IFMS contract provides the FAA with turn-key services for the automated review and reconciliation of CLIN-based telecommunications invoices and other related services. A major focus of the IFMS contract is the review and reconciliation of invoices associated with the FAA Telecommunications Infrastructure (FTI) contract. The FAA has decided to extend the FTI contract to 2022, but the IFMS contract currently expires at the end of October 2017. To ensure no disruption to the automated invoice review and reconciliation functions, the FAA is performing market research of industry capabilities to provide the required services.
A contract line item number (CLIN) is a billing unit frequently used on Government contracts for cost recovery. The format of CLINs is generally contract-specific. CLINs have a defined unit price. On an individual monthly invoice, the same CLIN may be invoiced in association with multiple telecommunications services. The invoiced quantity is defined on a per-service basis by the associated service order.  There can be functional relationships between CLINs based on the corresponding network elements, i.e., the presence of one type of CLIN on the invoice may necessitate or preclude the presence of another CLIN on the invoice.

Specific Questions:

1A. Does your firm perform automated review and reconciliation of CLIN-based telecommunications invoices? 
Note:  If the answer to Question 1A is No, Questions 1B, 1C, 1D and all parts of Questions 2 and 3 are not applicable. 
1B. What is the maximum number of telecommunications services you have processed on a single monthly invoice for a particular client? 
1C. What is the maximum number of unique CLINs you have processed on a single monthly invoice for a particular client? 
1D. What is the maximum dollar value of a single monthly invoice you have processed for a particular client?
2A. Do the invoices processed by your firm include credits for the violation of Service Level Agreement (SLA) conditions? If so,
2B. What is the maximum number of SLA conditions processed for a particular client?
Note:  An example of an SLA condition is:  If a service outage is not restored within n minutes, an invoice credit of x% of the monthly recurring charge for the service must be provided on the next invoice.
3A. What best describes the tool your firm has used to perform automated review and reconciliation of telecommunications invoices? If your firm has used different tools for different clients, please base your response on the tool you feel is most relevant to the application described in the Background section. 
i.	Custom developed 
ii.	Modified version of a proprietary tool
iii.	Modified version of a commercial-off the shelf (COTS) product.  Name of COTS product: ________
iv.	None of the above. Explanation: _____________________________________________________
3B. If your response to 3A is ii or iii, please provide an estimate of the percentage of modifications required and provide the basis for the percentage, e.g., lines of code, function points, etc. Also, what was the cost (to the client) and amount of time required to complete the modifications?
3C. Does your firm provide a secure, web-accessible user interface for clients to access, run queries, and generate custom and ad hoc reports on the invoice source data and the results of the invoice processing, e.g., discrepancies identified?
4A. Does your firm perform automated generation of expensing recommendations between telecommunications invoice charges and accounting codes that should be used to pay the charges? If so,
4B. What is the maximum number of active accounting codes tracked for a particular client?
4C. What is the maximum number of expensing rules for a particular client?
Note:  An example of an expensing rule is:   If amendments or change orders have been processed that specify a new funding source that replaces funding sources cited on prior versions of the service order, charges shall be expensed against the accounting code specified on the latest revision of the service order.

<DESC><p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">INDUSTRY DAY</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>LCS Execution Planning - Single Award IDIQ</strong> <br />Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) will hold an Industry Day conference on Tuesday, 06 December 2016 at Naval Base San Diego, CA in COMNAVSURFPAC - 3M and Career Counselor Office BLDG 3416. The event will begin at 0930 and conclude at 1530 PST. This time will allow for networking opportunities among industry teams. The conference will be hosted by Naval Sea Systems Command SEA 024 and PMS 505 for the purpose of discussing the Navy's plan for LCS sustainment execution planning.</p>
<p>The Industry Day will begin with a discussion and overview of the contemplated requirement and planned contract strategy. This contract is intended to be awarded as a single award IDIQ and will address all execution planning for maintenance and repair efforts for LCS Class ships homeported in and visiting Mayport, Florida and San Diego, California, CONUS and OCONUS for a 5 year period.<br /><br /><strong>RSVP:</strong> NAVSEA requests that firms interested in attending the Industry Day submit company names and attendee lists no later than 1400 Eastern Time, 28 November 2016 via e-mail to Ms. Kelsey Blaskoski, SEA 024, Contract Specialist, kelsey.blaskoski@navy.mil. The subject line of the RSVP email shall be limited to: Industry Day RSVP from (Company Name). The body of the email shall include each attendee's name, Position/Title, email address, phone number, and indicate whether they have submitted the visit request to the SWRMC POC or taken the appropriate steps to access the base. Companies are asked to send no more than four (4) representatives as seating is limited. (See attached Industry Day Agenda).</p>
<p><em>The presentation slides will be made available to those who RSVP.</em></p>
<p><strong>One-on-One Sessions:</strong> These sessions will only be held in person, in the MWR classroom next door to BLDG 3416 (the presentation location). The intent of these One-on-One sessions is to provide Industry a private, non-public forum to present the Government with comments, concerns and recommendations. Thus, the One-on-One sessions are designed to consist of mostly one-way communication (from the firm to the Government) as the Government does not intend to share contract strategy information outside of the larger and/or public forum. Companies requesting a One-on-One session must indicate such in their RSVP email. These sessions will be no longer than 20 minutes in length, may be attended by no more than 4 people per company, and will be scheduled on a first come first serve basis. The Government will inform attendees of their scheduled session time no later than 30 November 2016.</p>
<p><strong>General Stipulations and Disclaimers:</strong> Recording of the event is not permitted. Other than the planned briefing materials referenced, the Government does not plan to provide additional information for review and comment prior to the Industry Day. This announcement is not a contract, request for proposal, a promise to contract, or a commitment of any kind on the part of the Government. NAVSEA does not assume liability for costs incurred by an attendee or for travel expenses or marketing efforts; therefore, attendee costs in response to this notice are not considered an allowable direct charge to the Government.</p>
<p><em>This Special Notice does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a contract or order.</em></p>

<p>Architect Engineer and Construction Contracting Industry Day for Repair, Maintenance, Construction and Design Services for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Europe District Projects for Israeli Ministry of Defense (MOD) Facilities in Israel.</p>
<p>NAICS Code: 236220 - Commercial and Institutional Building Construction</p>
<p>Synopsis:</p>
<p>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Europe District, in conjunction with the Israeli MoD intend to be hold two (2) Industry Days to present the Israel Foreign Military Sales (FMS) - Construction Program. Presentations will be provided on future USACE Israel FMS construction Best Value contracts and the existing FY15 Israel Multiple Award Task Order Contract (MATOC).</p>
<p>The objective of the industry days is to provide information to interested United States construction contractors and architect engineer firms on the general scope of USACE design build and design bid build projects within Israel; typical infrastructure and facilities being procured; potential repair, maintenance and construction opportunities to support MoD facilities in Israel; as well as information on the solicitation and proposal process for best value and the FY15 Israel MATOC. All briefings will be presented in English with no translations.</p>
<p>Currently the Israel FMS Construction Program has $400,000,000 in on-going construction projects and $165,000,000 in Pre-award actions. The Program projects six (6) to ten (10) Best Value acquisitions ranging from $15M to $250M and approximately thirty (30) $1M to $15M additional task orders on the FY15 Israel MATOC over the next 2 years.</p>
<p>The FY15 Israel MATOC permits bringing on additional United States Contractor(s) under the On-Ramp procedures as planned for in the original Indefinite Deliver Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Solicitation W012GB-14-R-0030. Solicitation W912GB-17-R-0002 will be posted on FedBizOpps immediately after the completion of the Industry Days to solicit interested Contractors to submit Best Value proposals.</p>
<p>The FY15 Israel MATOC is a $249.5M construction IDIQ with a base year ($49.9M) and four (4) option years ($49.9M each). Six (6) contracts were awarded on 18 Jun 2015. The contracts are currently in Option Year 1 with Option Year 2 to be exercised in Jun 2017. The number of current active contracts is five (5). The On-Ramp procedures as provided in the initial solicitation and contracts awarded are:</p>
<p>"The Government reserves the right to re-open competition at any time during the term of the contract. The KO intends to periodically review the need for additional Contractors during the contract period of performance (PoP). If it is determined to be in the Government's best interest to add Contractors, an on-ramp may be executed. When an on-ramp is used, the Government will advertise the reopening of the competition on FedBizOpps. All new awardees shall meet the criteria established in the initial solicitation. The evaluation and selection of awardees for any on-ramp will be the same as the evaluation and award criteria used for the initial basic contract awards. The anticipated number of awards will be announced in the reopening announcement posted to FedBizOpps; however the PCO has the discretion to award more or fewer contracts than the number anticipated in the solicitation depending upon the quality of the offers received."</p>
<p>"Any Contractor that received a basic contract award shall not re-compete. The new awardee(s) will compete with any existing or remaining Contractors for all task orders. Any additions due to on-ramps will not impact the contract ceiling. The ordering period for new awardees will not extend the overall maximum term of the original contract, nor shall it re-establish the contract base period. The new awardee(s) will be eligible to compete for future task order requests for proposal issued against the basic IDIQ contract. The Government will not consider unsolicited request for additional Contractors."</p>

<DESC>Chapter VI: Other Than Full and Open Competition (OFOC) SOP
Attachment 4:  Single Source Justification for SAP under $150K

JUSTIFICATION FOR SINGLE SOURCE AWARDS IAW FAR 13.106-1
(OVER MICRO-PURCHASE THRESHOLD($3.5K) BUT NOT EXCEEDING THE SAT ($150K))
IAW FAR13.104, COs must promote competition to the maximum extent practicable to obtain supplies and services from the source whose offer is the most advantageous to the Government, considering the administrative cost of the purchase. When competition is not practicable, IAW FAR13.106-1(b), COs solicit from a single source for purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold.  COs may solicit from one source if the CO determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g., urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, brand-name or industrial mobilization). IAW FAR13.106-3(b)(3),COs are required to include additional statements explaining the absence of competition (see 13.106-1 for brand name purchases) if only one source is solicited and the acquisition does not exceed the simplified acquisition threshold (does not apply to an acquisition of utility services available from only one source) or supporting the award decision if other than price-related factors were considered in selecting the supplier.  This template when completed can be used to document single source awards IAW FAR13.106-3(b)(3).  Note: Statements such as "only known source" or "only source which can meet the required delivery date" are inadequate to support a sole source purchase.  
1. ACQUISITION PLAN ACTION ID: 
618-17-1-029-1231
1A. PROJECT/TASK No. NONE
1B. ESTIMATED AMOUNT: 
$83,430.00
2. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES OR SERVICES REQUIRED AND THE INTENDED USE:
A firm fixed price purchase order for 18 boxes of 10ML syringes, 5 per box, NG3510-5-US Adhesive Cryolife Bioglue. Bioglue begins to polymerize within 20 to 30 seconds and reaches full strength within two minutes.  Bioglue also adheres to synthetic graft materials through mechanical bonding within the interstices of the graft matrix and is used in the OR by the Cardiologists during open heart surgery.  Required by November 10th, 2016.  
3. UNIQUE CHARACTERISTICS THAT LIMIT AVAILABILITY TO ONLY ONE SOURCE, WITH THE REASON NO OTHER SUPPLIES OR SERVICES CAN BE USED:
This is critical for O.R. Surgical use.  This is used during open heart surgery and is used in connecting (gluing) arteries together during open heart procedures.  Research was conducted by Clinicians and this product was selected because it offered the best surgical outcomes.  Experience with other products has not provided the same quality, consistency and successful outcomes compared to BioGlue.  The Minneapolis VA clinical staff is trained to use this product.  Cryolife is the sole manufacturer, creator, distributor, and patent owner of BioGlue.  They are the only authorized seller of the BioGlue line in the United States.  Per Cryolife, there are no other authorized resellers.  Without this product the OR could not conduct the procedures and patients would have to wait or be fee based out to local hospitals.
