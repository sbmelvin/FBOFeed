<CONTACT>Richard R. White, Contract Specialist, Phone 3106539115, Email richard.white@losangeles.af.mil - 
<DESC>This is a Notice of Proposed Contract Action per FAR 5.203 (a). The United States Air Force Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC) Military Satellite Communications Systems Directorate intends to release a solicitation and to negotiate the purchase of a Fifth and Six Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) satellite and screening and analysis of parts for Space Vehicle Seven and Eight. The first four AEHF satellites will be launched in 2010-2017 after nine years of development. The Government believes only the incumbent Prime developer is capable of performing this work in accordance with only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. Any persons or companies interested in this notice are to respond to the requirement and submit their Statements of Capabilities to the respective Government Point of Contact. The responding Prime Contractor must be able to manufacture, integrate, test and deliver AEHF satellites having communications capabilities that are functional clones of the four AEHF satellites currently in production. Satellites must be fully backward compatible with existing ground infrastructure to include fielded Low Data Rate (LDR) and Medium Data Rate (MDR) terminals; in-development extended data rate (XDR) terminals; all elements of the AEHF Mission Control Segment; as well as planned or on-orbit Milstar and AEHF satellites via their crosslink communications. The Contractor must be able to perform complete spacecraft checkout in addition to inter-segment tests to include mission control, terminal, and key management interfaces. In addition, the Prime Contractor must have the ability to conduct on-orbit checkout, spacecraft and payload sustainment, and anomaly support. On-site locations include but are not limited to Schriever AFB. CO, Peterson AFB, CO, and Cape Canaveral AFB, FL. This notice is seeking only Prime Contractors, not suppliers of components, materials, software or services that may be used by a Prime Contractor to produce an AEHF satellite.
<p><br />Qualified sources (Prime Contractors only) must demonstrate the ability to produce these satellites with minimal investment by the Government in non-recurring engineering and high confidence of success. Qualified sources must additionally demonstrate all of the following capabilities:</p>
<p>(1) A high confidence solution that includes mature payload and satellite bus technologies, certified payload and spacecraft on-board software that meets the mission and constellation requirements, mature test products to include Electronic Aerospace Ground Equipment, Mechanical Ground Support Equipment, established scripting and validated test procedures, and a high fidelity testbed environment. The use of space qualified, build-to-print drawings for unit, sub-system and space vehicle configurable items will be essential to minimize the amount of non-recurring engineering required. Such a design must include all of the System level requirement verification products to ensure that Space Vehicle five and six meets requirements while not posing any risk to the Milstar/ AEHF constellation and the existing requirements baseline. The qualified source will also avoid any new technology development or fundamental effort to qualify or validate new space technologies outside of the existing AEHF technology baseline with the goal of minimizing the nonrecurring engineering and related risks with their insertion.</p>
<p>(2) A thorough understanding of the technical interface requirements associated with: the AEHF and Milstar payloads; Air Force, Army, and Navy terminals; AEHF COMSEC/TRANSEC System; AEHF and Milstar ground control and mission planning elements; and CCS-C.</p>
<p>(3) A thorough understanding of AEHF information assurance requirements including the key management plan and architecture, key authentication, key distribution, AEHF COMSEC/TRANSEC System products/schedule/issues, cryptographic key management for test assets, and certification and accreditation requirements.</p>
<p>(4) Extensive systems engineering experience, knowledge, and background dealing with DoD-specific capabilities in the EHF secure satellite communications field, including system requirements analysis, test and verification, risk management, and system security management. Familiarity and experience working with DoD customers, to include the Air Force Space Command, Army, Navy, and Air Force Terminal Program Offices (TPOs), is required to resolve terminal to payload requirements issues.</p>
<p>(5) Experience and understanding of US Government foreign disclosure requirements for support to the AEHF International Partners, including redaction of technical documents, processing and coordination of foreign disclosure material: Training in international programs security requirements and international security and technology transfer/control; familiarity with National Disclosure Policy (NDP-I), the Air Force Delegation of Disclosure Authority Letter (DDL), and the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR); and experience in processing Exemptions to the ITAR and the process of formulating Technical Assistance Agreements (TAAs) between US contractors and foreign governments and their contractors is required.</p>
<p>Interested parties (Prime Contractors only) may submit an unclassified Statement of Capability (SOC) within 15 days of this announcement demonstrating knowledge of AEHF satellites' critical interface requirements including hardware design, test procedures, individual spacecraft configurations and orbital procedures.</p>
<p>The SOC shall not exceed ten one-sided 8-inches by 11-inches pages in length, using fonts no smaller than 12 pitch, with page layout margins set to 1-inch both horizontally and vertically. Responses must be submitted via electronic mail as Microsoft Word or Adobe Acrobat file type attachments. The period of performance is for 9 years and will begin in 2012. This notice of proposed contract action is not a request for competitive proposals. Information furnished shall include enough detailed documentation to allow the Government to perform a proper evaluation. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Information herein is based on the best information available at the time of publication, is subject to revision, and is not binding on the Government. The Government will not recognize any costs associated with the submission of this SOC. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this effort is 336414. The applicable small business size standard for 336414 is 1,000 employees.</p>
<p>Submit all responses to: SMC/PKJ, Attn: William T. Althoff, 483 N. Aviation Blvd, EI Segundo, CA 90245-2808 (c-mail William.Althoff@losangeles.af.mil). All interested parties must identify to the Contracting Officer their capability to satisfy the Government's requirement within 15 days of this notice. Responses from small business and small, disadvantaged businesses are highly encouraged.</p>
<p>An Ombudsman has been appointed to address concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The Ombudsman does not diminish the authority of the program director or Contracting Officer, but communicates contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate Government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman shall maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. The Ombudsman for the Space and Missile Systems Center is Mr. James Gill, 310-653-1789.</p>

<DESC>This is a re-posting. The original Pre-Solicitation Notice did not upload to FedBizOpps. This is a Pre-Solicitation Notice only. This announcement is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) and does not commit the Government to award any contracts now or in the future. No Solicitation is available at this time. The purpose of this Pre-Solicitation Notice is to advertise that the U.S. Department of Interior, Bureau of Land Management (BLM), is contracting for the construction of a seed warehouse and supporting infrastructure in Ely, Nevada. The Government intends to solicit this acquisition as a 100% Small Business Set-Aside procurement. All Small Businesses or Small Business Concerns (SB, SDB, WOSB, HUBZone, and VOSB and SDVOSB) are encouraged to propose on this project. This requirement is assigned a NAICS code of 236220. The corresponding size standard for determining whether or not a firm qualifies as a Small Business is $33.5 million in average, annual receipts (gross) over the past three years. It is important to note that in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 52.219-14 - Limitations on Subcontracting, the prime contractor is required to perform at least 15% of the labor with their own employees for General Construction and at least 25% of the labor with their own employees for Special Trade Construction. For further information on the requirements for general construction and/or special trade construction, please visit the following web sites: http://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/print.pl/oes/2001/oesi2_17.htm http://www.census.gov/epcd/naics/NDEF235.HTM The project encompasses all site-off site developments and building construction required to furnish a facility for the processing and storage of seed in a temperature controlled environment. The warehouse building consists of a pre-engineered metal structure with approximately 16,000 square feet of floor space which includes, but is not limited to: an enclosed office; a break room, bathrooms, open seed storage area, and a 1300 square feet refrigerated seed storage unit. The project includes a racking system for the vertical storage of palletized seed. Site and off site developments includes the construction of utilities, paving, landscaping, fencing, water, power, telecommunications, on site sanitary, and storm water control. The Solicitation will be released on or about January 24, 2012, with an award anticipated for late March, 2012. The estimated price range of this project is between $1,000,000.00 and $5,000,000.00. A pre-proposal conference has been scheduled for Tuesday, January 31, 2012, from 10:00am - 12:00pm at the BLM Ely District Office, located at 702 N. Industrial Way, Ely Nevada. Information regarding the conference will be contained in the Solicitation posting. Completion time for this project is estimated at 330 calendar days after the written Notice to Proceed. Source Selection will be made using the Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) Source Selection process (FAR 15.101-2). The Government will not pay for any information solicited. Offers that do not meet all the technical requirements or a price reasonableness determination will not be considered. All offerors who do not meet the minimum requirements will be notified as soon as they have been determined to no longer be in consideration. Any late proposal received is subject to FAR 52.214-7 Late Submissions, Modifications, and Withdrawals of Bids (NOV 1999). The Solicitation will be released on or about January 24, 2012.

<a href="mailto:kcolson@blm.gov">kcolson@blm.gov</a>
<DESC>The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) at the National Interagency Fire Center (NIFC) intends to negotiate with only one source, Airborne Systems North America, Airborne Systems Group Headquarters, 5800 Magnolia Avenue, Pennsauken, New Jersey for 10 each 375 sq ft 7 cell main parachutes, 10 each 280 sq ft 5 cell ram-air reserve parachutes, and 5 reserve deployment systems.  This action is authorized by and in accordance with FAR 6.302-1.  The Government believes that the only responsible source capable of satisfying the agency's requirement is the Airborne Systems North America.  These parachutes have met the necessary testing and evaluation requirements for use within the BLM Smokejumper Program.  A Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition has been prepared in support of this acquisition.  The estimated value of this simplified acquisition is less than $39,000.00.  No Request for Quotation (RFQ) will be issued and no response will be made to letters or telephone requests for a copy of the solicitation.  This is not a request for competitive quotes, but serves as a procurement notice to fulfill public posting requirements in accordance with FAR 5.101(a)(1).  The requirement is unrestricted and the NAICS code 314999 applies.  Responsible firms believing they can provide the required items are encouraged to identify themselves and give written notification to the Contracting Officer referencing action item L12PS00112.  However, they must provide convincing evidence that they can furnish the requested items at a cost that will not exceed the total estimated transaction cost.  All responses will be fully considered.  If no affirmative responses are received by January 20, 2012 to the effect that a comparable source exists, an order will be placed with Airborne Systems North America for the requirement stated here.  Questions concerning this acquisition may be directed to Kathy Colson at 208-387-5545 or faxed to 208-387-5574.

The Industry Day is intended to inform industry of program requirements for the operation of the Cellular over the Horizon Enforcement Network (COTHEN), the competition timeline, and to provide a Question &amp; Answer opportunity<span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 8.5pt">.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 8.5pt">&nbsp;</span>CBP developed, purchased and deployed the "High Frequency" COTHEN communications radio network in order to meet CBP's tactical long-range radio communications requirements.</p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">&nbsp;This national/international network is comprised of land-based, fixed station transceiver systems, remote command and control systems, marine mobile systems, airborne mobile systems, transportable transceiver systems and many special purpose ancillary systems controlled by cellular switching technology. Each system that comprises COTHEN is specifically designed to support tactical law enforcement officers. The network is completely frequency adaptive and employs voice type 1-3 encryption. COTHEN is a primary means of long-range communications for many agencies and therefore it is critical that dedicated program management and conscientious users maintain network integrity. The network has been refreshed and modernized in the last two (2) years.&nbsp;</p>

<DESC><strong>This Pre-Solicitation Notice is for information purposes only. This is not a request for submission of proposals or qualifications. RESPONSES OR OTHER INQUIRIES ARE NOT APPROPRIATE AT THIS TIME.<br /></strong><br /><strong>The Defense Medical Materiel Program Office (DMMPO) intends to issue a Request for Incentive Agreement Quotations (RFIAQ) for the</strong> <strong>standardization of Functional Hinged Knee Braces on or about February 1, 2012, but the actual issue date for this RFIAQ may be delayed up to forty-five (45) business days.<br /></strong>The primary objective of this effort is to standardize the quality of care across the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) and operational assemblages based on the critical balance of clinical efficacy and value. The intent for this initiative is the standardization of a clinically preferred product(s) and source for institutional and operational medicine requirements at the lowest price. It is also intended for this initiative to result in the reduction of Stock Keeping Units (SKUs) and National Stock Numbers (NSN).

<SUBJECT>Towards Maximizing the Scientific Return on the Womens Health Initiative Biological Resource  Round III
<SOLNBR>NHLBI-CSB-WH-13-01-ST
<CONTACT>Stacy C. Turner, Contracting Officer, Phone (301) 435-6676, Fax (301) 480-3338, Email turners@nhlbi.nih.gov
<DESC>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) is seeking institutions to propose and define specific work requirements to:

   Support the primary goal of the Womens Health Initiative (WHI) 2010-2015 extension study, which is to study the determinants of an increased risk of CVD in older women (and conversely factors contributing to healthy aging with absence of CVD);
   Employ multiple technologies (using biospecimens) in an integrated fashion;  
   Be hypothesis driven.

The WHI program has set aside bloods (serum and plasma) and DNA samples for the purpose of this requirement. Serial bloods and physical measurements over an extended period of time allow for examination of long-term determinants of health status. They provide an important opportunity to study questions related to aging such as the absence or presence of cardiovascular disease and/or risk factors, maintaining good physical and cognitive function, and the predictors of change in biomarkers, metabolic markers, DNA methylation and RNA expression, and telomere length, and the interrelationships of markers in their association with health status. It is anticipated the laboratory assays may include integration of newer high-throughput technologies such as those from genomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and multiplex assays of adipokines and cytokines in order to elucidate pathways towards health or disease. The use of multiple technologies rather than a single technology is strongly encouraged.  Examples include using multiple technologies to try to elucidate a series of markers in a common etiologic pathway, or to develop a risk assessment profile that integrates markers from parallel etiologic pathways.  Offerors are encouraged to integrate existing data (e.g., GWAS, exome sequencing) where applicable. Offerors are expected to contribute new laboratory data using one or more technologies. The technologies need to have been validated in other studies prior to their application on the WHI samples. A combination of new data and existing data can be used to meet the goal of multiple [at least two] technologies. This solicitation is intended to support targeted hypothesis-driven rather than hypothesis-generating research. 

In order to put these resources to the best use, the investigations funded by these awards should not duplicate completed investigations or approved investigations already funded within the WHI, unless there are compelling reasons why replication would be desirable (for example, replication may be necessary for some genomics and proteomics investigations). Offerors should review the information on www.whiscience.org and on dbGAP for updated information on completed or funded investigations and publications. This is the third round of planned Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) awards using these resources. 

Proposals should include: 
   The hypothesis(es) being tested
   Agreement to abide by NHLBI policies for data distribution and confidentiality
   Plans for collaboration with WHI investigators, if any
   Plans for enhancing the development of early stage investigators
   Data dissemination plan
   The potential importance of the findings on public health, such as likelihood of leading to screening and mitigation of cardiovascular risk, and/or drug development.
   Reasons why this cohort is particularly or uniquely suitable for the proposed study  
   The number of cases and controls requested for specific outcome(s)
   Statistical power calculations
   Sample amounts, including steps taken to conserve sample
   Total amount and concentration of DNA and RNA, and amount of serum, plasma, citrated plasma, urine, and packed red cells requested
   Information on sample handling, shipping, and storage
   Ability to perform the laboratory analyses within the period of performance
   A summary of the technologies to be used and how multiple technologies will be integrated in the research
   Documentation of proficiency with the proposed technologies
   Documentation of sensitivity, reproducibility, variability, consistency with external laboratories and standards, sample success rates, locus success rates, as appropriate for the type of technology  
   Quality assurance steps to be included in this program (see www.whiscience.org for guidance)
   Documentation of ability to perform statistical analyses of the laboratory findings, or that suitable arrangements for statistical analyses through collaboration or subcontract have been negotiated
   Plans for transmission of an electronic dataset to the WHI Clinical Coordinating Center (CCC) as an interim step in order to receive additional data elements for analysis.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) intends to request a proposal and negotiate on a sole-source basis with Goodrich Corporation, P. O. Box 330651, Charter Oak Boulevard, West Hartford, CT 06133-0651 for the procurement of hardware to retrofit the MH-60R/S aircraft with the new Electronic Digital Engine Control Unit (EDECU) and a Discrete Application Selection (DAS) Plug. This procurement is for the incorporation of three ECPs (700173, 700184, 700187) designed to enhance the time on wing, reduce total ownership costs, and improve fleet maintainability and supportability of the T700 Engines. Goodrich specific hardware is required to implement the approved ECPs for the T700 Engines.
<p>This contract will be awarded as a firm-fixed price contract on a sole-source basis to Goodrich Corporation. Level III drawings and data are required to manufacture the kits, brackets, and plugs.

This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency.</p>

<DESC><strong>THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY<br /></strong>Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) located in Patuxent River, MD intends to solicit, negotiate, and award a sole source contract to furnish, operate, and maintain an Airborne System Training and Research Support (ASTARS) Saab 340A aircraft. This aircraft contains Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) consisting of sensors, computers, controls, and displays that are used to support ground and flight test and evaluation training on a representative, integrated system at the U.S. Naval Test Pilot School. Contractor will provide the design, fabrication, installation, and testing of GFE on the Contractor's airplane. <br /><br />The ASTARS system was designed to expose test pilots, Naval Flight Officers, and test engineers to a highly integrated avionics system, as well as support instruction in the test and evaluation of individual navigation and tactical sensors through the use of installed instrumentation. Configuration is similar to the centralized architecture used in next-generation aircraft such as the F-22 and Joint Strike Fighter. All processing is performed in multiple commercial rack-mounted off-the-shelf personal computers. Multi-Function Displays (MFDs) are emulated using Cathode Ray Tube (CRT) and Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) video monitors with added bezel buttons. Aircraft configuration currently includes a mock strikefighter cockpit student station equipped with multi-function hand controllers, as well as an instructor station equipped with similar controls and displays. Current sensor suite includes a multi-mode X-band radar (APG-66(V)2), a turret-mounted Electro-Optic/Infrared sensor (Wescam MX-15), an LTN-92 Inertial Navigation System (INS), and a Garmin 496 Map Global Positioning System (GPS), which provides INS aiding through mission computer software. A Heads Up Display (HUD) is simulated using a cockpit-mounted camera with overlaid symbology. The system also includes a digital moving map with full continental U.S. coverage. The current Saab 340A is used during approximately 35 weeks per year and accumulates 300 flight hours annually.
<p>The existing contract expires on August 31, 2012. The purpose of this acquisition is to continue existing services for the next five years. Having a fully functional airplane with GFE installed for training purposes is critical to the overall training objectives of the U.S. Navy Test Pilot School. The Government anticipates awarding this requirement on a sole-source basis to the current contractor, Calspan Corporation. The period of performance for this effort will be a base period from 1 October 2012 to 30 September 2017. Contractors who may be interested in providing this service need to consider the GFE has to be designed, installed, tested and operational no later than 30 October 2012.</p>
<p><strong>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL</strong>. However, interested parties may submit a capability statement via email to william.r.wright2@navy.mil. Capability statements are limited to ten (10) pages. All capability statements received in response to this notice must be received by 2:00pm, 3 February 2012, and will be considered by the Government for the purpose of determining whether to initiate a competitive procurement. DFARS 252-204-7004 Alt A "Required Central Contractor Registration" (CCR) applies to all solicitations. Lack of registration in CCR database will make an offeror ineligible for award. Technical capability will be determined solely on the content and merit of the information submitted in response to this notice. Therefore, it is incumbent on the interested party to provide sufficient technical literature, documentation, etc. in order for the Government to make an adequate technical assessment of the proposal. The Government reserves the right to process this procurement on a sole source basis based upon the responses received. However, if a competitive procurement is initiated, it will be made available electronically via the Federal Business Opportunities website. The Government will not pay for any information received.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Background:</span></strong>
<p>The USAF is seeking development of a unique, multivariate, statistics-based<br />approach for applying anomaly detection to engine performance data sets.</p>
<p>This analysis methodology shall automate the assumption checks, baseline development, and anomaly detection steps required for multivariate statistical analysis.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Requirement:</span></strong></p>
<p>It shall continuously monitor engine parameter readings as they are added and their relation to other engine parameter readings for shifts and trends from normal. Combining the expert knowledge of project engineers, the features extracted from the performance data shall be able to be refined to provide a holistic analysis, detecting changes in gas-path performance without the need for predefined fault codes. In addition, anomaly detection accuracy shall be greatly improved over traditional, population-based methods by automatically developing and utilizing a baseline for each ESN and allowing for rapid decomposition of indications to isolate anomalous parameters.</p>
<p>All interested parties should respond with company contact information and provide a brief description of similar work completed along with references. Company contact information shall be in the following format:</p>
<p>Company Name<br />Point of Contact<br />Address<br />Phone Number\E-mail<br />Web Address</p>

<ARCHDATE>02012012
<CONTACT>Wanda I. Cruz, Contracting Officer, Phone 2026493784, Email wanda.cruz@fhfa.gov
<DESC><p style="text-align: justify;">I am requesting information from interested sources on behalf of the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), Office of Human Resource and Management (OHRM). The request is for information only, and your response is not an offer/quote. This request for information does not commit the FHFA to pay any costs incurred in the preparation and submission to this sources sought request. Also, this does not obligate FHFA to contract for services or guarantee your inclusion on a potential Request for Quote (RFQ) mailing list.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">OHRM has a potential requirement for a training product and necessary services to implement a competency based integrated human capital system. Whereas the primary focus will be on off-the-shelf product and implementation consulting services.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">OHRM is particularly interested in capabilities related to performance management including 360 degree reviews, selection including assessment centers, employee development and leadership development and succession planning. It is important for OHRM to understand the market availability for comprehensive training programs in each of these areas and the design of these programs need to be integrated across the offerings (i.e. the structure of the performance management program needs to seamlessly integrate with the structure and training support of the selection system program). The training needed to support these systems needs to be both classroom and electronically based and the systems also need to be supported by a technology solution. Once implemented, the performance management system should have an available information technology support system for day to day administration or be able to integrate to an existing system.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>BACKGROUND<br /></strong>The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) was created on July 30, 2008, when the President signed into law the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008. The Act created a world-class, empowered regulator with all of the authorities necessary to oversee vital components of our country's secondary mortgage markets - Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and the Federal Home Loan Banks.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Office of Human Resource Management (OHRM) is responsible for implementing and managing strategic human capital systems for the agency. The OHRM collaborates as a strategic partner in achieving FHFA's regulatory mission by proactively determining human capital needs and recruiting, developing and retaining a world-class workforce that is diverse, motivated, and committed to excellence. The OHRM provides support services in all areas of human resources and develops and implements agency human capital policies, programs, and plans and maintains a robust human capital accountability program to ensure compliance with regulations and adherence to merit system principles. To carry out these responsibilities, OHRM must provide FHFA executives, managers and employees with effective systems for managing performance, selecting employees and managing employee and leadership development. Historically, these systems are developed in-house.&nbsp; However, OHRM is reviewing&nbsp;off-the-shelf systems to determine of more effective systems readily available.<br /><strong><br /><br />INFORMATION AND INPUT REQUESTED<br /></strong>If your firm is interested in this potential requirement, you are requested to submit the following information via e-mail to wanda.cruz@fhfa.gov. Please do not exceed twenty pages. However, your firm may submit any pre-created marketing literature to supplement the requirement.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">1. Company Information. Vendors shall provide a summary about their company. Included in the summary will be:<br />a. Company name and address<br />b. Years in business<br />c. Type of company<br />d. Point of contact with phone number and email, representing the interested firm.<br /><br />2. Functional Overview. Vendors shall provide a description of their off-the-shelf product available including examples of the effectiveness of the product in other organizations. Vendors shall also provide information regarding how their various human capital systems integrate and support one another.<br /><br />3. Public/Private Sector Experience. Vendors shall provide a summary of how their product has been successfully implemented in both the private and public sectors.<br /><br />4. Technology Support. Vendors shall provide information regarding how technology tools are used in both the training and day to day administration of the product requested.<br /><br />5. A brief overview of your firm's capabilities that addresses the above listed potential requirements.<br /><br />6. Suggested pricing structures, incentives, or any other best practices the FHFA-OHRM should consider when drafting its RFQ.<br /><br />7. A list of clients or experience in these areas with a client point of contact, name, phone number, and email.<br /><br />8. Do you have a GSA vehicle that could be utilized for these services? If yes, provide the contract number and point of contact name, phone, and email.</p>
<p>If this does become a firm requirement, and the FHFA decides to request a quote from your firm, you will be advised.</p>
<p>Questions should be submitted in writing via e-mail to wanda.cruz@fhfa.gov. The deadline for submitting questions is 2:00 PM, January 20, 2012.</p>

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards &amp; Technology (NIST) seeks information on commercial vendors that are capable of providing an automated spectroscopic ellipsometer. The CNST NanoFab is a state-of-the-art nanofabrication laboratory and has several tools capable of growing or depositing films with nanoscale thicknesses. These films need to be characterized to determine physical properties of the films and to quantify the variation across various size substrates. The system will be sited and used in a multi-user facility to support scientific and technical research projects at the NIST Center for Nanoscale Science and Technology (CNST) NanoFab.
<p>After results of this market research are obtained and analyzed and specifications are developed for an automated spectroscopic ellipsometer that can meet NIST's minimum requirements, NIST may conduct a competitive procurement and subsequently award a Purchase Order. If at least two qualified small businesses are identified during this market research stage, then any competitive procurement that resulted would be conducted as a small business set-aside.<br />NIST has a need for an automated spectroscopic ellipsometer that would meet the following requirements:<br />1. FOOTPRINT: System should be benchtop design <br />2. SUBSTRATE CAPABILITY: System should be capable of handling substrates from small irregular shaped pieces up to and including 200mm wafers<br />3. BASE ANGLE: System should have an automatic adjustable measurement angle from 45&deg; to 90&deg;.</p>
<p>4. STAGE: System shall have an automated 200mm XY mapping stage and a fully automated sample alignment.<br />5. WAVELENGHTS: Spectral range options from UV to NIR (193nm to 1690nm). All wavelengths should be acquired concurrently.<br />6. CAMERA: System should include a camera for visualization of measurement area<br />7. SOFTWARE: System operating software shall facilitate ease of instrument use since installed in a multi-user facility. Software should provide both data acquisition and analysis. <br />8. OPTIONS: Additional options and upgrades could be desirable.</p>
<p>NIST is seeking responses from all responsible sources, including large, foreign, and small businesses. Small businesses are defined under the associated NAICS code for this effort, 334516, as those domestic sources having 500 employees or less. Please include your company's size classification in any response to this notice. <br />Companies that manufacture such spectroscopic ellipsometers are requested to email a detailed report describing their abilities to todd.hill@nist.gov no later than the response date for this sources sought notice. The report should include achievable specifications and any other information relevant to your product or capabilities. Also, the following information is requested to be provided as part of the response to this sources sought notice: 1. Name of the company that manufactures the system components for which specifications are provided. 2. Name of company(ies) that are authorized to sell the system components, their addresses, and a point of contact for the company (name, phone number, fax number and email address). 3. Indication of number of days, after receipt of order that is typical for delivery of such systems. 4. Indication of whether each instrument for which specifications are sent to todd.hill@nist.gov are currently on one or more GSA Federal Supply Schedule contracts and, if so, the GSA FSS contract number(s). 5. Any other relevant information that is not listed above which the Government should consider in developing its minimum specifications and finalizing its market research.</p>

DESCRIPTION

1.0	52.215-3 Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes (Oct 1997).

(a) The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this solicitation or to otherwise pay for the information solicited except as an allowable cost under other contracts as provided in subsection 31.205-18, Bid and proposal costs, of the Federal Acquisition Regulation.

(b) Although proposal and offeror are used in this Request for Information, your response will be treated as information only. It shall not be used as a proposal.

(c) This solicitation is issued for (see 1.1 below).

1.1	PURPOSE 
This is a Request for Information (RFI) and NOT a solicitation.
 NAVSEA 04RN is requesting industry and academia for designs on Air Particle Samplers (APS). The APS will be used to collect air particulate samples and will analyze these for the presence of radioactive isotopes. Specifically, this RFI documents a Government request to industry and academia for information on approaches, products, technologies, and/or solutions for Air Particle Sampler (APS). This includes information on algorithms, pumps, power sources, and detector technologies which have the potential to meet or exceed the requirements herein. All interested sources are encouraged to respond.

1.2	 BACKGROUND
APS solutions must be able to exceed current capabilities used by the U. S. Navy.
 The APS will be used on board Naval Nuclear powered ships, and at shore facilities. There are two portable APSs fielded in large numbers by the RADIAC Program.  The HD-732C/UD (hereafter referred to as HD-732C) is an AC powered unit; the HD-1150/PD and HD-1151A/PD are essentially interchangeable DC powered units (hereafter referred to collectively as HD-1151A).  HD-732C and HD-1151A units are fielded to NNPP ships as well as NNPP shore activities.

a.	In order to maintain a supply of units, for the last several years the Radiation Detection, Indication, And Computation (RADIAC) Program has tasked the Yorktown RADIAC Calibration Laboratory (WAJ) and the Pearl Harbor RADIAC Calibration Laboratory (PEJ) to perform refurbishments of both HD-732Cs and HD-1151As.

b.	There is no current source of new HD-732C units.
  RADeCO, Inc. is the only current source of new HD-1151A units.

c.	Several years ago, based on discussions with RADIAC Program personnel, RADeCO Inc. conducted preliminary development of a digital replacement Electronic Module Assembly (EMA) for the HD-732C.  This replacement would result in new electronics, controls, and indications.  RADECO assembled a prototype unit (digital EMA installed in an HD-732C), concluded that the replacement EMA is feasible, and concluded that it could be easily installed in the HD-732C (less than 30 minutes installation time).  This effort was conducted at RADECOs expense, and no further effort was conducted.

d.	In 2009, the RADIAC Program contracted with a vendor to trouble-shoot and repair Printed Wiring Assemblies (PWAs) on several APS.
 The PWA is part of the Electronic Module Assembly (EMS). The vendor found that several of the boards worked upon arrival, so they did no repair on them.  But other boards were beyond economical repair, due to damage to the board, unavailability of a failed integrated circuit, or inability to identify the problem.  

2.	DISCUSSION

The small business size standard is 500 employees. Your response to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition strategy, including whether a small business set-aside is a possibility.</p>
<p>This Sources Sought Notice (SSN) is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) and does not constitute a commitment by the United States Government (USG). The USG is currently conducting market research in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation, Part 10, to identify potential small business sources to fulfill the requirement and gather information on current capabilities within the market. All information submitted in response to this sources sought notice is voluntary and the USG will not pay for information requested nor will it compensate any respondent for any cost incurred in developing information provided to the USG. Proprietary information submitted should be marked appropriately. All submitted information shall remain with the USG and will not be returned.</p>
<p>The Department of Health &amp; Human Services (HHS) has a future requirement to establish a Fill and Finish Network (FFN) to provide filling and finishing capabilities as core services for influenza vaccine product and other public health emergency biopharmaceutical products to address national security and to augment public health needs on a cost-effective, reliable, and sustainable basis. Core services may include, but are not limited to: analytical testing development, scale-up, formulation, filling, finishing, technology transfer from 3rd party biopharmaceutical company(ies), process optimization, process validation, labeling, packaging, and distribution. The FFN will connect our industrial partners with needed technical and regulatory expertise including facilitating interactions with FDA's new regulatory science initiative. Establishing the FFN with multiple capabilities and differing manufacturing platforms will allow for maximum flexibility and adaptability to respond to changes in technology and/or disease threats.</p>
<p>Anticipated minimum Mandatory Eligibility Criteria for this acquisition are:</p>
<p>1. U.S. based filling facility. <br />2. Has filled an FDA licensed biopharmaceutical in single or multi-dose vials within the last year. <br />3. Written evidence of a commitment to provide the additional capability to fill fifty (50) million doses of pandemic influenza vaccine in finished multi-dose vials, with internal testing completed within nine (9) weeks of availability of formulated material.</p>
<p>This acquisition is intended to create the contractual, business and regulatory relationships between offerors and the organizations that hold the license to the pandemic influenza product(s) necessary to meet the stated HHS objective of having 600 million doses available in 6 months, post HHS declaration of a Public Health Emergency, in response to a pandemic. It is anticipated that the majority of the time leading up to the fill and finish of 600 million doses will be occupied by viral seed selection and preparation, vaccine bulk drug substance manufacture, reagent development and bulk product release. Nine weeks are anticipated to be required upon availability of formulated material for several offering organizations to respond in parallel to the filling of pandemic influenza vaccine in finished multi-dose vials with complete internal testing. In the case of a pandemic, these relationships are designed to provide the USG with access as the majority of U.S.-based filling. To accomplish this goal the USG seeks to create a robust network of fill and finish service providers that can be readily accessed in the event of a pandemic. During inter-pandemic periods, a warm-base effort will be executed with Fill and Finish Network members to ensure their capabilities are maintained in a state of readiness.</p>
<p>Objective 1 (Base Period)<br />Augment Current US-based Fill and Finish Capacity:</p>
<p>The Offeror will enhance domestic biopharmaceutical filling and finishing capabilities for pandemic influenza vaccines and other public health emergency biopharmaceutical products at pilot and commercial scales.</p>

<p>Objective 2 (Option Period)<br />Provide Filling and Finishing Core Services:</p>
<p>Core services must provide technology transfer and fill and finish of influenza vaccine and other public health emergency biopharmaceutical products under development by the USG. Core services include the filling and finishing capability to produce clinical investigational lots, engineering lots, process validation lots, and commercial-scale lots. Core services may include, but are not limited to the following areas to support formulation, filling and finishing operations: technology transfer from 3rd party biopharmaceutical company(ies) analytical testing development, ), process optimization, process validation, labeling, packaging and distribution.</p>
<p>Core services may be provided to support the filling and finishing of products including sterile injectable drug, biopharmaceuticals, monoclonal antibodies, recombinant proteins, antitoxins, bacterial or viral vector-based products, and attenuated/killed virus vaccines used to prevent and/or treat, but not limited to, pandemic influenza. These or other candidate products could be filled and finished using technology platforms including, but not limited to, powders, liquid or lyophilized vials, single dose or multi-dose, prefilled syringes or sprayers, single packed dose or multi-packed doses.<br />Fill and Finish Network facilities may provide support capabilities, including but not limited to: Formulation, Analytical and Process Development, Program Management and Regulatory Affairs. Teaming arrangements will be considered.</p>
<p>Objective 3 (Option Period)<br />Provide Biopharmaceutical Fill and Finish Surge Capacity:<br />Offerors will augment existing biopharmaceutical filling and finishing biopharmaceutical manufacturing capacity to create a U.S.-based surge capability that can be pre-positioned to respond to public health emergencies such as an influenza pandemic and other public health emergency.</p>
<p>Offerors shall present a capability to fill fifty (50) million doses of pandemic influenza vaccine in finished multi-dose vials with internal testing completed within nine (9) weeks of availability of formulated material based on a USG task order.</p>
<p>For the influenza vaccine product(s) proposed, Offerors shall present a technical transfer plan and sustainability plan that ensure the capability is pre-positioned throughout the period of performance of the contract.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that a Request for Proposal (RFP) will be announced approximately late February/ early March 2012 with proposals due in April 2012. While the mandatory qualification criteria do not have to currently be met for response to this sources sought notice, all of the mandatory qualification criteria shall be met by proposal submission.</p>
<p>It is requested that respondents to this sources sought notice may identify their interest by submitting the following information:<br />1. Rate capacity for multi-dose vials, single dose vials, syringes and sprayers is sought. <br />2. Ability to fulfill core services including but are not limited to: analytical testing development, scale-up, formulation, filling, finishing, technology transfer from 3rd party biopharmaceutical company(ies), process optimization, process validation, labeling, packaging, and distribution.<br />3.

The preliminary goal for the TMTS is to create, deliver, and manage the assessment data for our officer workforce. This information is used to track employee knowledge, make training recommendations, and reach employment decisions. Currently TSA administers approximately 80,000 tests annually, and this number is expected to rise. This testing is mandated by Congress, as part of the Aviation and Transportation Security Act (ATSA), and must occur regardless of connectivity issues or other problems. TSA requires a flexible and stable system, with item writing and banking capabilities that can be used to administer tests and handle a large amount of data from over 430 locations dispersed nationwide. To ensure continuity in testing it is important to have a viable offline testing option, and a help desk that is available during TSA operating hours. In order to maintain system and test security, the system should allow multiple levels of user access. <br /><br />It is important to note responses to this RFI are solely for the purpose of market research.

<DESC>This is a notice to inform industry that the Air Force will be issuing a draft Request for Proposals (draft RFP) for the Enterprise Sourcing Group, Systems and Modular Furniture acquisition. The draft RFP is currently scheduled for release by 20 January, 2012. The Air Force will be conducting a Systems and Modular Furniture Industry Day on 7 February, 2012. This event will be held at the Hope Hotel and Richard C. Holbrooke Conference Center, Building 823, Area A, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, OH 45433. <br /><br />The Enterprise Sourcing Group (ESG) is the Air Force's primary organization responsible for enterprise-wide installation strategic sourcing. This acquisition is the primary responsibility of the ESG's Furnishings Commodity Council (FCC), an ESG sourcing team chartered with strategic sourcing Air Force furnishings requirements. <br /><br />The purpose of this Industry Day event is to educate potential bidders on the Systems and Modular acquisition, its strategic sourcing strategy as well as provide an in-depth overview of the draft RFP. The future Systems and Modular strategic sourcing contracts are anticipated to have a period of performance not to exceed five years, with a projected value of $280M during that time. This Systems and Modular acquisition will be an Air Force-wide initiative, mandated for use by all Continental United States (CONUS) Air Force procurement offices. A key component of the acquisition strategy centers on an approach that mutually incorporates manufacturers as well as their respective dealerships, allowing for the greatest level of participation by industry while achieving desired strategic sourcing results. Therefore, active involvement from both manufacturers and dealers is imperative to the success of this Air Force acquisition.<br /><br />An Industry Day Draft Agenda will be attached to this announcement, detailing other topics that will be covered during the event. We urge all interested Systems and Modular firms to attend Industry Day as it will offer valuable insight into this acquisition opportunity and provide a forum to ask any questions.<br /><br />An Industry Day slide deck will be posted on FedBizOpps (FBO) in the coming weeks. The FCC will not be providing hardcopy material during Industry Day. If participants would like a hardcopy of the presentation, we ask that they print it prior to arriving at the Hope Hotel. The Industry Day presentation will be displayed during the event.<br /><br />All participants must register for Industry Day by 1 February, 2012, using the link provided below:<br /><br /><a href="https://einvitations.afit.edu/EnterpriseSourcingGroupESG/anim.cfm">https://einvitations.afit.edu/EnterpriseSourcingGroupESG/anim.cfm</a>

<DESC>This is a notice to inform industry that the Air Force will be issuing a draft Request for Proposals (draft RFP) for the Enterprise Sourcing Group, Systems and Modular Furniture acquisition. The draft RFP is currently scheduled for release by 20 January, 2012. The Air Force will be conducting a Systems and Modular Furniture Industry Day on 7 February, 2012. This event will be held at the Hope Hotel and Richard C. Holbrooke Conference Center, Building 823, Area A, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, OH 45433. <br /><br />The Enterprise Sourcing Group (ESG) is the Air Force's primary organization responsible for enterprise-wide installation strategic sourcing. This acquisition is the primary responsibility of the ESG's Furnishings Commodity Council (FCC), an ESG sourcing team chartered with strategic sourcing Air Force furnishings requirements.<br /><br />The purpose of this Industry Day event is to educate potential bidders on the Systems and Modular acquisition, its strategic sourcing strategy as well as provide an in-depth overview of the draft RFP. The future Systems and Modular strategic sourcing contracts are anticipated to have a period of performance not to exceed five years, with a projected value of $280M during that time. This Systems and Modular acquisition will be an Air Force-wide initiative, mandated for use by all Continental United States (CONUS) Air Force procurement offices. A key component of the acquisition strategy centers on an approach that mutually incorporates manufacturers as well as their respective dealerships, allowing for the greatest level of participation by industry while achieving desired strategic sourcing results. Therefore, active involvement from both manufacturers and dealers is imperative to the success of this Air Force acquisition.<br /><br />An Industry Day Draft Agenda will be attached to this announcement, detailing other topics that will be covered during the event. We urge all interested Systems and Modular firms to attend Industry Day as it will offer valuable insight into this acquisition opportunity and provide a forum to ask any questions.<br /><br />An Industry Day slide deck will be posted on FedBizOpps (FBO) in the coming weeks. The FCC will not be providing hardcopy material during Industry Day. If participants would like a hardcopy of the presentation, we ask that they print it prior to arriving at the Hope Hotel. The Industry Day presentation will be displayed during the event.<br /><br />All participants must register for Industry Day by 1 February, 2012, using the link provided below:<br /><br /><a href="https://einvitations.afit.edu/EnterpriseSourcingGroupESG/anim.cfm">https://einvitations.afit.edu/EnterpriseSourcingGroupESG/anim.cfm</a>

<DESC>The 10CONS/LGCB, Contracting Squadron, USAF Academy intends to award a sole source purchase order for 10 each UAS Autopilot Packages and 3 Laser Altimeters from Goodrich - Cloud Cap Technologies (CCT), 2621 Wasco St. PO Box 1500, Hood River OR 97031. This procurement is for the acquisition of a sole source commercial item using simplified acquisition procedures in accordance with FAR Part 12 and 13. The contract line items are as follows:
<p>0001 Piccolo SL - ALT - 900 MHz (Item # 900-90023-00-C), 10 Each<br />Specifications: <br />- Antenna, 912 MHz Cut Duck (Item # 500-00311-00), 10 Each <br />- LT/SL Antenna, Cable, SSMA M to BNC Bulkhead F, 20" (Item # 500-01154-00), 10 Each<br />- Antenna, LT/SL Avionics/TASE GPS 20" with SSMA connector (Item # 500-01153-00), 10 Each<br />- Mounting Kit, Soft Generic Mount, Piccolo / Navigator - New style with threaded isolators includes (Item # 900-02269-00), 10 Each. Each unit includes:<br />Qty 6: 620-00927-00<br />Qty 4: 620-02298-00<br />Qty 12: 620-02300-00</p>
<p>0002 Laser Altimeter, Latitude Engineering model AGL, 1 Hz rate, RS232, 30cm accuracy to 370m range, 10cm resolution (Item # 500-01377-00), 3 Each<br />Shipping cost are inclusive.</p>
<p>This notice document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular Fac 2005-55, Effective 03 Jan 2012. The North American Industry Classification System Code [NAICS] is 334511 and the size standard is 750 employees.</p>
<p>Sole Source Justification: This is a follow-on procurement for the USAFA Center for Unmanned Aircraft Systems(UAS) which currently is doing research utilizing the Piccolo autopilot avionics system. In order to proceed with future research, the USAFA UAV Research Group needs to purchase 10 additional autopilot units (and associated antennas, cables, and mounting kits) and 3 laser altimeters. While a variety of similar products are available, the Center for UAS Research program currently employs Goodrich CCT equipment. The integration of different brand name UAS systems will create software incompatability issues between the ground station and the autopilot system. The Piccolo Autopilot System and the Altimeters manufactured by Goodrich - CCT are the only products capable of meeting the government's requirements. To institute a completely new system would result in greater cost to the government that would not be recoverable. Other commercially available altimeters would require significant amount of resources and man-hours to intergrate them with existing autopilots. <br />Delivery is to be made to the U.S. Air Force Academy CO 80840. FOB Destination.</p>
<p>This synopsis is for notification purposes only and THIS IS NOT A REQUEST for bids or proposals. DO NOT SUBMIT A QUOTE AT THIS TIME.</p>
<p>Any offerors believing they can meet the governments requirements for this acquistion have the burden and responsibility to provide documentation that substantiates their products are equal to or better by demonstrating their product, at a minimum, has the same features and functionality of the sole source products. The offeror should provide an understandable comparison between the two products along with brochures, specifications, and any other useful information for government consideration. All qualified sources may submit a response, which if timely received, will be considered by this agency. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether a brand name or equal procurement can be conducted.

<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Courier New'">The Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG) is seeking vendors who can offer rapid response sample surveys via the World Wide Web and mobile phones in key markets of interest.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Courier New'; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-latin">This is a Request for Information (RFI) only. The responses will be used for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation. This RFI is necessary to determine if adequate competition exists to set-aside competition among small businesses and to assess the capabilities of interested vendors and establish approximate costs for such surveys. In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Interested vendors are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Courier New'; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-latin">The Government is not obligated to acknowledge receipt of submissions or of the information received, or to provide feedback to responders.</span></p>

Achieved samples required would normally range from 250 to 500. Vendors would be expected to adapt and administer BBG supplied survey instruments to work seamlessly on the Web.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>BBG would require survey results to be delivered as cleaned, fully labeled SPSS files.</span></p>

<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. This is not a solicitation for bids, proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this RFI is to obtain information regarding the availability and capability of all qualified sources to perform a potential requirement. The responses we receive from interested Vendors will assist the Government in determining the appropriate systems to replace existing conditions and will help us determine the most appropriate acquisition method. This RFI is for the replacement of centralized mechanical equipment for an office complex.
<p><br />The USDA, Forest Service is seeking information from suppliers, designers, and contractors regarding a possible future construction project at the US Forest Service, Gauley District Administrative Complex in Richwood, West Virginia. This project includes replacement of existing mechanical units or systems at this existing site in order to save long-term operational costs, eliminated dated systems and improve the comfort to the occupants. Currently, there is an air distribution system within a crawl space supplied by propane, package units for heating and cooling. There are 2 Trane 7 &frac12; ton horizontal, gas/electric, dual compression packaged units (YCH090) installed at this office. A third branch system called "AC-3" will be considered as well. The USFS would like to consider every available replacement alternative which would fulfill the following requirements;</p>
<p>&bull; Low long-term fuel costs achieving savings over the current conditions. Achieve significant savings.<br />&bull; Minimized, annual operation and maintenance costs.<br />&bull; Consider green and sustainable systems alternatives in addition to traditional fuel replacements if they can achieve the above mentioned criteria. Biomass, geothermal, solar and wind systems have been successfully installed at other USFS locations.<br />&bull; Reasonable first-time installation expenses.<br />&bull; The client would like consider reusing the existing ductwork distribution system or consider replacing it if the life cycle cost of replacement justifies the additional expense.</p>
<p><br />The Forest Service is conducting this market survey to determine the existence of potential sources with the capacity to accomplish this work. Responding Vendors should have demonstrated past experience in this type of work as a supplier, installer, contractor, design-builder, or designer. The purpose of this search is to consider every serious replacement alternative that will be converted into a future construction solicitation. We will consider reuse of the existing distribution system or evaluate a new or additional replacement distribution systems being installed. Grill and supply/return alterations/installations (or new devices) may be considered in the heated office space. but large interior renovations will not be considered. The existing units are exterior, ground-mounted systems. The same location is feasible or new locations may be proposed.</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to submit their ideas and suggestions including any ancillary documents to explain the system and company. This submittal should include a statement of the replacement equipment, a general estimate of the installation and equipment costs, anticipated annual fuel costs for an indoor winter temperature of 72 deg and a summer temperature of 74 deg., and any other pertinent information that would assist the USFS designers in making a system selection.</p>
<p>Each submittal should also include the following business information:<br />a. DUNS number<br />b. Organization Name<br />c. Company Address<br />d. Point of Contact (including name, title, addresses, telephone number, fax number and Email address)<br />e. Business size<br />f. Socio-economic status</p>
<p>All information must be received by the Forest Service no later than: February 14, 2012, 2:00 PM, EST.<br /><br />Mail or email information to: Laura Ingram, Contracting Officer, USDA Forest Service, George Washington/Jefferson National Forest, 5162 Valleypointe Parkway, Roanoke, VA 24019. <br /><br />No field inspections or site visits are being considered at this time, but requests for technical information about the office complex may be directed to: Ms. Mary Smakula, Facilities Engineer, Elkins, WV, 304-636-1800. System selection ideas may be directed to Ms. Smakula (above telephone number) or Kurt Kretvix at 802-747-6732.<br /><br />Disclaimer and Important Notes: This Request for Information does not obligate the Government to award a contract or otherwise pay for the information provided in response. The Government reserves the right to use information provided by respondents for any purpose deemed necessary and legally appropriate. Any organization responding to this RFI should ensure that its response is complete and sufficiently detailed to allow the Government to determine the organization's qualifications to perform the work. Respondents are advised that the Government is under no obligation to acknowledge receipt of the information received or provide feedback to respondents with respect to any information submitted. After a review of the responses received, a pre-solicitation synopsis and solicitation may be published in Federal Business Opportunities. Responses to this RFI will not be considered adequate responses to an actual future solicitation. <br /><br />Confidentiality: NO PROPRIETARY, CLASSIFIED, CONFIDENTIAL, OR SENSITIVE INFORMATION SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN YOUR RESPONSE. The Government reserves the right to use any non-proprietary technical information in any resultant solicitation(s).<br /><br />Interested Vendors may register at http://www.fedbizopps.gov to receive notification when the solicitation and any amendments are issued and available for downloading.

<DESC>Special Notice. This is the public notice for acquisitions over $10,000. The U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), intends to increase the ceiling price of contract number WC133F-06-CQ-0033 with IAP World Services Inc., by $10 million dollars. The contract is for observer program and other research support activities for the Southeast Fisheries Science Center in Pascagoula, MS. The contract is a fixed-price type contract that allows for both time and material and labor-hour type task orders. The contract was awarded 04/21/2006 for a base year of 24 months, 3 12-month option years, and 5, 6-month award terms. The contract is currently in award term 2 of performance. This contract supports the research activities in four Southeast Fisheries Science Center Laboratories in: Miami, FL; Panama City, FL; Pascagoula, MS; and Galveston, TX. The contract covers a wide range of research activities including: 1. Regional observer programs; 2. Laboratory and at-sea support for survey cruises; 3. Port sampling programs; 4. Age and growth studies; 5. Marine mammal and sea turtle strandings and research programs; 6. Operation and maintenance of small vessels; 7. Development of fishing and sampling; 8. Data management; and 9. Data analysis and report development. It is the Government's intent to modify the existing contract with IAP World Services. The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of 41 USC 253(c) (1), Only One Responsible Source. When the existing contract was awarded in 2006, the projection for the contract ceiling was based solely on the continuation of the activities described herein, with no anticipated expansion due to unforeseen events. With the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in 2010, increased focus was placed on enhanced research activities in the Gulf of Mexico to support evaluation of impacts of the oil spill. The original contracted activities and the additional work pertaining to Deepwater activities have continued since the oil spill occurred. Additional contract employees were required to support these activities and the IAP World Services Inc. contract provided the appropriate mechanism to quickly respond to these priorities. The addition of these funds to the IAP contract and the increased work effort by the contractor resulted in the contract ceiling being reached more quickly than anticipated. This special notice is not a request for competitive responses, but rather a notice to the public of the Government's intent to modify the existing contract to increase the ceiling amount. Any response to this notice may be sent via email within 7 calendar days of its published date, to: jackie.a.shewmaker@noaa.gov. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed acquisition is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD A SOLE SOURCE CONTRACT UNDER THE AUTHORITY OF FAR 6.302-1, TO CLIVUS NEW ENGLAND, INC, LAWRENCE, MA FOR THE MAINTENANCE CONTRACT FOR THE CLIVUS SYSTEM  AT MINUTE MAN NATIONAL HISTORICAL PARK.
THE CLIVUS SYSTEM IS A COMPOSTING WASTE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM THAT REPLACES THE TYPICAL TOILET AND SEPTIC SYSTEM FOUND IN MOST RESIDENTIAL AND COMMERCIAL VENUES.  THE LOCATION OF THE NORTH BRIDGE VISITOR CENTER IS IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO WETLANDS WHICH PRECLUDED THE USE OF THE USUAL SEPTIC SYSTEM WITH A TANK AND LEACHING FIELD.  IN ADDITION, THE TOWN OF CONCORD'S INSTALLED SEWAGE SYSTEM IS A A MAXIMUM CAPACITY AND NOT CAPABLE OF HANDLING THE ADDITIONAL WASTE WHICH WOULD BE GENERATED BY THE VISITOR CENTER.  THE COMPOSTING WASTE SYSTEM WHICH WAS INSTALLED APPROXIMATELY 10 YEARS AGO ELIMINATES BOTH OF THESE PROBLEMS.  THE SYSTEM UTILIZES TOILETS WITH A FOAMING SOAP LIKE SUBSTANCE THAT CARRIES THE WASTE INTO STORAGE TANKS LOCATED IN THE BASEMENT.  THE TANKS NEED TO BE SERVICED AND EMPTIED PERIODICALLY THROUGHTOUT THE YEAR.  IN ADDITION, THE TOILETS, VENTILATION FANS, PUMPS, AND LIQUID DISPENSING UNITS REQUIRE PERIODIC MAINTENANCE AND UPKEEP.  THIS MAINTENANCE CONTRACT TAKES CARE OF THESE MAINTENANCE REQUIREMENTS.  
THE EQUIPMENT & MAINTENANCE MATERIALS ARE UNIQUE TO CLIVUS MULSTRUM INC.  SINCE THE SYSTEM IS ALREADY INSTALLED, CLIVUS IS THE ONLY OPTION FOR MAINTAINING THE SYSTEM.   
CLIVUS MULSTRUM INC. IS A LEADER IN THE COMPOSTING TOILET SYSTEM INDUSTRY.  ONCE THE CHOICE WAS MADE TO INSTALL A CLIVUS SYSTEM IT WAS ALSO REQUIRED THAT CLIVUS BE UTILIZED TO MAINTAIN AND SERVICE THE SYSTEM.  THIS CONTRACT IS A CONTINUATION OF THE MAINTENANCE AGREEMENT THAT HAS BEEN UTILIZED SINCE THE SYSTEM WAS INSTALLED.

<SUBJECT>Industry Day announcement for the Advanced Electric Power and Propulsion Project
<SOLNBR>N0002412R4210
<ARCHDATE>02092012
<CONTACT>
<DESC>The US Navy and the UK Ministry of Defence (MoD) are anticipating final approval of a Project Arrangement (PA) in the near future for the Advanced Electric Power and Propulsion Project (AEP3).  This international agreement will enable cooperation on maritime electric power and propulsion components and systems development for future warships.  The aim of this PA is to develop, characterize, model and de-risk electrical power and propulsion system architectures and technologies for future surface and submarine platforms to meet the needs of both Navies. The work will leverage US Navy, UK Royal Navy, and other Government developed science and technology and will seek to adopt multi-platform solutions and adapt commercial equipments and technologies where possible.

The work will be conducted in the US and UK with Government agencies and industrial participation, phased over 5 years.
 The PA is expected to commence in early 2012, and be jointly funded.  The project will report to a Senior level Steering Committee chaired by the US Office of Naval Research (ONR) and the UK Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (DSTL), and be led by an appointed Project Officer from each country.  Both Navies will leverage ongoing efforts with industry toward the goals of the PA and may solicit for additional industry participation in the various areas of mutual interest.

This PA is primarily focused on research and development of next generation electric platform technology to deliver the common goals and objectives. This PA will help to address many of the common electric technology opportunities and issues challenging ship designers in order to de-risk electric technologies to provide options for future platforms.
  There is also a desire for cooperation between companies (both domestically and between the respective countries) and an aspiration for an alignment of company technology roadmaps with the respective defense capability roadmaps, in order to optimize both the private and Government funded work in this area.

This PA supports the research, design and development of one or more electric power system architectures to meet the desired future capabilities of both Navies.  The US and UK will develop and maintain a common simulation environment to support the design of electric power and propulsion systems, common interface specification development, and integration studies with next generation weapons and sensors.
  The US and the UK will test functionally equivalent components to validate simulations and develop prototypes of key technologies to allow characterization, validation of performance models and key attributes, and facilitate risk reduction.

The objectives of the PA are anticipated to include raising propulsion power density and efficiency, developing advanced distribution systems, reducing Life Cycle Cost (LCC), scaling integrated power systems to become affordable in smaller vessels, and accommodating increases in electric power demand for higher energy users including sensors, weapons, and greater electrification of auxiliaries.

Specific areas for cooperation have yet to be finalized, but ongoing discussions suggest that there may be mutual benefit in cooperating in the following areas:

a.	Selection of candidate architectures.
 Identification, characterization and selection of electrical architectures for certain applications, using common systems where possible.  Reference power systems designs, including cost models and concept of operations for target platform concepts. Identification of technology risks and mitigation.

b.	Creation of simulation models, potentially including hardware in the loop. A common demonstration environment, preferably real-time with the ability to provide hybrid simulation, emulation and hardware testing.

c.	Generation and conversion. Rotating generating machinery, integrated power and energy conversion.

d.	Power distribution. Optimizing distribution systems to include bus bars and cables.
 HV/MV to LV power conversion, zonal power supplies and system studies.

e.	Propulsion motors. Identify candidate motor technologies, component de-risking and demonstration.

f.	Mission loads. Emerging high-energy mission systems have a broad range of mission-dependent load requirements and diverse concepts of operations. Propulsion dynamics, pulse power loads, and high-energy reactive mission systems (employment of the mission system in reaction to a threat without time to bring the ships power plant to a high energy state), will place unprecedented demands on future power systems.
	
g.	System integration. Addressing survivability drivers; physical and performance integration issues and mitigation; auxiliary system demands, requirements and robustness.
  
h.	Protection and control. Fault and overcurrent protection, fault tolerant designs. Current breaking capabilities using electromechanical, solid-state, and hybrid interrupters.  Overcurrent protection coordination and management.  Effective and proven fault pre-locating and locating methods. Grounding and galvanic isolation. System stability and self-healing.  Scientific understanding of the coupling between generation, distribution, and loads in Medium Voltage DC (MVDC) systems, to specify the role of power electronics in active control and de-coupling of sub-systems.  Identifying feasible ramp rates for various loads, generators, and storage units to meet system requirements.  Health monitoring strategies such as partial discharge detection.
i.	Energy storage.
 Develop interface requirements for Design Reference Systems that meet Key Common Requirements and provide for survivability and continuity of the electrical power supply. Demonstrate the ability to achieve Zonal/Compartment Survivability and Quality of Service. Assessment of energy storage technologies and platform requirements, including maintenance of safe working environments. Understanding the system design trade-offs for different energy storage allocation philosophies.  Optimization of power interfaces between storage systems and electrical bus in order to simulate and demonstrate the utility of a common energy storage module to meet multiple operational scenarios employing multiple loads, vice dedicated energy storage sources.
 For example, shipboard energy storage can be used in the following ways: vital sensitive load power continuity, buffer between mission load and power system that safely and stably supplies the difference between the load demands and the supply capacity of the power system, pulse forming network for high power mission loads, base-load provider to enable reliable/survivable fuel efficient plant line-ups, and power grid stabilization. Optimization would include design, develop and demonstration of a common energy storage source that provides these capabilities. Characterize candidate technologies, and conduct component de-risking.

j.	Classification standards development and safety.  Establish common standards for safe deployment of candidate technologies.
 Establish shared principles for HV safety.

This PA fosters an opportunity to provide significant benefits to US and UK maritime capabilities. The success of this PA will depend on the cooperation and active involvement of the US Navy and UK Royal Navy and industry stakeholders to exploit our mutual knowledge and expertise. 

The US Navy is interested in identifying companies interested in participating in this project.    There will be an information session held in the Washington DC area on Wednesday, February 8, 2012 with both US and UK governments present.  Additionally, there will also be an opportunity for interested companies to have individual one-on-one meetings with Government representatives to be scheduled over the next few months.
 Companies interested in attending the information session and subsequent one-on-one meetings on this topic should pre-register via email to the following address: Mr. Joseph Tannenbaum at joseph.tannenbaum@navy.mil or Mr. Adam Goldberg at adam.goldberg@navy.mil.  Please pre-register no later than January 31, 2012. Registration will be confirmed via a responding e-mail and failure to register will prohibit admittance.  Please provide the individuals name, company name, citizenship status, phone and e-mail address when registering.

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs, Orlando VA Medical Center, located at 5201 Raymond St, Orlando, FL 32803, intends to enter into a Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP) contract on the basis of other than full and open competition for the acquisition of an Operating Room Integration System.  In accordance with 38 U.S.C. 8127(c) and Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-5 "Authorized or Required by Statute" and Public Law (PL) 109-461, this will be a sole source acquisition set-aside for Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB).  

An Operating Room (OR) Integration System is used as a modern-day system to optimize space, efficiency, and intra-operative decision making.  A centralized operating room minimizes complexity by integrating the several components of the operating room, such as insufflators, X-ray, ultrasound, video recorder, telephone, video printer, MRI, and other components, etc., so that the surgical team can operate the components from a single interface.  This also allows for several operating rooms to be networked and provides for the expansion of communication and information within the surgical spectrum.  This information can be viewed through several display panels through each operating room, and interfaces with our current electronic health records system to display vital information that can be accessed by the surgical team.  The contractor shall provide all hardware, installation, programming, and set-up to 100% operating capacity.  The OR Integration System shall be installed in ten (10) operating rooms, with audio and video feeds sent to ten (10) conference rooms, and an IP video monitoring station in the surgical director's suite.  The North American Industrial Classification (NAICS) Code/Size is 423450/100 Employees.

This notice is not a request for competitive proposals. Questions/responses shall be submitted to Anita Leitch, Contracting Officer, not later than 18 January 2012 at 4 pm Eastern, at anita.leitch@va.gov.  The Point of Contact (POC) for this action is Anita Leitch, Contracting Officer, at anita.leitch@va.gov or David Bremer, Contracting Officer, as david.bremer@va.gov.

<DESC><strong>NOTICE OF INTENT TO ISSUE A SOLE SOURCE CONTRACT<br /></strong><br />Solicitation Number: GS-01P-12-BW-D-0022<br /><br />Agency: GSA, Region 1, PBS, 1PSA<br />Location: Thomas J. McIntyre Federal Building<br />80 Daniel Street<br />Portsmouth, NH03801
<p>Synopsis:</p>
<p>This announcement is a notice of intent to issue a sole source contract under the requirements of FAR Part 15 and FAR 6.302-1," Other Than Full and Open Competition - one responsible source". The applicable NAICS Code is 238220 with a size standard of $14.0M.</p>
<p>GSA Region 1 Acquisition Branch (1PSA) intends to issue a sole source, commercial item contract for janitorial services; mechanical operations; maintenance repairs; and, quality control services at the Thomas J. McIntyre Federal Building located in Portsmouth, New Hampshire. This contract is being awarded under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c) (1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1 - "Only one responsible source" as the only viable course of action that provides uninterrupted continuation of critical services.</p>
<p>This contract will be awarded as new short-term "bridge" contract with the incumbent contractor, Done Right Building Services, Inc., 4 Copley Place, Boston, MA. 02116. There will be no change to the existing specifications or service requirements and the base term of the contract will expire 09/30/2012.</p>
<p>The proposed bridge contract will be for a maximum period of 13 months (including options). This will provide for continuation of current services while the requirement is solicited and awarded on a competitive basis. Continuation of critical services requires that this contract be awarded no later than 29 FEB 2012. Due to the compressed timeframe, it is neither practical nor possible to compete this short-term contract and still provide uninterrupted services.</p>
<p>The incumbent is currently performing the work satisfactorily and has a working knowledge of the facilities, mechanical systems, and day-to-day requirements. Other contractors could not mobilize quickly enough and do not have the experience in this building needed to provide services seamlessly on such short notice and at a fair and reasonable price.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, GSA will consider any capability statements received by 12 pm EDT on Friday, 20 January, 2012. Capability statements would normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement; however, a determination by the Government not to compete the requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Any respondent companies must be a small business. <br />Responses should be emailed to Ms. Sotheavy Khon, Contract Specialist, at sotheavy.kho@gsa.gov and Ms. Donna Maffeo, at donna.maffeo@gsa.gov so that they are received no later than 20 January 2012.</p>

<DESC>Notice of Intent

SOLE SOURCE NOTICE: The proposed procurement action is for supplies for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source (T.O. Plastics LLC.). Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received within 5 days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Sole Source is based upon this vendor being the only manufacturer/vendor able to satisfy this requirement. See FAR 8.405-6(e)(2).
VA CMOP Leavenworth KS intends to Award a Sole Source purchase Order to T.O. Plastics to provide custom made, one of a kind, Totes. These Totes are used on a conveyor belt system for the collection of Pharmaceuticals to be mailed to Veterans. Totes configuration requires a custom Mold and cutting tools for manufacture. No other configuration of Tote meets the requirements of the conveyor belt system at the Leavenworth CMOP. Award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the government that is not expected to be recovered through competition or in unacceptable delays in fulfilling the requirement.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(ix) The provision at FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, applies to this solicitation along with the following addenda to the provision:<br />52.212-2 Addendum:<br />Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection in which competing Offerors' past performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. Award will be made to the responsible Offeror proposing the combination most advantageous to the Government based upon an integrated assessment of the evaluation factors described below. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) FACTOR 1 -- TECHNICAL. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made by the Contracting Officer. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following technical subfactors:<br /><br />Subfactor 1 - Provider Capability. <br />1a. This subfactor is met when the Offeror provides evidence they are a telecommunications company which owns most of its own facilities such as switching equipment, transmission lines and infrastructure, having the capability to provide Primary Rate Interfaces (PRI), Direct Inward Dial (DID), and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Subfactor 2 - Local Communications Services. <br />This subfactor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a SITE-SPECIFIC diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix 10 requirements. Reference generic example diagram in Appendix 10.</p>
<p>Subfactor 3 - Enhanced 911 Service. This subfactor is met when the Offeror presents a detailed plan for interfacing and complying with State 911 requirements that meets the following criteria:<br />[a] A sound methodology of how the Offeror will comply with State 911 interface requirements for commercial subscriber lines and trunks.<br />[b] A sound methodology of their process for updating Automatic Line Identification 911 database.<br />[c] A description of alternating routes of 911</p>
<p>(b) FACTOR 2 -- PRICE. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) FACTOR 3 -- PAST PERFORMANCE. In evaluating PPI, the government will employ several approaches including: reviewing contract references provided by the offeror; seeking PPI through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. Only recent (within the last three years) and relevant PPI (similar or greater in scope, magnitude of effort, and complexity than effort described in this solicitation) will be evaluated. When reviewing PPI, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform the services described in this solicitation. The performance confidence assessment will result in an overall performance confidence rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower. If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer. <br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-2)</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  <br><br>The combined synopsis/solicitation number is W91ZLK-12-T-0070 and is issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP).  This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-55.   This requirement is 100% Economically Disadvantaged Woman-Owned Small Business (EDWOSB) Set-Aside.  The associated North America Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541513 and the Business Size Standard is $25.0 Million. The Government contemplates award of a Firm-Fixed Price contract for the following requirement.  <br><br>Description of Requirement:<br><br>I. Background<br>Aberdeen Proving Ground (APG) computerized maintenance management system (CMMS) manages the Operations and Maintenance (O&M) activities for the approximately 2200 buildings and 30000 pieces of equipment at APG. Each facility has its own set of O&M requirements. These O&M requirements are met through the day to day operation of MAXIMO  , APG's current CMMS, during the transition period for implementation of General Fund Enterprise Business System (GFEBS). GFEBS is being implemented by the Army to produce accurate, timely and useful financial, cost and real property data; to integrate related functional output data; and to generate data for improving decision-making. GFEBS replaces numerous legacy systems in FY12. During the transition process from MAXIMO to GFEBS, APG Directorate of Public Works (DPW) will require data collection  and  management including management of old MAXIMO data, plus, migration of that data to GFEBS using Department of the Army (DOA) supplied templates. This transition is estimated by US Army Installation Management Command (IMCOM) to run for several years until GFEBS is fully operational. The purpose of this scope of work is to measure, improve and control certain key operational processes surrounding the current MAXIMO system and transition to GFEBS. The objective is to implement new business processes that leverage the efficiencies and management reporting capabilities of both systems and ultimately support a robust Capital Investment Strategy (CIS).<br><br>GFEBS uses a SAP platform database structure that allows O&M professionals to efficiently and economically manage O&M functions for DPW Operations at APG. The legacy systems being replaced by GFEBS are expensive to support. GFEBS is a web-based, enterprise resource planning (ERP) solution using a commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) system. The GFEBS solution applies Army-wide, and includes all three components: i.e., Active Army, the United States Army National Guard (ARNG) and the United States Army Reserve (USAR).<br><br>The USAG APG Garrison Commander has formed a GFEBS Task Force (TF). The GFEBS TF is the Garrison Commander's executive body to oversee and guide USAG APG transition and transformation to the new Army web enabled resource and business management system- GFEBS.<br><br>To achieve this goal, APG DPW will require CMMS support staff working with the GFEBS support team to work with APG Garrison Task Force team to provide strategic guidance to Garrison staff for GFEBS planning, implementation, integration, and sustainment efforts. Duties will require the sustainment of MAXIMO while migration to GFEBS is made by support staff.  MAXIMO will "brown-out" in FY12 leaving GFEBS as the single point of entry for all DPW business processes.<br><br>II. Scope<br>This Statement of Work outlines the requirements for contract support staff during transition to GFEBS. The duties required are described below in detail to include the continued development and operation of the DPW's Web page; maintaining a complete and accurate database in GFEBS; technical support of the DPW work reception desk in providing common level of support (CLS) to APG Garrison supported organizations; generation of reports using Crystal Reports or Business Intelligence (BI) as GFEBS develops that functionality.   DPW maintains 30,000 equipment records and 2200 location records; tracks 30,000 Service Orders (SO) and 3,000 Work requests (WR) annually. <br><br>Within one week of the notice of award, the contractor shall confer with the Government Technical Representative (GTR) to schedule a kickoff meeting.  The purpose of this meeting shall be to clarify any remaining questions, finalize the project schedule based on the new start date, and begin project activity.<br><br>CLIN 0001 Tasks <br><br>Task 0001    Asset Management System Administration/Database Administration.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  <br><br>DESCRIPTION<br><br>In accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.102(d)(2), the Army, using a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) process, is soliciting proposals to conduct a 6.3 Advanced Technology Development effort called Combat Tempered Platform Demonstration (CTPD).  Proposals are required to be submitted in accordance with the guidelines set forth herein. This BAA constitutes the total solicitation for CTPD. There will be no other solicitation issued in regard to this requirement.  Offerors should be alert for any BAA amendments.  <br><br>INTRODUCTION<br><br>High OPTEMPO requirements, asymmetric threats, and harsh operating environments all conspire to affect the operational availability of rotorcraft assets during peace-time and war. While systems are designed to high reliability standards, operational availability is often achieved in-part due to increased inspection and maintenance. Ballistic tolerance is also designed-in by specification, but historically tolerance is defined by short-term survivability with degraded performance and not in terms of true damage tolerance. Stress-life qualification methodology is intolerant of any form of structural damage (FOD, ballistic, fatigue, corrosion, etc.) and while providing extremely high assurance of structural integrity and mission reliability, negatively impacts operational availability. <br><br>Crew, passengers, and platforms are vulnerable to military threats such as small arms fire, environmental threats such as rain, sand, and corrosive elements, as well as operational threats such as hard and crash landings. These threats, even if survivable, often cause damage sufficient to make the platform and crew unavailable. <br><br>Wide variability in operational environments and missions has made hard and crash landings occur in a wide spectrum of attitudes, velocities, and impact surfaces, as well as at gross weights not originally anticipated.  Most current rotorcraft are designed to attenuate energy caused by nominally level impacts on a hard, flat surface.  However, performance decreases in other conditions such as skewed impact angles and soft soil or water landings.  Historical data shows that a significant number of crashes occur at impact angles exceeding design specifications. <br><br>Operationally unavailable, for whatever cause, is effectively an "attrition kill" in a high OPTEMPO environment.  Application of traditional durability, crashworthiness and vulnerability reduction point solutions can limit their effectiveness due to real-world variability and are often unpractical from a weight perspective.  Aircraft damaged in flight cannot reduce loads, for example, to damaged areas to limit propagation. Similarly, rotor systems cannot adapt to partial blade loss or effectively manage energy during an autorotation. These limitations negatively impact operational availability. <br><br>Technology is available to increase the durability of the platform, as well as to reduce the vulnerability of the crew, passengers, and platform to threats. These technologies can reside in the airframe, rotors, vehicle management system, and subsystems for an overall system benefit.  Through integration of these technologies with each other and with the platform, significant improvements in durability and survivability can be made without negatively impacting mission performance.  Ultimately this capability enables the aircraft, crew, and passengers to stay in the fight longer as well as survive, and get back into the fight more quickly.<br><br>CTPD shall focus on integrating and demonstrating enhanced aircraft and crew/occupant protection, improved battlefield durability, and reduced threat vulnerability.  The objective of CTPD is to demonstrate an integrated platform solution that exemplifies both operational durability and total survivability (http://www.aatd.eustis.army.mil/Transfer/CTPD_BAA_Ref_Briefing.pptx) as defined by the Operational Availability; Probability of Kill, given a Hit; and Crashworthiness Index metrics without deleterious effect on Mission Performance.  <br><br>This CTPD BAA is limited to 6.3 Advanced Technology Development. Efforts under this BAA will combine structures, subsystem, vehicle management system, and rotor technologies into a Combat Tempered Platform (CTP) level solution to demonstrate the combined benefits of a complete platform integration and optimization effort. Through this effort, an integrated CTP solution will be matured to a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 6/7 (system demonstration in a relevant/operational environment) to better enable modernization of a current production Army rotorcraft.  Other platforms and next generation systems such as Joint Multi Role (JMR) may benefit from the processes and technologies demonstrated; however, the CTPD will demonstrate system optimized solutions relevant to a currently fielded production platform.  Coordination with the appropriate Army Aviation Program Management Office(s) (PMO) is critical in demonstrating a realistic, viable solution as well as enabling technology transition and specification adoption.  Testing shall be full-scale, representative of the expected aircraft operating environment, and be of sufficient scope to demonstrate the CTP integrated solution and validate the metric contributions. <br><br>REQUIREMENTS<br><br>1.  Technical Description:  The Aviation Applied Technology Directorate (AATD) seeks proposals to conduct a Combat Tempered Platform Demonstration.  The AATD seeks proposals to demonstrate an integrated CTP solution that exemplifies both operational durability and total survivability.   Improvements made during CTPD relative to the current production rotorcraft shall be quantified in terms of the Operational Availability; Probability of Kill, given a Hit; and Crashworthiness Index metrics.  Though not traded or used to manage the effort, Cost and Mission Performance shall also be tracked as independent variables to ensure that the integrated CTP solution can feasibly transition.  The intent of CTPD is to improve survivability and durability, while ensuring that the aircraft Key Performance Parameters (KPPs) are still achievable.  Objective and threshold metric values are not specified, as the optimal solution is platform and mission dependant.  The three CTPD metrics are defined as:  <br><br>-  Operational Availability (Ao) - Defined as the percentage of time that a system is operationally capable of performing an assigned mission (uptime / (uptime + downtime)). The degree (expressed as a percentage) to which one can expect a system to work properly when it is required, that is, the percent of time the weapon system is available for use. Ao considers the effect of reliability, maintainability, and Mean Logistics Delay Time (MLDT) and is the quantitative link between readiness objectives and supportability. Ao is calculated by dividing Mean Time Between Maintenance (MTBM) by the sum of the MTBM, Mean Maintenance Time (MMT), and MLDT, that is: Ao = MTBM / (MTBM + MMT + MLDT).  Note: See https://dap.dau.mil/glossary for definitions of MTBM, MMT, MLDT).<br><br>-  Probability of Kill, given a Hit (P K/H) - Defined as the probability that if an aircraft is subjected to a given threat that it will result in a kill of the aircraft or mission.  A mission kill occurs if an occupant is injured by an event or the aircraft is unable to perform a given mission.  P K/H is calculated by dividing the Vulnerable Area (Av) by the Projected Area of the aircraft (Ap), that is P K/H = (Av)/(Ap).  For CTPD, a composite P K/H will be used that considers the cumulative P K/H for both attrition and mission kills, that is (% Attrition Kill ) * (P K/H Attrition Kill) +  (% Mission Kill) * (P K/H Mission Kill).   P K/H for each kill level is defined as the summation of the P K/H for a given threat multiplied by the likelihood of that threat, that is (% 7.62 mm hits) * (PK/H 7.62 mm hits) + (% 12.7 mm hits) * (PK/H 12.7 mm hits) +  (% 23 mm hits) * (PK/H 23 mm hits) +  (% RPG hits) * (PK/H RPG hits) +  (% Corrosion) * (PK/H Corrosion) +... +  (% N Threat) * (PK/H N Threat).  Note: For additional information see Ball, Robert E. The Fundamentals of Aircraft Combat Survivability Analysis and Design, Second Edition. [ed.] Joseph A. Schetz. s.l.: American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc., 2003. pp. 55-59.<br><br>-  Crashworthiness Index (CI) - Defined as a quantitative measure of a rotorcraft's crash performance across multiple crash environments and conditions over the duration of the crash event sequence.  CI is comprised of six factors (crew retention, troop retention, post-crash fire potential, basic airframe crashworthiness, design for evacuation, potential for an injurious environment) and is calculated by adding the score of these factors. Note: For additional information on each main factor and sub-factors see Aeronautical Design Standard 11B "Survivability Program, Rotary Wing, Appendix I" Directorate for Engineering (AED), May 1987 and "Aeronautical Design Standard 36 "Rotary Wing Aircraft Crash Resistance" Directorate for Engineering (AED) July 1993. For additional information on the calculation of the Crashworthiness Index, see "Full Spectrum Crashworthiness for Rotorcraft," Aviation Applied Technology Directorate, Ft. Eustis, VA, December, 2011. <br><br>A CTP solution that embodies operational durability and total survivability features will include, as a minimum: durability and damage tolerance qualification and life management; protection for critical systems and occupants from environmental, operational, and military threats; full-spectrum crashworthiness; and load alleviation / energy management.  Because of funding, time constraints, and risk, technologies below a TRL 4 should not be considered as part of the proposed CTP solution.  Offerors are reminded that the intent of CTPD is to advance the TRL to enable transition to a current Army rotorcraft program of record; therefore, new aircraft will not be considered.<br><br>The objective of CTPD is to demonstrate an integrated platform solution that exemplifies both operational durability and total survivability; therefore, it is expected that Offerors have performed the required trade studies to arrive at an initial CTP solution.  Revisions to the proposed CTP configuration and associated metric contributions are expected throughout CTPD as the integrated technology solution matures.  Technology transition is critical for the success of this effort, so it is expected that Offerors have already begun to coordinate the initial CTP solution and Technology Transition Plan with the appropriate PMO(s).<br><br>The main product of CTPD is a fully coordinated revised system specification that represents the operationally durable, total survivable, integrated, and optimized technology suite demonstrated.  A fully coordinated Technology Transition Plan and validated metric contributions are essential in obtaining the necessary support to transition this technology and ultimately implement the revised system specification.  <br><br>2.  Deliverable Items:  Awards will require delivery of the following data items or deliverables (delivered in the Offeror's format): <br><br>-  Kick-Off Briefing at Offeror's facility<br>-  Management Plan<br>-  Bi-Monthly Technical Progress and Cost / Business Reports<br>-  Test Plans<br>-  Briefings and Meeting Minutes<br>-  Combat Tempered Platform Conceptual Drawing(s)<br>-  Combat Tempered Platform Group Weight Statement<br>-  Combat Tempered Platform System Specification<br>-  Technology Transition Plan <br>-  Final Report<br>-  Final Briefing at Fort Eustis<br><br>3.

To adequately demonstrate the CTPD prototype, only one award is anticipated. <br><br>4.  Government Furnished Property and Data: Government furnished equipment, property, and data is not anticipated.  Offerors must have access to or be capable of generating the data required to develop and demonstrate the integrated combat tempered platform proposed.  It is the Offeror's responsibility to identify, coordinate, and furnish supporting documentation in the proposal for the use of any Government furnished equipment, property, or data.  <br><br>5.  Funding Instrument:  A variety of funding instruments are available pursuant to this announcement depending upon the proposed effort, the entity submitting the successful proposal(s), and statutory and regulatory requirements the Government must satisfy.  Such instruments include conventional contracts subject to the Federal Acquisition Regulation, as supplemented, and Technology Investment Agreements (TIA) (Cooperative Agreement under 10 U.S.C 2358) or Other Transaction (OT) for Research (10 U.S.C. 2371), which are more flexible than traditional Government funding instruments.  Under TIAs or OTs it is DoD policy to obtain, to the maximum extent practical, cost sharing of at least half of the costs of the project to ensure the recipient has a vested interest in the success of this effort.  Cost participation may be in the form of cash or in-kind contributions, where cash is considered of significantly higher quality in demonstrating commitment to the project.  Cost participation will be considered in accordance with the DoD Grant and Agreement Regulations, DoD 3210.6-R paragraph 34.13 (Cooperative Agreement) (but also see paragraph 37.530 pertaining to Other Transactions for Research) accessible at the following link: http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/32106r_041398/part34.pdf.  The Offeror's desired funding instrument shall be clearly stated in the proposal.  Award type is a subject for negotiation; however, a TIA is strongly preferred. <br><br>6.  Size Status:  Due to the complexity and technical considerations, this solicitation is not set-aside for small businesses.   <br><br>7.  Notice to Foreign Owned Firms:  Participation in this program is limited to U.S. Firms as Prime Contractors; however, Subcontractors may be foreign owned.<br><br>PREPARATION & SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS<br><br>1.  Proposal Preparation: The proposal shall consist of two volumes, Technical and Cost, and shall take the form of a Management Plan (see DI-MGMT-81117 for general guidance) to be revised, as necessary, based on negotiations.  In presenting the proposal material, Offerors are advised that the quality of the information is significantly more important than quantity.  Offerors should confine their submission to essential matters providing sufficient information to define their offer. The Government reserves the right to select only a portion of an Offeror's proposal or the total proposed effort. While multiple proposals from an Offeror are allowed, each proposal should comprise a single optimized platform solution relevant to an Army helicopter platform. <br><br>a.  Technical Volume:  The technical volume of the proposal is limited to seventy-five (75) pages  All text, including tables and figures, shall be no less than Times New Roman 12 point font.  The technical volume of the proposal shall include five sections, as follows:<br><br>-  Section 1 shall identify an aircraft baseline, based on a current production manned Army rotorcraft program of record, and define its performance in terms of the CTPD metrics.<br><br>-  Section 2 shall provide a detailed description of the conceptual combat tempered platform configuration (see DI-SESS-81001D for general guidance), as well as an analysis that substantiates the selection of the technologies and the integrated configuration proposed relative to the CTPD objective, the expected benefits in terms of the metrics, and the ability to transition to a current production manned Army rotorcraft program of record.  It is important to substantiate that the proposed configuration is an optimal combination of technologies based on the aircraft needs and mission profiles. <br><br>-  Section 3 shall define a proposed approach to demonstrate the integrated CTP. Offerors shall include a Statement of Research Effort (SORE) and the specific technical approach to be pursued; in particular tasks, milestones, schedule, and transition strategy, to both effectively and efficiently demonstrate the integrated technology suite; validate the metric contributions; and document a realistic, well coordinated, CTP system specification.     <br><br>-  Section 4 shall identify and describe the proposed deliverables, as well as define the data rights proposed to be asserted to each of the deliverables and the technology to be demonstrated.<br><br>-  Section 5 shall substantiate the capability of the Offeror to effectively execute a meaningful TRL 6/7 technology demonstration in a relevant or operational environment and transition the integrated CTP technology suite through a revised system specification.  This includes: the Offeror's explicit knowledge of and intellectual property for the baseline production aircraft; the suitability and availability of proposed personnel / project team, tools, and facilities; and the proposed plan to coordinate a Technology Transition Plan with an Army Aviation PMO.  To further substantiate capability, the Offeror shall also include a listing of five (5) recent relevant Government contracts/agreements, specifically the title of the effort, the original cost and period of performance, the completed cost and period of performance, the Government Point of Contact, and the final report number. <br><br>b.  Cost Volume: The cost volume of the proposal shall include the total CTPD cost, the cost per task, the cost per Government fiscal year, and the cost per month.   Cost elements (man-hours, labor categories, materials, travel, and other costs) shall be defined for the total CTPD and for each task.  All cost element pricing rates used shall be clearly identified.  Cost share or in-kind contributions, if proposed, shall be clearly identified.  Subcontractor cost proposals, if applicable, including pricing rate details, shall be provided concurrent with the prime Offeror's submission.  The proposed funding instrument, intellectual property rights extended to the Government, and validity period of the proposal, shall be identified. Technical information included within the Cost Proposal will not be evaluated or considered in the rating of technical merit.<br><br>2.  Proposal Submission:  Proposals are due by 1300 on 15 March 2012.  Proposals shall be marked with the solicitation number and shall be submitted in two paper copies and electronic format (PDF or MS Word) on a disc to the Aviation Applied Technology Directorate, Attn:  CCAM-RDT (Hope McClain), 401 Lee Boulevard, Fort Eustis, VA  23604-5577.  Facsimile or electronic proposal submission is not authorized under this Announcement.  Proposals submitted after the closing date will be handled in accordance with FAR 52.215-1, Instructions to Offerors-Competitive Acquisition.  Unless otherwise specified, proposals will be considered valid for Government acceptance through 31 December 2012. This announcement is an expression of interest only and does not commit the Government to pay any proposal preparation costs. Offerors can contact AATD to ask for solicitation clarification. All questions must be emailed to the Contract Specialist at hope.a.mcclain.civ@mail.mil.  Questions received less than two (2) weeks prior to the proposal due date may not be addressed. Any information given to a prospective Offeror concerning this Announcement, which is necessary in submitting an offer or the lack of which would be prejudicial to any other prospective Offeror(s), will be published as an amendment to this Announcement. Offerors should be alert for any amendments to this Announcement. <br><br>EVALUATION CRITERIA/BASIS FOR AWARD<br><br>1.  EVALUATION CRITERIA: The following criteria will be used to determine whether proposals submitted are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government and whether one or more sources will be selected for award.  Criteria one and two are more important than three and four.<br><br>  1.  The extent to which the proposed technical solution satisfies the CTPD objective, provides benefit relative to the metrics, mitigates deleterious effect on mission performance, and can logically transition to a current production manned Army rotorcraft program of record.  <br><br>  2.  The merit of the proposed CTPD approach, which includes the soundness of the proposed objectives, tasks, schedule, transition strategy, and approach to demonstrate the combat tempered platform.<br><br>  3.  The capability of the Offeror to effectively execute a CTPD, which includes suitability and availability of intellectual property, data, personnel, and facilities as well as past performance and the ability to transition the solution to a current production manned Army rotorcraft program of record.<br><br>  4.  The reasonableness of the Offeror's proposed cost to the Government, which includes the realism of the cost elements, benefit of any proposed cost share, and offered data rights.<br><br>No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting proposals. Individual proposal evaluations will be evaluated against the evaluation criteria without regard to other proposals submitted under this BAA.<br><br>2.  REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS:  The technical and cost proposals will be evaluated at the same time and categorized as follows:<br><br>a.  Category I: Proposal is well conceived, scientifically and technically sound, pertinent to the program goals and objectives, and offered by a responsible contractor with the competent scientific and technical staff and supporting resources needed to ensure satisfactory program results. Proposals in Category I are recommended for acceptance (subject to availability of funds) and normally are displaced only by other Category I proposals.<br><br>b.  Category II: Proposal is scientifically or technically sound, requiring further development and is recommended for acceptance, but at a lower priority than Category I.<br><br>c.  Category III: Proposal is not technically sound or does not meet agency needs.<br><br><br>

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>

This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>

Once the company has enrolled, its employees can register at the self-service Registration Station located at the Fort McCoy Welcome Center.
The RAPIDGate Program confirms the individual?s employment status with the company, and then performs identity authentication and background screening.  Employees who qualify are issued a personalized RAPIDGate ID Badge.  The Program performs background screening on a regular basis to verify continued eligibility in the Program.

<DESC><strong>The Defense Medical Materiel Program Office (DMMPO) announces a Request for Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFIAQ) for the standardization of Pad Antiseptic Skin Prep Alcohol. The Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) West is the lead MMESO for this project.</strong>
<p>The primary objective of this effort is to standardize the quality of care across the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) and operational assemblages based on the critical balance of clinical efficacy and value. The intent for this initiative is the standardization of a clinically preferred product(s) and source for institutional and operational medicine requirements at the best price for each MMESO Area of Responsibility (AOR). It is also intended for this initiative to result in the reduction of Stock Keeping Units (SKUs) and National Stock Numbers (NSN). Standardized products must be obtained through the Department of Defense (DoD) Prime Vendor (PV) Program. As an enterprise-wide clinically driven program, vendors and products must meet specific technical requirements plus products must meet or exceed specific clinical performance expectations as a primary consideration. Among vendors who meet the technical requirements and the products that meet or exceed the clinical acceptability, then clinically preferred, best value will determine selection for each MMESO AOR. It is intended that the selected standardized vendor(s) for this Standardization Action (SA) support the enterprise goal of medical materiel standardization that combines operational and institutional requirements. Vendor is not required to quote for each MMESO AOR. <strong>The Government will make a single selection for each of the following MMESO AORs:</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. MMESO North</strong></p>
<p><strong>2. MMESO South</strong></p>
<p><strong>3. MMESO West</strong></p>
<p><strong>4. MMESO Pacific</strong></p>
<p><strong>5. MMESO Europe</strong></p>
<p>The major facilities in the MMESOs North, South, West, Pacific and Europe (hereafter referred to as MMESOs) include but are not limited to MMESO North: Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, Naval Medical Center Portsmouth, Wright-Patterson Medical Center; MMESO South: Wilford Hall Ambulatory Surgical Center, Brooke Army Medical Center, Eisenhower Army Medical Center, Darnall Army Medical Center, Keesler Medical Center, Naval Hospital Jacksonville, Martin Army Community Hospital, Fort Benning, GA; MMESO West: Madigan Army Medical Center, William Beaumont Army Medical Center, Naval Medical Center San Diego, Irwin Army Community Hospital, Mike O'Callaghan Federal Hospital; MMESO Pacific: Tripler Army Medical Center, 18th Medical Group, Kadena AB, Okinawa, US Naval Hospital, Yokosuka, Japan; MMESO Europe: Landstuhl Regional Medical Center, Landstuhl, GE, US Naval Hospital, Naples, Italy, and 48th Medical Group, RAF Lakenheath; and Operational U.S. Forces. This SA is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support, Directorate of Medical Materiel. To participate in this SA a company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the current Med-Surg PV for each MMESO AOR for which a quote is submitted, i.e., Cardinal Health, and Owens &amp; Minor. This requirement is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the standardization initiative and agree to allow PVs to distribute their products. The IA resulting from this RFIAQ is a supplement to the PV Program and is not a contract. For additional information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program please access its web site at https://www.medical.dla.mil/</p>
<p>This IA standardization initiative will be a Three Phase IPP Process: vendor(s) who meets the technical / company requirements in Phase I will be invited to participate in Phase II where no-charge products will be provided for clinical evaluation and Phase III where pricing will be required for submittal. Phase II and Phase III will be run concurrently. The resulting IA will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of selection with three (3) 12-month "option" periods not to exceed a total of 5 years. <strong>Anticipated selection date is April 2012. </strong>The selection will be based on the product and vendor that provides the Best Value to the enterprise. Products and vendors that meet or exceed the technical and clinical performance requirements will be considered clinically preferred products and sources. <strong>Among vendors who meet the technical requirements and the products that meet or exceed the clinically preferred standard, best price (i.e. lowest Aggregate Post Standardization Cost) will determine selection for each MMESO AOR. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Points of Contact: Ricardo Orias, MMESO West Team Leader, Ricardo.orias.ctr@med.navy.mil, (619)532-8537; Cheryl Janus, MMESO West Clinical Analyst, Cheryl.janus.ctr@med.navy.mil, (619) 532-7554.</strong></p>
<p>B. Products &amp; Performance Required <br />The MMESOs are seeking product line items in the category of Pad Antiseptic Skin Prep Alcohol. Within the MMESOs, this product line has an estimated annual dollar requirement of $520,342. This forecast is based on historical usage data during a recent 12-month period. Based on usage data, twenty three (23) lines items of the total twenty nine (29) line items represent the top three (3) products and account for 97% ($505,410) of the total volume in sales ($520,342) in the MMESOs and are clinically significant. Estimated annual demand per Area of Responsibility is approximately MMESO North $103,667, MMESO South $156,267, MMESO West $118,393, MMESO Europe $102,238, MMESO Pacific $39,777. The top high volume usage lines for this project are shown in the Technical/Company Requirements below.</p>
<p>C. Instructions to Vendors<br /><strong>Vendors interested in participating in this standardization initiative will provide an initial response to the FBO-posted RFIAQ to Ricardo Orias, MMESO West Team Leader, ricardo.orias.ctr@med.navy.mil; and Ms. Cheryl Janus, Clinical Analyst, cheryl.janus.ctr@med.navy.mil.</strong> The vendor's initial responses will include detailed information requested in the technical/company requirements listed in the FBO RFIAQ and must also include: (1) Company name and address; (2) Company Point of Contact (POC) (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address); and (3) Identification of the RFIAQ to which the vendor is responding. Due to the potential for email to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the MMESO West that their initial submissions, quote and literature arrived at the MMESO West via email. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date / time, should a problem occur with the first submission. Vendor should complete and submit the attached document. A vendor who cannot open the attachments, may contact the POC as noted in the FBO RFIAQ and a copy will be provided via an alternate method (fax, email or hard copy). <strong>Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00 PM Pacific Standard Time (PST) on the date listed for closing will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization initiative. </strong></p>
<p>D. Source Selection Procedures <br />The MMESO Joint Product Review Board (JPRB) will serve as the forum for clinical recommendations for product selection, seeking and evaluating opportunities for committed volume purchase agreements, and coordinating logistics efforts in support of DoD Components. The boards are chaired by Designated Senior Logisticians (DSLs) and co-chaired by Designated Senior Clinicians (DSCs) in the MMESO AORs and include clinicians and logisticians for MTFs within each MMESO. The Clinical Advisory Committee (CAC) members are the deciding officials for this initiative. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing for each MMESO AOR for which a quote is submitted based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in that MMESO AOR. The MMESO West reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if determined necessary</p>
<p>Phase I Technical/Company Evaluation<br />The MMESO CPT will review the responses from the vendors and determine which vendors meet the technical/company requirements. A vendor must meet the technical requirements for continued consideration in this initiative. Failure to provide any requested information or meet any of the technical requirements will disqualify the vendor from further consideration. A vendor who meets the following technical/company requirements will be qualified and invited to participate in the clinical/performance selection process and will be requested to submit products for testing and their best price discount quotes via an e-mail communication. All communications of significant acquisition milestones (such as invitations to participate or notices of disqualification) should be digitally signed.</p>
<p>Technical/Company Requirements<br />During the pre-source selection procedures, the CPT approved the technical/company requirements outlined below. The requirements below must be answered with the vendor's initial submittal and required documents by the response date stated in the FBO announcement. <strong>A vendor who does not meet these requirements or who does not submit documentation to support these requirements with initial submittal will be disqualified in Phase I.<br /><br /></strong>1. Vendor must provide a complete line of Pad Antiseptic Skin Prep Alcohol products.<br />a. Vendor must provide Pad Antiseptic Skin Prep Alcohol: sterile and non-sterile, non-woven, latex free, 70% Isopropyl Alcohol, 2-Ply, Medium; and 1-ply or 2-ply sterile, non-woven, latex free, 70% Isopropyl Alcohol, Large and will include at a minimum.</p>
<p>PAD ANTISEPTIC SKIN PREP ALCOHOL MED STERILE, 2-PLY<br />PAD ANTISEPTIC SKIN PREP ALCOHOL MED NON-STERILE, 2-PLY<br />PAD ANTISEPTIC SKIN PREP ALCOHOL LG STERILE, 1-PLY or 2-PLY<br />* Operational usage items are included in this list of Pad Antiseptic Skin Prep Alcohol.</p>
<p>b. Vendor must provide a complete itemized list of items supplied (manufactured and/or distributed by brands) via excel sheet, and product catalog and literature in response to this RFIAQ with initial submittal. Vendor is required to supply all items listed in all sizes and type. <br />2. Vendor must have a DAPA or be in the process of obtaining a DAPA for the Pad antiseptic Skin Prep Alcohol product line. Vendor must provide the DAPA number or provide documentation the DAPA number has been applied for. <br />3. Vendor must have agreements with the current Med/Surg Prime Vendors for each MMESO AOR for which a quote is submitted, i.e. Cardinal Health and Owens &amp; Minor for Pad Antiseptic Skin Prep Alcohol or be in the process of obtaining Prime Vendor agreements. <br />4. Vendor will be required to submit discounts off of DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative when pricing is requested in Phase III. Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price. A vendor shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative. Vendor is not required to provide a quote for all MMESO AORs. A vendor who does not provide discounts off DAPA in Phase III for all products will be disqualified.<br />5. Vendor must indicate country from which each line item is an end product, IAW Trade Agreements Act. Vendors having existing DAPA numbers must also ensure that all DAPA line items/end products in the subject product line list the proper Trade Agreements Act country in the DAPA Management System.<br />6. Vendor must identify with initial submittal which MMESO AOR(s) they intend to submit quotes for. Vendor will not have an opportunity to change MMESO AOR(s) during any subsequent stage in this evaluation.</p>
<p>Phase II Clinical Performance Evaluation<br />Following acceptability of the technical/company requirements, the MMESO West, on behalf of the CPT, will request product sample sets from the product group to be sent to the specific CPT members at the participating MTFs. <strong>Vendor will be given 30 calendar days from the issue of the notice in which to deliver the product samples for clinical evaluation in Phase II. Product samples must be shipped no later than fourteen (14) calendar days after issue of notice, and arrive at the designated addresses for each MTF by 5:00PM local time before the 30th calendar day. Vendor must be able to deliver product literature, training materials and evaluation samples as requested to the MMESO Pacific via FedEx or UPS AND to the MMESO Europe via United States Postal Service (USPS) Express Mail AND throughout the United States by selected shipping method when requested in Phase II. Vendor must send the MMESO West verification regarding the shipment of literature and samples. This information will include the date of shipment, final delivery date, tracking numbers and the carrier used by the vendor.</strong> Vendor will provide only the following no cost product samples for clinical/performance evaluation. Unused samples will not be returned. One (1) pack of 50 each of the type and size listed below is to be provided as samples to each of the evaluation sites as identified in the letters of invitation.</p>
<p>PAD ANTISEPTIC SKIN PREP ALCOHOL MED STERILE, 2-PLY</p>
<p>Each evaluator will evaluate each product sample from each vendor against the established requirements. A trial will consist of evaluating sample products from a single vendor, evaluated against the requirements and recorded on a single evaluation form per vendor. Each evaluator will evaluate or trial each participating vendor's product line. The clinical/performance acceptability evaluation period will last for fourteen (14) calendar days. The acceptability evaluation responses will be in a Likert scale format with a one (1) through five (5) scoring range. The scale descriptors are: one (1) Completely Unacceptable, two (2) Overwhelmingly Unacceptable, three (3) Partially Unacceptable, four (4) Acceptable, and five (5) Highly Acceptable. The MMESO JPRB has established a 4.0 as the Clinically Preferred threshold of products for standardization.</p>
<p>A vendor scoring below the clinically preferred threshold will be disqualified from selection for this standardization initiative. A vendor who has been disqualified will be notified in writing upon completion of the standardization selection. Of those vendors that are qualified as clinically preferred, selection will be based on best price. Clinical / performance acceptability evaluations by the participating CPT facilities will be tabulated resulting in one score per participating MMESO per vendor. The participating MMESOs' scores by vendor will then be combined resulting in one final vendor performance evaluation score. All clinical/performance acceptability evaluations will be tabulated by the MMESO West and results will be forwarded to the MMESO CPT for final review.</p>
<p>There will be approximately nineteen (19) MTFs enterprise wide that will be evaluating products.</p>
<p>Clinical/Performance Requirements <br />During the acquisition planning process, the CPT approved the clinical/performance requirements outlined below. <br />1. Patient Safety - National Patient Safety Goal #7 - Infection Control. The Pad Antiseptic Skin Prep wrapper is intact and does not exhibit any holes/tears or rips in packaging. The wrapper must not exhibit any holes, rips or tears in the packaging integrity. This is to avoid contamination of the sterile items; maintenance of alcohol content to provide the optimum in disinfection; and to avoid wastage and increasing costs. <br />2. Patient Safety/Comfort - National Patient Safety Goal #7: Infection Control. The pad will not lint or leave any fabric residue when applying the alcohol. Pad should remain intact and not leave any debris on the skin surface. Lint fragments from the pad can dry, become abrasive and contribute to an inflammatory response on the skin. <br />3. Patient Safety - National Patient Safety Goal #7: Infection Control. The alcohol prep pad is durable and does not fray. Product will have non-woven material which will maintain its shape and required construction.<br />Pads which do not retain durability will not provide an even distribution of isopropyl alcohol and not provide the required disinfection.<br />4. Patient Safety and Efficiency of Usage - National Patient Safety Goal #7 and Cost. The pad will be impregnated with a sufficient amount of Isopropyl Alcohol which allows for the performance of the disinfection required. A pad which is saturated with isopropyl alcohol can drip and run over the site being disinfected. An uncontrolled amount of isopropyl alcohol can dry the patient's skin. A pad which is dry is an added cost as the clinicians must use another pad.</p>
<p>Phase III Pricing Analysis<br />Upon completion of the Phase I - Technical/Company Requirements, a vendor who is found technically acceptable will be qualified / invited to provide product samples and price discount quotes concurrently. A vendor will be given 30 calendar days from the date of pricing requests to submit IA pricing quotes in a prescribed electronic spreadsheet format, based upon the requirements of the MMESOs. <strong>Pricing will be submitted to MMESO West and must be received by 5:00 PM PST, thirty (30) calendar days after the issue date of the vendor notice to submit best price quotes.</strong> Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the specific products requested in this announcement. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the specific products requested in this announcement. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing for the products identified in this announcement. Pricing should be provided for each MMESO AOR for which a quote is submitted based on a committed volume of 80% of the total volume in sales of the MTFs in that MMESO AOR. Vendor quotes will contain separate pricing for each MMESO AOR(s) for which a quote is submitted based on Technical / Company Requirements above. Vendor is not required to provide a quote for each MMESO AOR. Price will be analyzed based on the projected Aggregate Post-Standardization costs for each vendor. Aggregate Post-Standardization Cost will be calculated for each vendor by applying the vendor's offered prices to the anticipated annual usage of the enterprise. Unmatched items will be represented in the Post-Standardization Cost at a baseline non-discounted price (current DAPA price of product with highest procurement). <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Among the products and sources that were determined to be clinically preferred, the best price Aggregate Post-Standardization Cost will be selected for each MMESO AOR.</span></strong></p>

The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: 
RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF EVALUATION FACTORS:
         a)	Price is MORE IMPORTANT than non-price evaluation factors.   The Government may elect to accept                 other than the lowest proposal when the perceived benefits of a higher priced proposal merit the                 additional cost.  The vendor who can deliver the most tons will be considered the lowest price.
         b)	Non-price factors are listed in descending order of performance.
PRICE:
A price evaluation will be performed to determine the reasonableness of the proposed price. Reasonableness will be determined considering other competitive prices received and comparison to the independent Government estimate.
NON-PRICE FACTORS:
         1.	Past performance - timeliness in delivery
               Past performance is a measure of the degree to which a contractor has satisfied its customers in the                past.  The NPS will evaluate past performance based on contacting references provided by the                contractor, the Government's knowledge of Offeror's past performance, and /or references obtained                from any other source.  Offers are instructed to provide a list of 5 past contracts/projects that they                consider similar in nature.  List must provide description, $ amount, date, contact name, contact phone                number and/or email.
A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.  Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. 
Offerors wishing to respond to this RFQ should provide the office with the following:  
1.  Offeror schedule pricing shall be provided on plain bond paper with company identification clearly visible.

<DESC>This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested & a separate solicitation will not be issued. This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format stated in the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Subpart 12.6. The National Park Service (NPS) contemplates award of a firm fixed price contract to the offeror providing the best value to the Government.  The proposed contract is set-aside for small businesses under NAICS codes 562111, 562112, & 562119. The contractor's CCR record shall reflect that it is a small business. For more information on small business size standards, please visit www.SBA.gov/sizestandards.  The bid close date is January 31st by 3:00 pm Arizona time. The anticipated award date is February 10, 2012. Please contact Kimberley Robinson with any questions via email at KimberleyRobinson@nps.gov.


STATEMENT OF WORK  The requirement is to provide dumpsters & pickup/disposal service for solid waste, which includes picking up & properly disposing of approximately 48 cubic yards of solid waste per week from a total of six (6) locations in the developed area at Grand Canyon National Park, NORTH RIM. The entrance to the Grand Canyon National Park North Rim is located 30 miles south of Jacob Lake on Highway 67. Jacob Lake, AZ is located in northern Arizona on Highway 89A, not far from the Utah border. You may research the North Rim further at www.NPS.gov/grca.
Four (4) locations are in the Campground, one (1) is across the parking lot from the administrative building & one (1) is near the generator building. These locations are within two (2) miles of each other. The current vendor uses eight, six (6) cubic yard capacity dumpsters & picks them up once a week. The dumpsters must be small enough so that a person standing on the ground can place a bag of trash into them. The solid waste is generated by National Park Service employees & park visitors. The concession operation on the North Rim disposes of their waste.  The Contractor shall supply & maintain all dumpsters. All dumpsters must remain fully operational for the duration of the contract. The dumpsters must be prominently labeled "NO HOT ASHES" on three (3) sides. The dumpsters must have the name & phone number of the vendor displayed clearly in plain sight. All other standard safety messages for dumpsters located in residential areas must be displayed. Pick up will be at least once a week from May 15 through the first week of November. The day or days of the week are up to the vendor; however, it must be consistent from week to week. There will be one (1) pick up after the road is opened (after winter snow removal) & before May 15, & two pickups after the first week of November. The dates for these will be determined by the NPS & called into the vendor at least two (2) days in advance for needed pick up. These three (3) pickups may all be in one location, since the NPS consolidates the dumpsters to one (1) or two (2) sites for the winter.  The solid waste must be disposed of in a state approved landfill. The Contractor shall inform the NPS as to which landfill will be used at the time of award & also at the start of any option years. 


PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE    The period of performance is 04/01/2012 to 03/31/2013, with the possibility of up to four (4) one-year optional renewal periods (1 April 2013 - 31 March 2014; 1 April 2014 - 31 March 2015, etc.). The NPS has the right to not exercise these renewal periods, & the NPS shall notify the vendor at least 30 days in advance of the decision.

ALL OCCUPATIONS LISTED ABOVE RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING BENEFITS: << HEALTH & WELFARE >> Life, accident, & health insurance plans, sick leave, pension plans, civic & personal leave, severance pay, & savings & thrift plans. Minimum employer contributions costing an average of $3.59 per hour computed on the basis of all hours worked by service employees employed on the contract. << VACATION >> Two weeks paid vacation after 1 year of service with a contractor or successor; 3 weeks after 5 years, & 4 weeks after 15 years.  Length of service includes the whole span of continuous service with the present contractor or successor, wherever employed, & with the predecessor contractors in the performance of similar work at the same Federal facility.  (Reg. 29 CFR 4.173) <<  HOLIDAYS >> A minimum of ten paid holidays per year, New Year's Day, Martin Luther King Jr's Birthday, Washington's Birthday, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Columbus Day, Veterans' Day, Thanksgiving Day, & Christmas Day.  (A contractor may substitute for any of the named holidays another day off with pay in accordance with a plan communicated to the employees involved.)  (See 29 CFR 4174)
THE OCCUPATIONS WHICH HAVE NUMBERED FOOTNOTES IN PARENTHESES RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING:1)  COMPUTER EMPLOYEES:  Under the SCA at section 8(b), this wage determination does not apply to any employee who individually qualifies as a bona fide executive, administrative, or professional employee as defined in 29 C.F.R. Part 541.  Because most Computer System Analysts & Computer Programmers who are compensated at a rate not less than $27.63 (or on a salary or fee basis at a rate not less than $455 per week) an hour would likely qualify as exempt computer professionals, (29 C.F.R. 541.400) wage rates may not be listed on this wage determination for all occupations within those job families.  In addition, because this wage determination may not list a wage rate for some or all occupations within those job families if the survey data indicates that the prevailing wage rate for the occupation equals or exceeds $27.63 per hour conformances may be necessary for certain nonexempt employees.  For example, if an individual employee is nonexempt but nevertheless performs duties within the scope of one of the Computer Systems Analyst or Computer Programmer occupations for which this wage determination does not specify an SCA wage rate, then the wage rate for that employee must be conformed in accordance with the conformance procedures described in the conformance note included on this wage determination.
Additionally, because job titles vary widely & change quickly in the computer industry, job titles are not determinative of the application of the computer professional exemption.  Therefore, the exemption applies only to computer employees who satisfy the compensation requirements & whose primary duty consists of: (1) The application of systems analysis techniques & procedures, including consulting with users, to determine hardware, software or system functional specifications; (2) The design, development, documentation, analysis, creation, testing or modification of computer systems or programs, including prototypes, based on & related to user or system design specifications; (3) The design, documentation, testing, creation or modification of computer programs related to machine operating systems; or (4) A combination of the aforementioned duties, the performance of which requires the same level of skills.  (29 C.F.R. 541.400).
HAZARDOUS PAY DIFFERENTIAL: An 8 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that represents a high degree of hazard when working with or in close proximity to ordinance, explosives, & incendiary materials.  This includes work such as screening, blending, dying, mixing, & pressing of sensitive ordnance, explosives, & pyrotechnic compositions such as lead azide, black powder & photoflash powder.  All dry-house activities involving propellants or explosives.   Demilitarization, modification, renovation, demolition, & maintenance operations on sensitive ordnance, explosives & incendiary materials.  All operations involving regrading & cleaning of artillery ranges. A 4 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that represents a low degree of hazard when working with, or in close proximity to ordnance, (or employees possibly adjacent to) explosives & incendiary materials which involves potential injury such as laceration of hands, face, or arms of the employee engaged in the operations irritation of the skin, minor burns & the like; minimal damage to immediate or adjacent work area or equipment being used. All operations involving, unloading, storage, & hauling of ordnance, explosive, & incendiary ordnance material other than small arms ammunition.  These differentials are only applicable to work that has been specifically designated by the agency for ordnance, explosives, & incendiary material differential pay. ** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE ** If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract (either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state or local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms & maintaining (by laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by an employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wage determination. The DOL will accept payment in accordance with the following standards as compliance: The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the actual cost of the uniforms.  In addition, where uniform cleaning/maintenance is the responsibility of the employee, all contractors & subcontractors subject to this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining agreement providing for a different amount, or the furnishing of contrary affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all employees for such cleaning & maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day).  However in those instances where the uniforms furnished are made of "wash and wear" materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments, & do not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning, daily washing, or commercial laundering in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms of the Government contract, by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work, there is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs.
The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the "Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations", Fifth Edition, April 2006, unless otherwise indicated. Copies of the Directory are available on the Internet. A links to the Directory may be found on the WHD home page at http://www.dol.gov/esa/whd or through the Wage Determinations On-Line (WDOL) Web site at http://wdol.gov.
Conformance Process: The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which is not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination.  Such conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished the fringe benefits as are determined.  Such conforming process shall be initiated by the contractor prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted class(es) of employees.  The conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits shall be retroactive to the commencement date of the contract. {See Section 4.6 (C)(vi)} When multiple wage determinations are included in a contract, a separate SF 1444 should be prepared for each wage determination to which a class(es) is to be conformed.

U.S.  EPA Office of Water


BACKGROUND INFORMATIONIn January 1993, responding to recommendations in the report, ?Safeguarding the Future: Credible Science, Credible Decisions,? Administrator William Reilly issued an Agency-wide policy for peer review.  Administrator Carol Browner confirmed and reissued the policy on June 7, 1994, and instituted an Agency-wide implementation program. The principle underlying the Peer Review Policy is that all major scientific and technical work products should be peer reviewed. 
Peer review is a process for enhancing a scientific or technical work document so that the decision or position taken by the Agency, based on the technical document, has a sound, credible basis.  The goal of the Agency?s Peer Review Policy is to ensure that scientific and technical work products receive appropriate levels of critical scrutiny from independent scientific and technical experts as part of the overall decision making process. 
In 2006, the Agency reaffirmed its commitment to quality decision&#8208;making by updating the Agency Peer Review Policy and issuing the third edition of the Peer Review Handbook (http://www.epa.gov/peerreview/pdfs/peer_review_handbook_2006.pdf), which amplifies and clarifies key Agency peer review issues. The Handbook states that, in general, all influential scientific and technical work products related to Agency decisions should normally be peer reviewed. Peer review is a documented, critical review of a work product performed by experts who are independent of those who developed the product. Work products that are developed to support regulations, such as risk assessments, should be evaluated to determine whether they meet the criteria for ?influential scientific and/or technical work products? and thus should be subject to peer review.
Regulations themselves are not peer reviewed. The straight&#8208;forward application of accepted, previously peer&#8208;reviewed economic methods or analyses in Regulatory Impact Analyses (RIAs), are not typically subject to formal peer review. If, however, the particular facts and circumstances of any piece of economic analysis in an RIA warrant peer review, the Agency should accommodate those needs on a case&#8208;by&#8208;case basis.
 The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is developing regulations under section 316(b) of the Clean Water Act.  Section 316(b) requires that the location, design, construction, and capacity of cooling water intake structures reflect the best technology available for minimizing adverse environmental impact.  The EPA estimates that more than 1,500 industrial facilities use large volumes of water from lakes, rivers, estuaries, oceans, or other waters of the U.S. for cooling, including steam electric power generators, pulp and paper makers, chemical manufacturers, petroleum refiners, and manufacturers of primary metals like iron, steel, and aluminum. 
Cooling water intake structures cause adverse environmental impact by pulling large numbers of fish and shellfish, or their eggs, into cooling systems (entrainment).  There, the organisms may be killed or injured by heat, physical stress, or by chemicals used to clean the cooling system.  Larger organisms may be killed or injured when trapped against screens of an intake structure (impingement).
EPA is developing Section 316(b) regulations.  In December 2001, EPA published final regulations addressing all new power plants and facilities that withdraw more than two million gallons of water daily from waters of the U.S. (Phase I).  
On February 16, 2004, EPA took final action on the Phase II rule governing cooling water intake structures at existing facilities that are point sources; that, as their primary activity, both generate and transmit electric power or generate electric power for sale to another entity for transmission; that use or propose to use cooling water intake structures with a total design intake flow of 50 MGD or more to withdraw cooling water from waters of the United States; and that use at least 25 percent of the withdrawn water exclusively for cooling purposes. See 69 FR 41576 (July 9, 2004).   Industry and environmental stakeholders challenged the Phase II regulations. On judicial review, the Second Circuit (Riverkeeper, Inc. v. EPA, 475 F.3d 83, (2d Cir., 2007)) remanded several provisions of the Phase II rule. Some key provisions remanded include: EPA improperly used a cost-benefit analysis as a criteria for determining BTA, and EPA inappropriately used ranges in setting performan ce expectations.  In addition, the Second Circuit further ruled restoration was not permissible as BTA, and that EPA?s cost-benefit site-specific compliance alternative was also not in accord with the Clean Water Act.  In response, EPA suspended the Phase II regulation in July, 2007 pending further rulemaking.  The US Supreme Court granted certiorari to Entergy Corportation on cost/benefit decision made by the Second Circuit and on April 1, 2009 the Court, in Entergy Corp. v. Riverkeeper Inc., decided that ?EPA permissibly relied on cost-benefit analysis in setting the national performance standards ? as part of the Phase II regulations.?  EPA is now taking a voluntary remand of the rule, thus ending Second Circuit review.
In June of 2006, EPA promulgated the 316(b) Phase III Rule for existing manufacturers, small flow power plants (facilities that use cooling water intake structures with a total design intake flow of less than 50 MGD to withdraw cooling water from waters of the United States; and that use at least 25 percent of the withdrawn water exclusively for cooling purposes), and new offshore oil and gas facilities. Offshore oil and gas firms, and environmental groups petitioned for judicial review, which was to occur in the Fifth Circuit.  On July 23, 2010, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit issued a favorable decision upholding EPA's CWA section 316(b) rule for new oil and gas facilities and accepted EPA's request to remand the existing facility portion of the rule back to the Agency for further rulemaking. EPA has now voluntarily remanded the existing facilities portion of the Phase III rulemaking, and combined the two phases into one rulemaking covering all exis ting facilities. 
EPA is develop revised regulations to provide national performance standards for controlling impacts from all existing facilities with cooling water intake structures under Section 316(b) of the Clean Water Act (CWA).  EPA has published a proposed Existing Facilities Rule in April of 2011, which is available at http://water.epa.gov/lawsregs/lawsguidance/cwa/316b/index.cfm.  The Final 316b Existing Facilities Rule is expected to be signed in July of 2012.
SCOPE OF WORKThe purpose of this Purchase Order is to conduct external, independent peer reviews that will evaluate the stated preference survey materials and implementation process, and the willingness-to-pay estimation methodology that are to be used in partial support of the Section 316(b) rulemaking. This stated preference survey is designed to elicit survey respondents? willingness-to-pay for reducing I&E at cooling water intakes. Under the guise of this Purchase Order, peer reviewers will evaluate the stated preference survey materials and implementation process, and the willingness-to-pay estimation methodology. The reviewers will comment on the appropriateness of the survey for the Section 316(b) valuation of fish, eggs, and larvae, fish population impacts, and ecosystem health, the use of the choice experiment framework, the appropriateness of the survey implementation process, the statistical method for correcting for non-response bias, and the willingness-to-pay estimation meth odology.


STATEMENT OF WORK
The Contractor shall support US EPA to identify and select peer reviewers, conduct peer reviews, and prepare a peer review report as specified in this statement of work. The Contractor shall perform all activities under this Purchase Order in accordance with EPA Agency Peer Review Policy procedures outlined in the following publication, Science Policy Council Handbook - Peer Review 3rd Edition (EPA 100/B-06/002, January 2006, http://www.epa.gov/peerreview/pdfs/peer_review_handbook_2006.pdf).  For this Task, the Contractor shall perform the following subtasks to complete peer review of the stated preference survey materials and implementation process, and the willingness-to-pay estimation methodology. 

Task 1 : Identify Peer Reviewer Pool The Contractor shall identify a group of candidate peer reviewers to  prepare and submit to the EPA PO the credentials of ten nationally-recognized technical experts who are qualified to independently peer review the stated preference survey materials and implementation process, and the willingness-to-pay estimation methodology according to EPA peer review guidelines.  The potential pool of peer reviewers shall include experts in environmental and natural resource economics, and econometric analysis, with specific experience in the estimation of non-use, fisheries, and/or recreation benefits.  The peer review panel shall not include any experts that directly or indirectly (by consultation) contributed to EPA?s rulemaking for section 316(b), nor those experts advising other parties in this matter or associated with any of the data used for various case studies. 
The EPA will review and approve the potential pool of peer reviewers based on credentials and expertise to fulfill the role of peer reviewers of EPA technical documents.  The EPA may reject the use of any particular candidate based on qualifications, conflicts of interest, or past direct involvement with the work under review. 
Task 2 : Conduct Peer ReviewFollowing review and approval by the PO of the peer reviewer pool, the Contractor shall choose five peer reviewers from the peer review panel of the ten candidates approved by the EPA PO, determine their availability to perform the review, and initiate the peer review effort.  The Contractor shall distribute the stated preference survey materials, implementation documentation, the willingness-to-pay estimation methodology, background information on the 316(b) rule, and the Charge to Peer Reviewers (provided to the Contractor by EPA, see Government Responsibilities below) to each selected peer reviewer.  The Contractor also shall provide the peer reviewers any supplemental information requested by the reviewers and deemed necessary by the EPA PO to complete a thorough review. 	
 The Contractor shall coordinate with the peer reviewers and monitor their progress to complete the review within the required time and LOE constraints described in this Purchase Order.  Peer reviewers shall conduct their review according to the guidelines detailed in the charge to peer reviewers.  Peer reviewers shall respond to the specific question asked in the charge or briefly indicate why the question cannot or should not be addressed.  It is not necessary that the peer reviewers jointly reach consensus on their findings and recommendations.  It is expected that no single peer reviewer would expend more than 40 hours performing the peer review; expending less than 20 hours is not acceptable.

Task 3: Prepare Peer Review Report Upon obtaining comments from the peer reviewers, the Contractor shall assemble and provide to the EPA all unedited peer review comments and any additional materials submitted by peer reviewers.  A summary of peer review comments is required.  If the EPA PO makes a request for clarification of any peer review comment upon receipt, the Contractor shall contact the peer reviewer and obtain the needed clarification.  
Upon the written request by the EPA PO, the Contractor may be required to present the peer review findings to any of the following:  EPA technical expert panel, EPA managers, non-EPA or other interested stakeholders identified by EPA PO (e.g., EPA sponsored meeting).

DELIVERABLE SCHEDULEThe Contractor shall provide the following deliverables to the EPA PO.  All text deliverables shall be compatible with Word 2007 and provided in electronic format (i.e., e-mail) to the PO.  Two hard copies and one electronic copy on CD or DVD of all deliverables shall be submitted to EPA.  Two hard copies of any handwritten comments, corrections, or edits provided by the individual peer reviewers on the original materials provided by EPA should be provided to the EPA PO.  Note that EPA anticipates that subtask 1 of this Purchase Order can be initiated immediately.  Subtask 2 will be initiated once EPA provides the peer review charge information and example peer reviewer list.

Task 1	Identify peer reviewer pool: The Contractor shall submit a list and credentials for ten potential peer reviewers within one week after Contractor receipt of the survey and supporting material and charge peer review documents. 
Task 2	Conduct peer review: The Contractor shall choose five peer reviewers and begin peer review within one week after EPA approval of the peer review pool. The Contractor shall complete peer review within one month of the peer reviewers? receipt of the documents.
Task 3 	Prepare DRAFT peer review report: The Contractor shall complete and submit to the EPA PO the peer review report within one week after receiving comments from peer reviewers.
		Prepare FINAL  peer review report: The Contractor shall complete and submit to the EPA PO the peer review report within one week after receiving comments from peer reviewers.




 CONFLICT OF INTERESTThe contractor shall ensure that individual reviewers have disclosed any actual or potential conflict of interest and have signed and submitted a Conflict of Interest Form. The contractor must ensure that none of the conflicts disclosed are direct and substantial as to rule out a particular reviewer.  The Contractor must also adhere to the following requirements regarding conflict of interest.
1)	Upon receipt of the Purchase Order, and prior to commencement of any work, the Contractor shall notify both the EPA Contracting Officer (CO) and Project Officer (PO) of any actual or potential organizational or personal conflicts of interest.

<p><strong>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</strong> - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note: personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

ALL QUESTIONS RECEIVED AFTER THIS DATE AND TIME WILL NOT BE CONSIDERED. All questions submitted within the allotted time will be answered within 24 hours.<BR><BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ?have?, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>

The seller is cautioned to study the Evaluation Factors stated above along with their relative importance. Your bid package shall address each of these factors since these are the standards against which your bid will be evaluated.

<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local, indigenous partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries by providing fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous local partners such as civil society groups (non-governmental organizations or informal community groups), local governments, private businesses, media groups, and others, through identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public understanding and participation in their country's political process.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) launched its Afghanistan program in July 2009 to address instability at the local level. The mission of OTI-Afghanistan is to improve stability in strategically selected locations by supporting formal and informal Afghan governance structures. Through the Afghanistan Stabilization Initiative (ASI) program, OTI seeks to: improve local perception of the Government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan (GIRoA) legitimacy; establish and/or strengthen the link amongst GIRoA, informal governance structures and the local population; and leverage and/or empower community based resiliencies to address sources of instability. To achieve these objectives, OTI incorporates a number of programming principles that emphasize a process-oriented, Afghan-led approach to implementation.<br />OTI-Afghanistan's program works to facilitate community consultation, encourage GIRoA transparency and public outreach, and build Afghan capacity through fast, flexible, and targeted projects. Project activities facilitate local government engagement with communities to address grievances and enhance GIRoA's legitimacy; rehabilitate infrastructure through creation of short-term employment opportunities for which GIRoA is responsible and receives credit; support civic education programs that strengthen the relationship between formal and traditional governance mechanisms; provide technical support to local GIRoA officials and community groups including public outreach and communications training, assessments, surveys, and subject-matter experts; and build GIRoA officials' capacity to design and implement public relations campaigns and community programming following military clearing operations.<br /><br />OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>To hire an OTI Deputy Country Representative that will support USAID/OTI's program in Afghanistan.</p>

<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS. This request is an announcement for information/market research for planning purposes. The synopsis does not constitute a request for proposal, request for quote, invitation for bid, nor does its issuance in any way restrict the Government as to its ultimate acquisition approach. <br /><br />The ICBM Systems Division, Hill AFB, Utah, is seeking potential sources to procure and install the Remote Visual Assessment (RVA) Terrestrial system and remove the RVA Satellite system at Minot AFB, ND and to maintain the RVA Network at three missile wings through Interim Contractor Support (ICS). RVA is utilized by Security Forces (SF) to assess security situations at Launch Facilities (LFs) in order to appropriately dispatch SF resources. <br /><br />The RVA network is currently deployed and maintained in two different configurations: Terrestrial at Malmstrom AFB, MT and Satellite at FE Warren AFB, WY and Minot AFB, ND. Northrop Grumman Corporation is currently transitioning FE Warren AFB, WY from RVA Satellite to RVA Terrestrial and currently maintains the RVA Network through an ICS contract.<br /><br />The RVA Terrestrial system at Minot AFB, ND will be a point-to-point radio communications system that connects 150 LFs, 15 Missile Alert Facilities (MAFs), Missile Security Control (MSC), and training locations to the overarching RVA Network. Tasks include installing concrete poles, cameras, infrared illuminators, and communications equipment outside the LF fence in order to observe the LF's Outer Zone area, removing and disposing of wood poles, satellite communications equipment, and cameras at the LFs, installing towers and monitoring equipment at MAFs and MSC and integrating each system into the RVA network.<br /><br />All three missile wings are connected to the RVA stand-alone network and maintenance is performed by deployed technicians (at each missile wing) for hardware replacement and power failure troubleshooting and remotely by trained system technicians for software upgrades, security updates, and software troubleshooting. This system is certified and accredited as a Mission Assurance Category Level III Sensitive asset and administrators must maintain appropriate training and certifications.<br /><br />Additionally, SuperTel Network Inc., and their affiliate Hexicom Corporation, must be utilized for the RVA installation at Minot AFB, ND by any potential source. This allows the Government to maintain proper configuration of the system's hardware and software ensuring ease of maintenance over the system's life cycle. SuperTel Network Inc. designs the LF data processing equipment and MAF monitoring equipment, while their affiliate, Hexicom Corporation, supplies the custom LF Digital Video Recorders with Hexicom software, Sight Commander software for the monitoring stations, and Net Commander hardware and firmware.<br /><br />THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP). Firms responding to this announcement should include company name, cage code, point of contact, address and indicate whether they are a small business, 8(a) concern, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, or women-owned small business. Potential offerors should submit a Statement of Capability (SOC) that addresses the offerors ability to provide the above requested system and services. The Government reserves the right to set-aside any subsequent acquisition based upon known sources and/or responses to this synopsis.<br /><br />SOC may be submitted by facsimile at 801-777-0990; e-mail: <a href="mailto:matthew.kimber2@hill.af.mil">matthew.kimber2@hill.af.mil</a>; or mailed to 6014 Dogwood Ave, Bldg 1258, rm 25 Hill AFB UT 84056, Attention: Matthew Kimber.

The US Army 5th Signal Command manages the current AMHS support for the U.S. European Command (USEUCOM), the U.S. African Command (USAFRICOM), U.S. Army Europe (USAREUR), and the U.S. Air Force Europe (USAFE).   Consolidation of the hardware and related operations and maintenance manpower to a single location over a period of several years has simplified long term support and training, reduced manning levels, and improved the efficiency of messaging services while reducing costs.  The AMHS component, together with its DMS Backbone Interface component, the 'CommPower Enterprise Extensible Markup Protocol' (CPeXP) and Type2 Cryptographic Support Server (T2CSS), hereinafter collectively referred to as AMHS, is a message processing component that supports DMS messaging requirements.  The equipment configuration consists of process-unique software modules and shares the use of several Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) software. The AMHS is hosted at S-Vaihingen, Germany (central site) and at the Area Processing Center, Kaiserslautern (APC-K), Germany, Continuity Of Operations (COOP) site to provide support for 'secret high' mission critical organizational messaging requirements within the European Theater of Operations (ETO). The Contractor shall provide daily, direct engineering support to the AMHS activities under management of the 5th Signal Command AMHS COR/PM-DMS, Army-E, within the ETO. The Contractor shall serve as the in-country, lead System Administrator (SA) for the AMHS, providing direct support to the other AMHS SA personnel assigned to the 5th Signal Command.

<DESC>MARKET SURVEY CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT TO REPLACE THE DUST COLLECTOR AND DUCT WORK SYSTEM IN THE LOGISTICS SUPPORT FACILITY (LSF) AT THE MIKE MONRONEY AERONAUTICAL CENTER, OKLAHOMA CITY, OK.
This is a market survey for the replacement of the dust collector and duct work system in the Logistics Support Facility (LSF) at the Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center (MMAC), Oklahoma City, OK, 73169, per the attached draft Statement of Work (SOW).  The responses to this market survey will be used for informational purposes only.  This is not a screening information request or request for proposal of any kind.  The FAA is not seeking or accepting proposals at this time.
The FAA will not pay for any information received or costs incurred in preparing the response to the market survey.  Therefore any cost associated with the market survey submission is solely at the interested vendor's expense.
At this time the nature of the competition has not been determined.  The FAA may decide to do a full and open competition or set aside all or part of the procurement for small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the SBA for participation in the SBA's 8(a) Program.
The purpose of this market survey is to solicit statements of interest and capabilities from small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses and 8(a) certified firms, capable of providing a replacement of the dust collector and duct work system in the Logistics Support Facility (LSF), per the attached draft SOW.
This market survey is also being conducted in order to obtain the information necessary to determine whether adequate competition exists to set-aside the competition among small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or 8(a) certified firms.
Interested firms are required to submit the attached Business Declaration form and a copy of their SBA 8(a) certification letter, if applicable.
In order to make this determination the FAA requires the following from interested vendors:
1. Capability Statement - This document should identify:    Type of services provided by your firm,     Size and type of services provided by previous contracts (elaborate and       provide detailed information and past performance),     Number of years in business
Attached is a draft of the Statement of Work and a Business Declaration Form.  Please respond by reviewing the draft SOW, submitting a filled-out and signed copy of the Declaration form (please submit electronically, and email to address below).
All responses to this market survey must be received by Tuesday January 24, 2012, 3:00 CST (Oklahoma Time).   All submittals should be submitted by email to:  lori.lemons@faa.gov

<DESC>Pre-Solicitation Notice P12PS50583Architectural and Engineering services for Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity Contract for various projects at Acadia National Park and St. Croix Island International Historic Site.
Amendment 0002
Clarification:
Submission Requirements
Please see https://orca.bpn.gov for information relative to Certifications and Representations.  
1.	Firms that do not have the NAICS code 541320 listed in their electronic ORCA record or CCR registration shall review the following note that is located on the ORCA web site for guidance and shall submit their certification with their proposals.  The certification will not count towards any of the page limits in the submission requirements:
"*If you are responding to a Government solicitation for supplies or services under a NAICS code not listed in paragraph (b) of this certification, you must provide this certification directly to the Contracting Officer."
Questions and Answers
1.	Question:  Please clarify the response to question number 1 posted in Amendment 0001 on January 9, 2012, with regard to the following factual circumstances:
An Architectural/Engineering Services Firm meets the small business size threshold under both the A/E NAICS Codes and therefore would meet the higher small business size threshold under the Landscape Architecture NAICS Code.  Said firm does not have in-house Landscape Architecture capability but does have in-house capabilities to perform the remainder of the services set-forth in the solicitation notice.  The A/E firm is interested in submitting an offer as the prime contractor which includes a Landscape architect as a subcontractor.  Would this be an acceptable offer or must offers be submitted by small business firms with in-house landscape architecture capability?
Answer:  All submissions of the proposed team will be evaluated in accordance with the Brook Act, Federal Acquisitions Regulations part 36.6, Selection Criteria and the Required Disciplines and services listed in the announcement.  Additionally, see the clarification No. 1 above for guidance.   
2.	Question:  Could you please clarify the difference between the answer to Amendment 0001 Question 11 which indicates that the Prime's personnel must perform at least 50% of the cost of contract for personnel, versus paragraph 2 in the Contract Structure section of the original solicitation which indicates that sub consultants to the Prime may perform the majority of work for specialized services?
Answer:  The Limitation in Subcontracting FAR clause 52.219-14 is applicable over the life of the contract.  The "pass throughs" may be approved on a task order by task order basis.  
3.	Question:  Do we need to have reciprocity (Maine certification) before we submit a proposal or can we gain reciprocity after we are awarded the project?
Answer:  All submissions must be complete by the due date stated in the announcement in order for evaluations to be conducted.  Evaluation will be made based on your submission as of the due date, January 19, 2012 by 2:00 p.m. local prevailing time.  
4.	Question:  Do all National Park projects require reciprocity in the state the work is being performed?
Answer:  No.  Each Solicitation is structured individually depending on the requirements.
5.	Question:  If so, will we need to gain reciprocity in each state before we submit a proposal?
Answer:  Please see the Synopsis.  "These sites are located in Maine near the towns of Bar Harbor, Winter Harbor, and Calais."
6.	Question:  Under submission requirements you say that "firms with branch offices and consultants must submit Part II of Standard Form 330 that include project samples"  By saying this, do you mean that only the Prime Firm's project samples should be included in SF330 Part I?  And that any project samples from consultants should be included in the SF330 Part II section?
Answer:  Provided that each firm is following the Submission Requirements, and Instructions applicable to the Standard Form SF 330, the organization of where to place project samples is up to the firm.
7.	Question:  Also under "Submission Requirements" you ask for the firms to "separately address the evaluation factors and relate where information can be found in the submittal package relevant to each factor."  Is this subject to the 50 page limitation?  Answer:  Yes.
8.	Question:  Can 10-point font be used to complete non-narrative portions of the SF330 form, such as filling in the Firm Names and Addresses in Part 1 Section C or for the Resumes in Section E?
Answer:  No.  Please follow the Submission Requirements.
9.	Question:  Regarding the following statement in the Submission Requirements, "Firms with branch offices and consultants must submit Part II of Standard Form 330 that shall include project samples," is there clarification available for this request?  Does this request allow us to include additional pages in each firm's Part II featuring these project samples?
Answer:  Part II shall be limited to branch offices that have a key role on the team and sub consultants or other team firms exclusive of the prime firm.  Pursuant to the submission requirements there is no page limit with regard to Part II.

Work on this contract will involve removal, by barge mounted mechanical means, and divers from the water.  The material is in 30 to 40 feet of water in each spillway bay.  Total cubic yards to be removed are approximately 550 cubic yards.  The material removed will become property of the contractor for disposal.  Rock size varies from 3 inch in diameter to approximately 5 feet in diameter, with the majority of the rock between 2 to 3 feet in diameter.  Some of the bays have erosion holes where the material will potentially need to be removed by divers.<br><br>Work on this contract will take place between February 10, 2012 and April 1, 2012.

<DESC>The Shallow Water Agile Submarine Hunting (SWASH) program intends to develop ASW surveillance and cued search capability for shallow water littorals without the use of traditional acoustics or sonar. DARPA seeks the widest range of possible sensing solutions to achieve this goal. The best solutions will allow for operations to be useful across all phases of conflict. The expectation is that sensing solutions with low size, weight, power, and cost offer the greatest opportunity for flexible integration into unmanned airborne platforms

<DESC><span style="text-decoration: underline;">II. Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Processed</span>
<p>This action will be awarded as a new firm-fixed-price order. The estimated delivery date is 10 weeks ARO. This acquisition is considered Other Contracting and will be acquired under FAR Part 8 Required Sources of Supply. This justification is written IAW FAR 8.405-6(b). This is a new order for specialized equipment using GSA schedule GS-24F-0022N. Heim Data Systems is the sole manufacturer of the equipment for procurement.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">III. Description of the Supplies/Services Required To Meet the Agency's Needs</span></p>
<p>The equipment required to meet the need is; <br /><br />&bull;4 each model D5200/1 (ref HS100-5200/1)High Speed data recorder mainframes, <br />&bull; 4 each data recorder media protection cartridges (ref HS100-2725)<br />&bull; 12 each model DBM 12 (ref HS120-0114) blanking modules, <br />&bull; 2 each model MRG41 (ref HS110-3036) PCM telemetry modules. The cost estimated total for the order is $173,000.<br /><br />Expect a complete delivery schedule of 10 weeks.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">IV. Identification of the Justification/Rationale for Limiting Sources and Demonstration of the Contractor's Unique Qualifications to Provide the Required Supply/Service</span></p>
<p>FAR 8.405-6 requires an ordering activity to justify its actions when restricting consideration of schedule contractors to fewer than required in FAR 8.405-1. In addition, DFARS 208.405-70(c)(1) requires that all orders exceeding $150,000 be placed on a competitive basis (by providing a fair notice of the intent to make the purchase) unless a written determination is justified and approved. The specific circumstance that justifies restriction for this acquisition is FAR 8.405-6(a)(1)(i)(B).</p>
<p>FAR 8. 405-6(a)(1)(i)(B) Only one source is capable of responding due to the unique or specialized nature of the work. The equipment request (airborne avionics data recorders) is to expand an existing proven B-2A flight test data collection system capability from two to four identical platforms. Not procuring the specified data recorders will greatly impact the test organizations ability to execute multi-objective flight test objectives in the future. Rational for procuring identical data recorders is to sustain one maintainable capability type that is user configurable allowing for cross- utilization of existing resources. Since 2004 in access of $2.5 M has been invested developing the proven data collection capability that enables the user to configure the Zodiac recorder for specific data types. Purchasing the specified data recorders from Zodiac Data systems maintains the proven plug and play capability. The plan has been to utilize existing media cartridges (&gt;$10K ea) and data modules (&gt;$10K ea) to complete the final stages of fielding four complete data collection platforms.<br />Introducing different equipment would require a significant redesign and validation process for an undesired additional airborne data platform configuration. Additional equipment will need to be procured to support and maintain the product. Spares would need to be considered for purchase to maintain the readiness. Training will need to be addressed. Establishing technical support for out-of-scope field maintenance would be one of many logistic issues that would need to be established. Airborne Data Recorder vendors do not design their equipment to be truly compatible with another competitor's equipment.</p>

<DESC>&nbsp;
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'">A task order was issued in October 2007 to ARD-Tetra Tech to provide technical assistance in the implementation of the Strengthening Property Rights in Timor-Leste (SPRTL) project, locally known as Ita Nia Rai (Our Land).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The project provides technical assistance to the GoTL's Ministry of Justice (MOJ).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A final evaluation of the project was conducted in October of 2011 to inform the Mission on the degree to which the SPRTL project had accomplished its goals, identify strengths and weaknesses of the project, and make recommendations for future activities. The evaluation team concluded that the SPRTL project has largely been a success.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The most notable, and valuable, of these successes has been the collection and recording of land claims data from across the country.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This data should provide the core of a national cadaster and/or registry that identifies and tracks ownership of parcels of land over time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The MOJ plans to carry on the registration and validation of property claims, a process initiated by the project.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>To date over 53,000 property claims have been registered through the Ita Nia Rai process.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'">While the Ministry of Justice's desire to take over the project is encouraging, the transfer of responsibility also presents many challenges. The Ministry lacks experience managing this type of function and does not have the needed structures in place for taking on such an activity.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>An extension to the SPRTL project will keep the project's management team in place so that the transition of responsibility can take place in a controlled manner, with the USAID funded management team available to serve as advisors, guiding a smooth handover while building the needed structures within the MOJ. </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'">Therefore, the purpose of this modification is to extend the period of performance of the task order for an additional six months, thru September 30, 2012 and allow the contractor to continue to provide advisory services to the MOJ in order to assist with the transition of project activities and protect the US Government's long-term land sector investment.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This extension will result to an increase of the current ceiling price by $500,000 from $9,875,734.00 to $10,375,734.00.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span></p>
