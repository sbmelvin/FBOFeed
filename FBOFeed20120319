<DESC><span>
<div><span>This is a pre&#8208;solicitation notice for the National Shipbuilding Research Program Advanced Shipbuilding Enterprise (NSRP ASE). The NSRP ASE Executive Control Board plans to issue a Research Announcement in the June 1, 2012 timeframe to solicit summary proposals that respond to priorities in the program's Strategic Investment Plan, including areas of particular interest that will be identified in the Research Announcement.</span></div>
</span>
<p>Research Announcements (RAs) are general in nature, identifying areas of research interest, disclosing criteria for selecting proposals, and soliciting the participation of all offerors capable of meeting the NSRP ASE objectives. The flexibility of RAs allows objectives to be stated in general terms of need or interest, as opposed to other solicitations (e.g., Requests for Proposals) which require specific solutions or outcomes.</p>
<p>The NSRP ASE program goal is to reduce the cost of building and maintaining U.S. Navy ships. To accomplish this, NSRP ASE is focused on industry&#8208;wide implementation of solutions to common cost drivers and consensus priority issues that exhibit a compelling business case to improve the efficiency of the U.S. shipbuilding and ship repair Industry. Proposals that incorporate aggressive technology transfer to, and buy&#8208; in by, multiple U.S. shipyards are strongly preferred.</p>

<DESC>The Air Armament Center, Test and Evaluation Contracting Branch (AAC/PKET) is planning to award a sole source contract, under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, to The Boeing Company, 7755 E Marginal Way S, Seattle, WA, 98108-4002. AAC/PKET anticipates that the new, follow-on contract will be awarded in July 2012. Eglin Air Force Base seeks to procure on-call engineering and sustaining support to include follow-on training for the E-3 Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS) Operational Facility (OPFAC) which is located at the Base's 46th Test Squadron (46 TS) Datalinks Test Facility (DTF). The E-3 AWACS is designed, developed and delivered by Boeing Seattle. This effort will require configuration management of the system to assist in tracking available software and hardware updates, which routinely occurs annually. Additionally, support may include software enhancements designed to address anomalies with the software. This effort requires that the contractor have a prior and detailed working knowledge of the unique equipment and software involved in the E-3 AWACS configuration. Boeing Seattle is the only known company that has the detailed knowledge and expertise to meet the Government's requirements for the effort described in this presolicitation. A requirements contract is anticipated which may include a mix of contract types: firm-fixed price, fixed price incentive fee, cost plus incentive fee, cost plus fixed fee, time and material, and other contract types. It is estimated that the total period of performance will not exceed five years from the time of award. All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency. Forward capability statements to the Contracting Officer, Mr. Kevin Miller at Kevin.miller@eglin.af.mil and the Contract Specialist Ms. Corletta Wilson at Corletta.wilson2@eglin.af.mil. For further information concerning technical aspects, you may contact Mr. Don Duy at Don.duy@eglin.af.mil or by phone, 850-882-1474. For contractual information contact Ms. Corletta Wilson.
<p>The clause 5352.201-9101, Ombudsman, is applicable to this procurement. An Ombudsman has been appointed to address concerns of offerors or potential offerors. The Ombudsman does not diminish the authority of the program manager or contracting officer, but communicates contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate Government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman shall maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposal or in the source selection process. Matters of routine or administrative nature concerning this acquisition should not be addressed to the Ombudsman, but rather the points of contact identified above. The AAC Ombudsman is Brigadier General David A Harris, Vice Commander (AAC/CV), (850)882-5422.</p>

<DESC><p>NOTICE OF INTENT TO ISSUE A PURCHASE ORDER. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), National Personal Protective Technology Laboratory (NPPTL), Surveillance, Communication and Scientific Support, hereby announces its intent to issue a purchase order to the University of Pittsburgh, Ronald E. LaPorte, Ph.D., Director Telecommunications and Disease Monitoring to develop the Personal Protective Equipment and Technologies Supercourse.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND AND SCOPE:</p>
<p>NIOSH conducts outreach in occupational safety and health to provide employers and employees with knowledge on PPE selection, use, and expectations to improve workplace safety and health. NIOSH has sector and cross-sector programs and activities to better protect the health and safety of American workers. In addition, NIOSH has a Global Collaborations programs to address occupational safety and health issues internationally. One of its cross-sector programs is the Personal Protective Technology (PPT) Program, managed by the National Personal Protective Technology Laboratory (NPPTL), located in Pittsburgh, PA. One of the objectives of the PPT Program is to develop an annual outreach strategy to encourage workers who rely on PPT to take responsibility for personal safety and encourage organizations to foster a culture of safety. A strong outreach program is the cornerstone for stakeholder/partnership building, while also facilitating technology transfer. Workers, employers, PPE end-users, and trade associations are targeted as recipients of the PPT Program outreach activities.</p>
<p>The outreach strategy includes dissemination of PPT Program research, certification, policy and standards, and surveillance information to educate and inform personal protective equipment users of current PPE selection, use and expectations information and information regarding PPE research findings and certification activities.</p>
<p>The contractor will work with NPPTL senior leadership to identify 25 PPT power point presentations used by the PPT program to educate and inform personal protective equipment users of current PPE selection, use and expectations information and information regarding PPE research findings and certification activities. An effort will be implemented to improve capacity for training in multiple areas of environmental and occupational health.</p>
<p>Dr. Ronald LaPorte and Dr. Faina Linkov are uniquely qualified to support this effort because they have published over 100 peer reviewed papers on the development of professional networks and information dissemination, including Nature publication on recruiting scientists into networks.</p>
<p>Dr. LaPorte and Dr. Linkov and their team can support this effort by providing a platform for information sharing, disseminating lectures, and building the network of lecture users. Thus, this team has a well-established scientific record in the development of outreach and education efforts. This team effectively implemented many similar efforts, including projects funded by CDC, where Dr. LaPorte's team provided support in network building, lecture library building and information dissemination. In the past 3 years the Supercourse group has produced a 10 fold increase in training in Global Health as well as networking most of the global health researchers. The PPT effort is expected to have a similar outreach impact.</p>
<p>Responsible sources that believe they possess the expertise and capabilities identified above are encouraged to submit to the Contracting Officer within 15 days from the posting date of this notice, their written item description/item characteristics and pricing information in the format they choose, not to exceed 10 pages. Please forward the item description and pricing information to Margaret L. Mooney, CDC NIOSH, 626 Cochrans Mill Road, Pittsburgh, PA 15236, Reference 2012-Q-14440. All vendors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) prior to an award of a federal contract. The website is: www.ccr.gov.</p>
<p>The Government will review any/all item descriptions and pricing information submitted and determine if other qualified sources do exist that could provide this requirement. Information received in response will be used solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>If no affirmative responses are received within 15 days, in accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), negotiations will be conducted with Ronald E. LaPorte, Ph.D., Director, Director Telecommunications and Disease Monitoring WHO Collaborating Centre, Professor of Epidemiology, 111 Parran Hall, 130 DeSoto St., University of Pittsburgh 15261 as the only source and a purchase order will be issued without any additional notices being posted.</p>

<p>The project is located in Wallowa County, OR approximately 12.5 miles southeast of Joseph, OR (T3S, R48E, SW &frac14; of Section 19). There are two separate routes which may be used to access the project site (see plans sheet 2 of 8 for a vicinity map). Portions of both routes are narrow and steep. The shortest (distance) route is following US 350 (Omaha Hwy) east out of Joseph to county road 674 (Rail Canyon Road) to county 850 (Armin Rd) to 3940. This route crosses two county bridges, contains one low radius switchback, and has multiple stretches that are very steep. The longest (distance) route is following US 350 east from Joseph to county 4602 (Wallowa Mountain Rd which becomes FSR 39) to FSR 3930 (Hurl Butte Rd) to FSR 3940. This route contains long stretches of maintained forest road, but after turning on FSR 3940 becomes steep with one low radius switchback. Since large trucks shall be needed to access the site, contractors shall investigate each route before submitting a proposal.</p>

The supporting test equipment will be re-used for SMAT.  Thisequipment, including the 5% scale mobile launch platform, flame trench, and launch tower,was designed for use with the RATO motor.  The use of a different motor would requireeither extensive modification of the existing test equipment or construction of new testequipment.

ALL INFORMATION NEEDED FOR INTERESTED PARTIES TO SUBMIT A STANDARD FORM (SF) 330, ARCHITECT-ENGINEER QUALIFICATIONS, IS CONTAINED HEREIN.  THERE IS NO SEPARATE REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP) PACKAGE TO DOWNLOAD.
Naval Facilities Engineering Command Southeast (NAVFAC SE), Naval Air Station (NAS) Jacksonville, Florida intends to award up to four (4) Indefinite-Delivery Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) contracts for  Professional Architectural and Engineering (A/E)  design services.  The contract will primarily provide design services for Department of Defense (DoD) and Non-DoD facilities located in South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Texas, Guantanamo Bay Cuba, and Andros Island Bahamas.
 Although less frequently, this contract could be used for design services at activities located within the entire NAVFAC AOR (worldwide).  Design services will primarily be for preparation of Design Bid Build documents (100% plans and specifications) and Design Build Requests for Proposal (RFPs). Projects will include new facilities and renovation/modernization/repair of existing facilities.  Project types will include general building construction (administrative and training facilities, dormitories, hangars, child development centers, fitness centers, etc.), airfield projects and waterfront projects.  Other ancillary activities associated with providing the above services will include, but not be limited to, topographic surveys, geotechnical investigations, lead and asbestos surveys, hurricane damage facility condition assessments, cost estimates, and DD 1391 Military Construction Data documentation.
  The duration of the contract will be for one (1) year from the date of initial contract award, with up to four (4) additional one-year option periods.  The total amount that may be paid under each contract, including option years, will not exceed $30,000,000.  The Government guarantees a minimum of $10,000 for the contract term of each contract awarded from this synopsis.  The minimum guarantee is typically met by the issuance of the first task order.  The Government makes no representation as to the number of task orders or the actual amount of work to be ordered.  Contractors are not guaranteed work in excess of the minimum guarantee.  In the event the estimated annual fee is not met, the Government reserves the right to carry-over any unused capacity to the following option year(s).
 The options may be exercised at the discretion of the Government subject to workload and/or satisfaction of the A&E performance under the subject contract.  The proposed contracts are being solicited as UNRESTRICTED, FULL AND OPEN to all large and small business concerns.  The North American Industry Classification system (NAICS) for this contract is 541330.  The prime firm and consultants for each contract will be required to perform throughout the contract term (including option years, if implemented).  The anticipated value of construction projects for this procurement will typically be less than $30,000,000 although larger projects may be included.

<DESC>This solicitation is being posted to both the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) page located at http://www.fbo.gov/ and the Navy Electronic Commerce on Line (NECO) site located at https://www.neco.navy.mil/  While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable.  Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by NSWC Crane. 
 
Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWC) Crane Division plans to enter into a Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) with Raytheon Integrated Communications Systems, 1010 Production Road, Fort Wayne, IN. 46808 for the procurement of supplies and services to support the Communications Electronic Attack Surveillance and Reconnaissance (CEASAR) Systems AN/ALQ-227Communication Countermeasure Set (CCS) Variant.
  The BOA will cover a five-year period for modifications, upgrades, engineering support, technical support, logistical support, assemblies, sub assemblies, ancillary equipment, system and subsystem integration of the AN/ALQ-227 CCS Variant and other variant or derivative systems.  The CCS System covered includes the system as a whole, the individual Weapons Replaceable Assemblies (WRAs), the Shop Replaceable Assemblies (SRAs), Support Equipment, Test Equipment and applicable system firmware.  Efforts will include Repair/Rework/and Maintenance, Spares and Replenishment, Engineering Support Services, Research and Development, Test and Evaluation, Redesign and Modification and Logistics Support Service as required.
  Additional detailed guidance will be provided as implemented by specific job orders placed under the BOA.
 
This requirement will be negotiated on a sole-source basis in accordance with the statutory authority 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1.  The basis for restricting competition is that the U.S Government does not own or possess the required documentation necessary to manufacture, repair upgrade, or modify these avionics components in addition to the duplicative costs and time that would be required to reverse engineer the system.  Since this is sole source procurement, a solicitation will not be posted to the internet.

Responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency.
  It is the responsibility of interested offerors to monitor FedBizOpps and/or NECO for any additional amendments that may be issued.  It is the responsibility of the offeror to submit offers to the Point of Contact (POC) at NSWC Crane.

<CONTACT>Carolyn Keesman, Contracting Officer, Phone 202-260-0950, Email carolyn.keesman@hhs.gov - Elizabeth Steiner Elmazahi, Procurement Analyst, Phone 202-205-8926, Fax 202-205-6061, Email elizabeth.elmazahi@hhs.gov
<DESC>The mission of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) is to develop and procure medical countermeasures that address the public health and medical consequences of chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) accidents, incidents and attacks, pandemic influenza, and emerging infectious diseases. Specifically, BARDA supports the advanced development and procurement of drugs, vaccines and other products that are considered priorities for national health security. BARDA funding bridges the "valley of death" characterizing the late stages of product development. BARDA's support ensures continuity of funding at a critical point for medical countermeasures developed by industry or emerging from the basic research and preclinical development activities sponsored by the National Institutes of Health (NIH). In procuring medical countermeasures for the Strategic National Stockpile, BARDA enhances the capabilities of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to organize an effective response.
<p>The Pandemic and All Hazard Preparedness Act (PAHPA) directs BARDA to promote (i) innovations in technologies that may assist countermeasure and product advanced research and development, (ii) research on and development of research tools and other devices and technologies, and (iii) research to promote strategic initiatives. The 2011 BARDA Strategic Plan defines BARDA's vision and lays out a series of capability goals over a five year period (2011-2016). Amongst BARDA's guiding principles is supporting the development of novel platform technologies that provide flexible systems for the production of medical countermeasures against a variety of threats. Through this Broad Agency Announcement (BAA), BARDA seeks to address, in part, BARDA's Goal 4, responsive and nimble programs and capabilities to address novel and emerging threats, as well as support the technological and scientific advancements of medical countermeasures for biodefense and pandemic influenza. The PAHPA and BARDA Strategic Plan are located on the ASPR website: http://www.phe.gov/Preparedness/legal/pahpa/pages/default.aspx and http://www.phe.gov/about/barda/Pages/2011barda-stratplan.aspx.</p>
<p>This Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) is a continuation of a previous BAA (BARDA-BAA-11-100-SOL-00001) and is similarly designed to promote science and technology advancements of platforms applied to MCM development for the Strategic Science and Technology Division (SST) of BARDA.</p>
<p>The Government's intent is to solicit potential advancements in science and technology in the following BARDA SST Areas of Interest:</p>
<p>1.Pipeline acceleration and evaluation of candidate vaccines and therapeutics.</p>
<p>2.Product improvements to enhance safety, efficacy, ease of use, and manufacturability of MCM.</p>
<p>3.Product repurposing to treat novel and emerging pathogens.</p>
<p>4.In vitro diagnostic platforms for the rapid diagnosis of human infection.</p>
<p>The specific application of the technologies will focus on biodefense, pandemic influenza, and other emerging infectious diseases (EID). BARDA is open to evaluation of technologies at multiple stages of development, but advanced development activities of products specific for CBRN and Influenza will not be considered. Development activities are to be fully integrated with regulatory activities associated with product development efforts.</p>
<p>BARDA anticipates awarding multiple contracts and/or other transactions for research and development efforts from this BAA that have sufficient potential for success, are of interest to the Government, and support one or more of the listed BARDA SST Areas of Interest.</p>
<p>Contact Information:<br />Comments to this announcement, referencing synopsis BARDA-BAA-12-100-SOL-00013 may be submitted to SST-BAA@hhs.gov.</p>

Work with project lead and teams to formulate a system concept that will meet stakeholder requirements, and translate into a set of clear, concise, verifiable and valid well-written technical requirements.  Formulate requirement specifications using MIL-STD-961E as a guide.  Establish traceability between various levels of requirements and ensure completeness by tracing to functional models and architectures.  Develop interface requirements in accordance with defined system architectures.
Requirements Management: Ensure that supported projects have a documented requirements management process that describes how changes to requirements will be made by the team.  Use existing automated tools (i.e. Dynamic Object-Oriented Requirements System (DOORS)) to manage changes and traceability for sets of requirements.  Maintain traceability between requirements and functional models, design elements, test cases, and other levels of requirements.  Produce reports (e.g. traceability reports) and specifications for the customer.
Functional Analysis: Involves capture and examination of system functionality, interfaces, and behavior (states and modes) using a variety of techniques, including use cases, activity diagrams, sequence diagrams, and state transition diagrams. This area also includes methodical decomposition of mission tasks to operational capabilities and functional/technical requirements.
System Architecting: Organize operational- and system-level information (e.g. operational activities, system functionality) into particular views to convey the right set of information to stakeholders to support decision making.  Construct views and models in accordance with standard frameworks (including, but not limited to DoD Architectural Framework (DODAF)).  Construct and maintain the architecture model using automated tools (i.e. Magic Draw, Rhapsody).

<DESC>The US Army Contracting Command-Redstone on behalf of the Product Management Air Warrior office is conducting a Request for Information (RFI) in accordance with FAR 15.201 (e) to determine the availability and technical capability of qualified concerns that are suppliers of the services described below and are capable of fulfilling the requirements mentioned below. <br><br>This notice is for planning purposes only, and does not constitute an Invitation for Bids, a Request for Proposals, Solicitation, Request for Quotes, or an indication that the Government will contract for the labor and materials contained herein. This notice is not to be construed as a commitment on the part of the Government to award a contract, nor does the Government intend to pay for any information submitted as a result of this notice. This RFI is part of a continuous process for obtaining the latest information on the commercial status of the industry with respect to their current and near-term abilities. The information provided herein is subject to change and in no way binds the Government to solicit for, or award, a competitive contract. It is emphasized that this is a notice solely for planning and informational purposes only and is not be construed as a commitment by the government to enter into a contractual agreement, nor will the government pay for information solicited. The Government does not reimburse respondents for any cost associated with submission of the information being requested or reimburse expenses incurred to interested parties for responses to this RFI. Any responses received will be treated as information only.  It shall not be used as a proposal.<br><br>Purpose:  To identify potential sources and Commercial-Off-the-Shelf (COTS) items that may satisfy the Air Soldier ALSE 72-Hour Mandatory Items Kit requirements as provided in the attached draft specification and to solicit feedback regarding the requirements captured in this document.  Ideal solutions will provide reductions in weight and bulk from the current suite of gear.  The responses to this RFI will be used to develop an initial list of potential offerors that may elect to participate in a future Request for Proposal (RFP) leading to the execution of a competitively awarded IDIQ contract for up to 5 years to purchase test articles and to provide assets for fielding as part of the Air Soldier beginning 4Q2014.<br><br>Background:  Air Soldier is the next generation aircrew mission and protective ensemble that will replace the legacy Air Warrior (AW) system currently being used by Army rotary and select fixed wing aircrew members.  Air Soldier encompasses all clothing and individual equipment worn or carried by the aircrew, including ancillary aircraft mounted hardware and components, that serve the primary objectives of physiological sustainment, personal protection, and enhancing mission performance while operating in all environmental and threat conditions, including crash and post-crash escape and evasion scenarios.   A key performance parameter (KPP) of Air Soldier is the reduction of weight and bulk.  Analysis has shown weight and bulk to be one of the factors affecting crew endurance.  In addition, bulky equipment reduces crew mobility which also decreases mission effectiveness.  The current effort is focused on identifying end items that could reduce the weight and bulk burden on the soldier. <br><br><br>Instructions:  The attached draft specification describes the equipment needed for 72 hours in a Survival, Escape, Rescue, and Evasion (SERE) environment.  Offerors are asked to provide information on end items that fulfill one or all requirements and meet the goal of reducing weight and bulk over the current selection of gear. To assist, Appendix 1 is provided with the current suite of survival items and one potential solution that would allow PM Air Warrior to reach a 14% reduction in weight and 17% reduction in bulk.  However, other approaches to providing the functionality required by the specification while still achieving the weight and bulk goals will be considered.  Samples of items may be submitted and may be evaluated against the requirements.

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION ANNOUNCEMENT AND NO CONTRACT WILL BE AWARDED FROM THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. The purpose of this sources sought synopsis is for market research purposes to gain knowledge of potentially interested and qualified sources. No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement and/or any follow-up information requests. There is no solicitation available at this time. Information should focus on the capability to provide the technical support services defined below. Standard company brochures are not desired.<br />The United States Air Force seeks to procure contractor support to provide IT services to support approximately 200 users. The software used by the United States Air Force is significantly more sophisticated than typical office automation: including specialized operations research models, mathematical optimization, and other general tools associated with operations research. The computational heart of the organization is located in a SCIF with specialized analytic architectures that combine UNIX (Solaris, IRIX, and/or LINUX) with Windows in stand-alone networks. These architectures are selectively combined and modified in some instances to run on the Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNET) with AF Enterprise office automation applications. The architecture is further abstracted into another subset that runs on the Non-classified Internet Protocol Router Network (NIPRNET), which, while centrally managed under a separate contract by another organization, will require first-tier Client Support Technician (CST) troubleshooting and remediation support from this contract.<br />A draft Performance Work Statement (PWS) is available below. To evaluate the potential number of vendors capable of adequately performing under the United States Air Force PWS, a thorough review of capability statements will be conducted. Interested parties who believe they have the ability to provide the required services are invited to supply a capabilities statement of no more than twenty (20) pages. Capability statements must include: <br />1. Complete Business Name, including DUNS Number <br />2. Contact Information (Respondent's name and title, address, telephone, facsimile, e-mail) <br />3. Business Size and Classification (small, small-disadvantaged, SBA Certified 8(a), HUBZone, service-disabled, veteran-owned etc). <br />Capability statements must address technical competencies and management/personnel experience relative to the key task areas detailed in the draft PWS.<br />The Government anticipates award of a firm-fixed-price contract with a one-year base period and two one-year option periods. The Government intends to issue the solicitation in May 2012 after a pre-solicitation notice is published as required by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 5.2. The procurement strategy will be determined in part by the responses to this notice. <br />All interested parties believing they can provide the required services as defined in the United States Air Force PWS are invited to submit the above documentation. Responses should be e-mailed to Contract Specialist via the e-mail link below.
<p>ALL INFORMATION SHALL BE SUBMITTED NO LATER THAN 2:00 PM EDT WEDNESDAY, MARCH 23, 2012. No feedback or evaluations will be provided to concerns regarding the information submitted to Air Force District of Washington/PKS. Please direct any questions you may have regarding this notice in writing to Contract Specialist Martha Warren (Ctr).</p>

<DESC>PMS401 seeks information from industry entities about their capabilities and interest vis--vis the Common Acoustic Cabinet (CAC) to be procured under a small business set-aside, competitive contract.  The CAC will implement Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) products and non-developmental item(s) (NDI).

   The CAC consists of a series of COTS-based, reconfigurable, high-performance computing servers, high-speed switch technologies, and technologies that power various sonar sensors and monitor cabinet status.  Hardware is refreshed periodically to mitigate obsolescence issues and implement reliability availability and maintainability (RAM) improvements.  
The CAC performs in extreme, submarine-based, operational conditions such as MIL-S 901D (Grade B) shock, MIL-E-461F electromagnetic compatibility,  0oC to 50oC ambient air temperature with a Relative Humidity of 95%,  and MIL-STD-167 vibration environments.  The CAC requires operation for both spray and drip environments at angles up to 45 per MIL-STD-108E.

This advertisement serves to aid in determining market interest and capabilities for this prospective contract. Of the available strategies, FLCJAX is considering the viability of the following socio-economic approaches: Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) set-aside, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) set-aside, Section 8(a) suitability, and Total Small Business set-aside.
 The Contracting Officer must establish a reasonable expectation that offers would be obtained from two or more HUBZone, SDVOSB, or Small Business entities that are competitive in terms of market prices, quality, and delivery.  You are advised that the Government is seeking to define the applicability of the requirement with regard to the available socio-economic programs.

The project will involve constructing a rock bench, consisting of rockfill, at elevation 671 along approximately 750 feet of shoreline and into the water. The rock bench will be approximately 10 feet wide with 1V:1.5H side slopes. Because of the uneven shoreline, some areas will require placing the rock farther away from the bank.

<DESC>Headquarters (HQ) Air Education and Training Command (AETC), Contracting Squadron, Randolph Air Force Base (AFB), Texas 78150-4302, intends to amend solicitation FA3002-11-R-0017 for the Engine Regional Repair Center (ERRC). This action is anticipated to be Amendment 0005 and will adjust the Section B Contract Line Item Number (CLIN) structure for the base period and all option periods. The revised structure will establish a Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP) CLIN to provide all services related to the necessary management, supervision, training, tools, non-maintenance labor, administration, vehicle acquisition, and maintenance, office and custodial supplies, preparing/submitting requested information and other related activities, equipment, parts and personnel to perform jet engine maintenance and related services as set forth in the Performance Work Statement (PWS). Services provided under this CLIN will be based on an established workload. Additional CLINs will establish unit prices per engine for specific maintenance activities (i.e. PE, HPO and JEIM) above the established workload in the FFP CLIN. The unit prices on these additional CLINs will be based on &lsquo;hands-on' engine maintenance, exclusive of other than hands-on functions/activity. Lastly, there will be "Not to Exceed" CLIN's established to sustain consumables directly related to engine production and travel. Neither this notice nor the anticipated amendment reflects an attempt to establish or reopen an opportunity to submit competitive proposals. The Government intends to limit the response to the amended requirement to the offerors that originally submitted proposals in response to Solicitation number FA3002-11-R-0017.

<DESC>The Mission and Installation Contracting Command- White Sands Office, has a requirement for Test Engineering and Analysis Support Services (TEAS) at the White Sands Missile Range (WSMR), New Mexico. Therefore, White Sands Missile Range will be hosting a one (1) day only Industry Day for the follow-on Test Engineering and Analysis Support Services contract currently held by ATAMIR-WSMR LLC and invites you to attend.
<p>Location: WSMR Professional Development Center auditorium, Building 465, Dyer Street, White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico, 88002. Parking is available near the intersection of Dyer Street and Rock Island Avenue and also at Dyer Street and Picatinny Avenue.</p>
<p>Time: The event will begin at 08:00 AM. Attendees should plan on arriving to WSMR at least one and one half (1.5) hours prior to the event so you may process through security, obtain a visitor's pass and check-in at the event. Check-in at the event will begin at 7:30 AM MST. A tentative agenda is attached.</p>
<p>All questions will be held until the afternoon session. All questions and answers discussed at the Industry Day event will be published.</p>
<p>RSVP: Contractors electing to attend the Industry Day must RSVP to Mr. Peter L. Hopkins, Contracting Officer. There is a limit of two (2) representatives per contractor. No foreign nationals are permitted. The contractor must e-mail the completed attached RSVP form (see attached Microsoft Excel workbook) to peter.l.hopkins.civ@mail.mil by COB 4 April 2012. Due to security procedures, the persons attending the Industry Day must be listed on the RSVP form.</p>
<p>Las Cruces, NM is the closest city to WSMR, NM. The closest WSMR access gate is located off of US Highway 70. El Paso International Airport, El Paso, TX is the closest regional airport. Contractors are solely responsible for all expenses associated with their attendance at the Industry Day. Please visit the WSMR website, http://www.wsmr.army.mil/Pages/Home.aspx, for more information about WSMR. The "WSMR at a Glance 2011" and the WSMR Fact-book" are also attached for your basic information. Maps of WSMR are available at:<br />http://www.wsmr.army.mil/testcenter/Pages/WhereWeAre.aspx.</p>
<p>Occasionally, WSMR will block roads (including US Highway 70) in the area for missile testing. Please call the Road Block phone number, 575-678-1178, for recorded updates on planned roadblocks. The information is usually updated each weekday in the afternoon for the following day. Since the actual firing schedule can slide due to any number of circumstances like weather or equipment problems, travelers should also check the recording right before leaving to ensure nothing has changed.</p>
<p>Installation Access: All visitors must bring photo identification. To obtain a vehicle security pass you must have a driver's license, vehicle registration and proof of insurance. All visitors must enter WSMR through the Las Cruces main gate (located off of US Highway 70). Visitors must stop at the WSMR Reception Center to obtain their visitor's pass.</p>
<p>Safety: As a tri-service Department of Defense Range, White Sands has tested nearly every type of deployable ordnance developed in the United States since 1945. Quite a number of these munitions were deliberately designed to blend in with the terrain, and their presence may not be immediately obvious to the casual observer. Consequently, even though WSMR performs extensive Range Clearance activities, there is no assurance that any area of the Range is truly 100% free of unexploded ordnance. More information concerning unexploded ordnance hazards can be viewed at http://www.wsmr.army.mil/ux/Pages/default.aspx. The contractors are responsible to view the video found at this link under the title, UXO Hazards Video. You will be asked to sign a form, acknowledging that you have viewed this video at the check-in event. No person will be allowed to tour the range without first viewing this video.</p>
<p>Photography &amp; Video Ban: No photographs or videos are allowed on WSMR except in the WSMR museum missile park area.</p>
<p>A DRAFT Performance Work Statement (PWS) without the Technical Exhibits has been provided for industry review and is subject to change prior to its official release. This Request for Information (RFI) is for market research and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the Government. The purpose of this notice is to identify potential sources that may be interested in and capable of performing the work described within the attached DRAFT PWS. Please note that the Technical Exhibits will not be provided at this time.</p>
<p>Information sought:</p>

<p>4. Please identify a suitable phase-in period.</p>
<p>5. Please identify any potential organizational conflicts of interest.</p>

<DESC>This notice DOES NOT constitute a request for information, quote, or proposal for procurement of products or services.  It concerns an action which may affect the current procurement of the products listed in this Notice by the Federal Government. <br /> <br />The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled is an independent agency of the Federal Government.  The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, provides employment opportunities for persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals.  Those products which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the AbilityOne Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (PL).  You can view the PL on our website at www.abilityone.gov.  Once a product is added to the PL to be provided by a nonprofit agency, no other product determined to be essentially the same can be sold to the Federal government.  However, the new SKILCRAFT branded product can be bid and sold to the Government by any authorized dealer.
<p>The Committee has been asked to consider adding the Total Government Requirement for the following product to the PL:</p>

<p>NSN:		7510-00-NIB-9836<br />Similar Items:	SAU 00561; DEX1517-J85</p>
<p>In order for the Committee to be able to assess the potential impact on affected companies, it is important that these firms report the following information to the Committee:</p>
<p>1) Total Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period.  When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations.  If your company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporation to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporation's total revenue data.</p>
<p>2) Revenues accrued by providing the products listed in this Notice to the federal government for the same most recent 12-month period</p>
<p>3) The length of time the potentially affected firm has been providing these products to the federal government.</p>
<p>The information prescribed above must reach the Committee no later than April 2, 2012 and can be submitted in letter format.  If information is not received by the date requested, the Committee could conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed products be added to the PL.</p>
<p>It is only with this information that the Committee can perform an accurate impact analysis.  Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to&nbsp;(703) 603-0655.  You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate.  If any of the information you provide is proprietary, please advise us in your reply, and we will ensure that it is safeguarded from disclosure.</p>

License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basisand may include specific fields of use. THE TECHNOLOGY: NASA Langley Research Center has developed a novel probe for eddy current sensorapplications that improves detection depth and measurement resolution. Although the useof anisotropic magnetoresistive (AMR) sensors in eddy current probes to improvesensitivity at low frequencies and increase the detection depth is known, thehigh-frequency sensitivity and small size of these sensors is less explored. This newprobe incorporates two induction sources (i.e., one high frequency and one low frequency)and an AMR sensor; the result is improved resolution in near surface materialcharacterization, combined with simultaneous deep-flaw detection. Addition of a secondhigh-frequency induction source, oriented to produce a magnetic field orthogonal to thefirst, allows for near surface anomaly detection in two dimensions.To express interest in this opportunity, please respond to Sean Sullivan, ResearchTriangle International (RTI),  at: NASA Langley Research Center, Strategic RelationshipsOffice (SRSO),	17 West Taylor St., Mail Stop 218, Building 1212, Room 110 Hampton,Virginia, E-mail: Sean.D.Sullivan@NASA.gov,  or phone: 757-864-5055.

<p>(h) Multiple awards. This award shall be made on an all or none basis.<br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-1)</p>
<p>(ix) Provision 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition along with the following addenda to the provision.<br />52.212-2 Addendum:<br />Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection in which competing Offerors' past performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. Award will be made to the responsible Offeror proposing the combination most advantageous to the Government based upon an integrated assessment of the evaluation factors described below. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) FACTOR 1 -- TECHNICAL. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made by the Contracting Officer. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following technical subfactors:<br /><br />Subfactor 1 - Provider Capability <br />This factor is met when the Offeror provides evidence they are a telecommunications company having the capability to provide Basic Rate Interfaces (BRI), Commercial Subscriber Lines (CSL), and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p><br />(b) FACTOR 2 -- PRICE. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) FACTOR 3 -- PAST PERFORMANCE. In evaluating PPI, the government will employ several approaches including: reviewing contract references provided by the offeror; seeking PPI through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. Only recent (within the last three years) and relevant PPI (similar or greater in scope, magnitude of effort, and complexity than effort described in this solicitation) will be evaluated. When reviewing PPI, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform the services described in this solicitation. The performance confidence assessment will result in an overall performance confidence rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower. If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer. <br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-2)</p>
<p>(x) Complete all representations and certifications electronically at the following website: http://orca.bpn.gov/publicsearch.aspx. If not completed on-line, Offerors must include a completed copy of the provisions at FAR 52.212-3, which can be obtained at http://farsite.hill.af.mil, FAR Part 52 or online at http://orca.bpn.gov. In addition, complete the following Addendum I to 52.212-3:<br /><br />52.212-3 Addendum, Certification to Accept the Government Purchase Card (GPC).

Multiple offers may not be considered if they alter the Government's requirement. Should the Offeror claim exceptions to any requirement in the solicitation, these exceptions shall be listed and rationale provided.

<p>(h) Multiple awards. This award shall be made on an all or none basis.<br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-1)</p>
<p>(ix) Provision 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition along with the following addenda to the provision.<br />52.212-2 Addendum:<br />Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection in which competing Offerors' past performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. Award will be made to the responsible Offeror proposing the combination most advantageous to the Government based upon an integrated assessment of the evaluation factors described below. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) FACTOR 1 -- TECHNICAL. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made by the Contracting Officer. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following technical subfactors:<br /><br /><br />1b. This factor is met when the Offeror provides evidence they are a telecommunications company having the capability to provide Basic Rate Interfaces (BRI), Commercial Subscriber Lines (CSL), and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>(b) FACTOR 2 -- PRICE. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) FACTOR 3 -- PAST PERFORMANCE. In evaluating PPI, the government will employ several approaches including: reviewing contract references provided by the offeror; seeking PPI through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. Only recent (within the last three years) and relevant PPI (similar or greater in scope, magnitude of effort, and complexity than effort described in this solicitation) will be evaluated. When reviewing PPI, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform the services described in this solicitation. The performance confidence assessment will result in an overall performance confidence rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower. If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer. <br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-2)</p>
<p>(x) Complete all representations and certifications electronically at the following website: http://orca.bpn.gov/publicsearch.aspx.

<p>(End of Clause)</p>
<p>I.2.2 Non-Disclosure Agreement for Contractor and Contractor Employees (Mar 2006)</p>
<p>(a) The contractor shall prepare and submit a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) to the Contracting Officer prior to access of government information or the commencement of work at CDC.</p>
<p>(b) The NDA made part of this clause, exhibit I and II , is required in service contracts where positions and/or functions proposed to be filled by contractor's employees will have access to non-public and procurement-sensitive information. The NDA also requires contractor's employees properly identify themselves as employees of a contractor when communicating or interacting with CDC employees, employees of other governmental entities (when communication or interaction relates to the contractor's work with the CDC), and members of the public. The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 37.114 (c), states "All contractor personnel attending meetings, answering Government telephones, and working in other situations where their contractor status is not obvious to third parties are required to identify themselves as such to avoid creating an impression in the minds of members of the public or Congress that they are Government officials, unless, in the judgment of the agency, no harm can come from failing to identify themselves. They must also ensure that all documents or reports produced by contractors are suitably marked as contractor products or that contractor participation is appropriately disclosed."</p>
<p>(c) The Contractor shall inform employees of the identification requirements by which they must abide and monitor employee compliance with the identification requirements.</p>
<p>(d) During the contract performance period, the Contractor is responsible to ensure that all additional or replacement contractors' employees sign a NDA and it is submitted to the Contracting Officer prior to commencement of their work with the CDC.</p>
<p>(e) Contractor employees in designated positions or functions that have not signed the appropriate NDA shall not have access to any non-public, procurement sensitive information or participate in government meeting where sensitive information may be discussed.</p>
<p>(f) The Contractor shall prepare and maintain a current list of employees working under NDAs and submit to the Contracting Officer upon request during the contract period of performance. The list should at a minimum include: contract number, employee's name, position, date of hire and NDA requirement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>EXHIBIT I<br />Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) <br />Contractor Non-Disclosure Agreement<br />I. Non-public Information<br /><br />[Name of contractor] understands that in order to fulfill the responsibilities pursuant to [Contract name and number] between the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and [Name of CDC contractor] dated [date], employees of [contractor] will have access to non-public information, including confidential and privileged information contained in government-owned information technology systems. For purposes of this agreement, confidential information means government information that is not or will not be generally available to the public. Privileged information means information which cannot be disclosed without the prior written consent of the CDC. <br /><br />In order to properly safeguard non-public information, [contractor] agrees to ensure that prior to being granted access to government information or the commencement of work for the CDC, whichever is applicable, all employees will sign a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) provided by the CDC prior to beginning work for the CDC. Contractor agrees to submit to the contracting official the original signed copies of NDAs signed by the contractor's employees in accordance with the instructions provided by the contracting official. Failure to provide signed NDAs in accordance with this agreement and instructions provided by the contracting official could delay or prevent the employee from commencing or continuing work at the CDC until such agreement is signed and returned to the contracting official. <br /><br />Contractor further agrees that it will not cause or encourage any employee to disclose, publish, divulge, release, or make known in any manner or to any extent, to any individual other than an authorized Government employee any non-public information that the employee may obtain in connection with the performance of the employee's responsibilities to the CDC. <br /><br />II. Procurement-Sensitive Information<br /><br />Contractor further agrees that it will not cause or encourage any employee to disclose, publish, divulge, release, or make known in any manner or to any extent, to any individual, other than an authorized Government employee, any procurement-sensitive information gained while in connection with fulfilling the employee's responsibilities at the CDC. For purposes of this agreement, procurement-sensitive information includes, but is not limited to, all information in Statements of Work (SOW), Requests for Contract (RFC), and Requests for Proposal (RFP); Responses to RFPs, including questions from potential offerors; non-public information regarding procurements; all documents, conversations, discussions, data, correspondence, electronic mail (e-mail), presentations, or any other written or verbal communications relating to, concerning, or affecting proposed or pending solicitations or awards; procurement data; contract information plans; strategies; source selection information and documentation; offerors' identities; technical and cost data; the identity of government personal involved in the solicitation; the schedule of key technical and procurement events in the award determination process; and any other information that may provide an unfair competitive advantage to a contractor or potential contractor if improperly disclosed to them, or any of their employees. <br /><br />Contractor understands and agrees that employee access to any procurement-sensitive information may create a conflict of interest which will preclude contractor from becoming a competitor for any acquisition(s) resulting from this information. Therefore, if an employee participates in any discussions relating to procurement-sensitive information, assists in developing any procurement-sensitive information, or otherwise obtains any procurement-sensitive information during the course of performing duties at the CDC, contractor understands and agrees that contractor are be excluded from competing for any acquisition(s) resulting from this information.</p>

<p>EXHIBIT II</p>
<p>Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) <br />Contractors' Employee Non-Disclosure Agreement<br /><br />I. Non-Public Information<br /><br />I understand that in order to fulfill my responsibilities as an employee of [Name of CDC contractor], I will have access to non-public information, including confidential and privileged information contained in government-owned information technology systems. For purposes of this agreement, confidential information means government information that is not or will not be generally available to the public. Privileged information means information which cannot be disclosed without the prior written consent of the CDC. <br /><br />I [Name of Employee], agree to use non-public information only in performance of my responsibilities to the CDC. I agree further that I will not disclose, publish, divulge, release, or make known in any manner or to any extent, to any individual other than an authorized Government employee, any non-public information that I may obtain in connection with the performance of my responsibilities to the CDC. <br /><br />II. Procurement-Sensitive Information<br /><br />I further agree that unless I have prior written permission from the CDC, I will not disclose, publish, divulge, release, or make known in any manner or to any extent, to any individual other than an authorized Government employee, any procurement-sensitive information gained in connection with the performance of my responsibilities to the CDC. I specifically agree not to disclose any non-public, procurement-sensitive information to employees of my company or any other organization unless so authorized in writing by the CDC. For purposes of this agreement, procurement-sensitive information includes, but is not limited to, all information in Statements of Work (SOW), Requests for Contract (RFC), and Requests for Proposal (RFP); Responses to RFPs, including questions from potential offerors; non-public information regarding procurements; all documents, conversations, discussions, data, correspondence, electronic mail (e-mail), presentations, or any other written or verbal communications relating to, concerning, or affecting proposed or pending solicitations or awards; procurement data; contract information plans; strategies; source selection information and documentation; offerors' identities; technical and cost data; the identity of government personal involved in the acquisition; the schedule of key technical and procurement events in the award determination process; and any other information that may provide an unfair competitive advantage to a contractor or potential contractor if improperly disclosed to them, or any of their employees.<br /><br />I understand and agree that my access to any procurement-sensitive information may create a conflict of interest which will preclude me, my current employer, or a future employer from becoming a competitor for any resulting government acquisition derived from this information. Therefore, if I participate in any discussions relating to procurement-sensitive information, assist in developing any procurement-sensitive information, or otherwise obtain any procurement-sensitive information during the course of performing my duties at the CDC, I understand and agree that I, my current employer, and any future employer(s) are excluded from competing for any resulting acquisitions.</p>
<p><br />III. Special Non-Disclosure Clause for Contractors with Access to CDC Grants Management and Procurement-Related Information Technology Systems<br /><br />In addition to complying with the non-disclosure requirements and safeguards stated above, I understand that my authorization to use CDC's grants management and procurement systems is strictly limited to the access and functions necessary for the performance of my responsibilities to the CDC and which have been approved in advance by the CDC. I understand that I am not authorized to enter procurement requests for any requirements pertaining to contracts or subcontracts held by me or my employer. <br /><br />IV. Identification as a Non-Government Employee<br /><br />I understand that as an employee of a government contractor, I represent an independent organization and I am not an agent of the Government. Therefore, I agree that unless I have prior written authorization from the CDC, I will, at the beginning of interactions with CDC employees, employees of other governmental entities, members of the public, or the media (when such communication or interaction relates to the contractor's work with the CDC), identify myself as an employee of a contractor. I further agree to use the following identification procedures in connection with my work at the CDC:<br /><br />A.

<p>FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors - Commercial.</p>
<p>Addendum to FAR 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors - Commercial. The following sections from the clause at FAR 52.212-1 are tailored as follows; all non-tailored instructions remain the same:<br />(c) Period for acceptance of offers. The offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm for 120 calendar days from the date specified for receipt of offers.<br />(d) Product samples. Not Applicable<br />(e) Multiple offers. Not Applicable.<br />(h) Multiple awards. Not Applicable.</p>
<p><br />(ix) FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation -- Commercial Items Evaluation. The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers in the following relative order of importance: 1.Technical Acceptability. 2. Price. The Government will evaluate the total price of the offer for the award purposes.</p>
<p>Initially offers shall be ranked according to price.</p>
<p>Technical Acceptability and Price, when combined, are EQUAL. However, quotes which are not rated as Technically Acceptable will be eliminated from the competition and receive no further consideration.</p>
<p>(1) If the lowest priced evaluated offer is judged to have "Technical Acceptability" assessment, award shall be made to that offeror without further consideration of any other offers. If the lowest priced offeror is not judged to have "Technical Acceptability," the next lowest priced offeror will be evaluated and the process will continue (in order by price) until an offeror is judged to have "Technical Acceptability." An award, pending availability of funds, will be made to the lowest priced, technically acceptable, responsible offeror who responds to all items included in the solicitation (all or none) and complies with the terms of the Request for Proposal (RFP).<br />(2) These are the technical areas that we will evaluate to determine the technical acceptability:<br />a. Reasonableness of proposed schedule. The Air Force estimates a period of performance of 70 days from Notice to Proceed.<br />b. Company's three year history of similar projects, including whether any Notices of Violation were received. Receipt of any Notice of Violations will not alone disqualify quotes.<br />(3) The offers will be evaluated by key government personnel, rating the aforementioned technical areas on a pass or fail basis. Any offer receiving a "fail" rating on any of the technical areas will be ineligible and not considered for contract award.</p>
<p>(x) All offerors shall include a completed copy of FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications -- Commercial Items or complete electronic annual representations and certifications at http://orca.bpn.gov.</p>

<DESC><strong>The Defense Medical Materiel Program Office (DMMPO) announces a Request for Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFIAQ) for the standardization of Pad Antiseptic Skin Prep Alcohol Sterile. The Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) West is the lead MMESO for this project.</strong>
<p>The primary objective of this effort is to standardize the quality of care across the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) and operational assemblages based on the critical balance of clinical efficacy and value. The intent for this initiative is the standardization of a clinically preferred product(s) and source for institutional and operational medicine requirements at the best price for each MMESO Area of Responsibility (AOR). It is also intended for this initiative to result in the reduction of Stock Keeping Units (SKUs) and National Stock Numbers (NSN). Standardized products must be obtained through the Department of Defense (DoD) Prime Vendor (PV) Program. As an enterprise-wide clinically driven program, vendors and products must meet specific technical requirements plus products must meet or exceed specific clinical performance expectations as a primary consideration. Among vendors who meet the technical requirements and the products that meet or exceed the clinical acceptability, then clinically preferred, best value will determine selection for each MMESO AOR. It is intended that the selected standardized vendor(s) for this Standardization Action (SA) support the enterprise goal of medical materiel standardization that combines operational and institutional requirements. Vendor is not required to quote for each MMESO AOR. <strong>The Government will make a single selection for each of the following MMESO AORs:</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. MMESO North</strong></p>
<p><strong>2. MMESO South</strong></p>
<p><strong>3. MMESO West</strong></p>
<p><strong>4. MMESO Pacific</strong></p>
<p><strong>5. MMESO Europe</strong></p>
<p>The major facilities in the MMESOs North, South, West, Pacific and Europe (hereafter referred to as MMESOs) include but are not limited to MMESO North: Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, Naval Medical Center Portsmouth, Wright-Patterson Medical Center; MMESO South: Wilford Hall Ambulatory Surgical Center, Brooke Army Medical Center, Eisenhower Army Medical Center, Darnall Army Medical Center, Keesler Medical Center, Naval Hospital Jacksonville, Martin Army Community Hospital, Fort Benning, GA; MMESO West: Madigan Army Medical Center, William Beaumont Army Medical Center, Naval Medical Center San Diego, Irwin Army Community Hospital, Mike O'Callaghan Federal Hospital; MMESO Pacific: Tripler Army Medical Center, 18th Medical Group, Kadena AB, Okinawa, US Naval Hospital, Yokosuka, Japan; MMESO Europe: Landstuhl Regional Medical Center, Landstuhl, GE, US Naval Hospital, Naples, Italy, and 48th Medical Group, RAF Lakenheath; and Operational U.S. Forces. This SA is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support, Directorate of Medical Materiel. To participate in this SA your company must have or be in the process of obtaining a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the current Med-Surg PV for each MMESO AOR for which a quote is submitted, i.e., Cardinal Health, and Owens &amp; Minor. This requirement is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the standardization initiative and agree to allow PVs to distribute their products. The IA resulting from this RFIAQ is a supplement to the PV Program and is not a contract. For additional information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program please access its web site at https://www.medical.dla.mil/.<br />This IA standardization initiative will be a Three Phase IPP Process: vendor(s) who meets the technical / company requirements in Phase I will be invited to participate in Phase II where no-charge products will be provided for clinical evaluation and Phase III where pricing will be required for submittal. Phase II and Phase III will be run concurrently. The resulting IA will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of selection with three (3) 12-month "option" periods not to exceed a total of 5 years. <strong>Anticipated selection date is August 2012.</strong> The selection will be based on the product and vendor that provides the Best Value to the enterprise. Products and vendors that meet or exceed the technical and clinical performance requirements will be considered clinically preferred products and sources. <strong>Among vendors who meet the technical requirements and the products that meet or exceed the clinically preferred standard, best price (i.e. lowest Aggregate Post Standardization Cost) will determine selection for each MMESO AOR. <br /><br />Points of Contact: Ricardo Orias, MMESO West Team Leader, ricardo.orias.ctr@med.navy.mil, (619)532-8537; Cheryl Janus, MMESO West Clinical Analyst, cheryl.janus.ctr@med.navy.mil, (619) 532-7554.</strong></p>
<p>B. Products &amp; Performance Required <br />The MMESOs are seeking product line items in the category of Pad Antiseptic Skin Prep Alcohol Sterile. Within the MMESOs, this product line has an estimated annual dollar requirement of $520,342. This forecast is based on historical usage data during a recent 12-month period. Based on usage data, thirteen (13) lines items of the total twenty nine (29) line items represent the two (2) products and account for 84.24% ($438,377) of the total volume in sales ($520,342) in the MMESOs and are clinically significant. Estimated annual demand per Area of Responsibility is approximately MMESO North $103,667, MMESO South $156,267, MMESO West $118,393, MMESO Europe $102,238, MMESO Pacific $39,777. The top high volume usage lines for this project are shown in the Technical/Company Requirements below.</p>
<p>C. Instructions to Vendors<br /><strong>Vendors interested in participating in this standardization initiative will provide an initial response to the FBO-posted RFIAQ to Ricardo Orias, MMESO West Team Leader, ricardo.orias.ctr@med.navy.mil; and Ms. Cheryl Janus, Clinical Analyst, cheryl.janus.ctr@med.navy.mil.</strong> The vendor's initial responses will include detailed information requested in the technical/company requirements listed in the FBO RFIAQ and must also include: (1) Company name and address; (2) Company Point of Contact (POC) (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address); and (3) Identification of the RFIAQ to which the vendor is responding. Due to the potential for email to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the MMESO West that their initial submissions, quote and literature arrived at the MMESO West via email. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date / time, should a problem occur with the first submission. Vendor should complete and submit the attached document. A vendor, who cannot open the attachments, may contact the POC as noted in the FBO RFIAQ and a copy will be provided via an alternate method (fax, email or hard copy). <strong>Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00 PM Pacific Standard Time (PST) on the date listed for closing will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization initiative. </strong></p>
<p>D. Source Selection Procedures <br />The MMESO Joint Product Review Board (JPRB) will serve as the forum for clinical recommendations for product selection, seeking and evaluating opportunities for committed volume purchase agreements, and coordinating logistics efforts in support of DoD Components. The boards are chaired by Designated Senior Logisticians (DSLs) and co-chaired by Designated Senior Clinicians (DSCs) in the MMESO AORs and include clinicians and logisticians for MTFs within each MMESO. The Clinical Advisory Committee (CAC) members are the deciding officials for this initiative. <strong>Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing for each MMESO AOR for which a quote is submitted based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in that MMESO AOR.</strong> The MMESO West reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if determined necessary</p>
<p>Phase I Technical/Company Evaluation<br />The MMESO CPT will review the responses from the vendors and determine which vendors meet the technical/company requirements. A vendor must meet the technical requirements for continued consideration in this initiative. Failure to provide any requested information or meet any of the technical requirements will disqualify the vendor from further consideration. A vendor who meets the following technical/company requirements will be qualified and invited to participate in the clinical/performance selection process and will be requested to submit products for testing and their best price discount quotes via an e-mail communication. All communications of significant acquisition milestones (such as invitations to participate or notices of disqualification) should be digitally signed.</p>
<p>Technical/Company Requirements<br />During the pre-source selection procedures, the CPT approved the technical/company requirements outlined below. The six (6) requirements below must be answered with the vendor's initial submittal and required documents by the response date stated in the FBO announcement. <strong>A vendor who does not meet these requirements or who does not submit documentation to support these requirements with initial submittal will be disqualified in Phase I.<br /></strong>1. Vendor must provide a complete line of Pad Antiseptic Skin Prep Alcohol Sterile products.<br />a.

Vendor must be able to deliver product literature, training materials and evaluation samples as requested to the MMESO Pacific via FedEx or UPS AND to the MMESO Europe via United States Postal Service (USPS) Express Mail AND throughout the United States by selected shipping method when requested in Phase II. Vendor must send the MMESO West verification regarding the shipment of literature and samples. This information will include the date of shipment, final delivery date, tracking numbers and the carrier used by the vendor.</strong> Vendor will provide only the following no cost product samples for clinical/performance evaluation. Unused samples will not be returned. One (1) pack of at least 50 each of the type and size listed below is to be provided as samples to each of the evaluation sites as identified in the letters of invitation.</p>
<p>PAD ANTISEPTIC SKIN PREP ALCOHOL MED STERILE, 2-PLY</p>
<p>Each evaluator will evaluate each product sample from each vendor against the established requirements. A trial will consist of evaluating sample products from a single vendor, evaluated against the requirements and recorded on a single evaluation form per vendor. Each evaluator will evaluate or trial each participating vendor's product line. The clinical/performance acceptability evaluation period will last for fourteen (14) calendar days. The acceptability evaluation responses will be in a Likert scale format with a one (1) through five (5) scoring range. The scale descriptors are: one (1) Completely Unacceptable, two (2) Overwhelmingly Unacceptable, three (3) Partially Unacceptable, four (4) Acceptable, and five (5) Highly Acceptable. The MMESO JPRB has established a 4.0 as the Clinically Preferred threshold of products for standardization.</p>
<p>A vendor scoring below the clinically preferred threshold will be disqualified from selection for this standardization initiative. A vendor who has been disqualified will be notified in writing upon completion of the standardization selection. Of those vendors that are qualified as clinically preferred, selection will be based on best price. Clinical / performance acceptability evaluations by the participating CPT facilities will be tabulated resulting in one score per participating MMESO per vendor. The participating MMESOs' scores by vendor will then be combined resulting in one final vendor performance evaluation score. All clinical/performance acceptability evaluations will be tabulated by the MMESO West and results will be forwarded to the MMESO CPT for final review.</p>
<p>There will be approximately twenty (20) MTFs enterprise wide that will be evaluating products.</p>
<p>Clinical/Performance Requirements <br />During the acquisition planning process, the CPT approved the clinical/performance requirements outlined below. <br />1. Patient Safety/Infection Control - National Patient Safety Goal #7. The Alcohol Pad wrapper is intact and does not exhibit any holes/tears or rips in packaging. The Alcohol Pad wrapper must not exhibit any holes, rips or tears in the packaging integrity. This is to avoid contamination of the sterile items; maintenance of alcohol content to provide the optimum in disinfection; and to avoid waste that can increase costs. <br />2. Patient Safety/Comfort/Infection Control - National Patient Safety Goal #7. The Alcohol Pad will not lint or leave any fabric residue when applying the alcohol. The Alcohol Pad should remain intact and not leave any debris on the skin surface. Lint fragments from the pad can dry, become abrasive and contribute to an inflammatory response on the skin.<br />3. Patient Safety/Infection Control - National Patient Safety Goal #7. The Alcohol Pad is durable and does not fray, maintains its shape and construction. An Alcohol Pad which does not retain durability and frays will not provide an even distribution of isopropyl alcohol or the required disinfection. <br />4. Patient Safety/Efficiency of Usage - National Patient Safety Goal #7. The Alcohol Pad will be impregnated with a sufficient amount of liquid which allows for the performance of the disinfection required. An Alcohol Pad which is overly saturated can drip and run over the site being disinfected. An overly saturated amount of isopropyl alcohol can dry the patient's skin. An Alcohol Pad which is dry does not supply the required antiseptic liquid.</p>
<p>Phase III Pricing Analysis<br />Upon completion of the Phase I - Technical/Company Requirements, a vendor who is found technically acceptable will be qualified / invited to provide product samples and price discount quotes concurrently. A vendor will be given 30 calendar days from the date of pricing requests to submit IA pricing quotes in a prescribed electronic spreadsheet format, based upon the requirements of the MMESOs. <strong>Pricing will be submitted to MMESO West and must be received by 5:00 PM PST, thirty (30) calendar days after the issue date of the vendor notice to submit best price quotes.</strong> Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the specific products requested in this announcement. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the specific products requested in this announcement. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing for the products identified in this announcement. Pricing should be provided for each MMESO AOR for which a quote is submitted based on a committed volume of 80% of the total volume in sales of the MTFs in that MMESO AOR. Vendor quotes will contain separate pricing for each MMESO AOR(s) for which a quote is submitted based on Technical / Company Requirements above. Vendor is not required to provide a quote for each MMESO AOR. Price will be analyzed based on the projected Aggregate Post-Standardization costs for each vendor. Aggregate Post-Standardization Cost will be calculated for each vendor by applying the vendor's offered prices to the anticipated annual usage of the enterprise. Unmatched items will be represented in the Post-Standardization Cost at a baseline non-discounted price (current DAPA price of product with highest procurement). <strong>Among the products and sources that are determined to be clinically preferred, the best price Aggregate Post-Standardization Cost will be selected for each MMESO AOR.</strong> The selected Vendor of Choice will have an opportunity to provide other items beyond the minimum required product line that you would like to be considered for addition to the Incentive Agreement with a discount from DAPA. All additions will be at the discretion of the Government.</p>

<DESC><strong>The Defense Medical Materiel Program Office (DMMPO) announces a Request for Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFIAQ) for the standardization of Rehabilitation Knee Braces. The Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) Pacific is the lead MMESO for this project.<br /><br /></strong>The primary objective of this effort is to standardize the quality of care across the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) and operational assemblages based on the critical balance of clinical efficacy and value. The intent for this initiative is the standardization of a clinically preferred product(s) and source for institutional and operational medicine requirements at the lowest price. It is also intended for this initiative to result in the reduction of Stock Keeping Units (SKUs) and National Stock Numbers (NSN). Standardized products must be obtained through the Department of Defense (DoD) Prime Vendor (PV) Program. As an enterprise-wide clinically driven program, vendors and products must meet specific technical requirements plus products must meet or exceed specific clinical performance expectations as a primary consideration. Among vendors who meet the technical requirements and the products that meet or exceed the clinical acceptability, then clinically preferred, best value will determine selection. It is intended that the selected standardized vendor(s) for this Standardization Action (SA) support the enterprise goal of medical materiel standardization that combines operational and institutional requirements. <strong>The government is seeking a single vendor selection for this SA.<br /><br /></strong>The major facilities in the MMESOs North, South, West, Pacific and Europe (hereafter referred to as MMESOs) include but are not limited to MMESO North: Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, Portsmouth Naval Hospital, Womack Army Medical Center, Wright-Patterson Medical Center; MMESO South: Wilford Hall Ambulatory Surgical Center, Brooke Army Medical Center, Eisenhower Army Medical Center, Darnall Army Medical Center, Keesler Medical Center, Naval Hospital Jacksonville, Martin Army Community Hospital, Fort Benning, GA; MMESO West: Madigan Army Medical Center, William Beaumont Army Medical Center, Naval Medical Center San Diego, Irwin Army Community Hospital, Mike O'Callaghan Federal Hospital; MMESO Pacific: Tripler Army Medical Center, 18th Medical Group, Kadena AB, Okinawa, US Naval Hospital, Yokosuka, Japan; MMESO Europe: Landstuhl Regional Medical Center, Landstuhl, GE, US Naval Hospital, Naples, Italy, and 48th Medical Group, RAF Lakenheath; and Operational U.S. Forces. This SA is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support, Directorate of Medical Materiel. To participate in this SA your company must have, or be in the process of obtaining, a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the current Med-Surg PV for each MMESO Region, i.e., Cardinal Health, and Owens &amp; Minor. This requirement is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the standardization initiative and agree to allow PVs to distribute their products. The IA resulting from this RFIAQ is a supplement to the PV Program and is not a contract. For additional information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program please access its web site at https://www.medical.dla.mil/
<p>This IA standardization initiative will be a Three Phase IPP Process: vendor(s) who meets the technical / company requirements in Phase I will be invited to participate in Phase II where no-charge products will be provided for clinical evaluation and Phase III where pricing will be required for submittal. Phase II and Phase III will be run concurrently. The resulting IA will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of selection with three (3) 12-month "option" periods not to exceed a total of 5 years. <strong>Anticipated selection date is August 2012.</strong> The selection will be based on the product and vendor that provides the Best Value to the enterprise. Products and vendors that meet or exceed the technical and clinical performance requirements will be considered clinically preferred products and sources. <strong>Among vendors who meet the technical requirements and the products that meet or exceed the clinically preferred standard, best price (i.e. lowest Aggregate Post Standardization Cost) will determine selection. <br />Points of Contact: Mary Summers, MMESO Pacific, Team Leader, mary.summers1@us.army.mil 808-433-3686 or Cora Toledo, Clinical Analyst, corazon.m.toledo.ctr@us.army.mil. 808-433-2894.<br /><br /></strong>B. Products &amp; Performance Required. <br />The MMESOs are seeking product line items in the category of Rehabilitation Knee Braces. Within the MMESOs this product line has an estimated annual dollar requirement of $578,570.40. This forecast is based on historical usage data during a recent 12-month period. Based on usage data, forty four (44) of the total forty four (44) line items represent the top five (5) products categories and account for 100% ($578,570.40) of the total volume in sales $578,570.40 in the MMESOs and are clinically significant. The top high volume usage lines for this project are shown in the Technical/Company Requirements below.</p>
<p>C. Instructions to Vendors<br /><strong>Vendors interested in participating in this standardization initiative will provide an initial response to the FBO-posted RFIAQ to Mary Summers, MMESO Pacific, Team Leader, mary.summers1@us.army.mil or Cora Toledo, Clinical Analyst, corazon.m.toledo.ctr@us.army.mil.</strong> The vendor's initial responses will include detailed information requested in the technical/company requirements listed in the FBO RFIAQ and must also include: (1) Company name and address; (2) Company Point of Contact (POC) (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address); and (3) Identification of the RFIAQ to which the vendor is responding. Due to the potential for email to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the MMESO Pacific that their initial submissions, quote and literature arrived at the MMESO Pacific via email. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date / time, should a problem occur with the first submission. Vendor should complete and submit the attached document. A vendor who cannot open the attachments, may contact the POC as noted in the FBO RFIAQ and a copy will be provided via an alternate method (fax, email or hard copy). <strong>Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00 PM Hawaii Standard Time (HST) on the date listed for closing will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization initiative. </strong></p>
<p>D. Source Selection Procedures <br />The MMESO Joint Product Review Board (JPRB) will serve as the forum for clinical recommendations for product selection, seeking and evaluating opportunities for committed volume purchase agreements, and coordinating logistics efforts in support of DoD Components. The boards are chaired by Designated Senior Logisticians (DSLs) and co-chaired by Designated Senior Clinicians (DSCs) in the MMESO AORs and include clinicians and logisticians for MTFs within each MMESO. The Clinical Advisory Committee (CAC) members are the deciding officials for this initiative. <strong>Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the MMESOs.</strong> The MMESO Pacific reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if determined necessary. <br /><br />Phase I Technical/Company Evaluation<br />The MMESO CPT will review the responses from the vendors and determine which vendors meet the technical/company requirements. A vendor must meet the technical requirements for continued consideration in this initiative. Failure to provide any requested information or meet any of the technical requirements will disqualify the vendor from further consideration. A vendor who meets the following technical/company requirements will be qualified and invited to participate in the clinical/performance selection process and will be requested to submit products for testing and their best price discount quotes via an e-mail communication. All communications of significant acquisition milestones (such as invitations to participate or notices of disqualification) should be digitally signed.</p>
<p>Technical/Company Requirements <br />During the pre-source selection procedures, the CPT approved the company/technical requirements outlined below. The requirements below must be answered with the vendor's initial submittal and required documents by the response date stated in the FBO announcement. <strong>A vendor who does not meet these requirements or who does not submit documentation to support these requirements with initial submittal will be disqualified in Phase I. <br /></strong>1.

Patient Safety and Product Performance - NPSG 14 and NPSG 07 - The fabric material is breathable and wicks moisture to control temperature inside the brace. The product must have lightweight and breathable padding that will reduce moisture between the knee and device to control temperature inside the brace, making it comfortable to wear, preventing skin break down, and surgical site infection and/or potential pressure ulcers.<br />&nbsp;<br />Phase III Pricing Analysis<br />Upon completion of the Phase I - Technical/Company Requirements, a vendor who is found technically acceptable will be qualified / invited to provide product samples and price discount quotes concurrently. A vendor will be given 30 calendar days from the date of pricing requests to submit IA pricing quotes in a prescribed electronic spreadsheet format, based upon the requirements of the MMESOs. <strong>Pricing will be submitted to MMESO Pacific and must be received by 5:00 PM HST, thirty (30) calendar days after the issue date of the vendor notice to submit best price quotes.</strong> Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the specific products requested in this announcement. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing for the products identified in this announcement (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the MMESOs). Price will be analyzed based on the projected Aggregate Post-Standardization costs for each vendor. Aggregate Post-Standardization Cost will be calculated for each vendor by applying the vendor's offered prices to the anticipated annual usage of the enterprise. Unmatched items will be represented in the Post-Standardization Cost at a baseline non-discounted price (current DAPA price of product with highest procurement). <strong>Among the products and sources determined to be clinically preferred, the best price after calculating Aggregate Post-Standardization Cost will be selected.</strong> The selected Vendor of Choice will have an opportunity to provide other items beyond the minimum required product line that you would like to be considered for addition to the Incentive Agreement with a discount from DAPA. All additions will be at the discretion of the Government.</p>

<p>The primary objective of this effort is to standardize the quality of care across the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) and operational assemblages based on the critical balance of clinical efficacy and value. The intent for this initiative is the standardization of a clinically preferred product(s) and source for institutional and operational medicine requirements at the lowest price. It is also intended for this initiative to result in the reduction of Stock Keeping Units (SKUs) and National Stock Numbers (NSN). Standardized products must be obtained through the Department of Defense (DoD) Prime Vendor (PV) Program. As an enterprise-wide clinically driven program, vendors and products must meet specific technical requirements plus products must meet or exceed specific clinical performance expectations as a primary consideration. Among vendors who meet the technical requirements and the products that meet or exceed the clinical acceptability, then clinically preferred, best value will determine selection. It is intended that the selected standardized vendor(s) for this Standardization Action (SA) support the enterprise goal of medical materiel standardization that combines operational and institutional requirements. <strong>The government is seeking a single vendor selection for this SA.</strong></p>
<p>The major facilities in the MMESOs include but are not limited to MMESO North: Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, Naval Medical Center Portsmouth, Wright-Patterson Medical Center; MMESO South: Wilford Hall Ambulatory Surgical Center, Brooke Army Medical Center, Naval Hospital Jacksonville, Martin Army Community Hospital; MMESO West: Naval Medical Center San Diego, Madigan Army Medical Center, Irwin Army Community Hospital, Mike O'Callaghan Federal Hospital; MMESO Pacific: Tripler Army Medical Center, Honolulu, HI, 18th Medical Group, Kadena AB, Okinawa, US Naval Hospital, Yokosuka, Japan; MMESO Europe: Landstuhl Regional Medical Center, Landstuhl, GE, US Naval Hospital, Naples, Italy, the 48th Medical Group, Lakenheath, UK; and Operational U.S. Forces. This SA is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support, Directorate of Medical Materiel. To participate in this SA your company must have or be in the process of obtaining a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the current Med-Surg PV for each MMESO Area of Responsibility (AOR), i.e., Cardinal Health, and Owens &amp; Minor. This requirement is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the standardization initiative and agree to allow PVs to distribute their products. The IA resulting from this RFIAQ is a supplement to the PV Program and is not a contract. For additional information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program please access its web site at https://www.medical.dla.mil/</p>
<p>This IA standardization initiative will be a Three Phase IPP Process: vendor(s) who meets the technical / company requirements in Phase I will be invited to participate in Phase II where no-charge products will be provided for clinical evaluation and Phase III where pricing will be required for submittal. Phase II and Phase III will be run concurrently. The resulting IA will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of selection with three (3) 12-month "option" periods not to exceed a total of 5 years. <strong>Anticipated selection date is August 2012.</strong> The selection will be based on the product and vendor that provides the Best Value to the enterprise. Products and vendors that meet or exceed the technical and clinical performance requirements will be considered clinically preferred products and sources. <strong>Among vendors who meet the technical requirements and the products that meet or exceed the clinically preferred standard, best price (i.e. lowest Aggregate Post Standardization Cost) will determine selection. Points of Contact: Mary Summers, MMESO Pacific, Team Leader, mary.summers1@us.army.mil and Wendy Sprouse, Clinical Analyst, wendy.a.sprouse.ctr@us.army.mil.</strong></p>
<p>B. Products &amp; Performance Required. <br />The MMESOs are seeking product line items in the category of Cohesive Bandages. Within the MMESOs this product line has an estimated annual dollar requirement of $1,420,436.10. This forecast is based on historical usage data during a recent 12-month period. Based on usage data, eight (8) major product categories of the total one hundred thirty-seven (137) line items represent the top products and account for 100% of the total volume in sales $1,420,436.10 in the MMESOs and are clinically significant. The top high volume usage lines for this project are shown in the Technical/Company Requirements below.</p>
<p>C. Instructions to Vendors<br /><strong>Vendors interested in participating in this standardization initiative will provide an initial response to the FBO-posted RFIAQ to Mary Summers, MMESO Pacific, Team Leader, mary.summers1@us.army.mil and Wendy Sprouse, Clinical Analyst, wendy.a.sprouse.ctr@us.army.mil.</strong> The vendor's initial responses will include detailed information requested in the technical/company requirements listed in the FBO RFIAQ and must also include: (1) Company name and address; (2) Company Point of Contact (POC) (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address); and (3) Identification of the RFIAQ to which the vendor is responding. Due to the potential for email to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the MMESO Pacific that their initial submissions, quote and literature arrived at the MMESO Pacific via email. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date / time, should a problem occur with the first submission. Vendor should complete and submit the attached document. A vendor who cannot open the attachments, may contact the POC as noted in the FBO RFIAQ and a copy will be provided via an alternate method (fax, email or hard copy). <strong>Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00PM Hawaii Standard Time (HST) on the date listed for closing will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization initiative. </strong></p>
<p>D. Source Selection Procedures <br />The MMESO Joint Product Review Board (JPRB) will serve as the forum for clinical recommendations for product selection, seeking and evaluating opportunities for committed volume purchase agreements, and coordinating logistics efforts in support of DoD Components. The boards are chaired by Designated Senior Logisticians (DSLs) and co-chaired by Designated Senior Clinicians (DSCs) in the MMESO AORs and include clinicians and logisticians for MTFs within each MMESO. The Clinical Advisory Committee (CAC) members are the deciding officials for this initiative. <strong>Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the MMESOs.</strong> The MMESO Pacific reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if determined necessary.</p>
<p>Phase I Technical/Company Evaluation<br />The MMESO CPT will review the responses from the vendors and determine which vendors meet the technical/company requirements. A vendor must meet the technical requirements for continued consideration in this initiative. Failure to provide any requested information or meet any of the technical requirements will disqualify the vendor from further consideration. A vendor who meets the following technical/company requirements will be qualified and invited to participate in the clinical/performance selection process and will be requested to submit products for testing and their best price discount quotes via an e-mail communication. All communications of significant acquisition milestones (such as invitations to participate or notices of disqualification) should be digitally signed.</p>
<p>Technical/Company Requirements <br />During the pre-source selection procedures, the CPT approved the technical/company requirements outlined below. The requirements below must be answered with the vendor's initial submittal and required documents by the response date stated in the FBO announcement.<strong> A vendor who does not meet these requirements or who does not submit documentation to support these requirements with initial submittal will be disqualified in Phase I. </strong></p>
<p>1. Vendor must provide a complete line of disposable Cohesive Bandages products. This product line consists of Cohesive Bandages to include: disposable, latex-free/safe, individually wrapped, sterile in sizes ranging from 3-6 inches x 5yds and disposable, latex and latex-free/safe, non-sterile cohesive bandages in sizes ranging from 1-6 inches x 5yds. <br />a. Required Items:<br />2-3 INCH X 5 YARDS STERILE, LATEX-FREE/SAFE COHESIVE BANDAGE, DISPOSABLE<br />4-6 INCH X 5 YARDS STERILE, LATEX-FREE/SAFE COHESIVE BANDAGE, DISPOSABLE<br />1-1.5 INCH X 5 YARDS NON-STERILE, LATEX COHESIVE BANDAGE, DISPOSABLE<br />2-3 INCH X 5 YARDS NON-STERILE, LATEX COHESIVE BANDAGE, DISPOSABLE<br />4-6 INCH X 5 YARDS NON-STERILE, LATEX COHESIVE BANDAGE, DISPOSABLE<br />1-1.5 INCH X 5 YARDS, NON-STERILE, LATEX-FREE/SAFE COHESIVE BANDAGE, DISPOSABLE <br />2-3 INCH X 5 YARDS, NON-STERILE, LATEX-FREE/SAFE COHESIVE BANDAGE, DISPOSABLE <br />4-6 INCH X 5 YARDS, NON-STERILE, LATEX-FREE/SAFE COHESIVE BANDAGE, DISPOSABLE<br />*Operational usage items are included in this list of Cohesive Bandages.<br />b. Vendor must provide a complete itemized list of products supplied (manufactured and/or distributed by brands) via Microsoft Excel spread sheet, and a product catalog and literature, in response to this RFIAQ. Vendors are required to supply all items listed above. <br />2. Vendor must have a DAPA or be in the process of applying for a DAPA number for the Cohesive Bandages product line. Vendor MUST provide the DAPA number with initial submittal or provide documentation that DAPA has been applied for with response submittal.<br />3. Vendor must have agreements with the current Med/Surg Prime Vendors for each MMESO AOR, i.e. Cardinal Health and Owens &amp; Minor for Cohesive Bandages, or be in the process of obtaining Prime Vendor agreements.<br />4. Vendor will be required to submit discounts off of DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative when pricing is requested in Phase III. Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price. A vendor shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative. A vendor who does not provide discounts off DAPA in Phase III for all products will be disqualified.<br />5. Vendor must indicate country from which each line item is an end product, IAW Trade Agreements Act. Vendors having existing DAPA numbers must also ensure that all DAPA line items/end products in the subject product line list the proper Trade Agreements Act country in the DAPA Management System. Additionally, vendors are advised that the Berry Amendment applies to this SA.</p>
<p>Phase II Clinical Performance Evaluation<br />Following acceptability of the technical/company requirements, the MMESO Pacific, on behalf of the CPT, will request product sample sets from the product group to be sent to the specific CPT members at the participating MTFs. <strong>Vendor will be given 30 calendar days from the issue of the notice in which to deliver the product samples for clinical evaluation in Phase II. Product samples must be shipped no later than fourteen (14) calendar days after issue of notice, and arrive at the designated addresses for each MTF by 5:00PM local time before the 30th calendar day. Vendor must be able to deliver product literature, training materials and evaluation samples as requested to the MMESO Pacific via FedEx or UPS AND to the MMESO Europe via United States Postal Service (USPS) Express Mail AND throughout the United States by selected shipping method when requested in Phase II. Vendor must send the MMESO Pacific verification regarding the shipment of literature and samples. This information will include the date of shipment, final delivery date, tracking numbers and the carrier used by the vendor.</strong> Vendor will provide only the following no cost product samples for clinical/performance evaluation. Unused samples will not be returned. One (1) box (at least 12 rolls in each box) of each size and style listed below are to be provided to each of the evaluation sites as identified in the letters of invitation.<br />SAMPLE SET<br />1 BOX (at least 12 rolls) of 4-6 INCH X 5 YARDS STERILE, LATEX-FREE/SAFE COHESIVE BANDAGE, DISPOSABLE<br />1 BOX (at least 12 rolls) of 2-3 INCH X 5 YARDS NON-STERILE, LATEX COHESIVE BANDAGE, DISPOSABLE<br />1 BOX (at least 12 rolls) of 2-3 INCH X 5 YARDS, NON-STERILE, LATEX-FREE/SAFE COHESIVE BANDAGE, DISPOSABLE</p>
<p>Each evaluator will evaluate each product sample from each vendor against the established requirements. A trial will consist of evaluating sample products from a single vendor, evaluated against the requirements and recorded on a single evaluation form per vendor. Each evaluator will evaluate or trial each participating vendor's product line. The clinical/performance acceptability evaluation period will last for fourteen (14) calendar days. The acceptability evaluation responses will be in a Likert scale format with a one (1) through five (5) scoring range. The scale descriptors are: one (1) Completely Unacceptable, two (2) Overwhelmingly Unacceptable, three (3) Partially Unacceptable, four (4) Acceptable, and five (5) Highly Acceptable. The MMESO JPRB has established a 4.0 as the Clinically Preferred threshold of products for standardization.</p>
<p>A vendor scoring below the clinically preferred threshold will be disqualified from selection for this standardization initiative. A vendor who has been disqualified will be notified in writing upon completion of the standardization selection. Of those vendors that are qualified as clinically preferred, selection will be based on best price. Clinical / performance acceptability evaluations by the participating CPT facilities will be tabulated resulting in one score per participating MMESO per vendor. The participating MMESOs' scores by vendor will then be combined resulting in one final vendor performance evaluation score. All clinical/performance acceptability evaluations will be tabulated by the MMESO Pacific and results will be forwarded to the MMESO CPT for final review.</p>
<p>There will be approximately fourteen (14) MTFs enterprise wide that will be evaluating products.</p>
<p>Clinical/Performance Requirements<br />During the acquisition planning process, the CPT approved the clinical/performance requirements outlined below. <br />1. (Efficiency of Use/Patient Safety/FDA Standard for Device Labeling - 21 CFR 820.120) Packaging promotes/allows for quick and easy identification of bandage size (width and length), latex composition and product sterility (if sterile). Product packaging that clearly identifies bandage size, latex composition, and sterility factor saves time, avoids errors and waste, and prevents harm/risk of infection to patients.<br />2. (NPSG.07.05.01: Implement evidence-based practices for preventing surgical site infections.) Product <br />packaging allows for aseptic opening and delivery of product to a sterile field. Product packaging must allow for aseptic opening and delivery of product to a sterile field, as compromising the sterile field could lead to patient infection and prolong surgery time. <br />3. (Efficiency of Use /Patient Safety/Prevention of Infection - Standard: IC.01.04.01: Based on the identified risks, the hospital sets goals to minimize the possibility of transmitting infections.) Bandage can be torn by gloved hands without resistance. When the bandage can be quickly torn by gloved hands without resistance, cross contamination from scissors is eliminated, protecting the patient from risk of infection and saving time for staff.<br />4. (Patient Comfort/Clinical Effectiveness - The care of wounds; a guide for nurses, 3rd ed. - Design of dressing allows for easy application and product readily molds to a variety of anatomical shapes.) Bandage is lightweight and flexible, allowing the dressing to contour to the part of the body on which it is being used. This type of bandage is used for many different purposes and therefore must be flexible and be able to conform to difficult-to-bandage areas. Without conformability, a bandage will fall away, no longer supplying adequate compression.<br />5. (Patient Comfort/Patient Safety/Cost Effectiveness/Prevention of Infection - The care of wounds; a guide for nurses, 3rd ed. - Patient comfort is of primary importance for any wound management product. It can be very distressing for a patient when the application or removal of a dressing is painful.) Bandage adheres securely to itself, and not to hair or skin. Non-adherence of product to skin preserves regenerating tissue and reduces discomfort during dressing changes. Prevention of skin tears reduces the risk of infection. Adherence to itself eliminates the need for tape or clips, which reduces costs and saves staff time.</p>
<p>Phase III Pricing Analysis<br />Upon completion of the Phase I - Technical/Company Requirements, a vendor who is found technically acceptable will be qualified / invited to provide product samples and price discount quotes concurrently. A vendor will be given 30 calendar days from the date of pricing requests to submit IA pricing quotes in a prescribed electronic spreadsheet format, based upon the requirements of the MMESOs. <strong>Pricing will be submitted to MMESO Pacific and must be received by 5:00PM HST, thirty (30) calendar days after the issue date of the vendor notice to submit best price quotes.</strong> Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the specific products requested in this announcement. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing for the products identified in this announcement (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the MMESOs). Price will be analyzed based on the projected Aggregate Post-Standardization costs for each vendor. Aggregate Post-Standardization Cost will be calculated for each vendor by applying the vendor's offered prices to the anticipated annual usage of the enterprise. Unmatched items will be represented in the Post-Standardization Cost at a baseline non-discounted price (current DAPA price of product with highest procurement). <strong>Among the products and sources that were determined to be clinically preferred, the best price Aggregate Post-Standardization Cost will be selected.</strong> The selected Vendor of Choice will have an opportunity to provide other items beyond the minimum required product line that you would like to be considered for addition to the Incentive Agreement with a discount from DAPA. All additions will be at the discretion of the Government.</p>

The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>Contractor SHALL provide the approved water distributor's name, address, and inspection responsibility code (IRC) with the bid. The water source must be approved and listed on the U.S. Army Medical Department/U.S. Army Veterinary Command Approved Sources list. This list is a comprehensive list of sanitarily approved food establishments and sources that may be utilized to provide services to the U.S. Government.

<DESC>Notice of Intent to Award a Sole Source (Non-Competitive) Contract<br />National Highway Traffic Safety Administration<br />DTNH22-12-R-00553
<p>Media Services to Support NHTSA Impaired Driving Public Campaign</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Transportation, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) intends to negotiate a contract award using other than full and open competition for media services for safety programs public service campaigns to the Advertising Council (Ad Council) 815 2nd Avenue, New York, NY 10017. Accordingly, NHTSA intends to award to the Ad Council a one-year plus four option years Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ)/Time and Materials (T&amp;M) contract to provide media services for safety programs public service campaigns. NHTSA published three notices (December 8, 2011, April 22, 2010 (modified on June 14, 2010), and November 12, 2009) seeking capability statements from firms who could meet NHTSA's media services requirements. However, no firms identified themselves with the capabilities to meet NHTSA's needs thus NHTSA will enter into negotiations with the Ad Council.<br />NHTSA's contract with the Ad Council will support NHTSA's various behavior safety programs to encourage safe behavior of drivers, occupants, cyclists, and pedestrians across the country. Tasks under this contract will primarily focus on developing and implementing large-scale, fully integrated public service campaigns in support of NHTSA's traffic safety programs. More specifically, offerors will be required to demonstrate that they have extensive and successful experience in providing a full-range of activities associated with researching, developing, producing, delivering, and evaluating program-related materials with both internal and external stakeholders. Expected quarterly impressions from the integrated public service campaigns are expected to deliver, on average, no less than 50 million impressions.<br />This notice of intent to award is not a request for competitive proposals. However, firms, companies or agencies may show their interest and /or capability by submitting a requirement response or proposal. All proposals must be received by the date and time designated in the solicitation. All proposals received within five (5) days after date of publication (NLT Thursday, March 29, 2012, EDT., 2:00 p.m. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.<br />Timeframe for Submittal of Capability Statements<br />Capability statements must be submitted electronically to nhtsaoam@dot.gov , to the attention of Sharon Burgess-Anderson, Contract Specialist, by 2:00 p.m., EDT., Thursday, March 29, 2012, referencing: Media Services to Support NHTSA Safety Program Public Service Campaign.</p>
<p>Background and Purpose<br />The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is an agency within the U.S.<br />Department of Transportation whose primary mission is to reduce deaths, injuries and economic losses resulting from motor vehicle crashes. This is accomplished by:</p>
<p>&bull; Setting and enforcing national safety performance standards for motor vehicles and equipment;<br />&bull; Researching and demonstrating promising strategies to influence positive traffic safety behaviors; and<br />&bull; Planning and executing strategic communication campaigns to support program activity.</p>
<p>Motor vehicle travel is the primary means of transportation in the United States, providing an unprecedented degree of mobility. Yet for all its advantages, motor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of death for people of every age from 3 through 34 (based on 2006 data). Traffic fatalities accounted for more than 90 percent of transportation-related fatalities.</p>
<p>One of the highest priorities of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is to increase occupant protection use and address all occupant protection issues as it pertains to diverse populations and targeted audiences (such as children, pre-teens, teens, and young adults).<br />The most likely cause for children to die in a car crash is not being buckled into a seat belt or age appropriate child restraint system. Every day in the United States, an average of 4 children age 14 and younger were killed and 529 were injured in motor vehicle crashes during 2008.</p>
<p>In addition, the percentage of pre-teens dying unrestrained is holding steady at or around 59 percent (FARS 2006) compared to 55 percent for motor vehicle occupants ages 16 and older. Although primary seat belt laws for children and adults are effective at increasing restraint use, in some states pre-teens are challenged because they do not necessarily fall under the coverage of child passenger safety or adult belt laws. It is estimated that increasing seat belt use can reduce fatalities by up to 45 percent in passenger cars and 60 percent in light trucks. Every increase in seat belt use translates to lives saved and injuries prevented. NHTSA estimates that every one percentage-point increase represents 2.8 million more Americans buckling up, 250 additional lives saved, and 4,000 fewer serious injuries annually.</p>
<p>Impaired driving-related deaths account for nearly 42 percent of all traffic fatalities annually. Alcohol- impaired driving is one of the most often committed crimes in America, affecting 1 in 3 Americans annually, resulting in 1 fatality every 30 minutes, 45 deaths every day, and more than 17,000 fatalities annually. More than 10,000 people lost their lives in 2009 in crashes involving drivers with a BAC of .08 and above.</p>
<p>NHTSA's various vehicle safety programs work with and through State highway safety agencies and other partners to encourage safe behavior of drivers, occupants, cyclists, and pedestrians across the country. Since traffic safety problems affect people in all communities, the effort to implement programs to improve safety involves people at all levels of the government, within businesses and organizations, and volunteers (both individual and organizational).</p>
<p>NHTSA has developed its communications program in a process that is first grounded in sound Agency policy and program. This approach provides the discipline for focusing communication efforts on the programs they support. Over the years NHTSA has developed and implemented many communication efforts aimed at general audiences that did not support program activity. Clearly communication focused on getting people to change their behavior is more successful in an environment that includes continuous and consistent messaging that educates the public.</p>
<p>NHTSA utilizes an integrated approach when developing and implementing its communications programs meaning that all tools available to communications experts are explored for use in any given campaign. This includes reviewing data, including traffic and market research, advertising, media relations, collateral materials, partnerships, and evaluation of all NHTSA safety programs.</p>
<p>PURPOSE</p>
<p>The purpose of this statement of work is for the acquisition of services and products required by NHTSA to field successful and effective national public service campaigns: refinement of campaign strategies and focus, technical assistance, creation of multimedia advertising materials to carry out the strategies, dissemination of multimedia products to national and local media outlets, development and placement, and monitoring and reporting the results of donated media efforts, and management of social media efforts that support campaign strategies and make full use of the latest marketing tools to increase awareness of campaign messages.</p>
<p>Although the contractor will be asked to work on specific high-level programs that include Occupant Protection and Impaired Driving, their stated capabilities and specific task requirements included in this SOW may be applied to any NHTSA safety programs that require a national public service campaign.</p>
<p>Specifics objectives for two of these NHTSA safety programs are as follows.</p>
<p>The Occupant Protection campaign's objectives are to:</p>
<p>&bull; Develop and deliver national public information campaigns featuring varied media approaches to increase occupant protection use across all age groups;<br />&bull; Demonstrate proper use; and<br />&bull; Illustrate how to select, fit and wear occupant restraints that meet, and exceed, Federal safety standards.</p>
<p>The Impaired Driving campaign's objectives are to: <br />&bull; Develop, deliver and maintain a national public information campaign to decrease impaired driving for certain target audiences featuring varied media approaches; and<br />&bull; Create dialogue on planning ahead of time to prevent impaired driving behavior.</p>
<p>Even though the current SOW includes immediate media services needs for the Occupant Protection and Impaired Driving campaigns, there may be additional behavioral and vehicle safety program campaigns added as additional Task Orders under this contract. The functional areas and tasks will remain the same as outlined in this document.<br />Interested parties may submit Capabilities Statements to be received by March 29, 2012, 2:00 p.m. EDT, by email to the attention of Sharon Burgess-Anderson, Contract Specialist, nhtsaoam@dot.gov.</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-57. The solicitation number is P12PS20984, and the solicitation is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ).  This Request for Quotation has been made available through www.fbo.gov to comply with the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(e)) and the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act (41 U.S.C. 416), that requires contracting officers to disseminate information on proposed contract actions expected to exceed $10,000 or more, by displaying in a public place, or by any appropriate electronic means. Due to the limited amount of public places for positing at Olympic National Park, and the remote locations and accessibility of field sites, electronic posting at FedBizOpps.gov is utilized to comply with public posting and to promote competition to the extent practical.  While the government estimate cannot be divulged, the Government anticipates this project to be less than $25,000.  The National Park Service expects there to be interest from film students and beginning professionals, willing to tackle a lower-budget project.  Offerors should anticipate using minimal equipment, traveling light, and using a small crew. The Government anticipates that the total price awarded will be sufficient to support a filmmaker, travel expenses, and post-production work (i.e., editing the films).  This solicitation is unrestricted (full and open).  The NAICS code is 512110 with an associated small business size standard of $29.5 million (average gross revenue over past three years).  It is the contractor's responsibility to be familiar with applicable clauses and provisions.  Clauses and provisions can be found at http://www.acquisition.gov/far. This solicitation will result in award of a firm, fixed-price contract.  The National Park Service (NPS), Olympic National Park, has a requirement for production of two each, 10-minute movies about climate change featuring NPS scientific staff working in parks within the North Coast and Cascade Science Learning Network (SLN).
OBJECTIVE:  The goal of this project is to convey the urgency of climate change as seen through the eyes of scientists working in that field.  Each film will follow an NPS scientist working on climate change. The films will show the scientist in the field, analyzing data, and include a bit of their personal lives, and also showing the science, professional commitment, and passion of the scientists doing their work, including (a) how climate change is monitored and what we've learned as a direct result of that science, (b) introduce viewers to the day-to-day operations of science field work, (c) engage new audiences (youth, students, teachers, web-users) to national park science through engaging visual media, (d) be of high visual quality and interest while accurately conveying both factual detail and agency mission, and (e) creating the personal bond between the scientist and the viewer by showing the sincerity of researchers and devotion to their work.  Creative visualization will be a collaborative effort with the contractor and the SLN staff, and will include natural-setting scenic shots, wildlife or other natural resources, on-camera staff interviews, and images of research activities in progress.  It is the Government's intention that the contractor film candidates with engaging on-camera personality, who interact well with park field crews, who can be on-location to capture images or reshoot scenes as needed, and deliver finished products on a deadline.  Each movie will follow an NPS scientist working in the field, potentially at each of the following eight parks:  (1) Olympic National Park, headquarters at 600 East Park Avenue, Port Angeles, WA 98362;  (2)  North Cascades National Park, headquarters at 810 State Route 20, Sedro Woolley, WA 98284; (3) Mount Rainier National Park, headquarters at 55210 238th Avenue East, Ashford, WA 98304; (4) Ebeys Landing National Historical Reserve, headquarters at 162 Cemetery Road, Coupeville, WA 98239; (5) San Juan Islands National Historical Park, headquarters at 4668 Cattle Point Road, Friday Harbor, WA 98250;  (6) Fort Vancouver National Historic Site, headquarters at 612 East Reserve Street, Vancouver, WA 98661; (7) Klondike Gold Rush National Historical Park - Seattle Unit, headquarters at 319 Second Avenue South, Seattle, WA 98104; and (8) Lewis and Clark National Historical Park, headquarters at 92343 Fort Clatsop Road, Astoria, OR 97103. 
TASK:  Produce a total of 2 each, ten-minute movies.  SCOPE OF WORK:  SLN staff will provide appropriate movie content, including explanation of why science occurs in National Parks, and other detailed park information, with the intent that the movies convey factual park information, the importance of why studying a particular resource is vital to achieving NPS goals, and show that science is performed in National Parks.  The SLN will coordinate for the contractor, all on-site interviews with park staff, and will be present for most of the filming.  Each movie will highlight the activities of a field researcher who will be shown conducting his or her own work.  Although no script is involved, each video sequence will be scheduled and accompanied by an NPS liaison staffer.  The liaison staff will provide a few leading questions to start the interview and the rest will follow ad lib. Normally a single researcher is in the field with a small crew of 3-4 individuals. Some researchers are obviously more out-going or photogenic than others. NPS will try to select film subjects passionate about their work. Videographer's task is to convey that passion to audiences.  There will be no props or visuals except the equipment used by researchers and nature itself.  While the NPS staff and on-site arrangements at each park will be coordinated by SLN staff members, travel to and from each site is the responsibility of the contractor.  The Government anticipates filming can be achieved within a single day at each scheduled park, and overnight stays in the field with NPS researchers or scientists will not be required.  However, arrangements can be made for the contractor to stay in the field overnight by agreement of the SLN and NPS staff.  Field work may require contractor's crew to cross difficult terrain and film in varying weather conditions.  Note regarding filming permits:  Because the work is solely for the non-profit use of the National Park Service and the work is being done at NPS direction, film permits will not be required for this project.  POST-PRODUCTION PHASE:  Upon contractor's submittal of "first draft" of the two movies, allow six weeks for the SLN staff to review and comment.  Note about closed-caption:  NPS follows government-wide practice in ensuring that videos and similar media are accessible to all audiences.  Closed-captioning will be performed by NPS after delivery of the videos.  Filmmaker does not need to be concerned with providing closed-captioning in their delivered products. Final submittal shall include three master DVDs, raw footage, and edited video files. The final movies shall be in QuickTime.  SLN staff will distribute the resulting movies through numerous venues including on-line.  
ANTICIPATED CONTRACT TIMELINE:  The following timeline is to provide a general overview of how the Government anticipates the entire project and all phases to flow from beginning to end over a ten-month period.  Actual timeline and schedule will be determined after award, by agreement of the parties, but, all work shall ultimately be achieved within a ten-month period.

Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.<br>    <br>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71.

The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: The award decision will be based on the Lowest Priced, Technically Acceptable offer.  Best value is expected to result from selection of the technically acceptable proposal with the lowest evaluated price."<br><br> (b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).<br><br>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<br><br>(End of provision)<br><br><br>ADDENDUM TO 52.212-2<br><br>Paragraph (a) is hereby supplemented with the following:<br><br> (a).  The total evaluated price must be reasonable, and any additional expense must be justified by a corresponding value for technical merit, or an expectation of greater quality of performance.  <br><br>(b).   Contractors may not qualify if any of the following are not met: <br><br>1.   	Proposal does not reasonably address the requirements in the request for proposal (RFP).<br>2.	Proposal includes major deficiencies or omissions which discussions could not be expected to cure without a major revision or a new proposal.<br><br>3.	Proposal is so technically inferior or so out of line in price as compared to other proposals as to preclude it from having a reasonable chance for award.<br><br>4. 	An unrealistically low price, may indicate lack of sound management judgment and lack of understanding of the requirement for the geographic area of service, or unbalanced pricing of line items, as proposed initially or subsequently, may be grounds for eliminating a proposal either on the basis that the offeror does not understand the requirement or has made an imprudent offer.<br>5.   The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions, if necessary.<br><br><br>PART I    TECHINICAL:<br><br>Technical capability to include catalog price lists if available; proof of Enforcement Agency (DEA) distribution license or DEA number and delivery information.<br><br>Technical will be evaluated as either Acceptable or Unacceptable. Best value is expected to result from selection of the technically acceptable proposal with the lowest evaluated price.<br><br>Definitions are as follows: <br><br>ACCEPTABLE: To be rated acceptable, the offeror's technical proposal must demonstrate it can meet all requirements. <br><br>UNACCEPTABLE: A technical proposal that fails to demonstrate it can meet one or more requirements will be determined unacceptable. <br><br><br>PART II   PAST PERFORMANCE<br><br>Offeror is required to submit information, on a single page, identifying federal, state and local Government and private contracts performed within the past three years, which are similar in scope and complexity to the effort described in this solicitation.  If none, offeror should so state and provide information on references.<br><br>Information provided by the Contractor shall state:  The type of service provided with information to verify references:  Names; telephone numbers; Points of Contact; amount of contract; and email addresses.<br><br>Past performance shall be used as an evaluation factor within the LPTA process, unless waived by the PCO in accordance with FAR 15.101- 2(b). It shall be evaluated in accordance with FAR 15.305 and DFARS 215.305.  However, the comparative assessment in FAR 15.305(a)(2)(i) does not apply.  Therefore, past performance will be rated on an "acceptable" or "unacceptable" basis using the ratings below.<br><br>Acceptable: Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort, or the offeror's performance record is unknown. (See note below.)<br><br>Unacceptable: Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has no reasonable expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort.<br><br>Note: In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available or so sparse that no meaningful past performance rating can be reasonably assigned, the offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (see FAR 15.305 (a)(2)(iv)). Therefore, the offeror shall be determined to have unknown past performance. In the context of acceptability/unacceptability, "unknown" shall be considered "acceptable." A.2.1.2.1 Aspects of Past Performance.<br><br>PART III    PRICE:<br><br>Price will be evaluated separately from Technical and will be evaluated for fairness and reasonability. Offeror shall provide their published price list with their offer. <br><br><br>52.212-3     OFFEROR REPRESENTATIONS AND CERTIFICATIONS--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (DEB 2012) ALTERNATE I (APR 2011)<br><br><br>Vendors shall include a completed copy of FAR provision 52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications with their offer. Offerors shall include a confirmation of receipt of any amendments to this solicitation. Failure to submit a confirmation could result in the offer being determined non- responsive.<br><br><br>

All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal or quotation which will be considered by the agency.<br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695<br />Quotes will be accepted via e-mail at the above addresses, facsimile at 252-334-5427, or at the following address: <br />MEDIUM RANGE SURVEILLANCE (MRS)<br />USCG/CASA<br />AVIATION LOGISTICS CENTER (ALC)<br />ELIZABETH CITY, NC 27909</p>

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695<br />Quotes will be accepted via e-mail at the above addresses, facsimile at 252-334-5427, or at the following address: <br />MEDIUM RANGE SURVEILLANCE (MRS)<br />USCG/CASA<br />AVIATION LOGISTICS CENTER (ALC)<br />ELIZABETH CITY, NC 27909</p>

All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal or quotation which will be considered by the agency.<br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695<br />Quotes will be accepted via e-mail at the above addresses, facsimile at 252-334-5427, or at the following address: <br />MEDIUM RANGE SURVEILLANCE (MRS)<br />USCG/CASA<br />AVIATION LOGISTICS CENTER (ALC)<br />ELIZABETH CITY, NC 27909</p>

All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal or quotation which will be considered by the agency.<br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695<br />Quotes will be accepted via e-mail at the above addresses, facsimile at 252-334-5427, or at the following address: <br />MEDIUM RANGE SURVEILLANCE (MRS)<br />USCG/CASA<br />AVIATION LOGISTICS CENTER (ALC)<br />ELIZABETH CITY, NC 27909</p>

All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal or quotation which will be considered by the agency.<br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695<br />Quotes will be accepted via e-mail at the above addresses, facsimile at 252-334-5427, or at the following address: <br />MEDIUM RANGE SURVEILLANCE (MRS)<br />USCG/CASA<br />AVIATION LOGISTICS CENTER (ALC)<br />ELIZABETH CITY, NC 27909</p>

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p><br /><strong>V. All responsible sources may submit a quotation</strong>, which if timely received, shall be considered by the Agency. <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Companies must have a valid DUNS number and be registered with Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and shall provide the company Tax Information Number (TIN) with their quote. </span></em></p>
<p><br /><strong>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</strong> - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

The mulch beds in the playground are maintained by FE (USCG&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Facilities Engineering)&nbsp;personnel.&nbsp; the alwn contractor isn't responsible <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for mulch or matting in that area.<br /><br />2. Is the mulch at the playground included in the mulch count?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ans.

It really does not matter.&nbsp; One or two days would be fine, but we don't <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; want it to turn into a week-long affair.<br /><br />5. How many LF is the perimeter fence line?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ans. 8,000 feet.<br /><br />6.

Will the contractor be contacted by the USCG when an out of sequence&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; servicing is required?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ans.&nbsp;Yes.&nbsp; The Facilities Manager will notify the contractor's POC if such<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; situation arises.<br /><br />8.

FE will notify the contractor's POC if additional mowings are required.<br /><br />9. After the quantity of an ELIN line item is met, will additional treatments or<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; quantity of material such as mowing, mulch and leaf&nbsp;removal be ordered<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; IDIQ?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ans.

Is post emergent weed control required for the turf areas?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ans. Yes.<br /><br />11.

<DESC><p>NOTICE OF CONTRACT ACTION (NOCA)<br />Posted 19 March 2012</p>
<p>This announcement constitutes a notice to all potential offerors that on or about 3 April 2012, the Integrated Strategic Planning and Analysis Network (ISPAN) Program Office anticipates the release of a Request for Proposal (RFP) for the sustainment/enhancement of the Global Strike and Product Support (GSPS) suite of software applications. This effort will be issued under solicitation number FA8707-12-R-0002. The Government anticipates awarding a Single Award Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract with a contract ceiling of $49.6M. The IDIQ will have a five year ordering period. The place of performance for this effort is USSTRATCOM, Offutt AFB, NE. Offerors will be provided 45 days to respond to the RFP. Interested parties desiring to do business with the Air Force shall be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) System at www.bpn.gov/ccr/. Interested parties should ensure any potential Organizational Conflicts of Interest have been, or are in the process of being mitigated. This NOCA does not constitute an RFP, and it does not restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach, nor should it be construed as a commitment by the Government. Contractors are reminded and cautioned that only the Contracting Officer is legally authorized to commit the Government. Additionally, once the RFP for the GSPS effort is posted, all correspondence concerning this effort shall be with the Contracting Officer only. Please direct any questions on this NOCA to the Contracting Officer, ESC/HSBK, 901 SAC Blvd, Ste 2H29, Offutt AFB, NE, 68113, Attn: Mr. Lee Smales, Contracting Officer (tel: 402-232-7367), email smalesl@stratcom.mil.</p>
<p>The ESC Ombudsman, located at Hanscom AFB, MA, serves as the Ombudsman for all of ESC, including its GSUs. The Ombudsman hears concerns about specific issues in acquisitions, communicates those concerns to ESC/CC, ESC's Deputy for Acquisition (DC(A)) or ESC's Deputy for Support (DC(S)) from industry or Government personnel, and assists in the resolution of those concerns. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes, nor does the Ombudsman diminish the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official. When approached with an issue or query the Ombudsman independently assesses the situation and provides a response or initiates a resolution, and when requested, will maintain confidentiality as to the source of the inquiry. Contact information for the ESC Ombudsman is as follows: ESC/CS, Bldg 1606, 9 Eglin St, Hanscom AFB, MA 01731. Telephone: 781-225-1628, Fax: 781-225-2250, Email: ESC.Ombudsman@hanscom.af.mil.</p>

<DESC>Note: The PWS has been slightly altered.&nbsp; If your company has already responded to&nbsp;the previous sources sought announcement for this acquisition, please reply to the primary POC with whether you are still interested or no longer interested in this opportunity.<br /><br />The United States Air Force (USAF) intends to increase the use of refurbished bearings, as opposed to procure all new aerospace bearing, to meet weapons systems supply demands. The USAF has made the strategic decision to pursue the public capability for Level I-II aerospace bearing inspection and refurbishment and associated engineering. Further, the strategic decision is to establish a single process and standard of quality, for inspecting, repairing, and refurbishing all USAF Aerospace bearings. The capability will initially be established at&nbsp;Hill, Tinker, and Robins Air Force Bases. The objectives of the initiative are as follows: expand the business base of aerospace bearing refurbishment; expand the pool of potentially reparable defense aerospace bearings, including other service and federal agency systems; improve item level cost, quality and/or schedule performance through aerospace bearing refurbishment; reduce Air Force total ownership cost through aerospace bearing refurbishment.

Yet the tasks are design, development, deployment, testing and maintenance and operation of the DAMIS.

The Bureau is responsible for the development, supervision, coordination and implementation of international narcotics control assistance activities and international criminal justice issues for the Department of State. INL/AP provides policy guidance and develops, executes and monitors programs to address the full range of criminal justice issues as they relate to stabilization and reconstruction activities in Afghanistan and Pakistan. INL has been engaged in an effort with the Government of Afghanistan to build the capacity of the Afghan Criminal Justice System to properly and securely detain arrested persons awaiting trial and sentencing as well as those who have been properly sanctioned by a court in a manner consistent with the commonly accepted human rights principles.</p>
<p>Purpose<br />The Regional Corrections Advisor would provide technical corrections expertise in a wide variety of settings, including internal U.S. embassy and multi-national meetings, to assist the Government of Afghanistan in reaching its stated Goals and Objectives in reforming the corrections/prisons system in Afghanistan. The Regional Corrections Advisor would offer assistance in a variety of areas, to include technical assistance, contingency planning and development, training and equipment needs. S/he would also serve as a resource to the INL/Kabul Director, the INL/Kabul Administration of Justice Team Lead, and the Afghan Director General for Prisons (Central Prisons Directorate) on corrections issues bringing together expertise from the United States, as well as other countries having innovative corrections projects and programs that could be considered by the Government of Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Relationships <br />The Regional Corrections Advisor (to include the Representative to the Combined Joint Interagency Task Force - 435 (CJIATF-435)) reports to the INL/Kabul Director through the INL/Kabul Administration of Justice Team Lead, serving as the corrections systems development expert on a full range of prison/corrections issues in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>&nbsp;B. STATEMENT OF WORK<br />&bull; Serves as one of INL's corrections experts in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>&bull; Develops and coordinates corrections programs for Afghanistan in concert with other USG, international and Afghan law enforcement and criminal justice programs.</p>
<p>&bull; Serves as an advisory resource for INL/Kabul, INL/AP, CJIATF-435, and Afghan corrections officials on specific aspects of planning and implementation of ongoing corrections assistance programs in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>&bull; Oversees and coordinates Afghanistan corrections program activities with the end goal of supporting the Afghan Government in developing a safe, secure, and humane corrections system.</p>
<p>&bull; Provides policy analysis and program guidance to INL/Kabul, INL/AP, and Afghan officials on all aspects of corrections matters, addressing any of a number of issues related to corrections system reforms to include human rights issues related to prisoner incarceration; prisoner classification; strategic planning; prisoner programs; budgeting; development of correctional capacities and institutions; refurbishment and/or construction of correctional facilities; and training plans.</p>
<p>&bull; Organizes and participates in meetings, seminars, and exercises to develop plans/programs for implementation of corrections assistance in Afghanistan and improve overall capacities to effectively modernize existing institutions.</p>
<p>&bull; Attends domestic and international conferences on Government of Afghanistan corrections reforms.</p>

<p>&bull; Other duties as requested and assigned by the INL/Kabul Director and Administration of Justice Team Lead.</p>
<p>&bull; Communicates regularly with the INL/AP Corrections Team Lead.</p>
<p>Guidelines<br />The assignment involves providing expert analytical and advisory support for the planning, development, and execution of U.S. foreign policy within a broad and complex range of corrections areas, interpreting data that is often vague, unsubstantiated, or contradicts existing knowledge in preparing options and/or recommendations. Incumbent must develop an analysis that provides new perspectives for the understanding and resolution of complex legal, political, economic, social, geographic, or military issues as they relate to Afghanistan and the surrounding region. The work is complicated by the need to provide expert advice and guidance that influences the decisions and actions of senior policy officials and the need to quickly, accurately, and decisively determine the relevance and significance of information to the policy interests of the Department. It is further complicated by the need to produce widely disseminated analytical products that represent the Bureau's official assessment of complex issues, and keep the policy making and foreign affairs communities constantly apprised of new issues and developments with respect to corrections issues. Other complicating factors include the incumbent's responsibility for ascertaining the need for initiating and conducting in-depth studies on topics of critical importance to the policy formulation process, and for representing INL/Kabul on committees and working groups that address issues of vital interest to INL.</p>
<p>Complexity<br />Develops detailed plans, goals, and objectives for the long-range implementation and administration of the program, and/or develops criteria for evaluating the effectiveness of the program. Coordinating plans with various other groups including international donors, the U.S. military and the Government of Afghanistan can be complicated.</p>
<p>Projects require dynamic leadership and expertise and complex innovation, strict adherence to high level policy without lower level interpretive assistance, and the ability to single-handedly or in concert with a variety of other stakeholders resolve critical problems and achieve difficult goals that may impact other programs. They are broad in scope and complicated by many complex features, technical, administrative, or political in nature.</p>
<p>Physical Demands<br />The work generally does not impose unusual physical demands when the incumbent is working at his/her office location. However, frequent travel is required to hazardous duty locations that could impose unusual and/or difficult physical demands.</p>
<p>C. MINIMUM QUALIFICATIONS<br />a. U.S. citizen, eligible for a State Department Top Secret security clearance.</p>
<p>b. A total of 15 years professional work experience:<br />&#61607; At least 10 years experience in corrections operations, management, organizational development, planning, and/or training, 2 years of which must have been at the rank of assistant warden (or equivalent) or higher.<br />&#61607; At least 4 years experience in other senior management roles such as strategic planning, resource management, and budgeting. <br />c. Graduation from a certified state or federal corrections or probation officer training academy.<br />d. A bachelor's degree from an accredited college or university. Individuals without a degree but with significant corrections management experience (minimum of five years) at the warden level (or equivalent) or higher will be considered.<br />e. A total of fifteen years professional work experience. At least four years experience in senior project management using critical path methodology, resources management, quality control processes, and budgeting. Demonstrated experience which clearly illustrates the applicant's ability to manage a multi-phase, complex construction project from concept through final turnover. International experience required, experience in Afghanistan or Iraq preferred. Significant experience in correction and/or justice infrastructure projects preferred. <br />f. Working knowledge and experience in corrections intelligence operations.<br />g. Superior interpersonal skills.<br />h. Superior writing and communication skills</p>

<p>The contractor will computer model the electrical distribution systems indicated on the single line diagrams for Buildings H (E106.4) and L (E401) for the above referenced facility. The contractor will field verify and correct single line drawings as needed to perform an accurate study. The study will be performed in accordance with IEEE and NFPA standards. <br /><br />The complete study will include: <br />Perform a short circuit study and calculate the incident energy levels and flash hazard boundaries for switchgear, switchboards, motor control centers, panel-boards, bus duct and meter sockets in accordance the NEC, NFPA 70E and IEEE 1584. Studies will be run with and without emergency power and the worst case scenario will be used as the basis of the study. Arc flash results will be provided for systems that, based on available fault magnitudes, can support an arc. In general, this will include all medium voltage and 480V distribution systems and select 208V systems. Calculated results for 208V systems will be limited to those systems supplied by transformers 150 kVA and larger. For systems served by smaller transformers, standard NFPA 70E levels will be furnished. Should hazard potentials exceed allowable PPE levels, general recommendations will be offered to remedy the situation. If incident energy levels can be reduced by changes in protective device settings, settings will be provided as part of this study. Where incident energy levels can only be reduced through equipment replacement or reconfiguration, only recommendations will be offered. Engineered solutions will be provided as an additional service. Warning labels identifying the hazard levels will be furnished for all equipment studied. Single labels will be furnished for all panel boards and multiple labels will be furnished for switchgear, switchboards and MCC's as applicable. <br />&bull; <br />&#61472;&#61472;&#61472;&#61472;Verify protective device coordination. Where devices do not coordinate, revised settings will be provided to correct deficiencies. Settings will also be reviewed as necessary to mitigate arc flash incident energy levels. <br />&bull; <br />Field verification of data necessary for the completion of the studies including but not limited to: equipment ratings; relay and breaker characteristics (and existing settings - if any); transformer sizes and ratings; cable sizes and lengths; large motor load sizes with contactor data (for PDC study). <br />&bull; <br />Engineered solutions for mitigating excessive arc flash hazard levels. <br />&bull; <br />Application of arc flash labels to all panels and switchboards.</p>

<DESC>Request for Information: Consumer Credit Information Panel<br /><br />Background: Consumer Credit Information Panel for Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) Research<br /><br />The CFPB seeks to acquire and maintain a nationally representative panel of credit information on consumers for use in a wide range of policy research projects. <br /><br />The panel would be a random sample of consumer credit files obtained from a national database of credit files. The outside contractor would provide an initial panel of consumers with information on an annual or quarterly basis for each of the last 10 years. Going forward, the contractor would provide updated consumer credit files for the consumers in the database on an annual or quarterly basis.<br /><br />The CFPB seeks to obtain information that will enable it to identify the important design considerations in developing such a panel. The CFPB requests comments on the following issues.<br /><br />Study population:<br /><br />&bull; The CFPB may consider the household as the appropriate sampling unit for the panel. How would your organization construct a panel based on households? <br /><br />&bull; Can your organization identify joint borrowers, co-signers, and/or authorized users? How? Should the Bureau append to the core sample of consumers or households joint borrowers, co-signers, and/or authorize users? What are the trade-offs the Bureau should consider in making this determination?<br /><br />&bull; The panel will have ongoing annual or quarterly refreshes. What are the benefits of moving from an annual to a quarterly update schedule? Additionally, does your organization have the ability to provide data for interim periods? For example, if you provide quarterly updates, can you provide monthly data on credit balances? For example, for an end-of-calendar Q1 data pull, would you be able to tell us the credit balances for consumers in January and February?<br /><br />&bull; One issue of concern is how the CFPB should treat files that are split. A file might be split if new tradelines reveal that a consumer identified as a single individual is actually two people. Similarly, a file might be split because some tradelines are identified as fraudulent. How would your organization handle credit files that are split between sample pulls? How would you suggest treating these files to maintain the representativeness of the panel? Can your technology identify these split files?<br /><br />&bull; A similar concern is how the CFPB should treat files that get combined. For example, two files might be combined if new tradelines reveal that two files actually belong to a single consumer. How would your organization handle credit files that are combined between sample pulls? How would you suggest treating these files to maintain the representativeness of the panel? Can your technology follow two files that are combined into a single file?<br /><br />&bull; The CFPB would like to do an initial data pull that goes back 10 years. For each of the years in this initial pull, the sample needs to be representative of the population of credit files at that time. Given this objective, what methodology is recommended to establish the initial sample? If an initial pull is for 10 years, should the base population be selected at a current date, should it be selected at the beginning of the 10 year data pull, or should the CFPB consider an alternate method?<br /><br />&bull; An important consideration in designing the panel is to maintain its representativeness over time. Describe the methods your organization could provide to assure the ongoing representativeness of the panel. Would your organization compare updated samples with a representative sample of the current credit population?<br /><br />&bull; How would your organization plan to identify new entrants to update the panel over time? In your answer, could you specifically address the challenge of differentiating between truly new entrants and files that look like new entrants, but are really not (e.g., files that are split over time).<br /><br />&bull; If the CFPB pulls a sample today, and then tries the pull the updated records of the same sample a year from now, should the CFPB assume that some files won't be found? Could you list the specific reasons why your organization might not be able to find all the records?<br /><br />&bull; The CFPB seeks input on the recommended size of the panel. The CFPB is estimating a panel of roughly 1 million consumers. The Bureau intends to study the behavior of individuals and financial products over time on a national and regional basis. Do the consumer panels deployed by other Federal agencies and private sector entities offer a meaningful comparative metric?<br /><br />&bull; Please provide any additional recommendations for constructing an initial credit panel.<br /><br />Data Characteristics:<br /><br />&bull; Central to the creation of the panel is the ability to track consumers over time. Please describe how your organization follows consumers over time. If individuals are tracked by means of a unique identifier, under what condition can this identifier change? If two credit records are combined, which identifier (if either) is maintained? Similarly, if a credit record splits into multiple records, how are the identifiers for the new records assigned?<br /><br />&bull; The consumer panel would include available information in the consumer's credit file. To maintain consumer privacy, what data fields would have to be anonymized? Please identify the specific data fields that could be made available for analysis.<br /><br />&bull; Are there additional variables associated with the consumer credit file that are not part of a consumer report, but would be available for research (e.g. identity theft flag)? Please identify other raw data fields that the CFPB could consider obtaining as part of the panel.<br /><br />Panel Features: <br /><br />&bull; The CFPB would like to use the consumer credit panel to analyze and survey subpopulations of individual consumers on their use of specific types of products (e.g. private label cards; general purpose branded cards) and product subclasses (e.g., first time home equity loans). How would you recommend developing the panel to permit such surveys? How would you implement such a survey consistent with Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) obligations?<br /><br />&bull; The CFPB is interested in tracking the tradelines of particular consumers over time.<br /><br />o What techniques/technologies are available to enable such tracking?<br />o Can such technologies track accounts after they have been sold (e.g. to a debt buyer) or transferred? If so, how?<br />o Some loans may be reported by multiple reporting entities. These potentially could appear as duplicates on a person's credit record. How would your organization recommend identifying duplicates?<br /><br />&bull; Please describe the categories of consumer non-credit attributes (include specific examples as well) that your organization could attach to the panel.<br /><br />&bull; Can your organization provide a credit score for each consumer in the panel? What specific scores would be available and over what time frame?<br /><br />&bull; What restrictions, if any, exist on the supplying the name of furnishers of specific tradelines? If the identity of a furnisher cannot be provided, is it possible to provide an anonymized indicator that would allow the CFPB to identify trade lines across consumers that are from the same furnisher? What information is available to describe the type of data furnisher?<br /><br />&bull; What information is available to describe the type of tradeline (e.g. industry type, loan type, interest rate, etc.)?<br /><br />&bull; The CFPB plans to supplement this file periodically with additional data sources in accordance with FCRA requirements. These data linkages likely would be conducted by the outside contractor or a third party. Please describe the necessary technical specifications to permit the future linking of this panel with other databases. Does your organization have such a capability?<br /><br />&bull; For any of the strategies recommended in your response, what limitations apply when applying these strategies to the initial 10 year data pull? To historical data in general?<br /><br />Other issues:<br /><br />&bull; Prior Performance: Please provide any example of comparable panels developed by your organization for other institutions.<br /><br />&bull; What type of external resources (e.g. consulting) should the Bureau plan for as it sets up and maintains this consumer panel?<br /><br />For all of the bullet points addressed, please specify whether your particular firm is describing a capability that has already been implemented or whether it is describing one that could be implemented. Please also describe: (a) the standard list price for any data set or service described, if there is a standard commercial list price available, (b) known limitations of the service discussed, (c) whether capabilities are internal or external, (d) and a description of the level of staffing required to implement the activity or service described, <br /><br />In addition to the above, the response should include all of the following:<br /><br />1. Vendor's name, address, point of contact, phone number, and e-mail address;<br />2. Vendor's business size status, including any applicable socio-economic classifications (e.g. HUBZone, SDVOSB, etc.), and its most applicable North American Industry Code System (NAICS) code. <br />3. Whether the vendor has the capability to perform the contemplated work as a prime contractor or a subcontractor, or anticipates significant teaming arrangements; <br />4. Recommendations for how to structure a program to project and measure the costs of building and maintaining a national panel of consumer reporting information.<br /><br />Interested vendors&nbsp;shall respond no later than 2:00 p.m. ET on Wednesday, March 28, 2012. Responses shall&nbsp;sent via e-mail to <a href="mailto:psb3@bpd.treas.gov">psb3@bpd.treas.gov</a>. &nbsp;Subject heading shall&nbsp;state, "Attention: J. Oberlin, Consumer Credit Information Panel".&nbsp; All information in response to this notice must be sent via e-mail in Adobe Acrobat (.pdf) or MSWord format. <br /><br />Note that this is not a request for proposal or quote and does not imply an obligation on the part of the Bureau to purchase services or to proceed to any request for proposals or quotes for such services. Any information provided to the Bureau in response to this Request will become the property of the Bureau and, in addition, may be subject disclosure under a FOIA request.

<DESC><strong>This Pre-Solicitation Notice is for information purposes only. This is not a request for submission of proposals or qualifications. RESPONSES OR OTHER INQUIRIES ARE NOT APPROPRIATE AT THIS TIME.<br /><br />The Defense Medical Materiel Program Office (DMMPO) intends to issue a Request for Incentive Agreement Quotations (RFIAQ) for the standardization of Rehabilitation Knee Braces on or about February 1, 2012, but the actual issue date for this RFIAQ may be delayed up to forty-five (45) business days.<br /></strong>The primary objective of this effort is to standardize the quality of care across the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) and operational assemblages based on the critical balance of clinical efficacy and value. The intent for this initiative is the standardization of a clinically preferred product(s) and source for institutional and operational medicine requirements at the lowest price. It is also intended for this initiative to result in the reduction of Stock Keeping Units (SKUs) and National Stock Numbers (NSN). As an enterprise-wide clinically driven program, vendors and products must meet specific technical requirements, plus products must meet or exceed specific clinical performance expectations as a primary consideration. Among vendors who meet the technical requirements and the products that meet or exceed the clinical acceptability, then clinically preferred, best value will determine selection. It is intended that the selected vendor(s) for this Standardization Action (SA) will support the enterprise goal of medical materiel standardization that combines operational and institutional requirements. <br />Examples of items being solicited could include, but are not limited to, Rehabilitation Knee Braces, latex-free/safe, lightweight material and lightweight construction, with rust proof and well padded metal components, breathable fabric material, adjustable Velcro straps, comprised of washable material that is compatible with readily available household cleaning agents or detergents without decreasing the structural integrity of the brace, and available in sizes from x-small -2x-large, must fit right and left knees, or be universal; and have adjustable incremental range of motion control of flexion and extension, and hinges with stop locks and other items. The estimated value of the resultant Incentive Agreement (IA) will be approximately $578,570 annually. <br />NOTE: This initiative will be part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program which is executed by the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support, Directorate of Medical Materiel and standardized products must be obtained through the Department of Defense (DoD) Prime Vendor (PV) Program. To participate in this Standardization Action (SA) your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the current Med-Surg PV for each MMESO Area of Responsibility (AOR), i.e., Cardinal Health, and Owens &amp; Minor, or be in the process of obtaining a DAPA and a separate commercial agreement with Cardinal Health and Owens &amp; Minor. This requirement is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the standardization initiative and agree to allow PVs to distribute their products. The IA resulting from the solicitation is a supplement to the PV Program and is not a contract. For additional information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program, please access the DLA web site at https://www.medical.dla.mil. <strong>Vendor must update their DAPA numbers for this product line in the DAPA Management System with the country from which each line item is an end product, IAW the Trade Agreements Act. Vendors responding to the solicitation will be required to ensure that all DAPA line items/end products in the subject product line list the proper Trade Agreements Act country.<br /></strong>Detailed information about the requirements and selection process will be provided in the RFIAQ. The purpose of this Pre-Solicitation Notice is to inform qualified entities interested in providing these services that the release of the RFIAQ is imminent. Upon issuance of the RFIAQ, all solicitation information will be available electronically on the Federal Business Opportunities website.&nbsp;<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />The Pre-Solicitation Notice will be replaced with the currently posted RFIAQ:<br />

<DESC>THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. This notice represents award of a modification to the existing contractor National Government Services, Inc. (NGS) under contract number HHSM-500-2008-M0004Z in the amount of $140,836 authorized under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR OFFERS.
<p>The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA, or Recovery Act) (Pub.L. 111-5) was signed into law on February 17,2009. The law includes the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH Act), which established programs to provide incentive payments for the "meaningful use" of certified electronic health record (EHR) technology. Included in these incentive payments (also known as HITECH payments) are payments to Medicare hospitals.</p>
<p>The initial purpose of this initiative was to fund the contractor to collect and subsequently enter necessary data into the HITECH FISS screens for all Subsection (d) Hospitals by March 31, 2011. This initial data was obtained from the 12-month cost report filed at that time. As cost reports are continually accepted during the year, MAC's shall update the data in the FISS within 5 business days of acceptance (for those hospitals that have not yet attested and received their initial payment for that payment year).</p>
<p>The purpose of this modification is to fund the contractor to continue these efforts.</p>
<p>This contract action was not awarded as a fixed price type because uncertainties involved in contract performance did not permit costs to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed price contract. As such, a cost-reimbursement type action was awarded(FAR 16.301-2).</p>

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:<br />Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

The Contractor shall not receive any compensation in addition to this rate for the Prime Contractor's direct labor associated with such changes under this contract.<br />(a) The composite labor hour rate shall represent total compensation for the following:<br />(1) direct labor wages and salaries;<br />(2) all employee benefits including, but not limited to, paid leave, supplemental pay, insurance, retirement, savings, and legally required benefits;<br />(3) other direct costs associated with transit time, delay, disruption, expendable supplies, and equipment;<br />(4) all indirect costs such as overhead and general and administrative expense;<br />(5) any port or association fees, rents, or other levies;<br />(6) profit (fee); and<br />(7) all direct and indirect costs and profit associated with the following support functions:<br />Supervision and Management, Planning and Estimating, Material Handling, Housekeeping, Engineering, Transportation/Drivers, Quality Assurance, Contract Administration, Security, Testing<br />(b) The composite labor hour rate will be applied to production labor hours only. Production labor hours include only those hours necessary and reasonable to perform direct production functions and do not include the hours expended on the support functions listed above. This exclusion of support function hours applies whether such support functions are normally charged directly or indirectly by the Contractor's accounting system. These support functions are to be priced into the composite labor rate quoted and shall not be separately compensated.<br />(c) The Quantity of Composite Labor hours indicated in the Schedule of Supplies/Services, is only an estimate and is an Optional Item pursuant to this solicitation. The Estimated Quantity represents the Government's best estimate of the total number of additional hours that may be required throughout the contract. The Government may elect to exceed this value at the prices stated in the schedule and its discretion during performance of the contract. The inclusion of this item does not obligate the Government to exercise the item nor entitle the Contractor to compensation if not exercised.<br />(16) MAINTAINING, REPORTING, AND DISPOSING OF GOVERNMENT PROPERTY IN THE PERFORMANCE OF A SHIP REPAIR CONTRACT <br />1. The Government Property Clause incorporated by reference delineates the Contractor's overall responsibility when taking possession of government property in performance of a contract. In performance of this contract the Contractor will be required to properly identify, track and control property within its possession. This includes, a) property furnished by the government (GFP) to the Contractor in conjunction with specific CLIN Items. These items and their values are listed in the specification, b) property that is pre-existing in a location that during the course of performance will be replaced or renewed. <br />2. The items listed in the specification, as government furnished property will be provided in the quantities designated. Government furnished property may be provided in person by an official Coast Guard employee, shipment via commercial carrier, etc. The Contractor shall sign for all government furnished property using either a DD Form 1149, entitled, "Requisition and Invoice/Shipping Document" or a DD Form 1348, entitled, "Issue Release/Receipt Document". A copy of the DD 1149 or DD 1348 must be sent within 48 hours of receipt of property, to the designated Government Property Administrator. The name of the individual assigned as Property Administrator will be furnished to the Contractor at time of award. The Contractor shall not take receipt of property that is not listed in the specification, has not been previously identified as becoming part of the contract (via contract modification) or which otherwise cannot be identified. Such irregularities shall be immediately reported to the Property Administrator. <br />3. The Contractor shall complete the report provided herein, entitled, "Government Property Report". This report is intended as a living document whereby relevant fields shall be filled in, maintained and kept current at all times. All property described in paragraph 1 (a and b) above shall be reported on the report. At contract completion the Contractor and the Property Administrator shall ensure that all fields are appropriately completed. A signature block is provided at the end of the report for both parties to attest to the report's accuracy and completeness. The Government Property Report shall clearly delineate the complete track that all Government property took over the course of the contract. This completed report must accompany the Contractor's final invoice. Final payment may be delayed, without penalty of interest, until such time as the report is received. A separate copy of the completed report and any final DD 1149s or DD 1348s executed, as a result of carrying out disposition instructions shall be provided to the Property Administrator.<br />4. Pursuant to the Government Property Clause the authority to render disposition instructions of Government property associated with this contract is delegated to the Property Administrator. The Contractor shall comply with all instructions in the contract for the return of government property to the Coast Guard. This includes government property taken off the vessel (shafts, propellers, etc.), government property returned to the vessel (special tools, etc.) or surplus government property not used during performance of the contract.<br />(17) CONTRACTING OFFICER'S AUTHORITY<br />No oral or written statement of any person other than the Contracting Officer will in any manner or degree modify or otherwise affect the terms of this contract. The Contracting Officer is the only person authorized to approve changes in any of the requirements under this contract, and, notwithstanding any provisions contained elsewhere in this contract, said authority remains solely with the Contracting Officer. In the event the Contractor effects any such change at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract price to cover any increase in cost incurred as a result thereof.<br />(18) CONTRACTOR PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT REPORT (CPAR)<br />(a) GENERAL: The U.S. Coast Guard Surface Forces Logistic Center (SFLC) will monitor and evaluate the successful offeror's past performance of this contract and prepare a Contractor Performance Assessment Report System (CPARS) in accordance with FAR Part 42.15. All information contained in this assessment may be used, within the limitations of FAR 42.15, by the government for future source selections and in accordance with FAR 15.304, when past performance is an evaluation factor for award. <br />(b) NOTIFICATION: Upon completion of the contract, the contractor will be notified of the assessment. The contractor will be allowed 30 days to respond to the SLFC's assessment of its performance entered into CPARS. The contractor's response, if any, will be made part of the CPAR system. <br />(c) INFORMATION: Information included in the CPARS may include, but is not limited to, the contractor's record of conforming to contract requirements and to standards of good workmanship; the contractor's record of forecasting and controlling costs; the contractor's adherence to contract schedules, including the administrative aspects of performance; the contractor's history of reasonable and cooperative behavior and commitment to customer satisfaction; the contractor's record of integrity and business ethics, and generally, the contractor's business-like concern for the interest of the customer.<br />(d) RELEASE OF DATA: CPARS information is considered business sensitive and will not be released except: (1) to other Federal procurement activities which request it; (2) when SFLC must release pursuant to a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request; or (3) when prior written consent is requested and obtained from the contractor.<br />(19) METHOD OF PAYMENT AND INVOICING INSTRUCTIONS FOR SHIP REPAIR <br />The Government will make payment under this contract based on a percentage or stage of completion. The Contractor may invoice each contract line item (CLIN) as work progresses. The amount invoiced shall be calculated based on those prices stipulated in the contract Schedule of Supplies/Services as follows:<br />A CLIN may not be invoiced until the percentage complete reaches 25 percent. Future invoices for that CLIN have no limitation as to the percentage of completion required before invoicing. (The minimum percentage of completion (25%) to be reached prior to billing each CLIN may be waived by the Contracting Officer on a case by case basis for large dollar CLINS.)<br />Invoices submitted by the Contractor which are deemed not proper, in accordance with FAR clause, 52.212-4 will be returned. Invoices shall include (see the clause for a full summation of invoice requirements): <br />Name and Address of the Contractor;<br />Invoice date<br />Contract Number/Modification No.<br />Description, quantity, unit of measure, unit price and extended price;<br />Shipping and Payment Terms;<br />Name and Address of Contractor official to whom payment is to be sent;<br />Name, title, phone number, and mailing address of person to be notified in the event of a defective invoice.<br />The invoice must include:<br />a) The percentage of completion for each CLIN identified;<br />b) Name of the Contracting Officer;<br />c) Vessel name; and,<br />d) The overall percentage and dollar amount previously billed, currently billed and unbilled,<br />e) The Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number.<br />The Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number is the primary identifier in Central Contractor Registration (CCR), (see FAR 52.232-33, Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer - Central Contractor Registration (OCT 2003)). Contractors are located and identified in CCR by their DUNS number. Therefore, to facilitate payment, the DUNS number shall be recorded on every invoice submitted to the U.S. Coast Guard.<br />All payments for partial performance rendered by the Government under this contract are based on the assumption that the Contractor will, in good faith, execute and honor all payment terms entered into between it, the Prime Contractor, and any subcontractor thereof in the performance of this contract. The Contractor hereby acknowledges the Government's right to reduce or suspend progress payments based on non-payment in accordance with any payment terms of the subcontract agreement.<br />Any amount deemed not payable will be deducted from the Contractor's invoice. Deducted amounts may be resubmitted on the next invoice for reconsideration.<br />Additional work verbally agreed to by the parties that has not yet been incorporated into the contract by modification shall not be included in an invoice. Payments will not be made for any work to which a modification has not been properly executed. Invoices submitted for payment that includes such a request will be reduced by the unmodified amount. <br />All items of work invoiced under this contract will be verified by the designated billing office and confirmed by the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR) as accurate and complete. <br />Once the Invoice is signed by the COTR, it may be submitted for payment in one of the three options listed below:<br />1. Faxed to 757-628-4628<br />2. Submitted via Email to: Andrew.J.Northcutt@uscg.mil<br />3. Mailed to:<br />U. S.

The Contractor shall respond in writing within 24 hours of receipt, unless otherwise approved by the Contracting Officer, to the COTR. The COTR will comment on the Contractor's response and will forward the Deficiency Report and comments to the Contracting Officer, with a copy to the Contractor, the PBPL Availability Project Manager, and the NESU.
