Provide all labor and materials for completion of design and construction of Utility Systems Separation at three Federal Buildings in Albuquerque, NM.  Project entails severing two existing Federal Buildings from existing hot water/chilled water and utility central plant at a third Federal Building. Both buildings will be converted to complete stand-alone utility and mechanical systems.  Project will include installation of new chillers, boilers, cooling towers, pumps, domestic hot water heaters, and controls.  Project will also include tie-in, re-routing, and demolition of existing mechanical, electrical, and communications systems as required to make buildings independent.  GSA will provide documentation depicting the existing building conditions for this project.  The project will be designed and constructed in soft Metric units.  The Guaranteed Maximum Price cost range for this project is $3,000,000 - $5,000,000 including design and construction.  The scope of design/build services may require, but is not limited to: construction drawings, specifications, cost estimates, Value Engineering services, computer aided design and drafting (CADD), project scheduling, submittal preparation, construction quality control, construction, preparation of as-builts, post construction services, and commissioning.  The design will include consideration for sustainable design features including LEED certification and EPACT 2005 compliance.  The work will require coordination with the GSA Property Manager, Construction Manager, Building Tenants, and other Government Contractors.  Capabilities to sequence and schedule the work and quality control for the design and construction efforts are required.  The existing facilities must remain operational during business hours throughout this project.  It will be the responsibility of the Offeror to: design this project and achieve construction in budget; construct the new facility; complete the design and construction (including Commissioning) within 36 months of Notice to Proceed.

This acquisition will implement a Two-Stage Design-Build Source Selection Process.  The Stage One Request for Qualification (RFQ) will identify those firms which are the most highly qualified.  A maximum of five (5) firms will be selected for consideration for the Stage Two Request for Proposal (RFP).  The short list will be based on the firm?s submittals in response to the Stage One RFQ.  The Stage Two RFP submission will be the basis for the final selection.  Those firms included in Stage Two will be required to prepare fully developed technical and price proposals.  Stage Two firms will be provided pertinent information regarding the design and programming requirements.  The names of the offerors selected to participate in Stage Two will be published in FedBizOpps.  The offerors selected to participate in Stage Two will be notified of the submittal requirements for Stage Two.  

Offerors can be partnership, corporation, association, and /or other legal entity which will have contractual responsibility for the project.  A proposed joint venture must provide profiles for all firms in the joint venture.  

A Pre-proposal Conference will be held during Stage Two.  A time and location for this Conference will be advertised in a forthcoming FedBizOps announcement. 

 The source selection technical evaluation factors for Stage One are listed in descending order of importance as follows: Offeror?s Past performance on Similar Projects; Offeror?s Experience on similar projects; Experience and Past Performance of Key Personnel; Management Approach.  It is not essential that the proposed design build team members have completed work together previously; however the submittal should demonstrate the ability of the component firms to form an effective and efficient team. 

Stage Two will require submission of technical and price proposals.   Proposals will be evaluated on the basis of best value to the Government.  Factors will include price, technical merit, and lifecycle energy cost.  In addition, a bid guarantee in the amount of 20% of the offer will be required of offerors participating in the Stage Two competition.  The successful Offeror will be required to provide the maximum practicable subcontracting opportunities for small business concerns, small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, woman owned small business, service disabled veteran-owned business, and HUBZone small business concerns to participate in this contract.  Stage Two offerors will be required to submit a subcontracting plan with their proposal. (Small businesses are not subject to this requirement.) 

This procurement is unrestricted.  All responsible firms are invited to submit a proposal to the Stage One Request for Qualification (RFQ).  Firms interested in receiving the RFQ should submit a letter of interest by e-mail to kathey.thury@gsa.gov or FAX at (817) 978-7017, Attn: Kathey Thury, Contracting Officer.  This request shall include the company?s name, DUNS number, Tax ID # mailing address, phone number and E-mail address.  The company will then be required to review, complete and return the Document Security Notice (DSN) and a copy of their business license or comparable to the POC.    If your firm responded to the sources sought the POC will be e-mailing you the DSN within the next seven calendar days.  The RFQ is expected to be issued on or about November 21, 2006 to all accepted firms who have submitted the information above.    Closing date and time for submittal of the RFQ is December 15, 2006 at 3:00pm, CST.  Questions shall be received in writing by email or FAX to the POC until 3:00pm, CST, December 5, 2006.

<DESC>The Marine Corps Systems Command desires to negotiate and award a sole-source contract modification with the Holden Industries, Inc, an industrial trailer manufacturer, pursuant to FAR 6.302-1.  The current Marine Corps Direct Support Electrical System Test Set (DSESTS) utilizes a fixed expansible van permanently mounted on a 5-Ton series truck.  The Marine Corps phased out all 5-Ton series trucks, including the M934A1 Expansible Van. Without a replacement, commanders will not have the capability to provide a suitable deployed maintenance facility to conduct diagnosis and repair of M1A1 Tank components.  The truck phase-out coupled with the degraded condition of the attached expandable van necessitates a replacement.  The replacement units will consist of a separable truck/shelter configuration that is fully deployable mounted upon a modified Engineering Equipment Trailer (EET).  The contract is for the final version of the Holden chassis trailer testing unit developed!   for the Marine Corps.   The period of performance is 60 after date of contract, with an estimated cost not to exceed $25K.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  No formal solicitation package is available.  The Government will not be responsible for any cost incurred in responding to this notice, and all responses must be received within fifteen (15) days of this posting.  Only e-mail inquiries will be accepted—no telephonic communications.  See Note 22.

<DESC>ARC is requesting a continuation of testing services and reports to support NASA's Orion Aerosciences Project. These tests are required to provide real gas heat transfer and aerodynamic data for the Orion flight aerothermodynamic database. The data will also be used to validate the CFD codes used to generate the flight databases. This is a continuation of testing activities currently performed under contract NNA06BA17P with the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) of Pasadena, CA.  Currently, laminar heat transfer data is being obtained in Caltech’s T5 shock tunnel facility. There is a need to obtain corresponding turbulent heat transfer data from the same facility in order to determine the amount of heat transfer augmentation due to turbulence.  The services requested are: 1) Perform at least 50 tests on a scale model of at least 6" in diameter in a high enthalpy (between 10 and 20 MJ/kg) flow field with a range of reservoir pressures between 20 and 70 MPa. Vendor is required to build a model of blunt-body geometry similar to the Apollo capsule. The exact geometry for the model will be provided by the Government after award is made; 2) Provide heat transfer data with uncertainty estimates for the range of enthalpies and Reynolds numbers above at a minimum of 50 locations on the model; 3) Provide aerodynamic force and moment measurements for the range of enthalpies and Reynolds numbers above; 4) Provide expert analysis assessing turbulent transition; 5) Include error bars and uncertainty estimates in the reports; and 6) Provide access to the facility, and insight into data collection procedures and data reduction processes during testing, including access to all raw data traces.  All work must be complete and the final report delivered by September 15, 2007.	 NASA/ARC intends to modify the current contract for testing and analysis services with the California Institute of Technology. Caltech’s T5 shock tunnel facility and testing and analysis team has the capability to meet all of the test requirements. The research team, under Professor Hans Hornung, has a great deal of expertise in the field of hypersonics and high enthalpy test facilities. Caltech's T5 shock tunnel has produced high quality heat transfer data for a range of Department of Defense, NASA, and industrial customers for over 15 years. The authority for other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(a)(1) "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements." Based on NASA's market survey, Caltech is the only source capable of fulfilling the requirements, given the schedule constraints and the need for close coordination with ARC. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on November 13, 2006.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

Full and open competition is impractical for the following reasons:  •	The Q800 DMA will become a part of a suite of TA Instruments modular thermal analysis instruments (Q1000 DSC; SDT 2960; MDSC 2920, TGA 2950, TMA 2940) with a personal computer based data acquisition system that currently operates at KSC.	 •	Referenced equipment is essential to the Government's requirements, thereby precluding consideration of a product manufactured by another company. •	The specific manufacturer and part numbers are required to integrate with the current system. Failure to purchase these specific items may result in operational incompatibility that would impact performance of the system.  •	A DMA from another source would be incompatible with the current data acquisition system and accessories that the Government already owns.  •	Accessories with the obsolete DMA that is being replaced are not themselves obsolete and may be used with the new Q800 DMA, offering retention of capability at no cost to the government. •	The new and obsolete DMA share similar operating characteristics and procedures, greatly reducing training requirements. The Government intends to acquire these commercial items using FAR part 12, and 13 or a combination thereof. Interested organizations may submit, in writing, their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort, to the identified point of contact, no later than 4:30 pm ET on November 15, 2006.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541620   U.S. Environmental Protection Agency - National Decontamination Team (NDT) BACKGROUND The National Decontamination Team (NDT) delivers on-site scientific and technical expertise in response to Incidence of National Significance involving environmental contamination and  acts of terrorism related to Weapons of Mass Destruction.  We provide leadership and coordination of decontamination policy, science, and engineering, bridging gaps between research and response.  NDT promotes decontamination readiness through training, exercises, and planning. The NDT joins the  force of Special Teams available to support On-Scene Coordinators.   Located in Cincinnati, Ohio, NDT is dedicated to providing decontamination expertise, especially related to chemical, biological, and radiological contaminants that can be used as Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD).  The team  provides scientific support and technical expertise for decontamination of  buildings, building contents,  public infrastructure (including waste/drinking water plants, chemical plants, power plants, food processing facilities and subways), agriculture, and associated environmental media (air, soil  and water). Working closely with EPA's Environmental Response Team (ERT) and the National Homeland Security Research Center (NHSRC), the NDT identifies research needs and bridges the gap between research and application of newly developed field tools. LOCATION The NDT is located in Cincinnati, OH.   The contractor services would be required at emergency response sites. PURPOSE The purpose of this request for information is to determine potential emergency response support sources by acquiring capability statements for the following: contractors that specialize in technologies/methods to  decontaminate/treat chemical, biological, and radiological, contamination for use in the aftermath of Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) or an Incident of National Significance (INS).   CAPABILITY STATEMENT A submission from potential emergency response support sources in the form of a capability  statement is requested.  Submissions should clearly document the capability to provide technologies/methods for the decontamination/treatment of chemical, biological and/or radiological agents indoors and outdoors on all types of media (water, soil, concrete, non-porous surfaces, electronics, etc.)  and structures (monuments, buildings, subways, airplanes, airports, etc.).  The technologies/methods shall have the ability to decontaminate WMDs such as, but not limited to, Sarin, Ricin, Anthrax, Smallpox, Pandemic/Avian Flu, VX, dirty bombs or Sulfur Mustard.  This list is not all inclusive.   Contractors may submit decontamination technologies/methods for CBRN agents they specialize in that are not mentioned above.  The contractor shall include the type of agent their technology/expertise will decontaminate and their capability of responding to single or multiple incidents.   The  statement shall be no longer than 10 pages in length, shall explain the decontamination technology and the agent(s) to which the technology is applicable to, and state any real world applications that have proven the technology.  OBJECTIVE The objective of this RFI is to obtain capability  statements, based upon the requirements outlined above, from all (large and small) businesses interested in this possible opportunity.  Respondents should identify any information they consider sensitive or proprietary.  All interested businesses are hereby invited to submit a capabilities  statement of no more than 10 pages to demonstrate their ability to provide the services outlined above.

<CONTACT>Point of Contact, John Southerland, Purchasing Agent, Phone (919) 541-3416
<DESC>NAICS Code: 541710   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) has a requirement to conduct analyses across several children's cohort studies by pooling relevant data.  Data will be compiled from a number of different studies performed by different organizations.  Because of differences in the data collection protocols and database formats, it will be necessary for a central organization to work with individual researchers to compile data in a systematic manner so that cross-study analyses can be performed.   This action is being pursued on a sole source basis.  The  Health and Environmental Sciences Institute (HESI) is the only organization likely to successfully perform the work in a timely manner.  HESI has established a strong group of interdisciplinary, multi-sector scientists that possess biomonitoring data that is required to meet the requirements of  this procurement.  Furthermore, they are uniquely qualified to work collaboratively with the diverse research organizations that have collected and retain the relevant data.  NAICS Code 541511 applies with a small business size standard of 500 employees.  The intent of this notice is to determine  if any other sources(s) exist, and therefore, no solicitation (RFQ) is available.   Consequently, any response failing to provide the aforementioned data and instead choosing to merely submit a routine letter requesting a copy of the RFQ will be ignored.  Interested parties who can meet the above  requirements may submit written qualification statements, fully explaining their capability no later than 15 days after the date of this publication.  Submit response to the U.S. EPA, Attn: John Southerland Jr (MC-E105-02), RTP Procurement Operations Division, Research Triangle Park, NC 27711.

<DESC>The Social Security Administration (SSA) is responsible for two national disability programs, Social Security Disability Insurance (DI) and Supplemental Security Income (SSI).  SSA uses a five-step sequential process for evaluating the disability claim submitted by an individual who alleges an inability to perform substantial gainful activity (SGA).  A medical basis for the disability claim is required, and the State disability determination services (DDS) collect and evaluate the medical information, making a determination about the severity of the medical and/or psychiatric impairment as it relates to the claimant?s ability to perform SGA.  SSA has begun to gradually roll out a new Disability Service Improvement (DSI) process which is designed to improve SSA?s disability determination process.  As part of the new DSI process, claimants who are initially denied disability benefits may choose to appeal their denial to a Federal Reviewing Official (FedRO). An individual who receives an unfavorable decision from the FedRO may request a hearing before an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ).  While many disability impairments may be properly evaluated by medical generalists, claims that involve difficult or complex issues require medical and/or psychiatric specialist and sub-specialist expertise.  

The Medical Expert contract will obtain the services of experienced, licensed and board certified Medical Experts and Psychiatric Experts who will be available to analyze and provide expert advice related to their specialized field of medicine as needed so that adjudicators can render accurate determinations and decisions.  It is anticipated that this competition will result in the award of one or more Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) type contracts with provisions for the issuance of Firm Fixed Price (FFP) task orders.  The IDIQ period of performance will be for a base period of one year with four one year option periods.    

This acquisition will be conducted in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, and FAR Part 15, Contracting by Negotiation.  This is an unrestricted requirement where proposals from all responsible sources will be considered by the Agency.  Any additional information and documents on this requirement will be posted to FedBizOpps (www.fedbizopps.gov).  Potential Offerors shall be responsible for monitoring the FedBizOpps site for release of this solicitation, amendments and all other documents relative to this solicitation.  Requests for hard copies will not be honored.  Prospective contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) https://www.bpn.gov/CCR/scripts/index.html  database prior to award of any contract.  SSA anticipates release of the solicitation (SSA-RFP-07-1008) on or about November 15, 2006 with responses due within twenty-one (21) calendar days (three weeks) after date of issuance unless otherwise amended.  Interested parties must respond to the solicitation in order to be considered for award of any resultant contract.  All questions must be submitted in writing via e-mail to Melinda.lewis@ssa.gov.  NO PHONE CALLS WILL BE ACCEPTED.  E-mail communications shall include company name, address, point of contact, e-mail address, phone and fax numbers.

The Interested Vendors List (IVL) has been enabled for this solicitation.  Vendors are encouraged to register their interest in this solicitation.  Using the IVL will:  1) Provide interested parties with automatic notice of solicitation amendments; 2) Provide information to the Contract Specialist; and 3) Enable the Contract Specialist to publish a listing of the interested vendors through FedBizOpps to facilitate vendor collaboration for subcontracting opportunities, etc.  No other listing of interested vendors will be created or be available for release.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>Explanation for Extending the Due Date for the Submission of Pre-Applications for Loan Guarantees for Innovative Technologies Under Title XVII of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 Under Solicitation Number DE-PS01-06LG00001A Dated August 8, 2006, from November 6, 2006 to December 31, 2006. The Department of Energy (DOE) is extending the due date for Pre-Applications under Solicitation Number DE-PS01-06LG00001 from November 6, 2006, to December 31, 2006, to provide interested parties more time to develop and submit Pre-Applications for loan guarantees to be considered under this solicitation. DOE is extending the time period for interested persons to submit Pre-Applications because of the extensive interest throughout the United States that has been expressed in the new loan guarantee program and in this solicitation.  DOE believes the public interest will be served by affording the numerous parties that have expressed interest in this program additional time to consider whether and how they wish to participate in it.  An extension of the deadline also will permit interested parties, some of whom have requested a deadline extension, additional time to develop plans and prepare materials for submission to DOE in response to the solicitation. Any Project Sponsor that already has filed a Pre-Application with DOE pursuant to this Solicitation may amend, supplement or revise that Pre-Application on or before December 31, 2006.

The Bureau of Public Debt (BPD), on behalf of the National Science Foundation, is assessing the market to gain information about the procurement of a audit services.  This notice is not a solicitation, but an inquiry regarding the capabilities of audit services  providers and a request for information from offerors who are willing and capable of providing a presentation regarding audits.  We are seeking information to expand our contractor base and determine type of companies available to fulfill our requirements.



SOURCES SOUGHT
REQUEST FOR INFORMATION

BACKGROUND

The National Science Foundation (NSF) is an independent Federal agency created by the National Science Foundation Act of 1950 (P.L. 810 507).  Its goal is to promote and advance scientific progress in the United States.  The agency is responsible for the overall health of science and engineering across all disciplines.  The Foundation is also committed to ensuring an adequate supply of the Nation's scientists, engineers and science educators.  NSF funds research and education in science and engineering by awarding grants and contracts to educational and research institutions in all parts of the United States.  NSF, by law, cannot conduct research or operate research facilities.  Through grants, cooperative agreements, and contracts, NSF enters into relationships with non-Federal organizations to fund research and education initiatives.  

Federal agencies, including NSF, have an independent Office of Inspector General that is authorized by law with recommending policies and practices designed to promote economy, efficiency, and effectiveness; and conduct audits and investigations to prevent and detect fraud, waste, and abuse.  In support of the NSF mission,?? the NSF-OIG conducts independent and objective audits, investigations, and other reviews by promoting the economy, efficiency, and effectiveness and safeguarding the integrity of NSF programs and operations.  One of the ways that the NSF-OIG provides its support is by ensuring awardee?? compliance with NSF?s and Federal regulations concerning award administration and management.

Each year, the NSF-OIG conducts approximately 25 audits to determine whether awardees are in compliance with the financial and administrative terms and conditions of their award agreement.  These audits include grants, contracts, and cooperative agreements that are funded by NSF and awarded to (1) educational institutions, (2) state, local, and Federally-recognized Indian tribal governments, (3) hospitals, (4) non-profit organizations, and (5) for-profit organizations.  These financial audits include incurred costs, indirect cost rates, pre-award proposals, and other specialty audits, such as reviews of cost sharing and participant support costs.

Approximately 66 percent of the NSF-OIG?s audit work is performed by Contractors and is monitored by NSF-OIG staff.  These audit reports include findings and recommendations, which are monitored for audit resolution by the NSF Cost Analysis and Audit Resolution Branch (CAAR) of the Division of Institution & Award Support (DIAS).  DIAS also monitors the resolution of Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-133 Audit Reports that were issued by other Contractors on awardees for which NSF is the cognizant agency as well as for awardees whose cognizant agency is not the NSF, but where NSF contributed substantial funds.

SCOPE & METHODOLOGY

The Contractor shall address the following four phases of the audit individually.  The first phase will be to draft a planning document on the survey and internal control fieldwork, the second phase will be to conduct the survey and internal control fieldwork as well as to prepare the survey and internal control assessment report, the third phase will be to conduct substantive audit fieldwork, and the fourth phase will be to prepare the final audit report.  

The financial audit objectives of the audits include determining whether the costs claimed by an awardee are allowable and in conformity with the terms and conditions of the NSF award and Federal requirements.  These financial audits also report on the awardee?s compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and award terms and conditions, and the adequacy of the awardee?s internal control system for effectively accounting for and administering its NSF awards.

Specific objectives of the audit of NSF funds are to:  

Determine whether the Schedule of Award Costs of the awardee presents fairly, in all material respects, the costs claimed on the Federal Cash Transactions Reports (FCTR) in conformity with NSF-OIG?s Financial Audit Guide and the terms and conditions of the NSF award.

Identify matters concerning instances of noncompliance with laws, regulations, and the provisions of the award agreement(s) pertaining to NSF awards and weaknesses in the awardee?s internal control over financial reporting that could have a direct and material effect on the Schedule of Award Costs and the awardee?s ability to properly administer, account for, and monitor its NSF awards. 

REQUIREMENTS of AUDIT

The Contractor shall conduct the audit in accordance with the most current version of the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Generally Accepted Government Auditing Standards (GAGAS) issued by the Comptroller General of the United States.  (To download a copy of the standards, go to: www.GAO.gov.)  

Government Auditing Standards (GAS) incorporates by reference the field work and the reporting standards issued by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA).    Accordingly, the Statement on Auditing Standards (SAS) is part of Government Auditing Standards and must be adhered to where applicable.  Workpapers and audit plans need to make appropriate reference to these standards to provide documentation on their compliance.  

The new audit risk standards are addressed in SAS 104 through 111 and should be incorporated into these audits in order to address assessed risk and the auditor?s response to audit risk and materiality.  The auditor must have a clear understanding of SAS 99 and be able to document and discuss with OIG staff how this standard was met.  Although some of the SAS?s are effective December 15, 2006, we are highly recommending early implementation.

It is important to understand that these audits are not audits of financial statements as they relate to the financial position of an entity nor are they Single Audits under OMB Circular A-133. They are financial audits as they relate to SAS 62 which is incorporated into GAS

In addition to a clear understanding of GAGAS and all the applicable SAS requirements, the Contractor should have a clear understanding of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circulars applicable to the various organizations being audited.  Additionally, the Contractor should have experience and knowledge on the applicable requirements of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). The Contractor should also have experience auditing non-profit organizations.

The Contractor must comply with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) Guidance on GAGAS Requirements for Continuing Professional Education (CPE), which was issued on April 2005.  

The internal control assessments require a complete understanding of The Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) framework (see SAS 55 and SAS 112). The internal control assessment requires a COSO based approach to the assessment of awardee?s internal controls.

The Contractor must be an audit firm registered with the State Board of Accountancy.  Additionally, we consider the Partner, Sr. Audit Manager, and the Manager to be key personnel.  Their appropriate resumes are required as part of any proposal submission.  Additionally, as part of the proposal submission, the latest peer review report is required.

The Contractor must have the technical capability to express an audit opinion on the results of audit.  

Our audits are divided into four phases: 

PHASE 1 (Planning)
 
Survey and Internal Control Audit Planning Document:
 
The planning document shall include the Contractor?s planned audit approach including the proposed audit program and sampling methodology for performing the audit survey, gaining an understanding of awardee?s policies and procedures and financial systems for administering its NSF awards, identifying risks in the awardee?s operations for effectively administering its NSF awards, and testing significant internal controls to determine whether those controls are operating effectively to mitigate the identified risk.
 
The Contractor shall provide the proposed planning document to NSF-OIG for review at least one week before the scheduled planning story-conference meeting and the final planning document to NSF-OIG before the start of the on-site survey and internal control assessment site visit.

PHASE 2 (Internal Control)
	
Survey and Internal Control Assessment Report
 
The Survey and Internal Control Assessment Report shall include a summary of the results of the audit survey, assessment of prior audits, including OMB A-133 audit results and their impact, if any, on the scope of the audit, and testing of significant internal controls, including a brief description (i.e., flowcharts, bullets, etc.) of the awardee?s systems for:
 
?	Financial accounting and reporting on NSF award expenditures;
 
?	Accounting and reporting on cost-sharing obligations;

?	Property accountability;
 
?	Sub-recipient monitoring; and
 
?	Ensuring NSF awards are properly administered, accounted for, and monitored in compliance with NSF and Federal requirements.
 
The report shall also include the Contractor's assessment of the risk that the awardee?s systems are not meeting Federal regulations and NSF grant terms and conditions for claiming allowable, reasonable, and allocable costs.  The report shall identify early indications of where there may be instances of noncompliance, weaknesses in internal controls, areas of questioned costs, and non-accomplishment of program award objectives.  
 
The survey and internal control assessment report is not expected to be a comprehensive explanation of each of the areas reviewed, but rather a summary of what was reviewed and assessed and the overall conclusions on the adequacy of the awardee?s financial controls over NSF awards.  The report shall provide a firm justification for continuance or discontinuance of the audit based on the audit results from the survey and internal control assessment.  
 
Should the decision be made to end the audit at the end of the internal controls survey (phase 2), the information obtained by the Contractor as a result of conducting its internal control work at the auditee shall be delineated in the Survey and Internal Control Assessment Report. 
   
Preliminary Notification of Findings (NOFs) form

Based on the results of the survey and internal control assessment, NOFs should be initiated to document the preliminary instances of noncompliance, and weaknesses in internal controls, and potential areas of questioned costs.  At this stage, the NOFs may only identify a potential condition and the associated criteria.  Preliminary NOFs shall be provided to NSF-OIG one week before the survey and internal control assessment story conference meeting.  The findings shall be presented identifying the criteria, condition, cause, and effect.

Substantive testing planning document (if continuance of the audit is warranted)
 
Prior to the survey and internal control assessment story-conference, the Contractor shall also submit to NSF-OIG for review a substantive testing planning document, if a full audit is warranted as a result of the survey and internal control assessment.  At a minimum, this document shall include the proposed audit program including sections on tests of compliance with applicable laws and regulations, and substantive testing procedures to determine whether costs charged to the NSF award(s) by the awardee are allowable, allocable, and reasonable in accordance with applicable Federal cost principles and award terms and conditions.  This substantive testing plan shall consider the results of the survey and internal control assessment.  It shall provide a clear link between the Contractor?s conclusions on the level of risk in the awardee?s financial and compliance systems and the amount and kind of substantive testing work to be performed. 
 
The Contractor shall provide the draft substantive testing planning document to NSF-OIG at least one week before the scheduled survey and internal control assessment story-conference meeting at NSF headquarters and the final substantive testing planning document to NSF-OIG prior to beginning the fieldwork.

OPTIONAL PHASES:

PHASE 3 (Field Work) 

Completed Notifications of Findings

Based on the results of fieldwork in Phases 2 and 3, this document shall detail the final condition, criteria, cause, effect, and recommendations of each finding identified.  Detailed NOFs shall be provided to the NSF-OIG one week before the scheduled fieldwork story conference meeting at NSF headquarters.

Format for Audit Report

The Contractor shall provide all Notification of Findings to NSF-OIG one week before the fieldwork verification story-conference.  The Notification of Findings should include the condition, criteria, cause, effect and recommendation for each finding identified during the audit.  The purpose of the fieldwork verification story-conference is for NSF-OIG and the contractor to discuss and agree on the results of the substantive testing and the audit findings and to assess whether all audit work is completed.  NSF-OIG and the contractor shall also agree on the significance of each finding and its classification as a noncompliance, reportable condition, and/or a material weakness.

PHASE 4 (Reporting)

Draft Independent Auditor?s Report on Financial Schedules and Independent Auditor?s Report on Compliance with Laws and Regulations And Internal Controls over Financial Reporting 

After completion of the fieldwork verification story-conference, the contractor shall prepare a proposed outline and report format for the draft audit report.  The outline and report format shall be provided to NSF-OIG one week prior to the scheduled reporting story-conference meeting.   The purpose of the reporting story conference is for NSF-OIG and the contractor to agree on the layout of the report.  They will discuss and agree on the significance of each finding and its proper order of presentation in the audit report such that the significance and the impact of each finding will be clear to all readers and stakeholders in the audit.  Upon completion of the reporting story-conference, the contractor shall provide a draft audit report to NSF-OIG within 3 weeks of the report story-conference.  

Final Independent Auditor?s Report on Financial Schedules and Independent Auditor?s Report on Compliance with Laws and Regulations and Internal Controls over Financial Reporting

The final audit report shall include the awardee?s response to the report findings and recommendations.  The final report shall summarize after each recommendation the awardee?s response and the Contractor?s comments, indicating changes the Contractor made to the report language or disagreement with the awardee response.  The awardee?s official response in its entirety shall be attached to the final report.

<DESC>The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Washington DC, is seeking sources who can provide gift baskets for select new OCC employees.  Approximately 100 baskets are required every 6 months.  Currently, there is very little latitude in how the end product looks as they are assembled according to very detailed OCC specifications (only some of which are included herein).  The OCC may be open to suggested changes, but this sources sought is for sources who can comply with the following:

This requirement is separated into three phases after an order is placed.  Orders are usually placed about 6 weeks in advance of the required final ship date of the baskets.

1. OCC Items.   First, there are five items that are labeled, lettered, or  have the OCC logo on them (or some variation on that theme):  a silver finish calendar writing pen with flashlight; executive leather business card case; a leather luggage tag; and a t-shirt that has been compressed and shrink wrapped into a 5? round disk approximately 2? to 3? high; and a medium size thermos in a leather pouch.  The OCC has very detailed specifications for these items including for 4 of them the catalog (different items appear in different catalogs) in which they appear.  The contractor would order these items from  various sources with delivery to the contractor in time for the contractor to use them in assembling the baskets. Proofs of each item are required to be sent to the OCC on the first order and any subsequent order if anything changes.

2.  Baskets.  Second, the contractor provides the basket:  quality tan wicker approximately 15? wide (from below one handle to below the other handle), 12? back to front, and 3 ?? deep.  The contractor provides the following:
1 container Emerald Nuts 7 oz; 2 Standup pouches McDuffies Scottish Shortbread 5 oz each;
1 Box Guylian ? 6 pc. Chocolate box ? 2.3oz; 1 box Radimaker chocolate mint sticks 2.64 oz; 1 container Black Mountain Kona Coffee ? 1.4oz; 1 Box brent & Sams White Chocolate macadeamia cookies 7 oz.  Any substitutions to the above require advance written approval from the OCC.  The baskets are lined with unprinted newspaper and a tasteful tan colored crinkle shred. The contractor inserts a ?welcome? note provided by the OCC.  The entire basket is shrink wrapped (plastic sealed with heat) and placed in a box for shipping.  A sample basket is required to be sent to the OCC on the first order, and a sample of anything of substance that changes (such as the basket) on subsequent orders.

3.  Shipping.  The order will establish a date by which all the baskets must be shipped by courier (ground shipment) by the contractor in order to reach the recipients (locations all over the continental US) when desired by the OCC.  The OCC will provide a list of consignees and addresses to the contractor just prior to when shipping must commence (it does not
know this information at the time the order is placed).

The OCC intends to establish a source list of three high quality contractors and compete the requirements for baskets each time it has a requirement.  The evaluated price of the basket would be everything (including the box) except the actual costs of shipping which will be done on a not to exceed basis of approximately $10.00 per basket (or whatever isreasonable).

Sources wishing to be considered send an e:mail to the contract specialist, Cheryl Battle, confirming its ability to provide the above.  Sources wishing to be considered must affirm that they are currently registered in the Central Contractor Registration  (CCR) database or will register.

<DESC>National Security Technologies LLC is looking for sources for:

A six-channel time gated MCP detector. This pulser system will consist of six pulser modules, a control module, a trigger module and a power supply module integrated into a single 19" rack mounting enclosure. Each pulser module will have an integrated delay generator and bias voltage generator and will have a high level trigger input. In addition it will have a low voltage DC power supply input and a control interface all derived from a common backplane in the 19" rack. 

The system will always require one control module, one trigger module and one power supply module, but will be capable of operating with a minimum of one and a maximum of nine pulser modules. 
The unformed output of each pulser module will be a negative step of approximately 6kV with approximately 100ps risetime and a slower, approximate exponential decay. Each pulser module output will be manually fitted with a pulse-forming module (PFM). 
The negative output pulse voltage from a PFM will be nominally > or = to 3.0 KV into 50 ohm with a pulse duration that can be specified in the range 300 ps to 1000ps FWHM. The waveform of the pulse will be either a Gaussian or nearly square wave with a rise time less than 150 ps and falling edge less than 250 ps. A power indicator light should show that AC power is applied and the unit is switched on, and a triggered indicator should illuminate while the unit is being triggered.  The trigger module will take a single low level trigger input and will produce nine high level trigger outputs that will be distributed approximately synchronously to each of the 9 pulser module slots.  

The above is a partial specification, Interested parties are to demonstrate that they have the capability to provide similar products.  Also provide your business size based on NAICS code of 500 employees.

<DESC>The U. S. Army Research Development and Engineering Command (RDECOM) is seeking technical information on a Parachutist Oxygen Mask (POM) that will provide the Military Free Fall (MFF) parachutists a more dependable method of receiving supplemental ox ygen, the ability to use the same mask on different deliver systems, and a safer method of receiving supplemental oxygen due to the improved routing of the delivery hose and regulator.  The POM will be used as part of the MFF parachutist oxygen life suppor t system, which includes the bailout bottle system and the portable oxygen console, both of which are already certified for use by the USAF.  The POM will deliver diluted and 100% aviators grade oxygen to the parachutist when conducting MFF operations abo ve12,999-ft MSL, and will be used in altitudes as high as 35,000-ft Mean Sea Level during the conduct of High Altitude Low Opening (HALO) and High Altitude High Opening (HAHO) operations.  The POM will be attached to the MFF parachutist helmet by bayonet r eceptacles and connect to the bailout bottles and consoles via a quick disconnect mechanism.  The POM shall have the following capabilities: (Threshold (T) is a must-meet criterion; Objective (O) exceeds criterion.)

<SUBJECT>M -- 2 SOPS Det 1, Test and Operational Mission Services - Public Announcement of Public-Private Competition
<DESC>FEDBIZOPPS AND PUBLIC AFFAIRS ANNOUNCEMENT

STREAMLINED COMPETITION DECISION ANNOUNCEMENT  

2 SOPS, Detachment 1, Electronics Maintenance function at Cape Canaveral AFS FL Competition:  

The 50th Space Wing at Cape Canaveral AFS FL, 2 SOPS, Detachment 1, Electronics Maintenance function Commander, Major John E. Buchanan of Air Force Space Command has announced a tentative performance decision of Electronics Maintenance.  Competition between agency tender and contract performance determined contract performance to be the most efficient and cost effective method of operation.  This competition affects a total of 13 DoD personnel:  1 officer, 11 enlisted, 1 civilian (unencumbered), and 0 Contract Manpower Equivalents.  We anticipate the effect on these employees as follows: 0 will be offered other Government employment, 0 will retire, and 0 will be involuntarily separated from Government employment.

This streamlined competition was conducted in compliance with the Air Force policies in AFI 38-203, Commercial Activities Program, that implements the Office of Management and Budget Circular (OMBC) A-76, Performance of Commercial Activities.  This Circular reaffirms the Government?s policy to rely on the private sector for products and services.  When in-house performance of commercial activities is not required for national defense reasons and contracting is more cost effective, conversion to contract performance is in the best interest of the American taxpayer.

When a competition between an agency and contract performance determines contracting is more cost effective, OMBC A-76 and Federal Acquisition Regulation require the contractor to offer adversely affected civilian and NAF employees the Right of First Refusal for employment openings to positions (under the contract) for which they are qualified.  Since DoD is sensitive to the personal impact this action may have on civilian employees, the DoD Program for Stability of Civilian Employment ensures every effort is made to help adversely affected civilian employees who desire placement assistance.  These employees may register in the Defense-wide computerized Priority Placement Program.  Registrants under this program receive placement rights to vacancies within DoD (other Federal agencies are also solicited).  When adversely affected civilian employees must relocate to continue Federal employment, transportation and moving expenses are paid by the Government.

In order to validate the A-76 decision, the 50th Contracting Squadron will utilize the appropriate acquisition procedures available, and as outlined in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and its applicable supplements, to verify that contractor performance is the most cost effective alternative for the Government.  The Point of Contact for this action will be Mr. Steven Wells, Contracting Officer, 50CONS/LGCZW, (719) 567-3807, steven.wells@schriever.af.mil.  Interested parties may request a copy of the Streamlined Competition Form from the Contracting Officer.

The work described below concerns the Alexander Hamilton U.S. Custom House at 1 Bowling Green, NYC.  The building is a historic landmark and will celebrate its centennial next year.  All design and construction work connected with this building must be coordinated with GSA?s Regional Historic Preservation Officer (RHPO).

In August of 2006 marble pieces fell from vertical interior surfaces.  Steps were taken to either remove the marble or temporarily secure it in place to alleviate further dangerous situations.  A-E will be required to:
1. Do a survey of all the stone paneling throughout the building.  
2. Panels exhibiting less than safe adherence shall be discreetly marked for:
a)	Immediate repair/reattachment (i.e. within first 30 days of a construction contract)
b)	Longer term repair/reattachment (to be done after the immediate panels are corrected.)
3. In addition to the discreet marking of panels create a survey drawing identifying the panels in need of repair/reattachment.
4. Prepare a report describing the methods used to do the survey as well as the results.
5. Prepare specifications/drawings depicting the methods that a contractor must employ to repair/reattach the faulty panels.  The detail in the specs/drawings shall be clear enough to permit qualified contractors to bid on and carry out the needed repairs/reattachments.
6. Recommend at least three contractors that have performed similar restoration work.
7. Prepare estimates of the envisioned construction work.
8. It is noted that some panels have already been removed or broken.  It is desired, to the extent possible, to repair/reinstall these panels. Panels falling into this category shall be specifically highlighted in your report.   If panels are beyond saving then replacement panels closely resembling the original shall be fully detailed and specified.

Selected A-E must have past performance of historic preservation work.
No solicitation, request for proposal or request for quote is available for this procurement.  Nevertheless, any firm that believes it is capable of meeting the GSA/PBS/RHPO requirements described herein may submit a response no later than Thursday October 5, 2006, to the POC listed below by 3:30 p.m. EST to be considered:

Submit to the above referenced address and include the routing symbol (2POA-M) to ensure proper delivery.  Please verify that all required information is submitted and accurate.  Firms should include all relevant information about past design projects similar in type to this project.  This is NOT a request for proposals.

Pertinent factors for consideration for qualification for this project, listed in order of importance are:

1. Selected A-E shall have proven historic preservation capability. 2. Specialized experience and technical competence of the firm with the type of services required. 3. Specific experience and qualifications of personnel proposed for assignment to the project and record of working together as a team. 4. Capacity of the firm to perform the work (including any specialized work) within the time limitations. 5. Past record of performance with historic preservation.

Respondents should be advised that work may be required to be performed after normal business hours so as not to disturb tenants of the building.  The selected A-E shall provide their own material (including but not limited to ladders, scaffolds, safety gear, etc.) as may be necessary to conduct the survey.  The winning bidder shall be required to apply for security clearances for those employees intending to enter and work in the building. Any parties that believe they can meet the requirements of this project must ensure that their submission includes the following information:

 	Brief r?sum?s of the key personnel expected to be involved in the work detailing their qualifications related to historical preservation.
 	The method of doing the survey to determine the soundness and safety of the panels shall be briefly described and should include a description of ?go, no-go? criteria.  In other words, what level of survey reading would indicate a poorly adhered panel (i.e. requiring remedial repair) and what level indicates a well adhered safe and sound panel.

<SUBJECT>A -- Advanced Nanophosphor Composite Scintillator Materials
<DESC>Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL), operated by Los Alamos National Security, LLC under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), is seeking one or more industrial partners to assist in advancing and commercializing LANLs new class of scintillator materials.

Partnerships may take the form of Cooperative Research & Development Agreements (CRADA) and/or commercial licenses. Commercial licensees will have the option to obtain, up to and including, an exclusive license to the intellectual property in a pre-negotiated, defined field of use for reasonable compensation. CRADAs are expected to include funds-in to the Lab.

President Bush signed a $3.4 billion port-security bill that requires new monitors to be deployed at the nation's 22 busiest ports by the end of 2007. The Department of Homeland Security's plan to spend $1.2 billion deploying next-generation nuclear-detection equipment at U.S. ports and border crossings cannot be justified, given test results that showed current devices are unreliable. LANLs nanophosphor composites are pushing conventional scanning & detection technologies to new and improved heights. These new scintillator materials could be used for large volume, low cost radiation detection equipment.

GENERAL REQUIREMENT:

The U.S. Department of State, Narcotics Affairs Section (NAS) of the U.S. Embassy in Panama City, Panama has a requirement for the purchase of new vehicles to be donated to the host government for NAS program purposes:

--two (2) small panel vans to be used for carrying cargo.     

The Government of Panama needs vehicles primarily for surveillance and undercover operations.  The vehicles must be inconspicuous and suitable for surveillance in support of narcotics investigations, eradication, and interdiction operations.   The vehicles must be easily maneuverable and relatively economical in terms of gas mileage.  The vehicles must be consistent with those commonly seen on the road in Panama.  Normally, vehicles assembled in the U.S. would pose a problem in that they typically identify the occupants as police or other government officials; however, vehicles assembled in Panama or elsewhere and commonly driven in Panama without appearing conspicuous may be proposed.     

Vehicles offered must be capable of being maintained commercially in Panama at reasonable cost and must be covered by the manufacturer's warranties.  Quoters must demonstrate that the vehicles offered can withstand continuous use in Panama and the supplied vehicles are to be new, which is defined as having zero miles.  Low mileage and/or demonstration models are not considered to be new.  Delivery of anything other than new vehicles shall be rejected and returned at no cost to the Government.   The resulting contract type shall be firm-fixed price.

The above price is FOB destination, Cost Insurance in Freight (CIF) Panama City.  The above price includes all shipping and other costs for delivery of the vehicles to Panama City.  The vehicles shall be insured by the Contractor until such time as the vehicles are received by NAS in Panama City.

The specifications below are approximate descriptions and dimensions which all quoters should meet or surpass.   Provide the following quantities of vehicles described below.   Vehicles should be of varying colors, for security reasons.  At a minimum, the vehicles must meet the following specifications:

LINE ITEM 0001: Panel van, small size, quantity: 2 each; 

4 doors, 4 cylinder engine, regular body style with standard roof and long wheelbase, air conditioning, front power windows with one one-touch, driver and passenger power door mirrors, manual five-speed transmission, power steering, steering wheel with tilt adjustment, seating only for 3 people (in front), clock.

Color must be inconspicuous.

REQUIRED DELIVERY DATE:  December 1, 2006.  

EVALUATION OF QUOTATIONS:
The primary technical considerations for award of a purchase order will be whether the items are suitable for the intended purpose and whether they can be delivered on time.  Quoters that cannot meet the delivery date for the complete quantities or exact items may quote the best terms they can provide.  The quoter offering acceptable items that most closely match the Government's needs and required delivery date will receive most favorable consideration from a technical standpoint.   The Government may make one award or multiple awards, whichever is most advantageous and in the Government's best interest.   The Government intends to award to the lowest priced technically acceptable quoter(s).           

QUOTATION MUST INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING:

1)       PRICE:  Unit price and extended price, inclusive of delivery charges.
2)       DESCRIPTION:  Description of each vehicle being proposed and how it meets or surpasses the requirements stated above; product literature may be provided.
3)       REFERENCES:  Names and points of contacts of other Government or commercial customers for whom the quoter has performed this or similar work for in the past two (2) years. 
4)       DUNS AND CCR:  DUNS number and statement that the quoter has registered in CCR.
