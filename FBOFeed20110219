<p>The following clauses are provided in full text:</p>
<p>CAR 1352.271-71 METHOD OF PAYMENT AND INVOICING INSTRUCTIONS FOR SHIP REPAIR (APR 2010)</p>
<p>(a) The Government will make payment under this contract based on a percentage of completion. The contractor may invoice for the percentage completed for each work item as work progresses. The amount invoiced shall be calculated based on prices stated in the Schedule, as follows: A work item may not be invoiced until the percentage complete reaches 25 percent. Future invoices for that work item have no limitation as to the percentage of completion required before invoicing, but in no event may invoices be submitted more frequently than every 2 weeks, or for amounts less than $10,000, unless it is the final payment. The minimum percentage of completion (25%) to be reached prior to billing each work item may be waived by the Contracting Officer for large dollar work items on a case-by-case basis.<br />(b) Invoices submitted by the contractor which are deemed not proper, in accordance with FAR 52.232-25, will be returned. Invoices shall include: <br />(1) Name and Address of the contractor;<br />(2) DUNS Number;<br />(3) Invoice Date;<br />(4) Contract Number/Modification Number;<br />(5) CLIN/Work Item Number, to include: Description, Quantity, Unit of Measure, Unit Price and Extended Price;<br />(6) Shipping and Payment Terms; and, <br />(7) Contractor Point of Contact, including: Name, Title, Phone Number, and Mailing Address;<br />(8) The percentage of completion for each CLIN/work item identified;<br />(9) Name of the Contracting Officer ;<br />(10) Ship name;<br />(11) The overall percentage and dollar amount previously billed, currently billed and unbilled.<br />(c) When invoicing for changed work, the contractor shall identify it as a contract change and shall identify the modification authorizing the change, and the CLIN/Work Item associated with the change.<br />(d) All items of work invoiced under this contract will be verified and confirmed by the Contracting Officer's Representative as accurate and complete and approved by the designated billing office before payment will be made. <br />(e) Mail the original invoice to: <br />Department of Commerce/NOAA<br />Eastern Region Acquisition Division (ERAD)<br />Attn: Robin Resweber<br />200 Granby Street, 8th Floor<br />Norfolk, VA 23510<br />Robin.Resweber@noaa.gov<br />(f) The contractor's final invoice submitted under the contract must be marked as follows: &sup2;THIS INVOICE CONSTITUTES THE FINAL INVOICE - UPON PAYMENT OF THIS INVOICE NO OTHER MONIES ARE DUE UNDER CONTRACT NUMBER _____________________."(To be assigned at contract award)</p>
<p>(End of clause)<br />CAR 1352.271-72 Additional Item Requirements (AIRs) - Growth Work (APR 2010)<br />(a) This clause applies to Additional Item Requirements (AIR), also known as growth and emergent work ordered by the Contracting Officer pursuant to the Changes - Ship Repair clause or mutually agreed upon by the parties. The contractor shall perform AIR at the labor billing rates designated in the Schedule, as described in paragraph (c) of this clause. The AIR handling fee designated in the Schedule shall be the sole fee used for direct material purchases and subcontractor handling. The estimated quantity of labor hours and handling fees represent the Government's best estimate for growth that may be required throughout the contract performance period. All growth work shall be paid at the prices stated in the Schedule.<br />(b) The contractor shall take into account the potential for ordering all estimated AIR quantities in developing the Production Schedule. The ordering of any portion of the AIR quantities does not in itself warrant an extension to the original contract completion date; however, for planning purposes, the Government anticipates ordering AIR in accordance with the following schedule: <br />(1) No more than 75% of the hours during the first half of the contract period of performance. <br />(2) No more than 50% of the hours during the third quarter of the contract period of performance. <br />(3) No more than 30% of the hours during the fourth quarter of the contract period of performance.<br />(c) The AIR labor rate shall be a flat, hourly rate to cover the entire effort and shall be burdened to include: <br />(1) Direct production labor hour functions only. Direct production labor hours are hours of skilled labor at the journeyman level expended in direct production. Direct production is defined as work performed by a qualified craftsman that is directly related to the alteration, modification, or repair of the item or system identified as needing alteration, modification, or repair. The following functions are identified as direct production: Abrasive Cleaning/Water Blasting, Tank Cleaning, Welding, Burning, Brazing, Blacksmithing, Machining (inside and outside), Carpentry, Electrical/Electronic Work, Crane Operation, Shipfitting, Lagging/Insulating, Painting, Boilermaking, Pipe Fitting, Engineering (Production), Sheetmetal Work, Staging/Scaffolding, and Rigging. <br />(2) Non-production labor hours (whether charged directly or indirectly by contractor's accounting system) shall be for labor in support of production functions. For purposes of this clause, support functions are defined as functions that do not directly contribute to the alteration, modification, or repair of the item or system identified as needing alteration, modification, or repair. Necessary support functions should be priced into the burdened rate for production labor hours. Examples of support functions include: Testing, Quality Assurance (inspection), Engineering (support), Planning (including involvement of craft foreman/journeyman in planning a task), Estimating (including determination of necessary materials and equipment needed to perform a task), Material Handling, Set-up (moving tools and equipment from shop to ship to perform a task), Fire Watch, General Labor (including general support of journeyman tasks), Cleaning (including debris pickup and removal), Surveying, Security, Transportation, Supervision, and Lofting (sail/pattern making).<br />(d) Additional Item Requirements do not include replacement work performed pursuant to the Inspection and Manner of Doing Work or Guarantees clauses.<br />(e) It is the Government's intention to award any growth work identified during the repair to the contractor, if a fair and reasonable price can be negotiated for such work, based upon Schedule rates. If a fair and reasonable price cannot be negotiated, the Government may, at its discretion, obtain services outside of the contract. Such services may be performed while the ship is undergoing repair in the contractor's facility pursuant to the Access to Vessels clause.<br />(f) The contractor shall submit to the Contracting Officer the following information in all AIR proposals: <br />(1) Number of labor hours estimated; broken down by specific direct production labor category.<br />(2) Material estimates, individually broken out and priced. When requested by the Contracting Officer, material quotes shall be provided. <br />(3) Subcontractor estimates, individually broken out and priced along with the actual subcontractor quotes. The requirement to submit subcontractor quotes may be waived if deemed appropriate by the Contracting Officer. <br />(4) Material/subcontractor handling fee and the basis for the fee.<br />(g) The contractor shall not be entitled to payment for any hours ordered pursuant to this clause until such time as a written contract modification is executed.<br />(End of clause)<br />FAR clause 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial Items (DEC 2010) applies to this acquisition and the following additional FAR clauses cited in the clause at paragraph (b) are applicable to this acquisition:<br />(1) 52.203-6, Restrictions on Subcontractor Sales to the Government, (SEP 2006), with Alternate I (OCT 1995)<br />(6) 52.209-6, Protecting the Government's Interest when Subcontracting with Contractors Debarred, Suspended, or Proposed for Debarment (DEC 2010)<br />(9) 52.219-6, Notice of Total Small Business Set Aside, (JUN 2003) <br />(12) 52.219-8, Utilization of Small Business Concerns, (MAY 2004)<br />(14) 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting, (DEC 1996)<br />(20) 52.219-28, Post Award Small Business Program Representation (APR 2009)<br />(21) 52.222-3, Convict Labor, (JUN 2003)<br />(23) 52.222-21, Prohibition of Segregated Facilities, (FEB 1999)<br />(24) 52.222-26, Equal Opportunity, (MAR 2007)<br />(25) 52.222-35 Equal Opportunity for Veterans (SEP 2010)<br />(26) 52.222-36, Affirmative Action for Workers with Disabilities, (OCT 2010)<br />(27) 52.222-37, Employment Reports on Veterans, (SEP 2010)<br />(33) 52.223-18, Contractor Policy to Ban Text Messaging While Driving (SEP 2010)<br />(34) 52.225-1, Buy American Act -- Supplies, (FEB 2009)<br />(37) 52.225-13, Restrictions on Certain Foreign Purchases, (JUN 2008)<br />(42) 52.232-33, Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer - Central Contractor Registration, (OCT 2003)<br />No other additional contractual terms and conditions are applicable.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of Census intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with AMGRAF, INC. This requirement is being advertised under Other Than Full and Open Competition by the authority of the Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 6, Subparts 6.301 and 6.302.
<p>The IBEAM (Information Base for Exchange Administration and Management) system was originally designed by the U.S. Census Bureau to support paper questionnaire development via an interface with the AMGRAF, INC. software (OFDP, One Form Designer Plus). The legacy IBEAM/OFDP interface was used to support the development of many questionnaires for the 2010 Decennial Census program. The legacy IBEAM/OFDP interface enabled several division resources throughout the bureau in the content development, questionnaire design and questionnaire data capture of the decennial census questionnaires. Because of the tight coupling of IBEAM and OFDP, ongoing technical support from AMGRAF, INC. was required to ensure stability.</p>
<p>The Census Bureau is embarking on the development of a greatly enhanced for future questionnaire development. The richer, enhanced IBEAM/OFDP interface is being developed under a separate existing agreement.<br /><br />Technical support will be required for the legacy IBEAM/OFDP interface used to support the 2010 Decennial program until the legacy interface is retired.<br /><br />The contractor shall provide isolated maintenance and training services for the legacy IBEAM/OFDP interface. The expected outcome is that the Systems Support Division (SSD) will be able to obtain maintenance software support for the legacy IBEAM/OFDP interface on an ongoing basis and to request training services on the legacy IBEAM/OFDP interface as requested by the users in Census in a timely manner. The legacy IBEAM/OFDP interface will be preserved completely separate from the development of the enhanced IBEAM/OFDP interface to ensure successful usage of the legacy IBEAM/OFDP interface until it is retired.</p>
<p>The period of performance will be from Date of Award through one year with one option year. This will be awarded by government purchase order on a fixed price basis. Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the government. In doing so, interested sources must submit technical capabilities, pricing and other information that demonstrates their ability to meet the Census Bureau's needs. Detailed capabilities must be submitted electronically, via email to Tanisha Contee of the U.S. Census Bureau, Acquisition Division. This notice is not to be considered a request for quotations or proposals. No solicitation document is available and telephone requests will not be honored. No contract will be awarded on the basis of offers received in response to this notice, but offers will be used to determine if a comparable source is available and more advantageous to the government.&nbsp;If no affirmative written response is received within 15 days from the publication of this synopsis, a contract may be issued to AMGRAF, INC. without further notice.</p>
