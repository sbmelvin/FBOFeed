<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division, Coastal Systems Station (NSWCDD CSS) intends to issue a solicitation seeking proposals for comparison purposes in support of the NSWCDD CSS, A-76 Commercial Activities Study, involving Budget and Financial Program support services. Budget and Financial Program Support include daily recurring services in the following areas: Financial Transactions; Financial Customer Service; Financial Systems; Financial Information. The work will require the use of multiple Government databases and software programs to provide logistical and financial controls for each record established in the databases and software programs. The list of databases and software programs are as follows: AUTODOC - Automated Funding Document System; CAS - Commercial Asset System; CCR.DLIS.DLA.MIL - Central Contractor Registration Website;  CDB - Corporate Database ; CITIDIRECT - Citibank Card Management System; COBRA - Computer Optimized Batch Reconciliation Application; CPRRS - Civilian Personnel Resource Reporting System; CTS - Corporate Travel System; DCPS - Defense Civilian Pay System; DEPCON - Unisys DEPCON Output Management Application; DFAS.MIL - Defense Finance and Accounting Service Website; DIFMS - Defense Industrial Financial Management System; DOCUANALYZER - Mobius Document Analyzer; DOCUMENT DIRECT - Mobius Document Analyzer;  DRATS - Dahlgren Division Resource Allocation and Tracking Software; DWAS - Defense Working Accounting System; EAGLS - Electronic Account Government Ledger System;  EDA - Electronic Document Access;  ERP - Enterprise Resource Planning; EXCEL - Spreadsheet Software; FADA - Field Accounting Document Abstract; FEDSIM - Federal Systems Integration And Management Center; FRS - Financial Reporting System; FT P - File Transfer Protocol; HCM - Headquarters Claimant Module (STARS); IATS - Integrated Automated Travel System; ILSMIS - Integrated Logistics Support Management Information System; Internet / Intranet;  MOCAS - Mechanization of Contract Administration Sources;  NAFI - Navy/Air Force Interface;  OLRV - OPLOC Charleston Document Retrieval System; Microsoft® Outlook® - E-mail Software; PAR - Pensacola Action Request System; POWER TRACK - Bill of Lading Payment System; RBASE - Relational Database;  REMEDY - Issue Tracking Software; SDW - Shared Data Warehouse; SLDCADA - Standard Labor Data Collection And Distribution Application; STARS - Standard Accounting And Reporting System; SWT - Service Wide Transportation; WAWF - Wide Area Workflow; WIS - Workload Information System; Microsoft® Word® - Word Processing Software.   The specific requirements will be described in a Performanc e Work Statement (PWS) released with the solicitation. A cost comparison to determine the feasibility and economy of converting the above services performed by the Government to contractor performance is simultaneously being done. A contract will not be awarded if Government performance is determined to be more advantageous. Government personnel adversely affected by conversion of Government performed services to contract have Right of First Refusal for jobs for which they are qualified. It is anticipated that a pre-proposal conference and site-visit will be conducted prior to solicitation closing; time and date will be provided in the solicitation. The solicitation will be issued on a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) basis, and will include Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) line items to accommodate Government-ordered after hours work. Any resultant contract is anticipated  to be for a base period and up to four option periods (period of performance not to exceed five total years).    This procurement will be conducted as a 100% set aside for Small Business. Due to the type of work conducted at NSWCDD CSS, it is required that contractor personnel be United States citizens. Currently, the Government in-house workforce is performing the Budget and Financial Program Support services. The Navy intends to perform a cost comparison, pursuant to OMB Circular No. A-76, in order to determine the most cost effective service provider. Best Value Source Selection procedures will be utilized for this procurement. The proposals received in response to the solicitation will be fully evaluated by the Source Selection Team on the stated technical evaluation factors. Proposals will be evaluated on the following factors: 1) Relevant Past Performance; 2) Management  Approach and Organization; 3) Technical Approach, Experience and Qualifications, 4) Phase in Plan, and 5) Price. The contract will be awarded to the best value contractor if the contractors proposal is more advantageous than the Governments proposal, taking into consideration the minimum cost differential requirements. To be considered more advantageous, contractor’s proposal must be at least 10 percent lower than the Government’s costs in the performance period. The purpose of the minimum cost differential is to avoid the disruption of converting performance of the commercial activity based on a minimal cost savings.  If Government performance is determined to be more advantageous, this solicitation will be cancelled and no contract will be awarded.  If a contractor is selected as the service provider, an award will be made in accordance with OMB Circular A-76 and all other ap plicable Navy and Government acquisition regulations. The anticipated release date of the solicitation is on or about 28 April 2003.  In accordance with FAR 5.102(a)(7), availability of this requirement will be limited to the electronic medium. The Government will NOT provide hard copies (paper sets) or CD-ROMs of this solicitation.

The specific requirements will be described in a Performance Work Statement (PWS) released with the solicitation. A cost comparison to determine the feasibility and economy of converting the above services performed by the Government to contractor performance is simultaneously being done. A contract will not be awarded if Government performance is determined to be more advantageous. Government personnel adversely affected by conversion of Government performed services to contract have Right of First Refusal for jobs for which they are qualified. It is anticipated that a pre-proposal conference and site-visit will be conducted prior to solicitation closing; time and date will be provided in the solicitation. The solicitation will be issued on a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) basis, and will include Indefin ite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) line items to accommodate Government-ordered after hours work. Any resultant contract is anticipated to be for a base period and up to four option periods (period of performance not to exceed five total years). Due to the type of work conducted at NSWCDD CSS, it is required that contractor personnel be United States citizens. Currently, the Government in-house workforce is performing the Budget and Financial Program Support services. The Navy intends to perform a cost comparison, pursuant to OMB Circular No. A-76, in order to determine the most cost effective service provider. Best Value Source Selection procedures will be utilized for this procurement. The proposals received in response to the solicitation will be fully evaluated by the Source Selection Team on the stated technical evaluation factors. Proposals will be evaluated on the  following factors: 1) Relevant Past Performance; 2) Management Approach and Organization; 3) Technical Approach, Experience and Qualifications, 4) Phase in Plan, and 5) Price. The contract will be awarded to the best value contractor if the contractors proposal is more advantageous than the Governments proposal, taking into consideration the minimum cost differential requirements. To be considered more advantageous, contractor’s proposal must be at least 10 percent lower than the Government’s costs in the performance period. The purpose of the minimum cost differential is to avoid the disruption of converting performance of the commercial activity based on a minimal cost savings.  If Government performance is determined to be more advantageous, this solicitation will be cancelled and no contract will be awarded.  If a contractor is selected as the service provider, an award wil l be made in accordance with OMB Circular A-76 and all other applicable Navy and Government acquisition regulations. The anticipated release date of the solicitation is on or about 6 June 2003.  In accordance with FAR 5.102(a)(7), availability of this requirement will be limited to the electronic medium. The Government will NOT provide hard copies (paper sets) or CD-ROMs of this solicitation. Interested parties may download the solicitation upon its issuance from the following web sites: www.fedbizopps.gov, or www.ncsc.navy.mil.
