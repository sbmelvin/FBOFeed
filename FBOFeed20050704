<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>This is a modification to a previously posted sources sought notice.

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Acquisition Management Division, Chemical Science and Technology Laboratory Office, requires a matrix assisted laser desorption ionizing double time of flight mass spectrometer (MALDI TOF/TOF) to determine with high precision and accuracy the mass/charge ratios of fragments of proteins in proteomics research. A particular requirement is that the instrument be sensitive so that molecular masses can be determined on femtomole to sub-femtomole levels, levels that are typical for low-abundant proteins in cell and tissue samples. The instrument is required to provide for the selection of the collision energy, the collision gas, a threshold gas pressure, and the mass windof for MS/MS analysis in order to selectively identify particular protein fragments. The instrument is required to allow for the selection of the precursor ion of interest prior to fragmentation of that ion in the collision induced dissociation chamber to better control further fragmentation of the protein fragment. The maximum collision energy should be variable form 500eV to 3000eV in the mass spectrometer to allow low energy unimolecular fragment and/or high energy single or multiple collision spectra to be produced for identification of the protein fragment.

Based on NIST’s market research, NIST has identified only one system, manufactured by Applied Biosystems, that is capable of all of the above that is comprised of the following: PART NO. 4700 PROTEOMICS DISCOVERY SYS W/MASCOT, INCLUDING TRAINING; PART NO. 4350663, TF, CDS MS FASTA FILES; PART NO. 4333604, MASS STANDARDS KIT FOR 4700 PROTEOMICS; PART NO. 4316866, TF, SEQUAZYME PEPTIDE MASS STD INSTL KIT; PART NO. 4339035, TF, CLEAVABLE ICAT METHOD DEVELOPMENT KIT; PART NO. 4336211, KIT, UPGRADE, LINEAR DETECTOR, 4700; PART NO. 800-L, 160560 LC PACKINGS/DIONEX PROBOT; PART NO. 800-L, 161390 TABLE ADAPTER; AND PART NO. 800-L, SERVICE, INSTALLATION).

Therefore, the NIST Acquisition Management Division intends to negotiate an open market purchase order on a sole source basis, under the authority of Section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996, with Applied Biosystems for one (1) of the system noted above. The item is a comprehensive system including state-of-the-art MALDI tandem time-of-flight mass spectrometry, sophisticated bioinformatics, and enabling chemistries.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334516, and the size standard is 500 employees.

This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations, however, parties that are expressly authorized by Applied Biosystems to sell the system noted above may respond to this notice to indicate that they are authorized to sell it and shall provide written evidence of such authorization. Such notice shall be provided to Joseph.Widdup@nist.gov no later than June 26, 2005. The Government will then determine whether the procurement for the system noted above could be competed. A determination by the Government whether to compete the proposed acquisition will be based solely upon responses to this notice.

The capabilities statement must consist of the following sections: 1) Past Performance; 2) Key Personnel and Team; 3) Technical and Management Approach.  It is the responsibility of the contractor to ensure that the information to be evaluated is included in the proper section heading.  The Government will not try to extrapolate information from other areas of the capabilities statement to make a complete evaluation of each identified section heading.

Capabilities statements must address the following:

(1) Past Performance. The Offeror shall discuss how its past and present performance validates expected performance of work under this solicitation.  The Offeror shall include three (3) references for contracts with same or similar scope and the description shall include: (a) Contract Number; (b) Point(s) of Contact, such as Contracting Officer, Technical Representative and their contact information; (c) Period of performance (note: include the original (as –awarded) POP and subsequent (as-modified) POP if applicable; (d) If Offeror is/was the “prime”, include a list of the subcontractors used on the program, including company and the percent of subcontractor labor used; (e) If the Offeror is/was a subcontractor, include the percentage of work performed with a detailed description of only the actual work performed and the customer contact information. The Offeror’s past performance should be relevant in the key functional areas identified above and of comparable size and scope to this solicitation.
(2) Key Personnel and Team. The Offeror must submit resumes detailing the skill sets and experience level for each analyst, the Project Manager, and any other key personnel the Offeror may employ for this project. The TSA’s intent is to minimize turnover, if possible, to keep the same team members together for the duration of the contract.  TSA will evaluate all resumes submitted.  The Offeror must identify the period of time that each of their personnel has worked on the contracts which are submitted as past performance references.  The resumes must highlight the activities performed by the individual on the referenced contract, including experience working on integrated teams (multiple contractors, clients, stakeholders, etc) continuity on projects, relevant experience and skills, and an understanding of, and alignment with, the programs organizational structure.

In addition to resumes, the Offeror should provide a short biography for each of their employees, to be given to the appropriate stakeholder(s) prior to the team’s arrival at an asset location. 


Evaluation Criteria: The Government intends to evaluate capabilities statements based on the probability of successful performance of each Offeror, and by association, the risk to the Government. Offerors will be down-selected accordingly, based on the information provided in the capabilities statements, and must be rated at least acceptable in all evaluation areas provided to be considered for participation in the limited competition to follow. The TSA intends to down select without conducting communications with Offerors; therefore, Offeror initial capabilities statements should contain the Offeror’s best terms from a technical, management and relative experience standpoint.  The Government reserves the right to communicate with any Offeror if the Contracting Officer determines clarifications to be necessary.  Selected contractor employees may be subjected to additional TSA security clearance requirements. 

As discussed above, Factors to be considered when evaluating the capabilities statements include the following: 1. Past Performance, 2. Key Personnel and Team, 3. Technical Factors and Management Approach.

Factor 1, Past Performance, will be a pass/fail determination. Factor 2, Key Personnel and Team, is more important than Factor 3, Technical and Management Approach.
