<DESC>The United States Department of Agriculture, Economic Research Service (ERS) operates a number of computer servers including a public web site at its headquarters, located at 1800 M Street, NW, Washington, D.C.   As an information agency, ERS conducts much of its business over the Internet and this web site.

Currently, there is no operational off-site backup for the web server.  ERS plans to install a backup web server along with a number of related servers and network equipment, in a "co-location" facility.  This backup web server would provide a continued web presence for ERS in the event the main web server becomes unavailable due to normal system maintenance, fire, flood, telecommunications interruption, etc.

ERS does not operate any Critical Infrastructure Equipment and there will be none at 
the proposed co-location site.

1.1	Phases

Initially, ERS will place in the co-location facility five servers, three switches, and one router.   Later, approximately four more servers will be added.  Additional servers may be added in the future, for a total of approximately 15.

2.0	Objective

The purpose of this SOW is to obtain space in a co-location facility for one cabinet.

3.0	Period of performance

This purchase order will be for one year initially, with the Government's option to renew each year for up to four additional years.  The period of period schedule will be as follows:

Base:  July 1, 2006 through June 30, 2007
Option Year 1 – July 1, 2007 through June 30, 2008
Option Year 2 – July 1, 2008 through June 30, 2009
Option Year 3 – July 1, 2009 through June 30, 2010
Option Year 4 – July 1, 2010 through June 30, 2011


4.0	Requirements

4.1	Location Requirement

•	The facility needs to be located within 30-60 miles from the Washington, D.C. metropolitian area.  
•	The 30 mile distance is related to COOP requirements, should ERS in the future need to extend its COOP plan to include the facility. 
•	The 60 mile limitation, while not a hard limit, is needed is to provide a reasonable commuting time for ERS server administrators and to limit the cost for the dedicated T1 line described below in section 4.5.

4.2	Physical Security Requirement

Physical security requirements are adapted from USDA physical security standards for information technology restricted space.
1.	Access will be via electronic access control with the capability of providing an audit trail.
2.	Access will be limited to authorized personnel.  
3.	The facility must have Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) surveillance cameras with video recording.
4.	Biometric access control is desirable.

4.3	Access Requirement

Designated ERS personnel will have access to ERS equipment in the facility during regular business hours and by pre-arrangement at other times as needed.  ERS personnel will need this access to install or replace machines and to perform maintenance work on them that cannot be done remotely.

4.4	Machine Accommodation Requirement

Space.   	ERS requires space for one standard 24" cabinet for 19" rack servers.

Cabinet:  The facility shall provide a cabinet providing approximately 40U of space, or allow ERS to move its own cabinet into the facility.  A cabinet provided by the facility shall be lockable, a key shall be provided to ERS and the vendor’s key shall be kept secured against unauthorized access.

Power.	
1.	The initial cost shall include two 20 amp 110 volt circuits, adequate for eight servers, three switches, one router, and one DSU/CSU.  
2.	There shall be an option to add up to two more 20 amp 110 volt circuits as more servers are added.
3.	The power shall be conditioned and protected against spikes and dips that exceed server operating requirements.
4.	The power shall be provided through an uninterruptible power supply (UPS).
5.	There shall be redundant power for use by dual-corded servers.

Cooling.	
1.	The facility shall provide adequate cooling to maintain an air temperature at the cabinet of 65-75 degrees.
2.	Redundant cooling or an emergency backup cooling system is required.
3.	If cooling fails there shall be a mechanism or on-site operator to shut down equipment to prevent equipment damage from excessive heat.

4.5	Internet Connection Requirement - Initial

For security reasons, ERS will not be able to use the co-location facility's Internet connection.  Instead ERS will need to install its own T1 line connecting its DSU/CSU and router at the co-location facility to a USDA Internet access point in Beltsville, MD.  

1.	The co-location facility shall provide any needed support to the circuit vendor for installing the T1 line and extending it to the ERS equipment cabinet, and the cost for this support shall be included in the bid and not separately charged.
.  
2.	ERS will pay for the T1 line and it will not be provided by the facility.

4.6	Internet Connection Requirement – Possible Future

If USDA security considerations can be resolved sometime after the first year of this agreement, it is possible ERS will want to use the co-location facility's Internet connection instead of the T1 line it plans to lease initially.

ERS desires to know:

1.	How bandwidth charges would be determined and what they would be, in this future scenario.
2.	How bandwidth charges could be capped to a specific amount so costs to ERS would not exceed the amount we budget for them.

4.7	Operations Support Requirement 

In the event of suspected problems with the T1 circuit, the facility shall admit repair personnel from the circuit vendor and assist as needed, with identifying the ERS extended demarc and equipment cabinet, unlocking the cabinet as needed, to facilitate DSU/CSU inspection and replacement.  To permit this, the facility may be given a key to ERS equipment cabinet; the facility will safeguard this key against unauthorized use. 

The contractor shall make available a human operator to occasionally power equipment on and off at the facility as directed by an ERS network administrator.  

5.0	Schedule

The agreed upon cabinet space and related services shall be made available to ERS within 15-30 days of award.  

6.0	Government Contacts

The Contracting Officer (CO) is the sole point of contact for clarifying contract issues or changes.  This person’s name and phone number will be provided at the time of award.

The Contracting Officer’s Representative (COR) is the technical point of contact for administrative issues and for formal problem notification.  The COR for this contract will be determined at the time of award.

The Contracting Officer’s Technical Representative (COTR) will be determined at the time of award.

Optional Task

The contractor shall provide an "out of band" remote control technology that allows ERS system administrators to re-boot or power cycle its server equipment from a remote location such as ERS headquarters, without using the Internet connection provided through the ERS-installed T1 line.

Note:  Award will be determined based on best value and not lowest price.

<CONTACT>Debra Zamarron (760) 939-9658 John D. Watkins, (760) 939-8158
<DESC>Responses to this Broad Agency Announcement are sought to develop and test radomes for future high speed missiles.  The development of future Navy radar guided missiles includes broader RF bandwidths and potentially higher speeds.  Current ceramic radome technology does not have sufficient mechanical and electrical performance for these new high-speed missile systems operating in realistic weather extremes.  Improvements are needed in radome mechanical properties such as high temperature strength, thermal coefficient of expansion, rain erosion resistance, hermeticity, and handling toughness.  Electrical improvements sought include wide bandwidth, low distortion, and low loss tangent. Manufacturing and cost are other areas of interest for this BAA.  Manufacturers capable of producing large radomes (having base diameters above 13 in. and fineness ratios above 2.0) are invited to submit proposals for development and test of materials and structures for high performance fu!  ture Navy missiles.  It is envisioned that this will be a three phase program.  Phase 1 will be a study phase to select suitable materials for a hypersonic radome.  Phase 2 will be a manufacturing development phase where selected materials will be tested and prototype radome structures will be fabricated.  Phase 3 will test full size radomes in representative operating environments.  A SECRET classified addendum to this BAA is available to qualified offerors detailing the radome performance requirements. Offerors shall have, or have the ability to acquire, the capability to hold and use TOP SECRET material. Proposal topic areas of specific interest in this BAA include but are not limited to the following:  1.  Radome Mechanical Improvements: The objectives of this area are to provide improved mechanical characteristics for high speed radomes. As an example, a candidate material would have a melting temperature considerably higher than the expected temperatures experienced during long-range hypersonic flight, a very low coefficient of expansion, fracture strength substantially higher than necessary for the highly maneuverable hypersonic missile flight environment, be completely hermetic, and be very light weight.  Most current RF radome materials do not robustly survive high temperatures found in hypersonic flight.  Many also erode or fracture while flying through rain.  Materials that provide improved hardness and strength at high temperatures are desired.  Hermeticity is desired to protect electronics found behind the radome.  Many current radomes are fragile and susceptible to handling damage during manufacture and transport.  Improved toughness is needed to reduce losses fr!  om handling.  The proposed radome material also has to be compatible with current missile materials.  Coefficient of expansion, mechanical interface, and corrosion resistance compatibility are also required. 2.  Radome Electrical Improvements:  The objectives of this area are to provide improved electrical performance across wide percentage bandwidths.  The ideal radome would have no effect in the transmission of RF energy, regardless of frequencyAs an example, the ideal candidate material would have a dielectric constant of one, zero loss tangent, produce no depolarization, would have no change in electrical properties with temperature, and have no effect on the transmission of RF energy.  Current radome designs either use Në/2 or electrically thin walls to minimize losses.  These radomes usually are relatively narrow band or not physically robust.  New radome design is desired to widen the bandwidth and improve the mechanical strength.  High dielectric constant material used in some current radomes also limits bandwidth and increases losses.  Novel materials and combinations of materials are desired to improve radome performance through reduced loss, depolarization, and refrac!  tion over wide bandwidths while maintaining adequate mechanical strength.  The material needs to have predictable repeatable, well characterized performance over very wide temperature ranges from high altitude cold to temperatures found in hypersonic flight. 3.  Radome Manufacturing Improvements:  The objectives of this area are to develop techniques to manufacture improved radomes for high yield and low cost. As an example, a candidate radome would be inexpensive to build, have high manufacturing yield, and could be built out of common materials using relatively simple processes.  The structures required by this program need to be manufacturable based on a 13.5-inch radome diameter.  The length of the radome will be between two and three times the diameter.  Appropriate manufacturing processes need to be available for the materials selected.  Low cost materials and manufacturing techniques are highly desirable.  Repeatability is critical for insertion into missile systems design.  4.  Radome Testing:  To gauge the effectiveness of the improvements, the radomes developed under this need to be tested in representative environments.  Candidate radomes for testing shall be 13.5 inches in outer base diameter.  Because of existing testing infrastructure, the 13.5-inch radome shall have mounting attachments compatible with current 13.5 inch missiles. Testing will include both mechanical and electrical tests.  Sufficient radomes shall be produced to perform the necessary tests and to demonstrate radome producibility.   This notice constitutes a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) as contemplated in FAR 6.102 (d)(2). A formal Request for Proposal (RFP)/ Solicitation, will not be issued. The Naval Air Warfare Center, Weapons Division (NAWCWD) will not issue paper copies of this BAA.

<DESC>Note: This Synopsis was previously posted under Classification Code: R – Professional, administrative, and management support services; NAICS Code: 541611 – Administrative Management and General Management Consulting Services. Previous Synopsis  was deleted.

The U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) to provide training and human capital services and solutions to a large number of Federal Government agencies through OPM’s Training and Management Assistance (TMA) Branch. For more than 20 years, OPM has used TMA as a resource to help Federal agencies accomplish a variety of training and human capital management projects, specifically in support of human capital development and organizational performance improvement.

The proposed acquisition will be solicited using Full and Open Competition procedures. We will consider all responsible sources that submit a responsive technical and price proposal by the closing time and date of the RFP. OPM anticipates awarding multiple indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (ID/IQ) contracts that allow for firm fixed price delivery orders.

The resulting performance-based contracts will enable OPM to successfully support its client agencies in improving the proficiency of their workforces, the structures and business processes of their organizations, and the effectiveness with which they fulfill their missions and objectives. Every effort will be made by the TMA program office to work with customer agencies to develop performance-based statements of work, as appropriate, for each task to be negotiated and awarded under each of the TMA contracts. The projects will be awarded primarily through task order competitions among the qualified firms by virtue of their selection for an IDIQ award. 

The TMA program provides support in two (2) service areas:

1.	Custom Training and Learning Solutions.
Provide government agencies support in the analysis, design, development, implementation, and/or evaluation of instructional products regardless of subject area. Some examples of products and services under this key service area include: instructor-led materials; print-based instructional materials; technology-based training products; job aids; performance support strategies and tools; knowledge management systems; learning organization strategies; consulting; learning systems development and integration; and training management systems. Some technology-based training will be developed using Government-adopted software and systems.

2.	Custom Strategic Human Capital Solutions.
Provide government agencies support in the analysis, design, development, implementation, and/or evaluation of strategies and systems that align human resources management with an agency’s mission and that manage, appraise, compensate, and retain a high-quality and diverse workforce. Some examples of services under this key service area include: strategic human resources planning; human resources system development and integration; consulting; business process reengineering; compensation; performance management; performance measurement and improvement; program management support; and program evaluation.

The RFP will allow offerors to submit proposals for either one or both of these service areas.
 
Place of Performance: Most projects will require contractor performance in the Washington, D.C. metro area. However, TMA does service client agencies wherever they may be located, to include sites outside the continental U.S. 

Duration of the contract period: The period of performance includes a 12 month base period plus four 12-month option periods.

Offeror Question Submissions: OPM will accept and answer questions from offerors after the RFP has been released. All questions will be answered in an amendment to the RFP to allow all interested offerors access to the same information.  The RFP will provide an outline of the procedures for submitting questions.

Pre-Proposal Conference: OPM intends to host a pre-proposal conference not later than two (2) weeks after release of the RFP. The date and time of the conference will be announced when the RFP is released. The location is anticipated to be in the D.C. Metro area.  The pre-proposal conference will provide potential offerors with an overview of the TMA program. You are strongly encouraged to attend this conference. Attending the conference will familiarize you with our operations, infrastructure and business processes, and should help you prepare a more responsive proposal. At least two days prior to the conference, you must email to the OPM point of contact a notice of your intent to attend. Each bidder will be limited to two attendees. Due to security concerns, offerors failing to register will not be allowed to attend. When registering for the conference, all offerors must provide the following information:

1.	Your company name.
2.	Single company point of contact (first name, last name, title, telephone, fax, email, and mailing address.
3.	Your company website address.
4.	List of attendees (total number of your staff expected to attend the conference, first and last names, titles, social security numbers, U.S. citizenship status (yes or no), telephone, fax, email, and mailing addresses.
5.	Your NAICS code.
6.	Your company business size/type (based on NAICS code above).  This will allow companies to make teaming arrangements if desired.

<DESC>The Pediatric Epidemiology Section (PES) of the Epidemiology Branch (EB), an intramural research group within the Division of Epidemiology Statistics and Prevention Research (DESPR) of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), conducts research on identifying risk factors for abnormal childhood development.  An area of particular interest is the genetic contribution to birth defects.  The PES conducts much of its research via contracts, collaborating scientifically with the Contractors.  

The mapping of the human genome has made it possible to identify genes that are etiologically important in birth defects.  For example, the knowledge that folate was important in the etiology of neural tube defects (NTDs) (Medical Research Council, Czeizel) led to the identification of a variant in the enzyme methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase that increases the risk of having an NTD (Whitehead).  There is great potential for finding other gene related birth defects because recurrence risks indicate that there is a genetic component and because of the enormous genetic variability in the human population–any two individuals have approximately 3,000,000 differences in their genomes.
 
One of the limiting factors in this research area has been the availability of samples from a sufficient number of affected subjects (or families).  Because the etiology of many birth defects is multifactorial and because the penetrance of these genes is low (sometimes because of environmental factors), large numbers of cases must be studied to identify risks.  The possibility that defects are the result of gene-gene interactions also demands larger sample sizes to identify enough subjects with the combination of alleles in question.

Even a relatively common type of birth defect, such as neural tube defect occurs in only about one (1) pregnancy in 1000.  Hundreds of cases of any birth defect are required to address even the simplest of research questions.  Other birth defects of interest are much less common than neural tube defects. Therefore, a large underlying population is needed to identify enough defects of interest.  Many important defects are too uncommon for even a large institution to accrue enough cases to etiologic investigations.  There are few resources available to redress these problems.

	Therefore, the NICHD is intends to contract with an institution to acquire from a large population in a defined geographical area (e.g. births within a given state): 1) already collected samples containing DNA from a large number of children who have major birth defects and medical documentation sufficient to describe the birth defects; 2) already collected samples containing DNA from normal control children; 3) any and all existing data currently in the possession of the resultant Contractor on factors that may influence pregnancy outcome and birth defects. 




Additionally, as a contract option the NICHD is looking to obtain for the children who have major birth defects and for the normal control children:  1) maternal serum, plasma, amniotic fluid or other biological samples obtained during the pregnancy that produced the affected or normal control child; 2) samples containing DNA from the mothers; 3) samples containing DNA from the fathers, where maternal samples containing DNA are present.

Please note that offerors are not required to propose on the Contract Option requirements.   Proposals without the option requirements will still be considered for award, though there is a small (10 points) Technical Evaluation Criterion based on the Option requirements.  Furthermore, offerors that elect to propose on the Contract Option may elect to propose to provide all of the Contract Option requirements or they may elect may elect to propose to provide just the following Contract Option requirements: #1 only, #2 only, #1 and #2, #2 and #3 or #1,  #2 and #3.  

Please note that it is the intent of the Government to make only one (1) award as a result of the RFP.   This procurement is defined as code 541710 under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS).  It is anticipated that the RFP will be available on or about June 15, 2006 through the FedBizOpps website at http://FedBizOpps.gov.  

All proposals must be submitted on or before the due date and time stated in the RFP to: Jason Williams, Contracting Officer, NICHD R&D Contracts Management Branch, 6100 Executive Boulevard, Suite 7A07, MSC 7510, Bethesda, Maryland, 20892-7510 (if sending by overnight carrier, use 6l00 Executive Boulevard, Suite 7A07, Rockville Maryland, 20852).

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541990   The U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) intends to award a purchase order, using FAR Part 13 procedures, for gas leak quantification using thermal video and FTIR spectrometry and for field work support and sensor integration for the South Wind project (Thermal imaging for detecting of industrial gas emissions in Crittenden county, Arkansas, and Memphis, Tennessee).  This procurement, which is 100% set aside for small business, has an associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code of 541990, with a small business size standard of $6  million. The South Wind project is a research and development activity that is investigating the utility of using remote sensing technologies to detect fugitive gas emissions from industrial facilities and pipeline corridors. This project is part of an ongoing research program for developing remote  sensing capabilities to detect, identify, and quantify fugitive industrial emissions. The objective of this acquisition is to acquire the services of field work support staff to assist in the data collection during the South Wind exercise. The support staff will be expected to assist in the  operation of FTIR spectrometer and thermal video cameras, analyze the data from both systems, assist in generation of analytical products and reports, and provide software engineering support.  The EPA owns a field portable FTIR spectrometer, the D&P Instruments TurboFT with 4 inch telescope. This  system is capable of identifying the chemical composition of a gas plume from over 1km distance. The thermal cameras deployed in the South Wind exercise will have the capability to detect a gas leak in real time and display an image of the emission. These cameras can rapidly survey a facility for  leaks. Once a leak has been detected by the camera, the FTIR spectrometer will be used to identify the compound and estimate the concentration.  This project requires the wide area survey of numerous petrochemical and refinery facilities, pipeline corridors, and storage tank sites. Requirements of  the project include the following:  (1) In Real Time, detect the presence of gas phase hydrocarbon compounds at various concentrations and release rates.  "Detect" is defined as being able to determine/isolate an object such as a plume of gas against the background.  (2)  Identify compound species  by comparison to reference library database.  (3)  Acquire the spectral data of gas phase and/or vapor emissions at multiple targets of interest (i.e. petrochemical product units, storage tanks).  (4)  Provide geo-locations of the detected releases using GPS technology.  The contractor shall have  the experience and knowledge to make minor sensor hardware and software adjustments and repairs if necessary. Travel to the study area will be required. Period of performance will be from date of issuance of the order through four (4) months thereafter.  A Request for Quotations (RFQ) with complete  information will be posted on the EPA's website in approximately 15 days at the following address:  http://www.epa.gov/oam/rtp_cmd/   Hard copies of the RFQ will not be available.

Participants may ask questions relative to the Topical Broad Agency Announcement. (BAA).  All questions and answers posed at the pre-proposal conference will be posted to the NUWCDIVNPT Contracts, FedBizopps and Grants.gov websites.  SECTION 1. GENERAL INFORMATION.  1.1 INTRODUCTION. This publication constitutes a Broad Agency Announcement in accordance with FAR 6.102(d)(2),DOD 3210.6-R,“Defense Grant and Agreement Regulations (DGARS)”,. The Newport Division, Naval Undersea Warfare Center (NUWCDIVNPT), in collaboration with the Naval Sea Systems Command, has an interest in proposals relating to the establishment of a Center of Excellence in Undersea Technology (COEUT).  NUWCDIVNPT envisions the mission of the COEUT to be a cooperative research, technology transfer, product development, and Science and Technology (S & T) training/educational alliance between the Division and the successful offeror.  It is anticipated that the alliance, once established, will act to foster continued advancements in undersea technologies to meet existing and projected Navy needs, as well as identify civilian applications for such emerging technologies.  1.2 VISION. The vision is for the COEUT to become a preeminent National Center concerned with the research, development, test and evaluation of undersea technologies and associated products for the national defense and security.  Further, it is the vision for the COEUT to work with governmental and educational institutions to train the next generation of scientists and engineers working in undersea technologies through undergraduate, graduate and research programs.  1.3 BAA SUBJECT AREAS. Offerors under this BAA are required to submit proposals addressing both of two distinct subject areas.  Subject area 1 is a plan for the establishment and management of a Center of Excellence for Undersea Technology implementing the above Vision. Subject Area 2 is a proposal for a specific technical program, to be conducted under the COEUT, which will exemplify the Vision.   1.3.1 Subject Area 1:  The Center of Excellence in Undersea Technology will serve as a focal organization to: foster promotion and development of new technologies related to the undersea environment; facilitate partnerships between and among business, non-profit, academic and government institutions to carry out such development; and provide for educational and research opportunities for undergraduate and graduate education in order to contribute to the development of the next generation of undersea technology experts. The offeror should present an approach for the creation and management of such a center.  It is anticipated that the creation and management of the COEUT would be carried out under one or more of the following vehicles: Cooperative Agreements under the authority of 10 United States Code (USC) 2358; Cooperative Research and Development Agreements under the authority of 15 USC 3710; Other Transactions under the authority of 10 USC 2371; Technology Investment Agreements (TIA) under the authority of 10 USC 2358 or 2371; Grants under the authority of 10 USC 2358; Education Partnership Agreements under the authority of 10 USC 2194; and Procurement Contracts  under the authority of 10 USC 2304  awarded by NUWCDIVNPT.  1.3.2 Subject Area 2:  Offerors should review the areas listed below and propose one technical project to be conducted by an alliance or partnership involving NUWCDIVNPT and, at a minimum, one other nongovernmental organization.  The proposed project should represent an innovative approach for a dramatic advance in Undersea Technology in line with the Vision of the COEUT. Proposals that involve final product development beyond the stage of product prototype or feasibility demonstration are outside the scope of the competition and will not be acceptable. The proposal under this Subject Area must be for a cost shared effort.  1.3.2.1 Specific areas of interest to the government are: applied research focused on the design, development, testing, initial prototyping, concept proofing, and prototype implementation of any of a wide variety of undersea technologies that support both military and civilian applications; research opportunities and training in support of graduate and undergraduate education for the next generation of ocean technologists;  distributed sensor and/or network systems for ocean and sea floor monitoring; ocean sensors and instrumentation; autonomous and remotely operated underwater vehicles; materials; non-traditional power sources; nano scale devices and sensors; modeling & simulation; underwater communication, detection, and classification systems; and other promising emerging/leap-ahead technologies within the scope of the COEUT’s mission.  1.3.2.2 It is anticipated that the proposed technical project and similar projects in the future, which include NUWCDIVNPT as a participant, will be carried out under one or more of the following vehicles: Cooperative Agreements under the authority of 10 United States Code (USC) 2358; Cooperative Research and Development Agreements under the authority of 15 USC 3710; Other Transactions under the authority of 10 USC 2371; Technology Investment Agreements (TIA) under the authority of 10 USC 2358 or 2371; Grants under the authority of 10 USC 2358; Education Partnership Agreements under the authority of 10 USC 2194; Procurement Contracts under the authority of 10 USC 2304 awarded by NUWCDIVNPT.
These will help to facilitate: (a) a close working relationship between NUWCDIVNPT and other participants; (b) the interaction of personnel and maximum use of available facilities, (c) an environment for the exchange of scientific ideas, and (d) the conduct of research in support of Navy requirements while encouraging commercialization of the results of the research. Projects proposed under these vehicles, with the exception of a “procurement contract” must be for cost shared efforts.   1.4 NOTICES.  1.4.1 In accordance with OMB Circular A-110, proposed Cooperative Agreements shall not provide for payment of fee or profit. Proposals containing provisions for payment of fee or profit under Cooperative Agreements will not be considered.  The Government may not provide funds to organizations participating in a CRADA.  1.4.2 Readers should note that this Broad Agency Announcement declares the intention of NUWCDIVNPT to competitively fund or to cooperatively engage in research and technology projects fostered under the COEUT and that no other request for proposals, solicitation or other announcement of this opportunity will be made. Due to limited resources, the Government reserves the right to limit awards under this announcement and only proposals considered to be of superior quality will be funded.   1.4.3 Work performed under Subject Area 2 may, in principle, be performed both within the United States and its territorial waters as well as in waters throughout the globe. Proposals including work or research that will be performed outside of the United States will need to address in specific detail the reasons for utilizing those sites.  For reasons of National security NUWCDIVNPT may reject, in its entirety, a proposal for an effort not performed in the United States or its territorial waters.  1.4.4 Awards under this BAA may be for a period of up to five (5) years. The Government intends to assess the progress of the effort during each year. Based on this assessment, the Government will decide whether to continue funding or otherwise participating.   1.5 DUE DATES AND AWARD DATES.  1.5.1 This announcement is open until 31 JULY 2006.  1.5.2 Any interested offeror is required to submit a concept paper synopsis of the planned proposal including a rough cost estimate. Concept papers should address the selection criteria wherever possible. The concept paper should not exceed five (5) pages and must be submitted by no later than 30 JUN 2006. The concept paper shall be submitted to the Attention of Ms. Bonnie Stevens, Naval Undersea Warfare Center Division, Newport, Commercial Acquisition Dept., Code 5912, Bldg. 11, 1176 Howell Street, Newport RI 02841-5047.

While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable.  Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the Navy Sea Systems Command.  PLEASE NOTE RESPONSE DATE FOR WHITE COPY IS DUE 30 JUNE 2006.  RESPONSE DATE FOR FULL PROPOSAL IS DUE 31 JULY 2006.  SECTION 4 – QUALIFICATIONS.  This section should address the following areas.  1. The identification of the proposed principal investigators and other key personnel and a full description of the qualifications, education, and relevant experience of each of these individuals.   2. A discussion of the qualifications of each of the organizations involved in the effort in sufficient detail to demonstrate that the collective experience and expertise is necessary and sufficient to ensure technical objectives are met.   3. A demonstration that the resources available for the proposed activity, including facilities, equipment, and technical support, are necessary and sufficient to accomplish the objectives. Special attention should be paid to describing the necessity of any resources, which are proposed as part of the offeror's cost sharing. 
4. A discussion of how intellectual property (especially that proposed as part of the offeror's cost sharing) is to be used as a necessary resource to accomplish the objectives of the project.  3.3 COST/FUNDING PROPOSAL.   In light of 1.4.4 above, costs should be broken out by period of performance and year.  This proposal shall contain a cost estimate that is sufficiently detailed, by element of cost, for meaningful evaluation. The estimate must include the total cost of the project and the amount and source of project funding (e.g., funds requested from NUWCDIVNPT or funds to be provided by the proposing organization as cost sharing). The offeror's cost share may take the form of academic training (such as Distance Learning and On-Campus Courses), equipment or access to unique facilities, independent research and development (IR&D), cash, foregone intellectual property rights, and other acceptable forms of in-kind contributions. (Note: Work breakdown structures are neither required nor desired.   Cost/funding proposals should be organized to include three sections in the following order: total project cost, cost sharing and in-kind contributions, and cost to the Government.   Section 1 - Total Project Cost: This section will give a breakdown of costs of the project. Cost should also be broken down on a task-by-task basis for each task appearing in the Statement of Work. This should include all of the proposed cost to the Government and cost sharing by the offeror. The following information should be presented in the proposal for each phase of the effort: total cost of the particular project phase, total offeror cost share; funding requested from the Government; and elements of cost (labor, direct materials, travel, other direct costs, equipment, software, patents, royalties, indirect costs, and cost of money). Sufficient information should be provided in supporting documents to allow the Government to evaluate the reasonableness of these proposed costs, including salaries, overhead, equipment purchases, fair market value of leased items, and the method used for making such evaluations. Profit shall not be included as a cost element.   Section 2 - Cost Sharing and In-Kind Contributions: This section will include (1) the specific in-kind contributions proposed, their value in monetary terms, and the methods by which their values were derived (10USC 2371 provides further guidance); (2) the sources of cash and amounts to be used for matching requirements; and (3) evidence of the existence of adequate cash or commitments to provide sufficient cash or in-kind contribution in the future. Affirmative, signed agreements are required from outside sources of cash. Proposals should contain sufficient information regarding the sources of the offeror's cost share so that the Government regarding the availability, timeliness, and control of these resources may make a determination. For example: How will the funds and resources be applied to advance the progress of the proposed effort? What is the role of any proposed in-kind contributions?   Section 3 - Cost to the Government: This section will specify the total costs proposed to be borne by the Government and any technical or other assistance including equipment, facilities and personnel of Federal laboratories, if any required to support these activities. The cost to the Government should be that portion of the proposed effort that is not covered by cost sharing.  The costs incurred and work performed by any DOD or national laboratory "partnering" with the offeror under the proposal shall normally be considered costs of the Government and not costs of the offeror for purposes of the cost-sharing requirement unless the offeror is proposing to pay for those costs. Proposals should contain sufficient information regarding the resources to be provided by the Government so that an evaluation of their availability, timeliness, and control may be made.   3.4 PROPOSAL PAGE FORMATS.  All proposals should be printed such that pages are single-sided, with no more than fifty-five (55) lines per page. Use 21.6 x 27.9 cm (8 1/2" x 11") paper or A4 metric paper. Use an easy-to-read font or not more than about 5 characters per cm (fixed pitch font of 12 or fewer characters per inch or proportional font of point size 10 or larger). Smaller type may be used in figures and tables, but must be clearly legible. Margins on all sides (top, bottom, left and right) should be at least 2.5 cm. (1").   4.0 OTHER REQUIREMENTS.  Offerors proposing to conduct classified work in response to this BAA must have or be able to obtain prior to the classified work, all required personnel/facility clearances.   Our department no longer issues solicitations or amendments in paper form.  Instead, they may be accessed at our web site 
http://www.npt.nuwc.navy.mil/contract/.  We also provide electronic access in our Bid Room.  (END PART 2 OF 2)

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>Amendment #1 Questions & Answers for Grounds Maintenance, Solicitation # FA8601-06-R-0047 are hereby attached under "Questions_and_ Answers.doc" dated 31 May 2006.

As a result of this amendment, the closing date remains unchanged.  All proposals are due June 2, 2006, NLT 2:00pm EST.


**************
GROUNDS MAINTENANCE

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation number FA8601-06-R-0047 is being issued as a request for proposal (RFP).  This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-09, Effective 19 Apr 2006 and & Class Deviation 2005-o0001. This acquisition is 100% set aside for HUBZone concerns. The associated North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) is 561730 and the associated size standard is $6,500,000. This requirement is for grounds maintenance on vacant units and some common areas in Green Acres and Pine Estates, Base housing areas located at
Wright-Patterson AFB, OH. The number of units and common areas requiring
grounds maintenance will vary per call for service. The Government will
provide a list of units and common areas as maintenance is required (see
estimated workload in attached Statement of Work (SOW) and below). A Firm Fixed Price type contract is anticipated with a 12 month base period and one 12-month option period.   Service is normally to be performed bi- weekly during the months of April to November (during the growing season).   It is anticipated that the base and option periods will each have two contract line items (CLINs): One line item for Grounds Maintenance for vacant units which includes estimated quantities for mowing and trimming service; and another CLIN for Grounds Maintenance for common areas which includes estimated quantities for mowing and trimming service. An estimated workload is between 100 and 195 for the vacant units, varying square footage of 10,730 and 10,153. This estimate of 100 -195 is for each time a call is placed by the Government for mowing. The two common areas, estimated at 11,000 SF each, may need to be mowed each time a call is placed to mow vacant units. If common areas do not require mowing, the contractor will be so informed at time of call. The total number of calls made during the entire contract period depends on the weather and growth rate of grass. Period of Performance for the base period is 07 Jun 2006 -31 May 2007.  The Period of Performance for the option year is 01 Jun 2007-31 May 2008.  IMPORTANT NOTICE TO POTENTIAL SOURCES(S):  Due to potential privatization of the WPAFB base military housing, services requested in this announcement; future announcements and procurement documents; and any resulting award may be terminated, in whole, prior to, during, or after award.  All sources responding to this announcement are advised that the modification to terminate the requirements prior to, during, after award, or during contract performance, by the Government shall be made without additional cost or claim to the Government.

The U.S. Coast Guard is considering whether or not to set aside an acquisition for HUBZone, Small Business concerns or Service-Disabled Veteran-owned Small Business concerns.     The estimated value of this procurement is between $400,000.00 and $1,000,000.00.     The small business size standard is less than 1,000 employees.     The acquisition is for drydock repairs to the USCGC Barbara Mabrity (WLM-559), a 175-foot patrol boat whose homeport is in Mobile, Alabama.    All repairs are to be performed at the contractors facility.    The CGC Barbara Mabrity is restricted to transiting to the waters of the Gulf Coast and the eastern seaboard north to Charleston, S.C.  The performance period is seventy-two (72) calendar days and is expected to begin on or about November 7, 2006.

However, in accordance with FAR 19.1305, if your firm is HUBZone certified, or in accordance with FAR 19.502-2 (b) (1),       if your firm is a Small Business and intends to submit an offer on this acquisition, please respond by email to kstark@mlca.uscg.mil or by fax at (757)628-4676.

	Required services are more completely described in the solicitation and are available upon request.   Please contact Robert K. Moore, robert.k.moore@usps.gov.

B.	Statement of Objectives

In order to improve and enhance its supply chain capabilities through proper matching of Postal operational requirements with transportation carrier service offerings, USPS seeks supplier(s) to provide one-way within the continental United States for routes selected by Area Distribution Networks (DN) offices or by Headquarters Network Optimization (NO).

Center for Research and Evaluation on Abstinence Education

Description

The Department of Health and Human Services, Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation will have  a requirement to develop a Center for Research and Evaluation on Abstinence Education that would build capacity for sound research related to program evaluation in the field.  To ensure that program evaluation is useful and credible, the research should be sound, meaning that it employs widely-accepted scientific practices for sampling, measurement, design, analysis, and interpretation of findings in relation to the strengths and limitations of the design.  The Center’s activities will focus on assisting abstinence education providers during the planning and initial implementation process as they prepare to track program outputs and outcomes, and conduct evaluations. 

It is anticipated this project will be developed through a two-year task order.   

ASPE has identified four priority areas of activities for the Center:  a) conduct a needs assessment to identify gaps in abstinence education evaluation and technical assistance needs; b) develop materials on abstinence education evaluation; c) deliver technical assistance and capacity building activities related to program evaluation; and d) develop several research reports related to abstinence education.  The proposed Center will work to link people and resources, with the goals of stimulating greater collaboration and quality implementation and outcome evaluation research of abstinence education programs. 

Evaluation research is central to understanding the effectiveness of abstinence education programs and in helping ensure that the Department is continuing to fund strong programs for youth.  For the purposes of this solicitation, abstinence education is characterized using the federal A-H definition found in Section 510(a)(b) of Title V of the Social Security Act and the ACF policy guidance document (see the FY 2006 Community Based Abstinence Education grant announcement, available at, http://www.acf.hhs.gov/grants/open/HHS-2006-ACF-ACYF-AE-0099.html).  According to the federal statutory definition, “abstinence education” means an educational or motivational program which -
        (A) has as its exclusive purpose, teaching the social, psychological, and health gains to be realized by abstaining from sexual activity;
        (B) teaches abstinence from sexual activity outside marriage as the expected standard for all school-age children;
        (C) teaches that abstinence from sexual activity is the only certain way to avoid out-of-wedlock pregnancy, sexually transmitted diseases, and other associated health problems;
        (D) teaches that a mutually faithful monogamous relationship in the context of marriage is the expected standard of human sexual activity;
        (E) teaches that sexual activity outside of the context of marriage is likely to have harmful psychological and physical effects;
        (F) teaches that bearing children out-of-wedlock is likely to have harmful consequences for the child, the child's parents, and society;
        (G) teaches young people how to reject sexual advances and how alcohol and drug use increases vulnerability to sexual advances; and
        (H) teaches the importance of attaining self-sufficiency before engaging in sexual activity.

HHS funds three abstinence education grant programs.  Grantees must adhere to the A-H legislative definition above:  

•	State Abstinence Education block grant program (known as Title V Section 510 block grants) 
•	Community-Based Abstinence Education Grant Program (CBAE) 
•	Adolescent Family Life Grant Program (AFL)

The number of abstinence education grantees is growing.  Currently, ASPE is playing a critical role in answering questions about the effectiveness of abstinence education, through several evaluation efforts that are underway.  In addition, a significant amount of evaluation research is being conducted through Departmental program offices and their grant programs.  For example, ACF and OPA sponsored an evaluation conference, ACF required in its 2006 grant announcement for Community-Based Abstinence Education program that grantees use a percentage of the funds awarded for evaluation activities, and the AFL program is now allowing programs to devote up to 25% of their grant funding to evaluation.  

It is important to understand the appropriateness of different research designs for answering important program evaluation questions related to program implementation, youth outcomes, and program impacts.  To ensure that evaluations are useful and credible, the research should be sound, meaning that it employs widely-accepted scientific practices for sampling, measurement, design, analysis, and interpretation of findings in relation to the strengths and limitations of the design.  In addition, there are many challenges specific to designing a study of programs intended to prevent risky youth behaviors, including sexual behavior (e.g., requirements for active parental consent for research with minors, sensitivity of questions related to sexual activity, mandatory reporting issues in the case of rape or incest, and protecting the confidentiality of youth’s data).  However, there have been limited efforts to provide training on evaluation methodology along the continuum of evaluation approaches.  

It is expected that the Center will identify gaps in the field, including the perceived evaluation research needs of researchers, practitioners, and policymakers.  One of the goals of the Center is to stimulate collaboration between program evaluation experts and abstinence education practitioners and program experts.  ASPE envisions that the Center will incorporate staff from both the program evaluation and abstinence education program fields, who will work together to build evaluation capacity in abstinence education.  The Center will develop and disseminate research and evaluation materials designed to improve abstinence education research.  In addition, it will provide technical assistance, training, and support on evaluation to practitioners, researchers, and stakeholders in state and local government.  The Center will work to link people to resources, with the goal of stimulating quality research on issues related to abstinence education evaluation.  Activities do not include overseeing or conducting program evaluations.  

ASPE is seeking statements of corporate interest and capabilities with respect to this project.  Interested firms are encouraged to describe how their research experience and critical personnel (including subcontractors) would accomplish the identified goals of this effort.  Potential offerors are encouraged to identify the staff person who would likely be proposed as the project director for this work.  Statements of interest should address the ways in which the firm fulfills the following requirements:

•	Demonstrated knowledge of academic and/or applied experience in non-experimental, quasi-experimental, and experimental program evaluation research methodologies.  
•	Demonstrated expertise in the field of abstinence until marriage education.  If the offeror does not have experience with abstinence education programs, the offeror should describe a plan for addressing this gap through mechanisms such as subcontractors and technical consultants.  An offeror with strong abstinence education expertise could also partner with a university or research organization with evaluation expertise provided that the offeror demonstrates how the overall organization will ensure the use of consistent and sound standards for evaluation
•	Experience and expertise in building good working relationships with program practitioners and making technical research concepts accessible to practitioners through both written and oral communication.  
•	Demonstrated experience and expertise in developing materials, communicating and delivering technical assistance. 

The purpose of this is to determine whether there are sources with the requisite qualifications to perform the work described above. Any organization capable of performing the work should submit a statement of capabilities with documentation supporting its ability to meet the Governments requirement as described above by 3:00 pm EST, June 9, 2006.

1.1	SCOPE:  The contractor shall perform all duties and tasks required to provide medical appointment services to the 28th Medical Group beneficiaries.  Performance shall be according to the requirements contained in this statement of work (SOW).  Appointments shall be made following the 28th Medical Treatment Facility (MTF) appointing protocols, and comply with Military Health System (MHS) Access to Care standards (as required by 32 CFR 199.17).   Appointments shall be made using a government provided electronic system -- Composite Health Care System (CHCS).

1.2	 SPECIFIC TASKS:

1.2.1  Contractor shall register beneficiaries, when necessary, into the appointing 
and registration system, book appointments, book follow-up appointments, input cancellations, and reschedule appointments according to government provided appointing protocols and guidelines.  The government may revise the appointment protocols and guidelines on an as needed basis and will provide updates to the contractor as necessary.  Contractor errors in booking appointments will be tracked and used as a performance measure.  These are not all inclusive, but examples may include sending a T-Con to the wrong provider, not obtaining and providing appropriate information from the patient, booking appointments contrary to 28 MDG appointing protocols, etc.(reference appendix 5, exhibit 1)

1.2.2  The contractor shall accept appointments by face-to-face contact and telephonically 
from authorized beneficiaries, MTF staff members, or by the automated appointment system.  At no time will callers be asked to call back, even if appointments for a particular day are unavailable.  Telephone calls shall be answered within 90 seconds. Time in Queue for customers should average no greater than 90 seconds as an overall monthly average. (reference appendix 5, exhibit 2)  

1.2.3  Blocked calls shall never exceed 5%.  Blocked call rates are based on the number of calls 
that can not be completed by the caller due to the call capacity of the telephone switch (i.e., all telephones lines are busy). (reference appendix 5, exhibit 3)

1.2.4  The abandoned rate for calls shall fall within acceptable levels of not greater than 18% as
an overall monthly average.  Calls are considered abandoned after a customer reaches the appointment queue then hangs up before talking with an appointing clerk. (reference appendix 5, exhibit 4)

1.2.5  All contractor personnel shall follow Air Force Medical Service customer service
tenets/basics.  Adherence to these tenets will be monitored as a performance measure using government validated staff and customer complaints received on written patient complaint forms, in e-mails, or other written staff feedback.

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF THE GOVERNMENT'S INTENT TO AWARD A SOLE SOURCE ACTION.  Under the authority of FAR 6.302, the Government intends to award a sole-source action to DOWL LLC to provide survey services for 9 months and $1,000,000.  The survey service s are deemed to be available only from the original source of this contract for the continued provision of highly specialized projects under progress when it is likely that award to any other source would result in a substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition and unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requiremetns for pending construction projects.  Any projects surveyed for construction under this contract will be competed.  If an AE i s interested and believes they are capable of performing this work, they are invited to submit their letter of interest along with an outline of their qualifications, addressing knowledge or experience of the instant procurement or methodology to provide t he surveys without unacceptable delays or duplication of costs.  All responders are advised that this project may be cancelled or revised at any time during the solicitation, evaluation, negotiations, and final award.  A determination by the Government not  to compete this proposed contract action is within the discretion of the Government.  Point of contact is Ms. June Wohlbach, 907/753-5624.

<SUBJECT>17--Standard Aircraft Towing and Lifting System
<SOLNBR>W911W6-06-R-0008
<RESPDATE>063006
<ARCHDATE>08292006
<CONTACT>Katherine Kearney, 7578785703
<DESC>The U.S.Army Aviation Applied Technology Directorate Ft.Eustis Virginia is conducting a Sources Sought Market Survey in accordance with FAR Part 10. This notice neither constitutes an Invitation for Bids (IFB) or a Request for Proposal (RFP), nor doe s it restrict the Government to an ultimate acquisition approach. The current aging fleet of the U.S.Armys aircraft towing and lifting vehicles contains many vehicles that do not have logistical support. In addition newer vehicles locally procured to meet  immediate needs, also do not have logistical support. As a result this survey is being conducted to gain knowledge of sources possessing the capabilities to satisfy the U.S Armys requirements through the use of commercial or Non-Developmental Items (NDI)  systems, for a Standard Aircraft Towing System (SATS). The SATS must be able to remove/replace aircraft components, and move all aircraft and Aviation Ground Support Equipment (AGSE) in/around aircraft hangars, maintenance areas, in addition to loading ai rcraft and equipment aboard ships, and in strategic air lift platforms. Towing will occur on level and inclined surfaces up to 15 degrees, utilizing diesel fuel or JP-8 without degradation in performance. Weights of aircraft run from about 1229 pounds for an A/MH-6 to about 55,000 pounds for the maximum gross weight of an MH-47. The system in addition to maintaining all the requirements of an aircraft tow vehicle stated above, it must have an added capability to be used as a crane type vehicle. The crane mu st have the capability to be stowed to provide the operator full field of vision in the entire range of towing operations, or be self removable. The vehicle when outfitted with the lifting module must be able to lift an aircraft component weighing at least  5000 lbs. The centerline distance between the component and the crane will be a maximum of 14 ft, at a vertical distance of a minimum of 26 ft above ground level. Once the component is lifted from that distance; the crane must have the ability to rotate i n a 180 deg arc (minimum), off the crane centerline, to off load the component. Due to a requirement to be able to be air lifted externally by a CH-47 helicopter, the combined weight of the tow vehicle and the crane should not exceed 14,500 lbs The SATS sh ould improve unit readiness by providing aviation units with a standardized, logistically supported towing system, capable of towing or relocating aircraft and AGSE on improved/unimproved surfaces, (unimproved surfaces are those which are not concrete or a sphalt and may or may not be smooth or packed dirt) and in and around aircraft hangers. The SATS will be employed in aviation maintenance units worldwide and is expected to operate under the same climatic conditions as the aircraft it supports, during dayt ime or nighttime in adverse weather conditions in a temperature range from -25 degrees F to +140 degrees F. The SATS must be capable of safely seating and carrying a minimum of one, and a maximum of four personnel, with toolboxes, and securely carrying a s tandard aircraft tow bar. The rear service deck for carrying tools and parts should be no higher than (48) inches. The SATS must possess a low profile to enable clearance for deployment by internal transport by C-130 or larger aircraft. The tow vehicles wi th the lifting device in the stowed position or removed must be capable of being transported by ground units as cargo on or behind organic vehicles. In order to maintain cost effectiveness the mean time between essential mission failures (MTBEF) should be no less than 222 hours. Interested vendors are invited to submit a three (3) page White Paper providing a description of their system. The White Paper shall include, as a minimum: 1) A description of the system and the validating information supporting cla ims that the proposed system meets the above performance capabilities; 2) Product literature; 3) Past performance information; and 4) Price schedules/catalogues  (not included in the page count). Respondents must also include information regarding 1) customary practices (include warranties, discounts, etc.), and under which commercial sales of the product are made, and 2) requirements of any laws and regulations u nique to the items discussed. Additionally, respondents should express their interest in performing a collaborative effort, e.g., a cooperative research and development agreement or vendor demonstration (without Government funding). Proprietary information  submitted in response to this Sources Sough t shall be marked accordingly and will be protected when clearly identified as such. Responses to this Sources Sought should be received no later than 5 July 2006. This announcement is for purposes of exchanging  information to improve understanding of the Government requirement and industry capability and is for information and planning. This announcement must not be construed as a commitment by the Government and any information submitted by industry will not co nstitute an offer which could be accepted by the Government to create a binding contract. Vendors with systems that can meet the requirements will be asked approximately mid-August, about arrangements for their system to be demonstrated at a Government fac ility. Address responses to Aviation Applied Technology Directorate, ATTN: AMSRD-AMR-AA-P (Dominick Lubrano), Bldg 401, Lee Blvd, Ft Eustis, VA 23604-5577.

<DESC>NOTICE:  THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY.
The information provided in response to this notice will assist the Government in determining the extent of the business size and socio-economic market for the type of work described herein.  All firms qualified, capable, and interested, without restriction to size standards, should submit the requested information.  The intent of the announcement is to identify sources that are qualified business concerns able to address the technical feasibility of developing and deploying a PIT-tag system capable of interrogating tagged salmonids passing dams via spillbays with and without RSWs.  The spillway at Bonneville Dam located on the lower Columbia River near Stevenson, Washington (none of the spillbays at this dam has an RSW).  The general width of each spillbay is 50 ft with water velocity exceeding 60 ft/per sec under the vertical rising spill gates under certain conditions.  The spill gates typically are opened 2-5 feet during spill.  Note the fish capture velocity is set at 15 ft/sec.  Also, RSWs have been or are being installed at Lower Granite (2001), Ice Harbor (2005), and Lower Monumental (2007) Dams on the lower Snake River.  Little Goose Dam is scheduled for RSW installation in 2009.  Since they fit into spillbays, the width of RSWs is basically 50 feet and their downstream exit opening is approximately 3 feet high.  Given that the RSW is still being designed for Little Goose Dam, this provides an opportunity to investigate the feasibility of integrating a detection system into that RSW design.  General information regarding RSWs, artist drawings, and photographs of the installed RSWs can be obtained via the internet at http://www.nww.usace.army.mil/spillway_weir/default.html.  The following are requirements and factors that must be addressed and/or considered.  1) The general width of each spillbay is 50 feet with water velocity exceeding 60 feet/ sec under the vertical rising spill gates under certain conditions.  For this proposal, the design criterion for the spillgate is an opening of from 2 to 5 feet.  The height of the RSW opening is variable and ranges from 3 to 10+ feet; 2) Tag-reading efficiency for each spillbay at the dam will be variable.  Some of the factors creating the variability include spillway gate opening, structure vibration, radio-frequency interference, acoustic interference, number and type of antennas deployed at each spillway, read distance of the antennas, water velocity, and fish orientation.  At this time, no tag-reading efficiency goal for the installed system has been established by the fisheries agencies; 3) The tag to be used with any proposed system (i.e., spillbays and RSWs) must be capable of being interrogated using the existing full-duplex PIT-tag infrastructure that has been deployed throughout the CRB.  If pertinent, address how the existing system would need to be modified to accommodate this requirement.  The proposed system must also be capable of interrogating 134.2-kHz FDX-B ISO PIT tags.  The maximum size tag that will be acceptable for this application is 19-mm long by 3-mm diameter with a weight not to exceed 0.3 g in air.  However, smaller and lighter tags would be preferable and will be looked upon favorably.  A discussion of the similarities and differences in information format (e.g., tag telegram), if any, between what is presently being captured with PIT-tag interrogation systems deployed in the CRB and the new system should be addressed.  The data output from the interrogation system must be capable of being integrated into the PIT-tag database (PTAGIS) maintained by the Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission.
It is anticipated that a firm-fixed price contract for the Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Western Region Acquisition Division (WRAD) will result. The North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) is 334511 with a size standard of 750 employees.  All contractors doing business with the Government are now required to be registered with the Central Contractor Registry (CCR).
NOTE: THIS SYNOPSIS IS NOT CONSIDERED A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL BUT A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY.  No solicitation document is available.   No contract will be awarded on the basis of responses received to this notice.  Interested firms should submit in writing, its name, address, point of contact, telephone number, business type and size, and a brief narrative regarding its capability to provide the required services.  The following is the information that must be addressed in the response to assist the Government in determining the availability of qualified small business concerns for the requirement:
(1) Demonstrate relevant experience, expertise, and qualifications of key personnel in the basic design system and deployment of the system.
It is the Government’s intent to analyze responses from firms which can operate in the areas of consideration as specified above.  Detailed information must be submitted by mail to the U.S. Department of Commerce, NOAA, WRAD, 7600 Sand Point Way N.E., Seattle, WA 98115-6349, ATTN:  Judi M. Jzyk, or to the email address below by 12:00 noon, June 7, 2006.  Questions of any nature may be addressed in writing to judi.m.jzyk@noaa.gov.  NO TELEPHONE INQUIRIES WILL BE HONORED.  Submission information will be reviewed by the Government to determine the level of competition, i.e., small business set-aside, full and open competition.

<SUBJECT>R -- Disseminate, Diffuse and Document Impact of the Guide on improving state and local adolescent health programs and policies.
<DESC>This is for informational purposes only.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) intends to award a sole source purchase order to the Regents of the University of California San Francisco – National Adolescent Health Information Center (NAHIC). The purpose of the purchase order will be to obtain services in collaboration with CDC to further disseminate and diffuse Improving the Health of Adolescents & Young Adults: A Guide for States and Communities (GUIDE) and document its impact on improving state and local adolescent health programs and policies.  The length of the project is expected to be one year.
BACKGROUND INFORMATION The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Division of Adolescent and School Health (DASH) is funding a project to further disseminate and diffuse Improving the Health of Adolescents & Young Adults: A Guide for States and Communities and related resources, document their impact on improving state and local adolescent health programs and policies, and increase collaboration at the state and local levels, including collaboration with educators. The Guide was written by staff from the National Adolescent Health Information Center (NAHIC) in collaboration with officials from CDC/DASH and the Office of Adolescent Health, Maternal and Child Health Bureau (MCHB/OAH), Health Resources and Services Administration. CDC published the Guide in fall 2004 and has since, in collaboration with partners of the National Initiative to Improve Adolescent Health, disseminated it broadly throughout the nation. This project will include two components:
1)	Developing a product that communicates the impact of state and community level groups who have implemented the framework and strategies in the Guide. The product will incorporate a synthesis of lessons learned (from both full time and part time state adolescent health coordinators), including challenges and barriers faced and how they were overcome.   
2)	Developing a training of trainers module, including a PowerPoint presentation, on how to use the processes detailed in the Guide to achieve maximum impact at the state and community level.
OBJECTIVE:  The vendor shall gather stories of impact from a variety of state and local partners on implementing the Guide framework (e.g., formation of state or local adolescent health coalitions, improvements in adolescent programs or policies based on recommended steps in the Guide, movement toward developing a comprehensive adolescent health strategic plan, etc.).The vendor shall synthesize lessons learned from the field on implementing the Guide, focusing especially on lessons learned about what can be done by a full time versus a part time state adolescent health coordinator, and increasing collaboration with educators and other key partners. The vendor shall publish (on-line) a document communicating the impact of the Guide at the state and local levels as well as lessons learned, in collaboration with CDC/DASH. The vendor shall develop and publish a training of trainers PowerPoint presentation with notes for trainers to share how to use the Guide to achieve maximum impact at the state and local levels. The vendor shall submit draft documents to CDC/DASH for review and clearance. The vendor shall publish documents in collaboration with CDC/DASH. All vendors are required to be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) prior to award of a Federal contract. The preferred method for completing registration is via the World Wide Web at http://www.ccr.gov/.   A handbook and other information are available at the site, including information on how to obtain a DUNS number, which is required to begin the registration process. It is believed that the items and services procured from this vendor meet the minimum needs of the government and no other source for this service, within a reasonable time and cost, is known at this time. A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. This procurement will be processed under the authority of FAR 6.302-1:  Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirements. This notice is not a request for competitive proposals. The government will consider all responses received by 8:00 AM, EDST, Thursday, June 15, 2006. The response shall be clearly marked with the RFQ Number 2006-Q-08580. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed purchase order based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Inquiries will only be accepted by email to sjamison@cdc.gov.

Project Title
National Tuberculosis Indicators Project (NTIP) 

 
I.  Background
Accelerating progress toward Tuberculosis (TB) elimination requires new efforts and priorities.  Program evaluation is an essential component of successful programs and a mechanism for TB programs to reach the goal of TB elimination. Survey findings and discussions with state partners identified the evaluation needs of local TB program staff.  In the process, TB Evaluation Working Group’s (EWG) vision evolved. The vision of EWG are for
   TB programs to routinely conduct self-evaluations and use findings to improve and enhance programs.
   Data collection systems to be in place to collect and organize data for evaluation purposes.
   Standard indicators for program performance to be developed and reported to CDC. 
   TB programs to use evaluation findings to make systemic changes.
   TB programs to share lessons learned from evaluations. 
 
To address the needs of TB program staff at the state and local levels, and realize the vision of EWG, the Division of Tuberculosis Elimination (DTBE) EWG is planning and developing a coordinated web-based system that includes 3 major functions in public health programs: (1) program planning, (2) outcome monitoring, and (3) program evaluation. As activities are planned and implemented, outcome indicators are monitored to see how the program is performing.  If a program is doing well or poorly, it can be evaluated to understand why. The knowledge from the evaluation can then be used for planning improvements to enhance the program. These 3 functions operate simultaneously for optimal program performance and success. 
 
Leveraging existing resources and application within the field of Tuberculosis prevention programs, the development of the outcome monitoring component, of the system will be built based on the Tuberculosis Indicators Program (TIP).  This application will unify and standardize indicators of program performance reported to CDC. In addition, it will promote the use data currently being collected in Public Health data systems (i.e., Report of Verified Cases of Tuberculosis and Aggregated Report for Program Evaluation) for the purpose of conducting program evaluation and making program improvements.  
The TIP system was implemented using a multi-tier architecture using various Off the Shelf (OTS) software.  Listed below is a brief description of the various tiers and the major technologies that were used.
Presentation Tier:  Web based interface for users to request analytical reports using Microsoft Application Service Provider
Reporting Engine: Design of  TIP report templates in Crystal Reports 8.5 based on XML data sources.  The system uses the Report Designer Component (RDC) library to merge the data into the templates and produce a PDF document.  The system extracts data from the Reporting database based on the user’s selection.
Analytical Tier:  Processing of raw data from the Surveillance system into summary data as required by the TIP templates. Also performs necessary data cleansing prior to processing. Statistical Analysis Software (SAS) programs are executed in batch to produce reporting data in the form of ASCII delimited files. The analysis is usually performed by the data managers on their desktops or servers.
Reporting Database Tier: The ASCII delimited files from the above analytical process are imported into the reporting database. The reporting database is Microsoft Access.
















The  TIP system currently provides indicator calculations for TB programs within the state of California. To provide the system for use by TB programs across the United States, the TIP system needs to be modified to reflect national indicator calculations if different from the national standardized calculation, accommodate data gathered at the national level from Tuberculosis Information Management System (TIMS) and Tuberculosis Surveillance Program Area Module (TB PAM), and enable reporting jurisdictions to access data within their jurisdiction and perform automatic reporting of indicators for national TB objectives. Data includes, but not limited to, those from Report of Verified Cases of Tuberculosis (RVCT) and Aggregated Report for Program Evaluation (ARPE).

<SUBJECT>D -- RFI for Utilities and Telecommunications
<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION        MAY 30, 2006

The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) seeks Application Service Provider(s) (ASPs) to partner with USDA for modernizing and re-engineering the processing of payments while managing usage/rates and services for utilities, telecommunications and energy consumption/efficiencies. This is a Request For Information (RFI) issued solely for information and planning purposes.  It does not constitute a Request For Proposal (RFP).  USDA intends to assess the capa-bilities of the ASPs and may then issue an RFP.
Please ensure that any sensitive or protected information is marked as such. 
BACKGROUND – CURRENT STATE
USDA maintains a telecommunications and utilities payments legacy automated information systems environment that includes more than five loosely coupled, non-integrated legacy applications.  Many of these applications do not utilize commercial data bases and are reliant on legacy process which are no longer sus-tainable and are labor-intensive.  These applications cannot address the nuances of the utilities or the telecommunications industry in the 21st century nor can they provide the basic elements of information required for USDA to meet the re-quirements of the Energy Policy Act of 2005.  Because of this environment, USDA is unable to respond to new and evolving needs of our user community, including tracking actual energy use to meet the annual reductions in energy use( e.g., savings of 2% in FY2006, 4% in FY2007 and so on). 
Telecommunications and Utilities applications currently managed by USDA are a suite of legacy applications, which focus on addressing telecommunications and utility accounting and payments.  This suite of systems were not designed to track usage, analyze rates, provide comparisons month-to-month or annually, nor were assets inventoried in these payment systems.  Although there are a variety of payment methods for paying telecommunications and utilities, the payment proc-ess currently designated for utilities and telecommunication involves the use of five applications—however, many other payment methods are available for pay-ing these services.  Other less frequently used payment methods include process-ing through USDA’s two procurement systems, purchase card management system and direct entry into the financial system.  
 
The legacy utilities and telecommunications systems consist of five independent applications.  The applications are:     
1.  Telecommunications and Utilities Maintenance Systems.  This is the master account set-up application for the Telecommunications and Utilities feeder sys-tems.  This application links the account number for each vendor to the unique agency accounting strip and provides input for these accounts to the Telephone (Telecommunications) and Utility Vendor Payment systems, described below.
2. Telephone System.  This application consists of the set-up of a buck slip with approximately 8 data elements which constitute the payment elements for tele-communications.  This application was originally set-up when AT&T had a mo-nopoly on the telecom services and prior to cell phones and the explosion of telecommunications services and plans.  The application does not analyze rates, but provides the payment formats which interface into the USDA financial sys-tem.

3.  Utilities Vendor Payment system.  This consists of about 10 data elements to create payments for utilities.  There is a code added to each payment element to indicate the utility consumption metric—such as BTUs, cubic feet or whatever the measure.  This system formats the payments which interface into the USDA fi-nancial system.  

4.  Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) – This is a server application to provide Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) invoices into the Telephone system.  This ap-plication re-constructs the buck slip to input this data into the telephone system to create payments.  The detailed telecommunications data coming in the on EDI transmission is not used presently.  

5.  ENERGY Reporting system.  This is a back-end reporting system, which uses data from the Utilities Vendor Payment system and the financial information from the financial system to provide the energy reporting requirements of the Ex-ecutive Order 13123 on Efficient Energy Management (!999) requiring reporting utility consumption for owned facilities, commercial leased spaces and GSA dele-gated spaces.  

 
Description - Concept of Operations - Future

To further improve financial and energy conservation program performance and ensure that it can meet future needs, the USDA, Office of the Chief Financial Of-ficer (OCFO) has determined that USDA needs to partner with a Utilities/Energy and/or Telecommunications Application Service Provider (ASP) to implement a modern utilities, telephone/telecommunications and energy process that can meet current and future financial payments needs, analytic needs for energy consump-tion, rate and usage analysis and meet the reporting requirements for the Energy Policy Act of 2005.  In particular, the OCFO is seeking to replace five (5) feeder applications and replace the processing, as well as incorporate value-added ser-vices in partnership with a service provider that hosts a modern Application Ser-vice that is cost-effective, with minimal customizations, that will provide online, real-time transaction and information capability and will be accessible to the cen-tral financial office and other USDA agencies/organizations, as necessary.  
USDA requires an ASP to not only replace all the existing applications and pro-vide expanded functionality on a modern web application, but also to dramatically alter the service-levels that the payments process can deliver to the USDA cus-tomers.  This includes automatic routing of invoices to the USDA payments proc-essing personnel, and with the ASP offeror providing analysis of rates, analysis of usage, budget formulation/reporting for projections, energy conservation meas-ures and metrics, operations and maintenance costs and other value–added ser-vices. 
USDA envisions a concept of operations where an experienced utili-ties/telecommunications payments vendor, provides a hosted Application Service and trains USDA personnel to manage the revised business processes of payments and analysis through the software application provided by the utilities and tele-communications payments vendor.   USDA desires a system/process that can be easily enhanced to meet future requirements; please describe your con-cept/process for meeting future requirements.  USDA envisions a partnership with the offeror such that these services can support not only USDA but could be im-plemented with other federal agencies utilizing these services through USDA.  USDA’s priority is to swiftly migrate to an ASP, re-engineer the end-to-end busi-ness processes by incorporating the tools available through an ASP with greatly expanded analytic capabilities, train the government work force to use the appli-cation to create the payments and train the government workforce on the analytics methods to use the data and information created in the data bases.  Further, USDA requires a completely documented business process, with procedures that imple-ment appropriate audit trails, approvals if required, and documentation related to internal controls in the process.  
The Application (ASP) would need to support USDA processing of approxi-mately 27,200 Telephone invoices and 14,100 utility invoices per month.  USDA requires that transaction details be retained near-line and available for a minimum of six years and three months. The offeror should discuss any archiving strategy, if necessary.   Further, the USDA would require comprehensive reports for these detailed transactions.  The offeror should include in the response, the suite of re-porting that is available and address the tools and processes for generating the re-ports and/or any files for reporting. 
There will be two interfaces required in addition to the ASP capabilities and other services which USDA is seeking:   
¿	Interfaces
†	Account detail and payment detailed data must be transmitted to USDA’s financial management system for recordation in the USDA general ledger and to make the payments to the utilities and telecom-munications providers. 
†	Energy reporting requirements – require an interface to the USDA real property system, the Corporate Property Automated Information Sys-tem (CPAIS) 
†	Energy Policy Act of 2005 - requires specific energy reduction consumption percentages for federal agencies; requires electric metering; requires specific percentage purchase of renewable en-ergy.
†	E.O. 13123 “Greening the Government Through Efficient Energy Management” requires detailed information and reporting federal agencies energy/utility use.
†	E.O. 13327  “Federal Real Property Asset Management”  promotes the efficient and economical use of Federal real property resources in accordance with their value as national assets, and more specifi-cally requires identification and reporting of operating and mainte-nance (O&M) costs for all owned and leased assets, both buildings and structures.
Ø	Other data files for Business Intelligence, as specified by USDA.
USDA will require the ASP to participate in two annual disaster recovery exer-cises and will require the ASP offerors to discuss continuity of operations for ASP hosting and other services to ensure the continuity of USDA’s business process. USDA will also require vendor participation in the annual fiscal year consolidated financial statements audit.  This may consist of providing data extracts, source documents, application process controls or other types of information related to the audit.   
 This Utilities and Telecommunications payments processing and analysis mod-ernization initiative will require integration with financial and real property sys-tems, realignment of affected business processes, and clear communication to stakeholders. A successful Utilities and Telecommunications process moderniza-tion will result in improved financial management reporting, accountability, and decision making throughout USDA and its agencies. It will also further USDA’s implementation of key provisions in the President’s Management Agenda, eGov requirements, and other regulatory mandates.
USDA is pursuing an efficient and integrated approach that builds on government, industry, and project management best practices for securing the services of an ASP package and the system integration expertise to implement it.  At its core, this approach will use a performance-based acquisition strategy that is based on effective planning and requirements gathering consistent with USDA IT policy and system development lifecycle (SDLC) guidance, and Capability Maturity Model (CMM) level 2 or other similar processes. USDA plans to manage the Modernization using critical components of earned-value management methods for program planning, reporting, and management.

<SUBJECT>Q -- Sole source Intent
<DESC>The 10th Mission Support Group, Directorate of Contracting, United States Air Force Academy Colorado, intends to award a sole source commercial purchase order to Cerner Corporation.  This is based on the requirement to up-grade eight (8), 18GB hard drives for the Cerner, Operating Room Database Management Application (ORMA) at the USAF Academy hospital.  

The sole source justification approved by the Contracting Officer is as follows:

1.	The requirement if for the up-grade of eight (8), 18GB Hard Drives and support for the Cerner Operating Room Database Management Application (ORMA) at the USAF Academy Hospital.  The ORMA Server, Software, and end-user license agreements are copyrighted and used for our surgical documentation, for patient records.  The software application support is not available from any other source.  The system meets the needs of the Surgical Suite Flight at the USAF Academy Hospital.  ORMA was purchased with the understanding that it meets the sole needs of this department and has been fully operational now for over 1 year.  The system now needs to be up-graded, as stated above Cerner Corporation is the only company that can provide, install and service the upgrades to the system.

2.	We now have approximately 3 months of storage capacity left, with our current system at 90% filled capacity.  With the addition of more disc space to the system, we will gain 2 more years of use.  During this time, a search for a bigger system will be accomplished, but until then, this system should be up-graded as soon as possible.

3.	Cerner Corporation is the only known source that can satisfy the government’s requirement

<SUBJECT>10 - Remote Weapon System Evaluation
<DESC>The US Army Armament Research, Development & Engineering Center (ARDEC), Picatinny, NJ would like to offer its expertise to companies that have  designed and/or produced light weight remote weapon stations (less than  200 pounds including gun and ammunition).  The objective is to provide  an expert technical assessment of your lightweight remote weapon station  system that includes an evaluation of the functional capabilities of the  system in our laboratory and indoor firing range.  The system will be hard  mounted to a static platform and mounted on our 6 degree of freedom motion  simulator and will consist of performance testing to stress the system  capabilities.  As a result, ARDEC will deliver a detailed technical report  that will not only provide a technical assessment of your system (strengths and weaknesses) but also an expert analysis of your system's functional  capabilities (or lack thereof), including recommendations on functionality  based on our understanding of how the system will be operated by US  Warfighters. ARDEC can provide this service based on our specialized facilities and our  expert knowledge of weapon systems, both technical (design) and operational  (soldier needs).  ARDEC is the Army's Center for Remote Weapon Systems, as  well as the associated weapons and ammunition. Given that the US Army's goal is to enhance competition, be advised that  ARDEC is offering this opportunity to all developers/producers of  lightweight remote weapon stations.  Be assured that we will diligently  protect any proprietary information, as required by law.  We will not share  any proprietary information (to include the results of the assessment) with  anyone outside the US Army.  Also be advised that any data resulting from  this assessment will not be included in future competitive procurement  actions unless the contractor submits it themselves.  This offer is open  to international companies, however, non-US companies are advised that  these services will require compliance with U.S. export control laws. We envision using a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA,  15 USC 3710a) to effect this arrangement.  We estimate that it will cost  approximately $20,600 (US) to reimburse ARDEC for facility and labor costs  for the basic test plan described below.  Deviations from the test plan can  be negotiated and will likely change the final cost.  The basic terms of  the assessment are as follows.  ARDEC will provide you with the test plan  prior to any testing for your approval. You supply us a remote weapon station mount, including control package and  technical data on a loan basis (no cost to the government) for a period of  approximately 2-3 months.  ARDEC will supply the weapon (M240 or M249) and  ammunition for the evaluation.  The basic test will consist of functional  testing at ambient temperature on our laboratory hard stand and 6 degree of  freedom motion platform.  We will also perform static live fire in our  indoor firing range at ambient temperature mounted on a hardstand.  You are  welcome to have a representative present during any and all testing of your  system.  You are also welcome to perform any technical modifications to your  system during the test.  However, any repeat of testing as a result of your  modification is done at an additional cost to you. We at ARDEC believe that this valuable service will provide you with the  feedback you need to further mature your system. Responses to this announcement should be sent to the point of contact  listed below.  Responses shall include:  Company name, location, size (# of  employees), and point of contact information;  technical description of the  remote weapon station, including pictures and description of maturity level;  any current or planned military users of the product; and month and year  when the system would be available for delivery to ARDEC. Note:  This is not to be construed as a solicitation and is not a commitment  by the Government to ultimately issue an IFB, RFP, RFQ or contract.  No  reimbursement for any costs incurred by the respondents will be made. <BR> FOR BETTER VIEWING OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT, PLEASE CLICK THE LINK BELOW UNDER  ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.

<DESC>This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation for professional, scientific, and technical services prepared in accordance with the FAR Subpart 12.6 and FAR Subpart 13.106.     This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.     The procurement is being issued as a request for quotation.     Submit offers on Solicitation Number: 2006-Q-32307.  The solicitation is being issued as a request for quotation.  he solicitation documents and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Action Circular 2005-04, dated June 8, 2005.  This acquisition will be processed under Simplified Acquisition Procedures and is not a Small Business Set-Aside.  The North American Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 541990. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has a requirement for a vendor to measure the rate of, and risk factors for amplification of resistance to second-line drugs where amplification is defined as second-line drug resistance that develops during treatment.  This will be determined by examining the drug susceptibility test (DST) results of a follow-up isolate compared to a baseline isolate.  DNA fingerprinting will ensure that the same strain of TB is being observed.  Standardized patient and laboratory data will be collected to examine factors that may affect amplification of resistance.  MDR TB treatment outcomes will also be evaluated to determine the impact of amplification of resistance to 2nd-line drugs.

I.	BACKGROUND
Russia is affected by high rates of multi-drug resistant (MDR) Tuberculosis (TB), which is an indication of poor TB control in the past.  In the same way MDR TB develops from (mis)use of first-line drugs, expanded use of second-line drugs (SLDs) will result in the emergence of resistance to SLDs.  Foreseeing this problem, the World Health Organization established the Green Light Committee (GLC) to provide access to low-cost, high-quality SLDs to TB control programs that will use them properly.  To obtain these drugs, the TB program must demonstrate political commitment, adequate financial resources, solid basic TB services by international standards, laboratory and programmatic capacity for MDR TB, and a clinical protocol consistent with WHO guidelines for Directly Observed Therapy Short Course (DOTS)-Plus programs.  The GLC evaluates, provides technical assistance, and monitors the project for adherence and outcomes.  The experience of GLC-approved DOTS-Plus programs will provide evidence for strategies to combat MDR TB in Russia and worldwide.
To assist the Russian Federation in addressing the problem of MDR TB, this project will evaluate the extent to which the GLC has achieved its goals of increasing access while preventing resistance to second-line anti-TB drugs.  

II.	PURPOSE
The project is a multinational, prospective, observational study of patients being treated with second-line drugs for MDR TB.  The primary goal is to measure the rate of, and risk factors for amplification of resistance to second-line drugs where amplification is defined as second-line drug resistance that develops during treatment.  This will be determined by examining the drug susceptibility test (DST) results of a follow-up isolate compared to a baseline isolate.  DNA fingerprinting will ensure that the same strain of TB is being observed.  Standardized patient and laboratory data will be collected to examine factors that may affect amplification of resistance.  MDR TB treatment outcomes will also be evaluated to determine the impact of amplification of resistance to 2nd-line drugs.

III.	SCOPE OF WORK
The contractor will assist CDC in developing and implementing this research project in Russia, by providing appropriate technical, operational, and administrative support.  This will include obtaining to obtain official approval of the project protocol in the Russian Federation (RF) by the RF Ministry of Health and Social Development, Federal TB Research Institutes, and local authorities in Tomsk and Arkhangelsk oblasts.

 The Brand Name or Equal Justification follows: 

1.	The Electronic Warfare (EW) Directorate requests the Brand Name or Equal Purchase of Quantum 3D’s eight channel Independence PC Image Generator System.

2.	The Quantum 3D Independence System (IG) will be used to drive the 360 degree out the window field of view graphics and will be used in lieu of Silicon Graphics, Inc. MIPS based technology currently in use in the F-35 Manned Flight Simulators.  The new PC based IGs represent significant advances in performance over other systems currently in use. The salient functional characteristics that are essential to the Electronic Warfare Directorate are: 

·	Must meet current Joint Strike Fighter Program Office (JPO) and Lockheed Martin (LM) requirements in support of the current A.4 Program Introduction Document.
·	The units are currently in use and will continue to be used at LM Ft. Worth Verification Simulator (VSIM) labs as well as the LM Marietta Air Combat Simulator (ACS) and Edwards AFB mini-ACS labs.
·	LM approves unit hardware and software architecture for use in the verification of systems software against the Joint Contract Specification (JCS).
·	Quantum 3D visual and electro-optical databases are based on LM VSIM lab requirements. 

3.	Currently Quantum 3G Independence IGs are the only known brand of this type of technology currently being used by LM in support of the VSIM visual and electro-optical requirements.  Since LM is driving the requirements for the government support facilities it is currently the only known brand that can meet the Electronic Warfare Directorates requirement.  

4.	Since LM drives the system requirements for the government support facilities and we are obligated by the A.4 PID to replicate the VSIM labs as much as possible there is very little we can do in preventing brand name situations in the future.


Offerors are required to submit with their quote enough information for the Government to evaluate the minimum requirements detailed in this synopsis.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for a commercial item prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation number is RA1341-06-RP-0118 and is being issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-09.  The NAICS code is 334519 and the small business size standard is 500 employees.  This procurement is Full and Open Competition.  Any amendment(s) hereto will only be published on the Federal Business Opportunities website.  

GENERAL STATEMENT

The Materials Reliability Division (MRD) of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has a need for an instrument for making measurements known as Instrumented Indentation or Nanoindentation. In these measurements, a precisely-shaped diamond point or tip is applied to the surface of a material to be characterized. The force and displacement are recorded. The resulting record is analyzed to deduce values of the elastic modulus and hardness of the material. Modern microelectronic devices and the new nanotechnology rely on very small material bodies with distinct material properties. For example, in microelectronics, thin metal films on silicon wafer substrates often have thicknesses of 500 nanometers or less. The required instrument shall provide the appropriate range and resolution of the force and displacement measurement and control apparatus and systems, including hardware and software, to provide scientifically and technically useful characterization of such materials. Displacement sensitivities measured in picometers (1 meter divided by 1 followed by 12 zeroes) and force sensitivities in the nanoNewtons (1 Newton divided by 1 followed by 9 zeroes) are sought. The need is for a top-of-the-line, research-grade instrument.

Clearly measuring and controlling such small forces and displacements requires apparatus carefully designed and constructed for stability and vibration-isolation. Useful scientific studies of materials often require control of the location where the indenter tip is applied to the surface, so that special features such as grain boundaries or grain interiors in metals can be studied. It is expected that any instrument purchased under this request for proposals will be equipped with a system for at least high-resolution optical imaging of the specimen surface before and after the indentation. NIST is interested in the capability of a contractor to provide advanced imaging capability, such as atomic force microscopy (AFM), as a field upgrade to the Nanoindenter.

Tests are performed under computer control; it is expected that any instrument purchased under this request for proposals will be equipped with a computer and the needed software and accessories necessary to perform the tests and provide full documentation, including force-displacement records and deduced elastic modulus and hardness values. The computer shall be fully compatible with the on-site computer network (see item #11).

A complete instrument ready for use is sought; the instrument should be capable of being demonstrated upon receipt, by testing a specimen supplied by the manufacture or by NIST.  

Due to the unavailability of funds, NIST intends to purchase only the baseline Nanoindentation System, but requires the option to upgrade the system if funding should become available.  Additionally, the baseline instrument shall be a stand-alone piece of equipment, not an add-on attachment to another piece of equipment.

Because apparatus of the type sought has been sold commercially for some years now, NIST wants to be sure that it is purchasing an instrument that has the advantages of commercial experience built in. Therefore NIST has included some conditions to assure itself that the contractor is capable of supplying a highest-quality, research-grade instrument.

General Conditions

•	Equipment shall be a current year production model and not a prototype or one-of-a-kind system. There shall be at least 5 working units of the proposed make and model operating currently in the field.
•	The temperature and vibration stability of the laboratory environment that is required to allow the instrument to meet its specifications shall be stated. Required utilities such as electrical power, compressed air, and running water shall be specified and shall be within the capabilities of a typical research laboratory environment.
•	Upon request, the contractor shall provide a demonstration to a representative of NIST, at a date and time to be agreed upon, at some location within the continental USA, of an instrument that meets the specifications as offered in the proposal prior to award of the contract.

•	The Contractor shall provide at least a one year warranty.

•	The Contractor is notified that the instrument will not be accepted, and will not be paid for, until after verification of the equipment capabilities.  The verification testing will commence at the end of on-site installation and training.  It is anticipated that the acceptance testing period will have a duration of 3 weeks.  If adjustments to the equipment are needed to enable it to meet its specifications, the acceptance testing period will be extended accordingly.

•	The contractor shall have sufficient instrument service and repair capability accessible to NIST Boulder, so that repairs can be completed with a turnaround time of one week or less in the absence of unusual circumstances.

•	The contractor shall provide a minimum of one (1) day on-site installation and one (1) day on-site training.

•	Delivery shall be F.O.B. Destination (Boulder, CO) and shall occur within 90 days or less from receipt of contract award.

EVALUATION CRITERIA

Critical items for Baseline Instrument

1. Force Sensitivity, resolution, precision and accuracy.  The basis for the specifications offered, e. g. traceability or use of standard measurement methods and specific reference specimens, shall be documented. A practical application of such an instrument’s force sensitivity is the minimum detectable contact force. A specified value of the minimum detectable contact force, including documentation of how the value was obtained, is of interest. The practical force sensitivity is limited by the noise floor of an instrument. The noise floor of the instrument offered, defined as the smallest physically significant change in force that can actually be measured by the instrument, is of interest. Specification of the force noise floor should include documentation of the conditions under which it was measured; in particular, NIST would like to know what quality of laboratory environment, in terms of temperature and vibrational stability, is needed to achieve the specified values. Relevant quantities would include the upper limit of the rate of ‘drift’ of the indicated force value with time, the averaging time used externally or built into the instrumentation to achieve this value, and the frequency dependence of the force ‘noise’. 
2. Force Range.  A range sufficient for indenting metal films is sought. Optional high-force capability is considered a non-priority item. If a “high force” option is available, it should be listed and priced with the optional equipment, because high force is not viewed as critical for this purchase. 
3. Displacement (as used in the force-displacement curve, meaning displacement perpendicular to the specimen surface) sensitivity, resolution, precision and accuracy.  The basis for the specifications offered, e. g. traceability or use of standard measurement methods and specific reference specimens, shall be documented. The practical displacement sensitivity is limited by the noise floor of an instrument. The noise floor of the instrument offered, defined as the smallest physically significant change in displacement that can actually be measured by the instrument, is of interest. Specification of the displacement noise floor should include documentation of the conditions under which it was measured; in particular, NIST would like to know what quality of laboratory environment, in terms of temperature and vibrational stability, is needed to achieve the specified values. Relevant quantities would include the upper limit of the rate of ‘drift’ of the indicated displacement value with time, the averaging time used externally or built into the instrumentation to achieve this value, and the frequency dependence of the displacement ‘noise’. If a correction for “machine compliance” (as discussed in item 5 below) is used to reach the specified value of displacement accuracy during a normal instrumented indentation measurement, a brief statement of how the correction is applied and typical numerical values should be specified. If no such correction is needed, the verification that it is not needed should be documented. A displacement resolution less sensitive than 0.1 nanometer will not receive the full score for this item.
4. Displacement Range, up to a practical limit useful for the required measurements. A useful displacement range of at least 15 micrometers has been recommended by a NIST expert in this area. The useful displacement range of the instrument offered should be specified. 
5. Stability of the indicated displacement value against changes in the imposed force. In instrumented indentation measurements, the relationship between: a) The amount of displacement of the sharp diamond tip into the specimen material; and b) The force applied to produce this displacement, is critical. Under certain conditions this relationship can be expressed as a ‘compliance’, which is defined as a change in displacement divided by the change of the associated force. Depending on the particular design of the instrument, corrections for deflections of parts of the instrument itself that are produced by the imposed force may be necessary, because the ‘raw’ measured displacement value may be the sum of the desired displacement, which is the displacement of the tip into the specimen, and an extraneous displacement contributed by the deflection of the apparatus. These extraneous deflections are termed “machine compliance.” The larger is this quantity, the greater is the possibility of measurement errors. The need for corrections for “machine compliance,” or the absence thereof, should be documented in the proposal; specific methods and reference specimens used for this determination should be documented. In particular, the typical range of values of the “machine compliance” should be documented if it comes into the typical measurement procedure used for instrumented indentation measurements. 
6. Resolution and practicality of the imaging system, of whatever sort, built in to the instrument to preview the specimen surface to be indented and to measure the surface after indentation. An optical system with the capability to record digital still images at magnifications of at least several hundred is considered critical. Practical and workable interoperability of the imaging system with the placement of indents shall be documented. Priority is on capability to preview the specimen and accurately place the test indentations relative to pre-existing surface features (see item #7). NIST is aware of the possibility that this capability, particularly the acquisition and storage of digital images, may not be present on a ‘baseline’ instrument. However, NIST considers this capability to be crucial for a NIST instrument. NIST expects to purchase this capability and its cost will be considered to be part of the base cost of the instrument. 
It is likely that only an optical imaging option will be purchased initially. Therefore, the capability of the system to be retrofitted in the field at some later date with advanced imaging tools such as atomic force microscopy (AFM) will be considered. Sample images of a specimen surface and accompanying documentation of the time required to obtain them, and documentation of relevant other specific conditions of the imaging operation, shall be included with the proposal. Capability for scientifically useful post-indentation measurements of surface displacements is of interest and will be considered. Extra equipment needed to obtain the post-indentation measurement capability shall be listed with the optional equipment. The practicality, including cost, of adding this capability at a later date as a field upgrade should be specified.
7. Placement of test indentations relative to pre-existing surface features. These instruments typically move the specimen between one or more imaging stations and the indentation station. Accurate and reproducible motion is needed to accurately place test indentations relative to pre-existing surface features. The typical placement accuracy of which the instrument is capable shall be specified. If different grades of the specimen support and stationing systems (sometimes called, the moveable table) are available, the performance of the options available shall be specified in quantitative terms. Accuracy of placement within at least 2 micrometers is viewed as critical for the intended use of this instrument. NIST is aware that an optional ‘high-accuracy table’ may be offered by certain vendors. A high accuracy table, relative to its specified placement accuracy, shall be listed as an option.
8. Capability for measurement of mechanical response of the indenter-specimen contact under small force/displacement oscillations superposed on the main load, for sensitive detection of first contact and for measurement of the contact stiffness continuously along the load-displacement curve. This item includes consideration of the resonant frequency of the indenter head; high resonant frequency, up to a practical limit, would be preferred because measurements are made at frequencies well below the instrument’s resonance. NIST is interested in the range of frequencies that can be used for such a measurement, particularly the higher frequencies. NIST is aware of the possibility that this capability may not be present on a baseline instrument. However, NIST considers this capability to be crucial. NIST expects to purchase this capability and its cost will be considered to be part of the base cost of the instrument. Instruments which do not offer this capability will not be considered for purchase.
9. Many specimens of interest to NIST will be mounted on standard SEM (scanning electron microscope) specimen stubs. Typically these have a pedestal with a diameter of 0.5 inch mounted on a stem with a diameter of 0.125 inch. The total height is about 0.5 inch plus a specimen which can be considered to be 0.1 inch thick. The compatibility of the offered instrument with such specimens shall be described.
10. Availability of replacement indenter tips, including the standard Berkovich geometry and non-standard tips such as spherical, cylindrical, square-pyramid, cube corner, etc. shall be documented. 
11. Computer hardware and software supplied as part of the instrument shall be suitable for connecting to the NIST network. Microsoft Windows XP (trademark) is the most widely supported network operating system at NIST.
12.  Items which may not be listed as part of the baseline instrument, but which we consider essential, are:
 a) video imaging, with digital image storage and archiving, of the specimen surface; and
 b) the capability of the instrument to superimpose on the main force small oscillations of 
     force, and record the resulting oscillations in displacement, during an indentation. See 
     critical items 6 and 8 above. 

Lower Priority Optional Items (to be priced separately)
These items may be needed in the future. For the present purchase NIST wants to know about the availability of these items as future upgrades to the instrument.
12. Measurement at temperatures above and below room temperature of interest. Such temperature capability is not of primary interest for this purchase, and shall be listed with the optional equipment. 
13. Horizontal displacement and force control and measurement capability, often used for scratch tests, is of interest, but is not of primary interest. If this capability is offered, it should be priced with the optional equipment. 
14. Control options offered or available as future upgrades: displacement control, force control, and other if any. Advantages of multiple control options, beyond that needed to perform a basic indentation test, should be specifically described.

<DESC>This is an amendment to clarify questions regarding brand name justification. 

The BEP will not accept equal products for the DELL requirement. This is due to the following memorandum submitted by Deputy CIO Staff of BEP. 

The Chief Information Officer Directorate has made a determination to standardize on state-of-the-art, DELL PCs throughout the Bureau, both in the Washington, DC and Fort Worth, TX facilities. Standardized Dell network PCs provide for standardized motherboards containing standardized drivers that facilitate network management both with regard to initial imaging as well as subsequent network administration/management via the Bureau's Microsoft System Management Server (SMS). The Bureau's previous policy to purchase multi-brand PCs did not provide for standardized network management. Additionally, a number of these low cost PCs did not facilitate provisions for additional memory. When they did, different mother boards were oftentimes required, as were different network cards. 

Standardization not only facilitates network administration/management, but also provides for enhanced asset management across the enterprise. Dell PCs, providing for standardized mother boards across multiple generations of PCs, best meet the Bureau's needs.
