<DESC>INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION (ISS) WATER PROCESSOR ASSEMBLY (WPA) AMBIENT CATALYTIC REACTOR CATALYST DEVELOPMENT <p> NASA/MSFC plans to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) for the procurement of the development of a high efficiency water processing oxidation catalyst capable of operation at ambient pressure and a temperature below the boiling point. <p> In summary, water is reclaimed on the International Space Station (ISS) from crew latent, crew urine, and Sabatier reactor product water.  The Water Processor Assembly (WPA) uses adsorption and ion exchange to remove the majority of dissolved contaminants; however, volatile organic chemicals are not effectively removed via adsorption.	These contaminants are treated with a Catalytic Reactor that oxidizes the organics at elevated temperature (above the normal boiling point of water) and with a gaseous oxygen feed. Operation at elevated temperature results in a more complex system design compared to a reactor that could operate at ambient pressure.  However, catalysts currently available have insufficient activity to achieve complete oxidation of the organic load at a temperature less than the boiling point.  The purpose of this research is to develop an improved catalyst that can completely oxidize the desired organic load at ambient pressure and a temperature < 200F.  The contaminant level defined as the requirement represents the nominal concentrations observed on ISS, whereas the goal level represents the specification levied on the current flight catalyst.  Complete oxidation to carbon dioxide is preferred, but the requirement is to achieve < 3 mg/L of non-ionic Total Organic Carbon (TOC).   <p> The Government does not intend to acquire a commerical item using FAR Part 12. <p> All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. Evaluation and award of the solicitation will be based on the evaluation criteria stated in the Request for Proposal.  The basis for award will be Best Value utilizing the Trade Off Process as described in FAR 15.101-1. <p> The anticipated release date of the RFP is on or about April 14, 2014 with an anticipated offer due date of on or about June 5, 2014. <p> This presolicitation synopsis is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government pay for the information submitted in response.	Respondents will not be notified of the results.  All contractual technical question must be submitted in writing by email.  Telephone questions will not be accepted. <p> Prospective offerors shall notify this office of their intent to submit an offer. It is the offeror's responsibility to monitor the Internet cite for the release of the solicitation and amendments (if any).

<p><strong>Description<br /></strong>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG), is anticipating to award a Firm-Fixed Price non-competitive purchase order to the Cleveland Clinic Lerner Research Institute in Cleveland, Ohio to provide assays of TMAO, carnitine, and Choline for 1500 samples obtained from the ongoing ATBC trials. Because this order is to continue on-going research already being performed by the Cleveland Clinic Lerner Research Institute, the Cleveland Clinic Lerner Research Institute is the only source capable of fulfilling this requirement.</p>
<p>The services herein are being procured in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures as authorized by FAR Part 13.106-1 (b)(1). The North American Industry Classification System code is 541990 and the business size standard is $14 million.</p>
<p>Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation. This will be awarded as a firm fixed price type contract.</p>
<p>Period of Performance shall be 5.5 months from date of award (est. 5/1/2014-10/15/2014).</p>
<p><strong>Background</strong><br />There is convincing evidence for a role of red and processed meat in colorectal cancer, but the mechanisms underlying the association between red/processed meat and colorectal cancer are not clear. Colorectal cancer is the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths in both men and women in the U.S. Elucidating the mechanism underlying the association between red/processed meat and colorectal cancer may help to identify intervention targets, which could reduce colorectal cancer morbidity and mortality. Recent studies demonstrated that trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) is produced from choline and carnitine, compounds found in large quantities in red/processed meat and produced by gut bacteria. Moreover, TMAO is associated with cardiovascular disease, atherosclerosis, and inflammation. NCI proposes that gut microbiota may be a major determinant in modifying colorectal cancer risk associated with red/processed meat intake via TMAO production. TMAO and the gut microbiota may account for inconsistent results from past studies, and may highlight the mechanism by which red/processed meat is associated with colorectal cancer. TMAO has been associated with increased inflammatory markers, which may impact cancer risk, and may also contribute to formation of the carcinogen N-nitrosodimethylamine.</p>
<p>The Cleveland Clinic Lerner Research Institute will assess whether carnitine/choline and TMAO are associated with colorectal cancer in a case-cohort study nested in the ongoing Alpha-Tocopherol Beta-Carotene Trial (ATBC). Our primary aim is to determine the association between TMAO, as a potential integrative measure of red/processed meat intake and the gut microbiota, and colorectal cancer. The overarching goal is to provide insight into the mechanism underlying the association between red/processed meat intake and colorectal cancer.</p>
<p><strong>Purpose and Objectives of the Procurement</strong><br />This procurement will assess the role of carnitine/choline and TMAO in risk of colorectal cancer by assaying these compounds in sera in a case-cohort study nested within the ATBC Trial which is ongoing at the Cleveland Clinic Lerner Research Institute. This procurement will utilize serum samples from ~750 colorectal cancer cases and 750 controls in ATBC. Assays will be completed in Dr. Hazen's laboratory at the Cleveland Clinic, which has extensive expertise in TMAO plasma measurements. Cleveland Clinic Lerner Research Institute will measure serum carnitine, choline, and TMAO. TMAO will be measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS), the gold standard method for measuring TMAO. The Hazen laboratory already has panels set up to assay TMAO and many other analytes with this method. Choline and carnitine will be analyzed by stable isotope dilution LC/MS/MS analyses using established methods. For all assays, the laboratory will be blinded to case-cohort status. Each batch will include an equal distribution of colorectal cancer cases and disease-free individuals. 10% of the batch will include quality control samples used to calculate assay coefficients of variation.</p>
<p>Our primary aim is to determine the main effects of TMAO on colorectal cancer. In order to fully explore this association, this procurement will also investigate the associations between serum precursors of TMAO (carnitine, choline) and the disease endpoint.</p>
<p>Secondary aims are to:<br />1. Since TMAO is a biomarker only recently studied in relation to any disease, we will explore the associations that are related to the proposed role of TMAO in colorectal cancer. Specifically, this procurement will investigate the association between meat intake and serum metabolites (TMAO, carnitine, choline). This procurement will also explore the interrelationship between plasma TMAO, carnitine, and choline. Lastly, this procurement will determine whether there is an association between meat intake and colorectal cancer in the overall ATBC cohort (~29,000 men; ~ 825 cases) as well as the subset in which TMAO will be measured (~700 cases).<br />2. Investigate, in an exploratory analysis, whether TMAO is a mediator of the association between red/processed meat and colorectal cancer.</p>
<p><strong>Contractor Requirements</strong><br />The contractor shall perform the following tasks:<br />1. Receive and catalog approximately 1500 serum samples. The receipt of biologic samples should be logged in a MS Excel file including the information of ID, amount of serum received, and date of receipt. To facilitate this, an excel file will be provided by the Government and will include: sample ID and volume provided. The Contractor will add the date of receipt, an internal ID, test/assay date, and values for each serum measurement of interest.<br />2. Analyze carnitine, choline, and TMAO in 1500 serum samples using LC/MS/MS and record the results in the Excel file above.<br />3. Provide a plan for determining if the replicate values are in agreement and for repeat duplicates, as needed. Any insurmountable problems in the analysis of samples shall be reported to the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) within three days of when they happen.<br />4. Send data to the NCI.<br />5. The dates of service will extend 5.5 months from the date of award (estimated period of performance is 05/01/2014-10/15/2014).</p>
<p><br />This notice is not a request for competitive quotation. However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities. The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can perform the requirement. Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 12:00 PM EST, on March 20, 2014.

<DESC>Title: Operation and Maintenance of the Alamogordo Primate Facility (APF) <br />Program: National Institutes of Health (NIH) / Office of the Director (OD)<br />NAICS CODE: 541940 --Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services-- Veterinary Services
<p><br />Pre-Solicitation Notice<br />This is a notice of intent, not a request for a proposal. A solicitation will be subsequently issued. The Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health (NIH), through the pending acquisition, intends to award a Cost plus Fixed Fee Type Contract to procure Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services-- Veterinary Services for the Office of the Director, National Institutes of Health (OD, NIH)</p>
<p>BACKGROUND<br />The National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the U.S. Air Force (USAF) have an agreement to house and care for chimpanzees at USAF's facility named Alamagordo Primate Facility (APF) located in Alamogordo, New Mexico. MAINTENANCE OF CHIMPANZEES IS REQUIRED; NO RESEARCH IS REQUIRED OR ALLOWED. The current permit use agreement between the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the U.S. Air Force (USAF) prescribe that no invasive research shall be conducted on the chimpanzees currently held at the APF. In the event a decision is made to include any or all of those animals in further new or on-going NIH-approved research, the animals shall be transported off-base.</p>
<p>SUMMARY<br />The National Institutes of Health (NIH) requires a Contractor to operate and maintain the APF and its animal care and use program. The APF occupies a series of closely located buildings on the Holloman Air Force Base (HAFB). Each of Buildings 1301, 1302, 1303, and 1304 can house approximately 72 animals, in 12 dens holding approximately 6 animals each. Thus, the theoretical caging capacity is approximately 288 chimpanzees. The current primate population at APF is 160 chimpanzees caged in single sex groups. No research will be conducted. All the chimpanzees have been exposed to microorganisms such as hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), or both. These chimpanzees need to be routinely monitored and cared for. Few of the 160 chimpanzees are vasectomized or implanted with Norplant. NO MORE ANIMALS CAN BE BROUGHT ON BASE OR EXCHANGED FOR EXISTING ANIMALS. Any NIH-owned animals taken off the base cannot be returned to the base. The number of chimpanzees is expected to decrease over time as: they are needed elsewhere, they die due to natural causes, or possibly they are retired to sanctuaries.</p>
<p>MANDATORY CRITERIA<br />Nonhuman primates can carry a variety of zoonotic agents that can be transmitted to humans and other non-infected animals. For example, some of these infectious agents, such as hepatitis B and C, may have been acquired through previous exposure and may persist in the animal for a significant period of its lifetime. These potential risks increase the importance of identifying infectious hazards for humans working with nonhuman primates. Therefore the offeror must demonstrate the following:<br />1) Proper experience in the identification, handling, and maintenance of infected chimpanzees. <br />2) Proper experience and knowledge of nonhuman primate infectious agents, including hepatitis B and C agents.<br />Proposals submitted in response to the pending solicitation will be evaluated on the following factors:</p>
<p>EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD<br />The major factors for this solicitation include technical (which encompasses experience), past performance and cost/price. Offerors are advised that the award will be made to that offeror whose proposal provides the best overall value to the Government.<br />The evaluation will be based on the demonstrated capabilities of the prospective Contractor in relation to the needs of the project set forth in the solicitation. The merits of each proposal will be evaluated carefully. Each proposal must document the feasibility of successful implementation of the requirements of this solicitation. Offerors must submit information sufficient to evaluate proposals based on the detailed criteria listed below:<br /><br />Evaluation Factor 1: Competence in the operation and maintenance of a large chimpanzee facility conforming to all Federal laws, Federal policies, National Resource Council (NRC) and Institute for Laboratory Animal research (ILAR) recommendations.<br />&bull; Adequacy of proposed procedures for veterinary care and animal husbandry of more than a hundred chimpanzees; dealing with biohazards; obtaining IACUC approvals; and preventing the APF chimpanzees from breeding.<br />&bull; Ability to comply with all applicable Federal and State laws and regulations pertaining to the acquisition, registration, care disposition, and transportation of nonhuman primates.<br />&bull; Adequacy of the proposed administration infrastructure, either on-site at the APF or at the Contractor's main facility, that will adequately support the veterinary and technical services.<br />&bull; Experience in and technical approach for fulfilling the following requirements:<br /><br />a. Routine animal care, housing, nutrition, hygiene.<br />b. Sanitation and cleaning of the equipment and facilities.<br />c. Environmental monitoring of facilities, including vermin control and security.<br />d. Animal health surveillance, observations, identification, written and computerized record keeping.<br />e.

Veterinary medical assistance, treatments/medications, induction of anesthesia and surgical assistance.<br />g. Clinical laboratory technical support.<br />h. Interstate shipping of nonhuman primates.<br />i. Animal transportation within APF.<br />j. Ability to identify animals suitable for biomedical research.<br />k. Environmental enrichment for chimpanzees.<br />l. Maintenance of equipment and supplies or other logistical support.<br />m. Clerical and data entry support.<br />n. Appropriate management oversight.<br />o. Provision of required reports.</p>
<p>Evaluation Factor 2: Expertise and experience of proposed professional and support personnel. Personnel must possess extensive experience in nonhuman primate medicine and infectious diseases. The professional staff ( e.g.,Principal investigator/Director and veterinarians) will be evaluated, as appropriate, with respect to specialty board certification by the American College of Veterinary Laboratory Animal Medicine, advanced degrees, state veterinary licenses, residency training in laboratory animal medicine, and experience in managing a contract of this nature (past performance). The technical staff (e.g., Program Administrator, Behaviorist, Clinical Technician, Colony Manager, and laboratory animal caretakers) will be evaluated with respect to the American Association for Laboratory Animal Science technician certification and work experience related to chimpanzees infected with human pathogens. This criterion also includes the adequacy of the Contractor's proposed staffing plan and proposed OSH training program.</p>
<p>Evaluation Factor 3: Organizational Commitment<br />&bull; Experience of organization in managing a contract of this nature.<br />&bull; Evidence of commitment of the organization to provide the management oversight, support, staffing, quality control, assistance, and resources needed to perform the work at the APF.</p>
<p>A Request for Proposals (RFP) will be available electronically on www.fedbizopps.gov on/or about May 10, 2014. Responses to the RFP will be due 30 days after the release of the RFP.</p>

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City (NSWC PC) FL intends to award a sole source firm fixed price contract to ProModel Corporation of 556 East Technology Ave, Orem UT 84097 to develop and deliver specific functional enhancements to the commercially available ProModel&reg; software used in the NSWC PCD Process Analysis Laboratory (PAL) to facilitate and streamline currently manual processes. The enhancements consist of integration of the ProModel&reg; software with the Microsoft SharePoint Server 2010 used on the PAL network and implement a Multi-View Enhancement to provide the capability to view different, non-overlapping parts of a model simultaneously. The anticipated period of performance is 12 months after award of the contract. This requirement is unsuitable for full and open competition for the following reason. NSWC PCD has developed extensive modeling sets for various littoral warfare systems and programs. Use of any other product would invalidate these models and require additional time and expense to the Government to develop new models. The enhanced version of ProModel&reg; must be able to read, run, and edit models developed using earlier versions of ProModel&reg;. Since the ProModel&reg; software is commercial the Government has no rights in data to the design, architecture, or coding of the software. ProModel Corporation is the original developer and sole provider of the ProModel&reg; proprietary software. Given these facts, ProModel Corporation is the only vendor that can meet this requirement. Award is anticipated on or about 08/01/2014.
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. A determination by the government not to compete this proposed contract lies solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive requirement. The NAICS Code is 511210, software publishers, with a Small Business size standard of $35.5M. The FSC is 7030, ADP Software.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Transportation Volpe National Transportation Systems Center (Volpe) intends to conduct negotiations in anticipation of awarding a purchase order to Nordco Rail Services and Inspection Technologies (Nordco), a small business located in Ridgefield, CT on a basis of other than full and open competition under the authority of the test program for commercial items (section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996) as referenced in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 13.5. The order will be for one (1) Shuttlewagon Commander SWX315 Mobile Railway Car Mover Vehicle (Shuttlewagon MRCMV). The Government will utilize this car spotter vehicle primarily for two (2) types of operations; to spot and maneuver railway cars into and away from the loading areas from the servicing mainline railroad, and for off-rail configuration for hauling wheeled trailers. The car spotter vehicle will be used in and around railroad yards and dock shipping areas for locating and moving railway equipment where areas about the track are not suitable for truck traffic, and the use of a locomotive switcher would require needless shuttling. Based on market research done, the Government has found the Shuttlewagon MRCMV is the only commercially available solution able to meet the Government's needs. The Shuttlewagon MRCMV utilizes a non-weight transfer system to achieve desired tractive effort, which is needed so to attain the most efficient operation for end-of-train moving. It is also the only USA manufactured car spotter utilizing rubber tire traction for on-rail and on-road use without utilizing weight transfer to achieve the desired draw bar pull force. The Shuttlewagon MRCMV is solely manufactured and distributed by Nordco and they hold numerous patents on the technology. This is why the Government intends to conduct negotiations with Nordco on a basis of other than full and open competition. The applicable North American Industry Classification System number is 336510 with a size standard of 1,000 employees. There is no solicitation document available for this acquisition. As this procurement is for a commercial supply, interested parties shall make inquiries and/or provide capability information to the contact point shown in this notice within seven (7) calendar days after publication of this announcement, or by 1700 hours EST on Friday, 11 Apr 14. All timely responses received shall be considered by Volpe. Businesses will not be reimbursed for any costs associated with information submitted in response to this announcement.

Thread shall be hanging within flame in a double twisted construction to represent both needle and bobbin (looper) thread densities. <br>  <br> 6)	As an initial parameter, sewing threads shall be Heat Resistant and at a minimum demonstrate heat resistance in a 500 Degree F for minimum of 5 minute time per National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) 1977, Heat and Thermal Shrinkage Resistance Test. Threads shall be capable of retaining minimum of 80% break strength as compared to initial non-heated tests.  <br>  <br> 7)	It is a developmental goal to lower manufacturing costs for FR / HR threads, therefore threads shall not possess more than 30% by weight either Kevlar  and/ or Nomex  or combination of each within its' structure.  In other words, if so designed combinations of each fiber cannot exceed 30% weight. <br>  <br> 8)	FR finishes can be considered provided they are laundering resistant and pass all required test methods. <br>  <br> 9)	 Colorfastness to Laundering for threads shall pass AATCC TM 61 Test 2A after 3 cycles with thread dried after each cycle using. AATCC Evaluation Procedure 1 and 2, Gray Scale for Color Change and Staining respectively with a minimum of 3-4 rating. <br>  <br> 10)	Colorfastness to light testing shall be conducted to assure no color fading per AATCC TM 16 after 40 hrs or 170kJ using AATCC Evaluation Procedure 1, Gray Scale for Color Change with minimum 3 - 4 rating.   <br>   <br> 11)	Threads shall be capable of dyeing to color match typical Military shades such as Foliage Green 504, Coyote, Tan 499 or other. Final completed shade-match for contract delivery shall be determined at appropriate time toward completion.  <br>  <br> 12)	Threads shall be capable of withstanding minimum 5 min of high speed sewing using ASTM 301, lock stitch sewing machine. Threads shall be able to continue sewing in smooth, even manner via 4 layers of military FR fabric to be designated at appropriate time towards completion. Sewing machine speed shall be set to maximum speed.  Furthermore, completed thread stitch line shall be set-aside for minimum of 3 days to observe if there is wicking of thread lubricant or FR finish upon fabric surface as designated by a darkened area parallel to stitch line. Threads cannot stain base fabric in any manner. <br>  <br> 13)	 The thread must be Berry Amendment compliant, lower cost FR/HR sewing thread for use as an alternate to current Nomex and Kevlar threads for military uniforms, gloves and related end-item applications.  <br>  <br> 14)	Threads shall be capable of passing ASTM F 1930 - ,  quote mark Standard Test Method for Evaluation of Flame Resistant Clothing for Protection Against Simulations Using an Instrumented Manikin quote mark  such that no seams exhibit melting, opening, or degraded seam strength of no lower than 50% seam strength value compared to initial strengths. This shall represent final test criterion to be conducted at Natick Flammability Facility. Government shall produce FR garment representative of technology at time of completion of contract but in typical Army Combat Uniform design using typical LSc-2, SSa-2, 301, 516 or combination of stitch and seam types. <br>  <br> The proposed technical approach must clearly identify how and why the effort will be successful including the proposed materials required to develop the FR/HR sewing thread.  Concept development strategies without supporting technical information will be weighed negatively. .  Concept technology developed under this effort must be scalable to potential low rate production.   <br>  <br> The main effort should last approximately no more than 12 months from contract award.   <br>  <br> Technical reporting shall be conducted at a minimum, on a monthly basis and/or associated with significant technical milestones outlined in the concepts programmatic approach.  Technical reporting will require complete documentation of the research and development efforts including cost, schedule and performance updates.   <br>  <br> At the completion of the main effort, the contractor shall: <br>  <br> 1) Construct and deliver six (6) 20 quote mark  x 20 quote mark  sewn units using ASTM LSc-2 seam type in middle of swatch with designated military FR fabric, to be determined at appropriate time towards completion to conduct a 25 home laundering per AATCC TM 135-Machine cycle 1, Washing Temperature V, Drying Procedure A i, with drying in between for evaluation of colorfastness and/ or color change. Threads shall maintain standard shade color and not discolor in any manner. <br>  <br> 2) Include report of all aspects of FR / HR Thread manufacturing, Thread data based on internal laboratory testing, cost breakdown based on fiber content and related manufacturing processes, physical properties with focus on Tex size, break strength, elongation, length per pound data, plies, twist directions, related color fastness and other related details needed as basis to develop a FR / HR Mil-spec.   <br>  <br> 3) Deliver a minimum of 18 cones (500 yards minimum each cone), both sizes of FR/HR thread per designated military shade for Government confirmation FR/ HR, sewability, ASTM Manikin evaluations or other tests deemed pertinent. <br>  <br> All efforts are subject to availability of funds. <br>  <br> All interested firms are encouraged to submit a Concept Paper to NSRDEC in accordance with NSRDEC Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) Solicitation Number W911QY-13-R-0032, which can be found at https://www3.natick.army.mil.

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has a requirement for a Flight Simulator Motion Base.  The FAA operates a flight simulator of a twin engine aircraft typically used in air taxi or corporate operations.  The simulator is currently on a fixed base, and motion is required to perform studies of all-weather operations in the cockpit.  Space is limited in the simulator bay so large excusions are not feasible due to the amount of room for the envelope of motion.  Requirements for the base are provided in the attached document titled "Procurement Specification Motion Base.

The FAA will not pay for any information received or costs incurred for preparing responses to this announcement.  Therefore, any costs associated with a response to the RFQ are solely at the interested vendor's expense.

A tiered evaluation of offers will be used in source selection, and offers from other than small business concerns will only be considered after the determination that an insufficient number of offers from responsible small business concerns were received.  The CO will specify the tiered order of precedence for evaluating offers.  An example of a tiered order of precedence (descending in order) is: 

(a) Socially and economically disadvantaged business (SEDB) expressly certified by the Small Business Administration (SBA) for participation in SBA's 8(a) program.

(b) Service-disabled veteran owned small business (SDVOSB);

(c) Very small business;

(d) Small Business; and

(e) Other than small business.

Once offers are received, the CO will evaulate a single tier of offers according to the order of precedence specified above.  If no award can be made at the first tier. the evaluation will proceed to the next lower tier until award can be made with ample competition.

<DESC>NASA Kennedy Space Center (KSC) is hereby soliciting information about potential sources for the design, development, and manufacture of a mechanized device to contain and transfer supercritical xenon or a reference fluid of similar physical properties. The device will use electromechanical action (e.g., piston, bellows, diaphragm, or other mechanism) to transfer fluid between two reservoirs at pressures up to 1500 pounds per square inch gauge (psig). The accumulator is intended to be used for pilot-scale ground testing and a possible low-Earth orbit demonstration, and eventually scaled up to transfer fluid to a spacecraft in cis-lunar space. <p> The intent of this Request for Information (RFI) is to obtain information from industry to assist KSC in the development of this acquisition. NASA is soliciting initial intent of interest from all companies with past experience and qualifications in this type of design, fabrication, and qualification to the requirements of AIAA S-080 or a similar aerospace code. NASA reserves the right to share all information received in response to this RFI throughout NASA and to use all information submitted in response to this RFI in NASAs formulation of a solicitation seeking competitive proposals. However, any submitted competition sensitive data should be clearly marked as proprietary, and will only be shared with the NASA Xenon Transfer System team members. Although information contained herein represents current program content and acquisition planning, it is subject to change. Response to this RFI is requested within the context of the general approach described in the following paragraphs. <p> Preliminary Product Requirements: 1. Design code: AIAA S-080 or similar aerospace code approved by NASA.	Ground development units may be designed and fabricated to ASME B31.3 or similar with NASA approval. 2.

<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE. The Department of the Interior (DOI), U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), is conducting a MARKET SURVEY to determine the interest and capability of any firm eligible to compete under NAICS code 541360 with a Small Business Size Standard of $14.0 M for an upcoming requirement for the Crustal Geophysics and Geochemistry Science Center, in Denver, CO to provide Airborne Geophysical (non-engineering) Survey, Minnesota-Iowa Border Region.
THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION. ALL COST ASSOCIATED WITH PROVIDING INFORMATION AS REQUESTED BY THIS SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE SHALL BE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE CONTRACTOR. Submission is voluntary.
This requirement is for airborne gravity gradiometry and magnetic data as part of an airborne geophysical (non-engineering) survey covering portions of the Minnesota-Iowa border region.  The magnetic and gravity gradient system is required that can image the burial depth, internal lithologic variations, and structure of the buried igneous complex. These data are intended for rigorous inversion and interpretation of the 3-D geometry and lithology of Precambrian rocks in the region. The survey region is underlain by concealed Proterozoic mafic and silicic rocks, forming an igneous complex along the eastern margin of the Midcontinent Rift System.  The mafic rocks are thought to potentially host magmatic Ni-Cu-PGE deposits.  Burial depths to the igneous complex are thought to range from 200-600 meters beneath a package of Paleozoic sedimentary rocks.  
The USGS requires a platform that is well suited for near surface investigations and have the capability for recording magnetic and gravity gradiometry data, commonly a fixed-wing aircraft.  The contractor will be required to provide digitally recorded and processed airborne data. The data must be well calibrated and corrected for any system response and drift.  The requirement is for a minimum of 2,000 line km with up to an estimated total of 4,000 line km, if awarded.

In response to this announcement, please indicate your firm's socioeconomic status (e.g. small business, service-disabled veteran-owned, women owned, HUBZone, etc.)  This information will assist the Government in determining how small businesses can fit into the acquisition strategy.
A firm is considered small under NAICS code 541360 if their AVERAGE annual receipts for the preceding three (3) years were less than or equal to $14.0 million. Any information submitted is voluntary. If sufficient interest and capability is not received from small business firms, any solicitation may be issued as unrestricted without further consideration.
Interested small business firms, who feel that they can provide the airborne gravity gradiometry and magnetic data (based upon the criteria specified herein), are invited to submit, via email, an affirmative response to this announcement.  An affirmative response must include (1) references with contact names, email address, and phone numbers; and (2) a sample airborne gravity gradiometry and magnetic data set collected by the firm.

Your company must have a DUNs number and be registered on-line at the System for Award Management (SAM) www.sam.gov.

<p>1.0 DESCRIPTION OF ORGANIZATION<br />The United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) Wargame Center conducts Wargames, Rehearsal of Concept (ROC) drills, senior leader seminars, and other Special Operations Forces (SOF) Operational Planning Events in order to directly support the USSOCOM Commander in achieving operational and planning priorities for SOF. These events require visualizing, displaying, synchronizing, and rehearsing operational and mission concepts in terms of time, space and prioritization during multiple Commanders' directed leadership events. To meet this requirement, the Government has transformed the Wargame Center into a Wargame Theater with a Virtual Planning Workspace (VPW) capable of supporting many different types of events supporting various mission planning activities. To support many different types of commander required activities, leading edge technologies were utilized to create an interactive and seamless display environment supporting multiple users across all visual data displays - both on and off site. This statement of work requires hardware support for the VPW system and its capabilities.</p>
<p>1.1 TASK PURPOSE AND OVERALL OBJECTIVE<br />The overall objective of this SOW is to provide the Wargame Center and their staffs with technical hardware support for subject matter expertise for the VPW Image Generator and associated projectors and hardware.</p>
<p>The level of technical complexity varies from medium risk to high risk. The VPW system is new to the USSOCOM and thus requires highly skilled, technically competent individuals able to perform proficiently on the VPW hardware. The VPW system will be utilized for very high level General Officer / Flag Officer events and requires highly competent individuals to address any issues in the least amount of time as technically possible.</p>
<p>2.0 SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS:<br />2.1TECHNICAL &amp; MAINTENANCE SUPPORT<br />The contractor shall provide support to the Wargame Center in preparation for and in support of events. The contractor shall apply expertise in the VPW hardware. The contractor shall apply expertise in visualization of imagery in a 3D environment as well as hardware operation and manipulation.</p>
<p>The contractor will provide an expert level capability to diagnose, repair and maintain operational capability four (4) "Barco Galaxy" model number 4K-23 overhead projectors. The contractor must provide personnel trained as Barco Certified Experts to perform installation, basic maintenance as well as advanced diagnostics and repair for this effort. The contractor will ensure that all Projectors are tested and fully operational prior to an event and provide dedicated set up, operations, and troubleshooting during the event. It is not intended that the contactor supports the Waregame Center with a full time equivalent maintainer. Support will be episodic based upon the following support services:</p>
<p>Preventive Maintenance. The contractor will provide and adhere to a preventive maintenance schedule for all projector hardware. Maintenance procedures should be in accordance within industry standard timelines and must be provided to the Government within 10 days ARO. The contractor will be responsible for identifying the preventive maintenance required as well as performing such maintenance. Preventive maintenance must not interfere with scheduled Wargame Center events and is required to be coordinated with Wargame Center staff. Contractor may be required to perform maintenance during non-tradional hours (1700-0700) and potentially on weekends in order to not impede scheduled events that occur during 0700-1700 hours Monday through Friday. It is anticipated that preventive maintenance will occur quarterly but it is the responsibility of the contractor to determine such schedule and adhere to it as necessary.</p>
<p>Emergency Maintenance. Due to the nature of the high profile events in the SOCOM Wargame Center, the contractor must be able to respond onsite to an emergency equipment failure or malfunction within 48 hours. If spare parts are not on hand in the Wargame Center, the contractor must requisition emergency parts to expedite repair. Emergency equipment failures must return to fully operational status in no more than 5 business days. Contractor may be required to perform maintenance during non-tradional hours (1700-0700) and potentially on weekends in order to not impede scheduled events that occur during 0700-1700 hours Monday through Friday. USSOCOM conducts approximately 12 significant Wargame Center events each year, of which two are considered no-fail with the highest levels of DoD leadership involved.</p>

<DESC>INDUSTRY DAY ANNOUNCEMENT
<p>HQ AFMC/A4 and HAF/A4I will be offering an Industry Day on April 24-25, 2014 at Wright Patterson Air Force Base, Fairborn Ohio. The purpose of this meeting is to communicate with industry the AF Logistics IT Systems Strategy.</p>
<p>Our AF team is focused on developing a Logistics IT Strategy that establishes standardized processes, employing shared IT services, and driving efficiencies across supply, maintenance, product support, and deployment/distribution. These critical logistics business areas provide a framework in which we execute two major IT work streams. Stabilize and modernize operations of our existing, core logistics systems and transform processes to be more effective and efficient in meeting the warfighting missions. We are employing the Service Development and Delivery Process (SDDP) to help us, as a functional community, clearly articulate the business problems that we are attempting to solve.</p>
<p>Our first transformational initiative developed under this new strategy is Maintenance, Repair, and Overhaul (MRO), supporting depot operations. Our next priority for the transformation work streams targets developing the supply chain and product lifecycle management business process requirements needed to support this repair network.</p>
<p>Many of our industry and government experts have brought technologies, tools, and methods to our attention which may assist in the way ahead. This close partnership with industry is essential for success.</p>
<p>In addition to the capability initiatives and SDDP, we plan to discuss the AF Transformational Strategy, developments of "Digital Thread" and the AF Infrastructure Standardization.</p>
<p>This Industry Day is restricted to United States citizens. Due to room size constraints, each company division could be restricted to 3 representatives depending on total registration size. Those contractors interested in participating should e-mail your request to Marie Lethcoe @ marie.lethcoe@us.af.mil. Please include attendee full name, company division name, contact phone, email, and driver's license number (with state of issue) to register for the event and be listed on the visitor's request list for Area B.</p>
<p>The event will be held in the Air Force Institute of Technology (AFIT) Kenney Hall, Bldg 642. All attendees must present a government issued photo identification on the day of the event. Participants will need to enter at Gates 1B, 19B or 22B to gain access to Area B (see the attached map). Your name will be on the Visitor Center's guest list supplied. Parking at AFIT is limited, so carpooling is highly encouraged.</p>
<p>Thursday, April 24; Registration: 8:00 - 8:30am End: 5:00pm<br />Friday, April 25; Registration: 8:00 - 8:30am End: 12:30pm</p>
<p>Food and drink with the exception of bottled water are prohibited in Kenney Hall. Attendees will be on their own for lunch in the local area.</p>
<p>Point of contact for this program is: <br />Ms. Marie Lethcoe<br />HQ AFMC/A4NP,<br />4375 Chidlaw Rd. (Bldg. 262), Wright-Patterson AFB, Oh 45433<br />Send email to marie.lethcoe@us.af.mil</p>
<p>Alternate point of contact for this program is: <br />Mr. Gary Bain<br />HQ AFMC/A4NP,<br />4375 Chidlaw Rd. (Bldg. 262), Wright-Patterson AFB, Oh 45433<br />Send email to gary.bain.1@us.af.mil</p>
<p>This is not a Request for Proposal. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this announcement. This is to be considered an initial step in establishing industry understanding of the AF Logistics IT Systems Strategy and to allow the government team to determine market understanding and capability to integrate and complete the program.</p>

<DESC>The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) intends to procure maintenance services for imaging equipment on a sole source basis from Philips Medical Systems North America. The equipment is located at a biological high containment BSL4 (Biological Safety Level 4) Integrated Research Facility (IRF) at&nbsp;Fort Detrick,&nbsp;Frederick, Maryland. The equipment systems contain both commercial and proprietary non-commercial components. The non-commercial components were provided by Philips Medical Systems North America Inc., who designed, developed and implemented the necessary modifications to standard, commercial diagnostic imaging equipment so that the equipment was capable of operating inside BSL-4 containment. The contractor shall perform preventive, remedial maintenance and repair services to maintain the equipment in good working condition in accordance with the equipment manufacturer's specifications. The contractor will provide all facilities, service reports, materials, parts, test equipment, transportation, labor and all other related services for servicing the imaging equipment at the IRF. The IRF imaging personnel will assist in filling of phantoms and placing phantoms on imaging tables during the scheduled preventive maintenance and assist in performing tasks related to service on the high containment side of the imaging suites. The Contractor and the Government agree that the contractor's personnel will only access high containment areas if the ill-functioning imaging system parts residing within the high containment environment cannot be serviced by one of the IRF imaging staff members. Opening of a high containment area requires performing a decontamination process and approval of entry by the Division of Occupational Health and Safety. While the contractor's personnel are at the Government facility, the contractor is responsible for compliance with all the laws, rules and regulations governing conduct at the IRF. Contractor will follow all Federal, State and local laws related to the safety and health of personnel and property damage. Due to the security requirements imposed by the government the contractor personnel will make appropriate arrangements for escorted entrance into IRF and into the imaging suites to perform diagnostics, preventive maintenance and service on the equipment. Maintenance and calibration that cannot be performed outside the containment zone shall be performed either once annually (post fumigation of space) or shall be performed in compliance with the standard and special practices as described in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories (BMBL) for BSL-4 suit laboratory space. Listed below is the equipment to be serviced:<br /><br />Philips Medical Systems:

<p class="MsoNormal"><em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Background Information: </span></em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Sandia National Laboratories (Sandia) has made an initial investment in the research and development of barium titanate (BTO) nanoparticles for use in improved ceramic ferroelectric capacitors.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Such investment includes a non-provisional patent application surrounding a unique BTO nanoparticle synthesis methodology. Current areas of interest also include the fabrication and testing of 100% ceramic and ceramic/polymer composite devices. Sandia is a world leader in ferroelectric materials synthesis and device fabrication.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">BTO nanoparticle precursors offer significant technical benefits including a reduction of sintering temperature and improved material homogeneity. These benefits directly correlate to <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>improved ferroelectric device performance by means of increased breakdown strength, decreased strain, enhanced permittivity, decreased voltage coefficient of capacitance and decreased temperature coefficient of capacitance.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>The reduced sintering temperature and improved device performance achieved using nanoparticle precursors will translate to a substantial decrease in device manufacturing costs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span></p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.   <br>  <br> DESCRIPTION: Using the Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) process, the Aviation Applied Technology Directorate is soliciting technical and cost proposals to conduct a 6.2 Applied Research program for research and development effort entitled Rotorcraft Advanced Engine Integrated Controls System (RAEICS) Conceptual Design and Trade Analysis. Interested sources shall submit proposals in accordance with the guidelines contained in this announcement.  This BAA constitutes the total solicitation for the RAEICS program.  There will be no other notices issued in regard to this funding opportunity.  Interested sources should be alert for any amendments. <br>  <br> INTRODUCTION: The primary objective of the RAEICS program is to develop a conceptual design of an advanced engine control system that enables innovative, high performance propulsion capabilities envisioned for Future Vertical Lift (FVL) platforms and explores physical and functional integration approaches with other platform systems that maximize performance / operational capability and reduces associated life cycle costs for future rotorcraft.   A secondary objective is to develop the associated technology maturation plan necessary to enable transition of the selected RAEICS conceptual design to a future rotorcraft, such as, Future Vertical Lift platform in the 2025 timeframe. <br>  <br> This research effort is intended to explore foundational ideas/plans/trades using   engine-centric component/subsystem and system approaches to determine the potential benefits of advanced future engine controls architecture and how it best integrates with other platform systems such as vehicle management and health management for next generation Army platforms. The Army continues to develop the requirements for a fleet of next-generation rotorcraft known collectively as FVL.  These new clean-sheet platform designs provide opportunities for optimization of advance engine control system architectures and their potential integration with vehicle flight controls, vehicle management, health management and other systems to maximize air platform performance while minimizing cost of ownership.   Although mission requirements for FVL rotorcraft are still in development, the trending indicates future air platforms are expected to perform more demanding/complex combat missions.  With this trending of more demanding mission requirements for future rotorcraft, the air platform/propulsion system will likely increase in complexity at the system and subsystem level. The current fleet of DoD rotorcraft cannot continue to be incrementally improved to meet future operational requirements. Significant improvement in vertical lift, range, speed, payload, reduced pilot workload, survivability, reliability, and logistical footprint are all required to meet future anticipated needs. Furthermore, operational costs must be reduced to a fraction of those for the current fleet. As missions get more demanding, the pilot will continue to need technology which assists him to accomplish these missions.  DoD research in the last two decades indicates that advanced  propulsion control technologies, have a significant part to play in achieving these desired attributes and that more integrated platform concepts should be investigated to maximize desired outcomes. <br>  <br> This BAA is issued under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), 6.102(d)(2) and 35.016, and Chapter 1, Subchapter C of Title 32, Code of Federal Regulations (Reference (b)) and Chapter XI of Title 2, Code of Federal Regulations (Reference (c)). References (b) and (c) are also known and referred to collectively in this directive as the  quote mark DoD Grant and Agreement Regulations.  The Government's selection of proposals will be based upon an Evaluation Review of submitted proposals.  <br>  <br> TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: The Aviation Applied Technology Directorate (AATD) is interested in conducting a research and development effort to complete conceptual design/trade analyses of an advanced controls system configured for an advanced engine. The RAEICS program is an engine centric conceptual design and trades analysis effort that seeks to leverage advancements in electronics, computing processing, innovative architectures, software, etc. to provide an affordable, high performance engine control system that will meet the reliability and performance capabilities envisioned for future advanced propulsion systems.  The RAEICS effort will explore innovative engine control technologies and approaches that enable a highly capable and affordable engine control system that maximizes platform performance and utility over a full spectrum of expected operations. This advanced controls effort will also investigate the merits and methods to optimally integrate the advanced engine control system with other future platform subsystems such as Vehicle Management and Health Management.  The effort shall quantify the potential benefits, at the engine and airframe system level, for the candidate approaches.  The RAEICS effort shall establish the potential system level pay-offs (e.g. improved fuel burn, platform operational performance/effectiveness, pilot workload, weight, O&S cost, reliability, etc) of the chosen conceptual design for a notional future platform, such as FVL. <br>  <br> The RAEICS effort shall define a notional advanced propulsion system in the 2025 time frame to serve as baseline for trades and benefit analyses. Concepts in this time frame will likely include many advanced features such as: smart adaptive heat-exchangers/recuperators, active surge/clearance controls, variable speed power turbine, adaptive cooling technologies, adaptive/variable exhaust systems, high/low spool adaptive power extraction technologies, electric accessory approaches, smart inlet filtration systems, and multi-engine/compound drivetrains.  The Offeror shall execute engine-centric trade investigations to determine the best advanced controls approaches needed to accommodate the advanced engine configuration selected.  Examples of controls technology areas of interest are: distributed controls, high temperature electronics, fail-safe communication networks/architectures, standardized robust high quality power conditioning and distribution, more electric engine(MEE) concepts, distributed smart modules, affordable modular packaging, joint common architectures, thermal management, adaptive (convergent) controls, advanced model-based controls, multi-mode/multi-variable controls, reconfigurable  engine controls, virtual sensors, advanced  integrated control approaches and significantly improved Condition Based Maintenance /Prognostic Health Management(CBM/PHM) strategies. <br>  <br> The RAEICS effort shall also establish a platform baseline definition with quantifiable metrics to evaluate the benefits of advanced engine controls at a rotorcraft system level.  The baseline definition shall address, as a minimum, the following engine capabilities or lack thereof:  responsiveness to rotorcraft maneuvers, adaptability to account for engine deterioration, adaptability to optimize performance in off-design conditions (including variable output speed capability and adaptive fuel metering), and the ability to vary propulsion inlet and exhaust conditions to optimize performance for specific mission operational needs.  It is recognized that proposed baselines, engine and rotorcraft, may have limited or no capability for some of the functions listed above.  The Offeror should therefore clearly identify what functional capabilities are expected to be added, enabled or enhanced by the proposed RAEICS concept(s). <br>  <br> The platform baseline description shall also include a physical view and functional view description of the integration of the platform systems will be considered in the trade analyses.  As a minimum, the physical integrations (shared processing resources, busses, electrical power, etc.), data requirements, utilization, quality (rates, precision, accuracy, criticality, etc.) , and functional integration  (shared requirements of the engine control system with other subsystems, requirements generated by one subsystem and utilized by the others, etc.) will be described to support comparative trades and analyses. Although a conventional rotorcraft (e.g. currently fielded DoD system) can be selected for the platform baseline, the Government prefers a notional vehicle in the 2025 timeframe, such as the FVL concept, be utilized in the RAEICS program. The intent is to identify the benefits to future rotorcraft by comparing concepts based on traditional non-integrated subsystems approaches with a more integrated engine/platform approach. The offeror shall also define platform mission(s) that will be used to quantify the operational benefits associated with the RAEICS conceptual design.  The Government prefers the mission analyses show relevancy to expected operational needs, such as defined for FVL, and quantify payoffs in terms of mission fuel burn, vehicle payload, and maneuverability and lifecycle costs (maintenance, volume, parts count, etc.). <br>  <br> The RAEICS effort should focus on discerning the merits of the innovative engine control technologies and approaches that enable a highly advanced engine control system to maximize platform performance and utility over a full spectrum of expected operations. The offeror shall also determine the most promising, suite of engine/platform controls technologies, and shared functionalities to enable significantly improved system level performance across the mission spectrum for airframe configurations of interest while providing high levels of durability, reliability, and maintainability resulting in reduced life cycle cost for future Army Aviation platforms.  These program integration trades will investigate, as a minimum, options for physical distribution and functional sharing of data sources and processing capability to and from other platform systems such as vehicle flight controls, vehicle management and health management systems to maximize/enable vehicle performance capabilities while reducing platform life cycle costs.  The overall implications of the integration options considered need to include as a minimum: vehicle life cycle cost, shared-data quality/accuracy standards, system integration issues, vehicle weight, vulnerability, reliability, and impact on current vehicle qualification standards for the systems impacted. <br>  <br> The RAEICS concept design should seek to optimize future Army aircraft mission performance (fuel consumption, range, time on station, etc) across the full spectrum of ambient conditions (high hot, high cold, etc). While improved mission performance is a priority, the Offeror's proposed RAEICS concept(s) must also consider system level trades that optimize weight, cost, durability, maintainability, and reliability. As such, the offeror shall use well-defined methodologies and analysis techniques in their system trades to demonstrate a rationale for why the final down-selected RAEICS concept is the best total system approach in terms of all design aspects. Certain key identified technologies may leverage other key technologies in an integrated approach that will yield specific system level performance benefits. It is important that these integrated performance benefits be clearly identified to substantiate the benefits of, and the emphasis for, development of the key identified integrated sub-system technologies. Note: Existing redundancy requirements for flight or mission critical hardware must still be met in any selected approach. Offerors shall consider qualification requirements in the RAEICS design chosen for study (e.g. MIL-STD-810G for system durability, MIL-STD-461F as modified by ADS-37A-PRF for EMI, MIL-STD-704C for aircraft power compatibility, DO-178C for software, and DO-254 for hardware).  Program efforts shall identify the program risks and potential new requirements to qualify the RAEICS concept to a future rotorcraft, such as a FVL platform.  <br>  <br> Lastly, the RAEICS effort shall develop the associated technology maturation plan necessary to support transition of the selected RAEICS conceptual design to a future rotorcraft platform, such as FVL, in the 2025 timeframe.  As part of the proposed RAEICS effort, the offeror shall make recommendations relative to technology gaps/shortfalls for the resultant down-selected technologies identified in the final conceptual design and the need for specific component/ <br> Subsystem/system technology development efforts. The recommendations should prioritize the critical component/subsystem/system technology development needs/plans to meet the technical objectives of the offeror's RAEICS conceptual design.  The prioritization process should clearly identify the associated risk and payoffs of the candidate RAEICS technologies and the criteria used (such as current TRL level) to recommend future investments. <br>  <br> ANTICIPATED PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: Not to exceed 24 Months Total (21 for technical effort and 3 for Final Report).  Offerors should clearly depict their proposed schedule. <br>  <br> ANTICIPATED AWARD DATE: Staggered awards are possible starting in 4th quarter FY14, subject to the availability of funds. <br>  <br> ANTICIPATED GOVERNMENT FUNDING: Available Government funding is approximately $1.5M for all awards.  Government fiscal year distribution is as follows: FY14 $300k, FY15 $800k, FY16 $400k.  To adequately invest in and maximize the breadth of technology developed, there is a potential to make up to two (2) awards for differing RAEICS conceptual designs.  Any awards made under this announcement may be incrementally funded and are subject to the availability of funds. <br>  <br> TYPE OF FUNDING INSTRUMENT: The Government prefers offerors propose a Technology Investment Agreement (TIA) (Cooperative Agreement in accordance with 10 U.S.C 2358) and Chapter 1, Subchapter C of Title 32, Code of Federal Regulations Section 37 (Reference (b)) and Chapter XI of Title 2, Code of Federal Regulations (Reference (Reference (c))., which is more flexible than traditional Government funding instruments. This does not preclude other funding instruments from being used. A variety of funding instruments are available pursuant to this announcement depending upon the proposed effort, the entity submitting the successful proposal(s), and statutory and regulatory requirements the Government must satisfy. Such instruments include conventional Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF) contracts subject to the Federal Acquisition Regulation, as supplemented. Other Transaction (OT) for Research (10 U.S.C. 2371) is also an acceptable funding instrument. Under TIAs or OTs, it is DoD policy to obtain, to the maximum extent practical, cost sharing of half the cost of the project to ensure the recipient has a vested interest in the project's success. Cost participation may be in the form of cash or in-kind contributions, where cash is considered of significantly higher quality in demonstrating commitment to the project. Cost participation will be considered in accordance with the 32 CFR CH I, Section 37.530.  The type of funding instrument is a subject for negotiation, but the offeror's desire shall be clearly stated in the cost proposal. <br>  <br> DATA ITEMS/DELIVERABLES: All awards under this Announcement will require a kickoff meeting following award.  In addition, all agreements will require delivery of the following data items or deliverables:  (1) Program Plan (delivered 45 days after award), (2) Briefing Charts, (3) Bi-Monthly Progress, Cost and Performance Reports, (4) Final Report, (5) Final Briefing at Ft. Eustis (Note: Each of these items shall be delivered in Contractor's format). <br>  <br> SECURITY REQUIREMENTS: This effort will likely generate technical data that is subject to export control laws and regulations. Only those offerors registered and certified with the Defense Logistics Services Center (DLSC) and that have a legitimate business purpose may participate in this BAA. Contact the Defense Logistics Services Center, 74 Washington Avenue N., Battle Creek, Michigan 40917-3084 (1-800-352-3572) for further information on the certification process. Offerors must submit a copy of the offerors' approved DD Form 2345, Militarily Critical Technical Data Agreement, with its proposal. The Government does not anticipate the generation of classified data as part of this effort. Pre-award access to or submission of a classified proposal is not authorized. <br>  <br> DATA RIGHTS: The Government prefers,  quote mark Unlimited Rights quote mark , and requires at a minimum,  quote mark Government Purpose Rights quote mark  as defined by the DFARS 252.227-7013, to all technical data, deliverables, and computer software developed under this program, and no limitations on the use of delivered and/or residual hardware.   It is the offeror's responsibility to clearly acknowledge or take exception to the Government's desire for at least  quote mark Government Purpose Rights. quote mark   Ambiguities will be negatively evaluated against the Offeror.  The Contractor should propose legends for each data item identified as other than unlimited rights.  In addition, all offerors shall identify the technical data or computer software that they assert would be furnished with restrictions on use, release or disclosure if an award is made under this announcement.  This information shall be provided with your proposal using the format/table included in DFARS 252.227-7017 Identification and Assertion of Use, Release or Disclosure Restrictions. <br>  <br> GOVERNMENT FURNISHED PROPERTY AND DATA: It is the Offeror's responsibility to identify, coordinate and furnish supporting documentation in the proposal for use of any Government furnished equipment or property.  No government furnished data will be provided.  Offerors must have access to or be capable of generating the data required to develop and validate the systems proposed. <br>  <br> SUBCONTRACTING PLAN: Not applicable if proposing award under a non-FAR     <br> instrument (i.e. TIA) or if the offeror is a SMALL BUSINESS CONCERN.  Pursuant to the requirements of FAR part 19.702(a)(1), if the total amount of the proposal exceeds $650,000, and there are subcontracting possibilities, offerors must submit a subcontracting plan.  FAR part 52.219-9 defines a subcontracting plan and its requirements.  Offerors shall incorporate the subcontracting plan as part of the Offeror's proposal submission.  DFARS 226.370-8 discusses subcontracting incentive and goals with the Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Minority Institutions.  DFARS 219.708(b)(1)(A) and (B), discusses the appropriate use of DFARS Clauses 252.219-7003 and 252.219-7004 in solicitations and contract related to small, small disadvantaged and women-owned small business subcontracting plans.  Offerors are cautioned that in solicitations where subcontracting opportunities exist, the Government will not execute a contract unless the Contracting Officer determines that the negotiated plan provides the maximum practicable opportunity for SBs, SDB, WOSB, HUB Zone, and Veteran-owned Small Business concerns or HBCUs/MIs to participate in the performance of the contract.  Offerors should note that DFARS 219.705-4 provides for a goal of 5% for SDB concerns and HBCUs/MIs. <br>  <br> NOTICE TO FOREIGN OWNED FIRMS: Participation in this program is limited to U.S. Firms as Prime Contractors; however, foreign owned entities can participate as subcontractors/recipients to U.S. prime contractors/recipient.  The U.S. prime entity retains responsibility for compliance with U.S. export controls.  Interested entities must address export compliance of any foreign participants in its cost volume. <br>  <br> PREPARATION INSTRUCTIONS: Offerors may submit multiple proposals for different technology concepts.  Each proposal shall describe an effort to address all of the requirements defined within the BAA description. Each proposal shall consist of two volumes, a technical volume and a cost volume.  In presenting the proposal material, Offerors are advised that the quality of the information is significantly more important than quantity.  Offerors should confine the submissions to essential matters providing sufficient information to define their offer and establish an adequate basis for the Government to conduct its evaluation. The Government reserves the right to select for award only a portion of an Offeror's proposal or the total proposed effort.  Partial awards are conditioned upon the Government and the offeror reaching mutually agreeable terms for such partial awards.  The Government encourages and promotes teaming arrangements with research organizations to include academia, industry and small businesses in order to achieve a mix of relevant expertise and capabilities for executing research and development efforts.   <br>  <br> TECHNICAL VOLUME: The technical proposal shall provide a clear justification for the selection of the proposed engine controls concept(s), platform integration concept(s), and the key component and subsystem controls technologies for evaluation against the program objectives.

For this requirement, all evaluation factors other than cost or price, when combined are more significantly important than cost or price.  The importance of price as an evaluation factor will increase with the degree of equality of technical quotations received in relation to the other evaluation factors.

Factor 2  Personnel Qualifications. In identifying qualified personnel that possess the appropriate skills and experience to perform the services required to each task, contractors must demonstrate in-depth experience with the FCC/SLD E-rate program by providing resumes of key personnel with an emphasis on how to select the appropriate criteria and build reports designed to spot trends.  In addition, contractors must provide an organizational overview to include SaaS architecture and compliant with all State and Federal Regulations.
Factor 3  Past performance. The contractor shall demonstrate successful past performance in all phases and methodologies of the SLD E-Rate process working with larger school districts or states, citing no more than 3 references with contact information who are using the proposed solution in the past 5 years.

Travel: Not applicable to this contract
REQUEST FOR QUOTE INSTRUCTIONS

<p>(End of Clause)</p>
<p>DLAD 52.216-9067 - ECONOMIC PRICE ADJUSTMENT (LIQUID PROPANE GAS) (JAN 2013)</p>
<p>(a) Warranties. The Contractor warrants that -<br />(1) The unit prices set forth in the schedule do not include allowances for any portion of the contingency covered by this clause; and<br />(2) The prices to be invoiced hereunder shall be computed in accordance with the provision of this clause.<br />(b) Definitions. As used throughout this clause-<br />(1) The term "base price" means- <br />(i) The unit price offered for an item and included in the contract award schedule at time of award<br />(2) Market price means a price determined by an independent trade association, governmental body, or other third party and reported or made available in a consistent manner in a publication, electronic data base, or other form. This price may be either a single market price or a combination of market prices for price adjustment for individual items by product, market area, and publication as specified in paragraph (f) below. <br />(3) The term "base market price" means the preselected market price for an item as published on [Weekly Butane News Letter] in the publication specified in paragraph (f).<br />(4) The adjusting market price means the average price listed in the publication specified in paragraph (f) immediately preceding the date of adjustment. <br />(c) Adjustments. The Contracting Officer shall issue a modification to the contract to reflect any price change pursuant to this clause. The Contract price shall be adjusted at the initial date of performance only if the change between the market price at the start of performance and the base market price equals 5% (positive or negative) or more of the contract price. Price changes thereafter shall be no more frequent than every two weeks. Therefore, after the initial date of performance, the difference between the current market price and the base market price will be determined on a weekly basis, providing there has not been a price adjustment in the prior week (in which case no adjustment would be applicable). The Contract price will be changed by this difference, (positive or negative), at any time the adjustment from the current price to the newly adjusted price (positive or negative) is determined to equal 5% or more of the base price. Price changes will be formally issued in a contract modification which will be effective on the fourth business day immediately following the date of the publication used for the adjusting market price. For example, if the adjusting market price was published on a Monday, the effective date of the price change would be the Friday of that same week. <br />(1) Calculations. The prices payable under this clause shall be determined by adjusting the award price by the same number of cents, or fraction thereof that the market price increases or decreases, per like unit of measure, no more than every two weeks, providing that such an adjustment would result in a 5% or more change between the base price and the adjusted contract price. All arithmetical calculations, including the final adjusted unit price shall be rounded to the nearest thousandth of a cent. For example, if performance started January 1, the contract award price is $2.00 and if the base market price on the base reference date is 150.000 cents, and the adjusting market price immediately preceding the performance period is 160.000 cents, the contract price shall increase by 10.000 cents $2.10 at the start of the performance period. If the adjusting market price was 155.000 cents instead of 160.000, there would be no adjustment, since the difference between the adjusting market price and the base market price is less than 5% of the base price. All calculations in this example are purely hypothetical, and not based on any actual dates or prices. <br />(2) Revision of published market price indicator. In the event--<br />(i) Any applicable market price is discontinued or its method of derivation is altered substantially; or <br />(ii) The Contracting Officer determines that the market price indicator consistently and substantially failed to reflect market conditions,-the parties shall mutually agree upon an appropriate and comparable substitute for determining the price adjustments hereunder. The contract shall be modified to reflect such substitute effective on the date the indicator was discontinued, altered, or began to consistently and substantially fail to reflect market conditions. If the parties fail to agree on an appropriate substitute, the matter shall be resolved in accordance with the Disputes clause of the contract.<br />(3) Failure to deliver. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this clause, no upward adjustment shall apply to product scheduled under the contract to be delivered before the effective date of the adjustment, unless the Contractor's failure to deliver according to the delivery schedule results from causes beyond the Contractor's control and without its fault or negligence, within the meaning of the Default clause of this contract, in which case the Contract shall be amended to make an equitable extension of the delivery schedule.<br />(4) Upward ceiling on economic price adjustment. The Contractor agrees that the total increase in any Contract unit price pursuant to these economic price adjustment provisions shall not exceed [10] percent of the award price in any applicable program year (whether a single year or a multiyear program), except as provided hereafter. This [10] percent is not cumulative for each program year, and instead is applied to the price in effect at the beginning of each program year, through the end of that program year.<br />(i) If at any time the Contractor has reason to believe that within the near future a price adjustment under the provisions of this clause will be required that will exceed the current contract ceiling price for any item, the Contractor shall promptly notify the Contracting Officer in writing of the expected increase. The notification shall include a revised ceiling the Contractor believes is sufficient to permit completion of remaining contract performance, along with appropriate explanation and documentation as required by the Contracting Officer.<br />(ii) If an actual increase in the market price would raise a contract unit price for an item above the current ceiling, the Contractor shall have no obligation under this contract to fill pending or future orders for such item, as of the effective date of the increase, unless the Contracting Officer issues a contract modification to raise the ceiling. If the contract ceiling will not be raised, the Contracting Officer shall so promptly notify the Contractor in writing.<br />(d) Examination of records. The Contractor agrees that the Contracting Officer or designated representatives shall have the right to examine the Contractor's books, records, documents, or other data the Contracting Officer deems necessary to verify Contractor adherence to the provisions of this clause.<br />(e) Final invoice. The Contractor shall include a statement on the final invoice that the amounts invoiced hereunder have applied all decreases required by this clause.<br />(f) Publication, product, and location. The average of the high and low in Butane Propane News' (BPN's) Weekly Propane Newsletter, Propane Prices Update, Spot Prices for Natural Gas Liquids, at Mont Belvieu (not LDH) shall be used to calculate each four week average specified above. These prices measure the general rate and direction of price movement for this commodity within a market. This does not indicate a mandatory source of supply or area where bidders must obtain supplies. <br />(End of Clause)</p>

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

The Contractor shall furnish everything necessary, including, but not limited to all labor, equipment, supervision, transportation, supplies, and incidentals to deliver the groceries to the Spotted Bear Ranger Station weekly as ordered.

<p>(1) Unless exempted by an addendum to this contract, the Contractor is responsible during performance and through final payment of any contract for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(2) (i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the SAM database; (B) comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.</p>
<p>(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via CCR accessed through http://www.acquisition.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423 or 269-961-5757.</p>
<p>(u) Unauthorized Obligations.</p>
<p>(1) Except as stated in paragraph (u)(2) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End User License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern:</p>
<p>(i) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government.</p>
<p>(ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an "I agree" click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., "click-wrap" or "browse-wrap" agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause.</p>
<p>(iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement.</p>
<p>(2) Paragraph (u)(1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statue and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures.</p>

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)<br />The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<p>(b) When a levy is imposed on a payment under this contract and the Contractor believes that the levy may result in an inability to perform the contract, the Contractor shall promptly notify the Procuring Contracting Officer in writing, with a copy to the Administrative Contracting Officer, and shall provide-</p>
<p>(1) The total dollar amount of the levy;</p>

<p>(ii) If the levy may result in an inability to perform the contract but will not impact national security, a recommendation that the Contractor promptly notify the IRS to attempt to resolve the tax situation.</p>

(D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.)

<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-<br />(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract.

<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports.

<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>

(D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at subpart 32.11) for the same concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-<br />(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>

<p>(b) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)<br />The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>
<p><br />252.232-2010 Levies on Contract Payments (Dec 2006)<br />(a) 26 U.S.C. 6331(h) authorizes the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to continuously levy up to 100 percent of contract payments, up to the amount of tax debt.</p>
<p>(b) When a levy is imposed on a payment under this contract and the Contractor believes that the levy may result in an inability to perform the contract, the Contractor shall promptly notify the Procuring Contracting Officer in writing, with a copy to the Administrative Contracting Officer, and shall provide-</p>
<p>(1) The total dollar amount of the levy;</p>
<p>(2) A statement that the Contractor believes that the levy may result in an inability to perform the contract, including rationale and adequate supporting documentation; and</p>
<p>(3) Advice as to whether the inability to perform may adversely affect national security, including rationale and adequate supporting documentation.</p>
<p>(c) DoD shall promptly review the Contractor's assessment, and the Procuring Contracting Officer shall provide a written notification to the Contractor including-</p>
<p>(1) A statement as to whether DoD agrees that the levy may result in an inability to perform the contract; and</p>
<p>(2)(i) If the levy may result in an inability to perform the contract and the lack of performance will adversely affect national security, the total amount of the monies collected that should be returned to the Contractor; or</p>
<p>(ii) If the levy may result in an inability to perform the contract but will not impact national security, a recommendation that the Contractor promptly notify the IRS to attempt to resolve the tax situation.</p>
<p>(d) Any DoD determination under this clause is not subject to appeal under the Contract Disputes Act.</p>

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)<br />The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>
<p><br />252.232-2010 Levies on Contract Payments (Dec 2006)<br />(a) 26 U.S.C. 6331(h) authorizes the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to continuously levy up to 100 percent of contract payments, up to the amount of tax debt.</p>
<p>(b) When a levy is imposed on a payment under this contract and the Contractor believes that the levy may result in an inability to perform the contract, the Contractor shall promptly notify the Procuring Contracting Officer in writing, with a copy to the Administrative Contracting Officer, and shall provide-</p>
<p>(1) The total dollar amount of the levy;</p>
<p>(2) A statement that the Contractor believes that the levy may result in an inability to perform the contract, including rationale and adequate supporting documentation; and</p>
<p>(3) Advice as to whether the inability to perform may adversely affect national security, including rationale and adequate supporting documentation.</p>
<p>(c) DoD shall promptly review the Contractor's assessment, and the Procuring Contracting Officer shall provide a written notification to the Contractor including-</p>
<p>(1) A statement as to whether DoD agrees that the levy may result in an inability to perform the contract; and</p>
<p>(2)(i) If the levy may result in an inability to perform the contract and the lack of performance will adversely affect national security, the total amount of the monies collected that should be returned to the Contractor; or</p>
<p>(ii) If the levy may result in an inability to perform the contract but will not impact national security, a recommendation that the Contractor promptly notify the IRS to attempt to resolve the tax situation.</p>
<p>(d) Any DoD determination under this clause is not subject to appeal under the Contract Disputes Act.</p>

<p>The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-72, dated January 30, 2014.<br /> <br />PROJECT DESCRIPTION<br />The Division of Behavioral and Social Research (BSR) at the National Institute on Aging (NIA), National Institutes of Health (NIH), plans, conducts, fosters, and supports an integrated and coordinated program of research and research training with emphasis placed on: (1) the dynamic interplay among individuals as they age; (2) their changing biomedical, social, and physical environments; and (3) multilevel interactions among psychological, physiological, social, and cultural levels.  Research areas of emphasis are: (1) Health Disparities; (2) Aging Minds; (3) Increasing Health Expectancy; (4) Health, Work, and Retirement; (5) Interventions and Behavior Change; (6) Genetics, Behavior, and the Social Environment; and (7) The Burden of Illness and the Efficiency of Health Systems.</p>
<p>The National Advisory Council on Aging (NACA) encouraged increased emphasis on the following components in which this requirement will support:  (1) Using sophisticated strategies developing valid, reliable, well-defined, and standardized phenotypic measures in behavioral and social research to close the gap between genotype and behavioral phenotypes; (2) Developing opportunities for leveraging the specific and particular advantages of genotyped BSR cohorts (e.g., the extensive longitudinal data available in many studies, the population representativeness of the HRS); (3) Supporting method development to optimize the comparison and integration of heterogeneous data sets, both within and across populations and across genomics technologies; (4) Supporting infrastructure for individual studies and for the harmonization of and analyses across cohorts, where the administrative burden in running successful collaborative efforts is especially high.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND, PURPOSE, AND OBJECTIVES<br />The purpose of this requirement is to provide contractor services of a Behavioral Geneticist/Genetic Epidemiologist to advise on integrating genetics and genomics with the behavioral sciences, specifically in aging research.  BSR's interests in genetics cover diverse methodological applications and a broad range of phenotypes, including cognition, life expectancy, survival, and disability, as well as social aspects, sociability, economic behaviors, risk-taking, conscientiousness, and various motivations.  BSR's portfolio of twin research is positioned to yield new insights by applying novel molecular and quantitative methodologies to the twin design. BSR is also building research using population genetics. BSR is enhancing its investment in large social/behavioral surveys by pursuing GWAS strategies and developing harmonization strategies that will maximize the use of genetic data for well-planned behavioral and social science studies.</p>
<p>CONTRACTOR REQUIREMENTS<br />The successful contractor will be responsible for supporting the following work requirements. The amount of work anticipated by the contractor is estimated at 10-15% Full Time Equivalency (FTE %). Contractor shall not be required to work onsite at a Government facility, although period meetings with government officials for collaboration and meeting purposes may be required on an ad-hoc basis.</p>
<p>Contractor shall provide support to requirements from the BSR HSA government official currently managing the genetics portfolio, in addition to ad-hoc support of other portfolios being managed by the BSR HAS. This type of support includes:</p>
<p>1. Formulating research plans for the continued and expanded integration of genetics into the BSR portfolio, such as developing valid, reliable, and well-defined phenotypic measures in behavioral and social research; developing opportunities for leveraging newly genotyped BSR cohorts; supporting methods development to optimize the comparison and integration of heterogeneous datasets; and supporting infrastructure for harmonization across BSR-funded longitudinal cohort studies. This will include advising BSR staff in the planning of initiatives and advising applicants in the planning of research projects.<br /> <br />2. Identifying promising new methodological approaches or areas of research at the cutting-edge of this rapidly expanding area of scientific inquiry which would enhance the BSR portfolio of genetic studies.  This may include working on trans-NIH committees and initiatives in genetics, behavior genetics, genetic epidemiology and population genetics, that are of relevance to BSR and to NIA more broadly.</p>
<p>3. Translating these ideas into program activities that will further integrate genetics into the BSR portfolio, including:</p>
<p>a. Development of program interests through representation of BSR/NIA at professional meetings and conferences and through identification of Contractor as a contact person at BSR;<br />b. Development of research summaries related to areas of focus, including writing material to be included in NIA/BSR reports;<br />c. Writing of Funding Opportunity Announcements for the development of directions in genetics that are congruent with the objectives of BSR;<br />d. Advising BSR staff in the development of scientific initiatives at both the NIA and trans-NIH levels;<br />e. Attendance and participation in pertinent NIH meetings, including planning retreats, and Council-related meetings;<br />f. Organization and conduct of workshops, identifying and overseeing the initiation of required purchase orders that outline deliverables for invited participants.</p>

<p>8. NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program. It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is (202).372-3695.</p>
<p>9. Questions and quotes shall be emailed to Phillip.A.Will@uscg.mil . Contractors are responsible for verifying receipt of quotes.</p>
<p>10. Quotations shall be submitted not later than 14APR14 0930 Pacific Time.</p>

<DESC>RFQ: W911N2-14-Q-0002 is amended for the following purposes:   <br>     <br> 1. RFQ is extended until 09 APR 14. Responses are due no later than 10:00 A.M. Eastern Daylight Time. All quotes must be marked with RFQ number and title and accompanied with a signed/dated copy of this combined synopsis/solicitation and all amendments. Email quotes will be accepted. Please address to kevin.a.duffy4.civ@mail.mil  <br> 	 <br> 2. Posting of Additional Questions and Answers. The following delineates: <br>  <br> Question #13: In review of the answers to the posed questions on your VTC solicitation, I would like to bring to your attention on Section 1.1.7, regarding the speakers, you specify  quote mark  Extron Electronics SI 28, pair, Part# 42-073-02; Name Brand or Equal. quote mark  <br>  <br> Please note, part number 42-073-02 is a speaker which is non-powered and DOES require a separate amplifier. <br>  <br> The response/answers posted today associated with 1.1.7 state  quote mark Answer # 3: No amplifier is necessary. The speakers will be wall mounted within 5 feet of the unit or sitting on the credenza below. quote mark  <br>  <br> As such, the government is specifying a speaker (name brand or equal to 42-037-02; a non-powered speaker) and is also stating there is no amplifier necessary to be provided by the vendors.  If this specification remains as is, the result will be  quote mark no sound quote mark  from the speakers. <br>  <br> In addition, the same Answer # 3 to 1.1.7 also states  quote mark The speakers will be wall mounted within 5 feet of the unit or sitting on the credenza below. quote mark  <br>  <br> This answer now permits vendors to either wall mount the speakers or have them placed on the credenza below.  That same specified speaker, 42-073-02, can be mounted on the credenza, but again, will require an amplifier. <br>  <br> If the customer is now flexible for either wall mounted speakers or placed on the credenza (which answer # 3 eludes to), we would recommend using a different speaker than 42-073-02 to be placed on the credenza and those speakers would also include the amplifier self contained within the speakers to enable the audio. <br>  <br> However, the current rendition of this solicitation has and can lead to these different interpretations which may not deliver the solution to perform as desired. <br>  <br>  <br> Answer #13: The specification for Part# 42-073-02; Name Brand or Equal, Section 1.1.7.  <br> has changed to the following;   <br>  <br> The speaker is name brand or equal to 42-133-03 Extron - SM 3 Compact Full-Range Surface Mount Speakers with speed mount and the amplifier is name brand or equal to 60-844-02 Extron - MPA 152 Stereo Amplifier - 15 Watts Per Channel. <br>  <br>  <br>

The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103.  If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. (ii) Examples. (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. ?362 (the Bankruptcy Code).

To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. (2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, ?doing business as? name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day?s written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. <BR> <BR>The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.

(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database.

<DESC>** THE PURPOSE OF THIS MODIFICATION IS TO EXTEND THE BID DUE DATE AND TIME TO WEDNESDAY, 9 APRIL 2014 AT 3:00 P.M. ET.  AS A RESULT OF THE GOVERNMENT LOSING NETWORK CONNECTIVITY, NO BIDS WERE RECEIVED.  THOSE VENDORS THAT SUBMITTED BIDS, PLEASE RESUBMIT. ** <br>  <br>  <br>  <br> This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.    <br>    <br>  SALE OF SURPLUS PROPERTY 2014-003, #W912LQ-14-R-9003 TERMS AND CONDITIONS  <br>    <br>  The Virginia Army National Guard has a requirement to have existing non-functional equipment removed from its premises and is conducting a scrap sale for that purpose.  This equipment was previously used at the quarry and has exceeded its useful life.  The contractor shall provide all labor, equipment, parts, supervision etc needed to dismantle and remove these items.    <br>    <br>  The equipment includes large, oversized hoppers and conveying systems previously used at the quarry (see attached photos).  If these items exceed reasonable size limits for over-the-road transport or are in such as state as to not permit loading in one piece, the contractor shall be allowed 15 calendar days to disassemble the equipment into smaller, manageable pieces in preparation for removal.  The quarry is typically a closed facility so access will have to be coordinated with a government point of contact each day to open and close the gate.  <br>    <br>  A site visit is scheduled for Wednesday, 26 March 2014 at 11:00 a.m. to allow interested bidders the opportunity to assess the equipment, site access, ask questions etc.  Attendance is not mandatory however vendors are strongly encouraged to attend.  This is the only opportunity vendors will have to access the site prior to bid opening; interested bidders will not be allowed to schedule individual site visits.   <br>    <br>  A deposit is not required to submit a bid however, within three (3) business days of award the successful contractor must provide an earnest money deposit of 20% of the total bid price to the Contracting Officer.   This deposit will be held for the duration of the project.   The contractor may remove materials up to the value of the deposit.  If the contractor chooses to incrementally remove the scrap, these loads must be paid for within seven (7) calendar days of removal and before additional loads are removed.  Checks, along with weight tickets, must be submitted to the Contracting Officer on the seventh day.  If the contractor chooses to demolish then remove all material at one time, the settlement shall be made with one check.  The VaARNG reserves the right to retain the deposit until such time as all weight tickets have been received and the purchaser has paid in full invoices for all property removed.  Interest will accrue on all late payments at the daily rate of 1.375% in accordance with 41 U.S.C. 611 (https://www.fms.treas.gov/prompt/index.html).  In addition, an administrative fee may be charged to collect a delinquent payment.  <br>    <br>  Material must be removed within 15 calendar days of submittal of 20% earnest money and of notification of award.  The Qualified Recycle Program (QRP) manager shall oversee the loading of the material and shall annotate the material loaded and total weight of the load.  This total is still only an estimate.  The purchaser shall weigh the material after removal and shall provide copies of all weight tickets along with a certification of the scales used.  The government's and purchaser's weights shall be compared and reconciled.  The purchaser shall provide payment in one of the accepted formats within 30 calendar days of award.    <br>    <br>  Payment is to be made payable to US Treasury; remittance shall indicate it is for the purchase of U.S. Government Property.  Acceptable forms of payment include certified check, money order or company check.  <br>    <br>  Bids are to be submitted in pounds on the SF114F form.    <br>    <br>  Bids are due by 11:00 a.m. ET on Thursday, April 3, 2014.  Bids may be delivered in person, mailed or faxed to Susan Quinn, Contract Specialist, USPFO-ACQ, Building 316, Fort Pickett, Blackstone, VA 23824.  Seller reserves the right to refuse all bids.

<DESC><p>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FEDERAL ACQUISITION REGULATIONS (FAR) SUBPART 12.6, AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; THEREFORE A WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Solicitation number NB688000-14-01946 is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ). <br />This solicitation and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 05-72.</p>
<p>The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 333314, and the Small Business size standard is 500 employees.</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), is soliciting from all interested Small Business parties who can provide a Tapered Amplifier Laser System capable of supporting research and development of laser-cooled Cesium atomic fountain frequency standards (such as NIST-F1 and NIST-F2 which serve as the primary frequency standards for the US), in the Time and Frequency Division, in accordance with the attached SOW, located at NIST in Boulder, Colorado.</p>
<p>**One key parameter is the &lsquo;optical isolation' built into the product. A high amount of optical isolation helps insure high-performance and stable operation. This is very important for achieving the most stable and accurate atomic frequency standards.**</p>
<p>A Sources Sought notification was previously posted from 03/14/14 to 03/24/14, via NB688000-14-01946.</p>
<p>TECHNICAL CONSIDERATIONS: Experience with laser-cooled frequency standards, optical isolation of the laser is critically important. Insufficient optical isolation leads to degraded laser performance (line width and stability) which directly impacts the temperature of the laser cooled atoms and introduces noise in the atom detection process. This results in degraded performance of the frequency standard.</p>

<p>EVALUATION OF QUOTE:</p>

<p>The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible Contractor whose quote conforming to the solicitation will be the best value to the Government- price and other factors considered. Technical and Past Performance, when combined, are more important than Price.</p>
<p>TECHNICAL EVALUATION CRITERIA:</p>
<p>A. Quality of the technical quote and turnaround time; its clarity and demonstrated ability to perform the research in a timely manner. Evaluation shall assess the detailed technical description of how all the required work will be accomplished. This will include evaluation of the literature review, data sources, and methodologies proposed for analysis and their appropriateness to the overall research being conducted relevant to the PWS. In addition, the project timeline will be assessed to assure that the research report is completed in a timely manner and consistent with the methodologies prescribed in the quote. Researchers whose quotes include surveys should be mindful of the Paperwork Reduction Act and OMB clearance. For a good or excellent evaluation, the quote must show the ability to accomplish the desired results and demonstrate the quality of work in providing services in a timely fashion.</p>
<p>The following rating method shall be used in the evaluation of the technical approach information:</p>
<p>Excellent - Based on the quote's technical approach, no doubt exists that the quote will successfully perform the required effort. The technical approach shows a complete understanding and methodology<br />for completing the PWS within the standards and workload specified.<br />Good - Based on the quote's technical approach, little doubt exists that the quote will successfully perform the required effort. The technical approach shows an acceptable understanding and methodology for completing the PWS within the standards and workload specified.<br />Marginal - Based on the quote's technical approach, some doubt exists that the quote will successfully perform the required effort. The technical approach shows a marginal understanding and methodology for completing the PWS within the standards and workload specified. <br />Poor - Based on the quote's technical approach, serious doubt exists that the quote will successfully perform the required effort. The technical approach demonstrates significant deficiencies in understanding and implementing performance of the PWS within the standards and workload specified.</p>
<p>B. Researcher qualifications, experience (including past performance), if applicable and knowledge of literature in this field. The evaluation will be based on the information obtained in the quote and, when necessary, from other references provided by the quote. It will also look at other relevant past performance information. The evaluation will consider: (1) the qualifications of the researcher(s) relevant to the analysis being performed in the quote and (2) knowledge and previous experience in researching the topic as stated in the PWS. The Government will assess the relevant risks associated with each quote to determine technical acceptance. Performance risks are those associated with an quote's likelihood of success in performing the acquisition requirements as indicated by that quote's record of past performance and knowledge and experience of the research in the fields relevant to this PWS.</p>
<p>For those quoters who have prior contractual experience, the Government will focus on the past performance as it relates to all acquisition requirements, such as cost, schedule and performance, including standards of good workmanship; the quote's adherence to contract schedules, including the administrative aspects of performance; the quote's reputation for reasonable and cooperative behavior and commitment to customer satisfaction; and generally, the quote's business-like concern for the interest of the customer. The Government will consider the number or severity of an quote's problems, the effectiveness of corrective actions taken, the quote's overall work record, and the age and relevance of past performance information.</p>
<p>The following rating method shall be used in the evaluation of the technical approach information:<br />Excellent - Based on the quote's past performance record and/or qualifications and knowledge of the field, no doubt exists that the quote will successfully perform the required effort of the PWS. <br />Good- Based on the quote's past performance record and/or qualifications and knowledge of the field, little doubt exists that the quote will successfully perform the required effort of the PWS.<br />Marginal- Based on the quote's past performance record and/or qualifications and knowledge of the field, some doubt exists that the quote will successfully perform the required effort of the PWS. <br />Poor- Based on the quote's past performance record and/or qualifications and knowledge of the field, serious doubts exists that the quote will successfully perform the required effort of the PWS.</p>
<p>C. Probability that this research will make a fundamental contribution to the literature, produce an innovative concept or idea, offer policy relevant results, or develop new ground that has previously not been fully mined or understood. The evaluation will assess the quality of the quote based on its overall potential contribution to the literature in terms of innovativeness, policy relevance, or furthering the debate.</p>
<p>The following rating method shall be used in the evaluation of the technical approach information:<br />Excellent - Based on the quote's quote, no doubt exists that the quote's quote will make a fundamental contribution to the literature, produce an innovative concept or idea, or develop new ground that has previously not been fully mined or understood. <br />Good - Based on the quote's quote, little doubt exists that the quote's quote will make a fundamental contribution to the literature, produce an innovative concept or idea, or develop new ground that has previously not been fully mined or understood. <br />Marginal - Based on the quote's quote, some doubt exists that the quote's quote will make a fundamental contribution to the literature, produce an innovative concept or idea, or develop new ground that has previously not been fully mined or understood.<br />Poor - Based on the quote's quote, serious doubt exist that the quote's quote will make a fundamental contribution to the literature, produce an innovative concept or idea, or develop new ground that has previously not been</p>
<p>PRICE:</p>
<p>Reasonableness: The Government will evaluate price and determine price reasonableness based on comparative, competitive pricing among the quotes received as compared to the Government's own Independent Cost Estimate. The reasonableness of proposed price and shall also be assessed by the acceptability of the Contractor's methodology used in developing the price estimates. For the price to be reasonable, in its nature and amount, it should be commensurate with what would be incurred by a prudent person in the conduct of a competitive business. Only reasonable quotes will be considered for award. Unreasonably high or low quotes present a risk to the government in achieving a best-value solution and, therefore, will not be considered.</p>
<p>Other relevant information to consider when submitting a quote:</p>
<p>1. Research quotes should include a review of the literature, establish a set of hypotheses to be tested, describe the model, describe the data to test the model, show the policy relevance of the research, list a time line and provide cost information.<br />2. Some data sources require special access due to privacy concerns. Quoters must sufficiently show how they would gain access to such data if they were to be awarded a contract. If applicable, quotes should include the cost of acquiring or using any databases or data lists.<br />3. Quotes that include uses of additional survey(s) for information should demonstrate familiarity with survey procedures, provide the source for respondents, provide collection details and provide realistic estimates of the response rates. Quotes suggesting surveys need to include the survey approval process in the timeline as required under the Paperwork Reduction Act's clearance process within the Office of Management and Budget. Surveys are not preferred over using existing data, as they can place a burden on small businesses, but we recognize that on occasion they are necessary.<br />4. Previously completed research funded by the Office of Advocacy can give researchers perspective when creating quotes. See http://www.sba.gov/advo/research.</p>
<p>A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. (End of Provision)</p>

The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors: (1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and (2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract. (b) Scope.

For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both. (c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage.

The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507?1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk.

<DESC>ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS ASKED AND ANSWERED:<br /><br />Q: Can we use 17-4 stainless steel plate that meets or is above the letter D revision? <br />A: As long as it meets rev D it is fine.<br /><br />Q: In regards to&nbsp;item 4, side plates: when we were drawing the features and details of view 2-C we found that the coordinates of R3, R4,R5 did not produce a continuous profile with the inferred tangency shown.So my question is does this need to be updated first, and does the CAD model that will be provided after quoting supersede the drawing we see now.<br />A: these are the same drawings that have been used several times in the past with no issues.
<p>Q: In regards to the tolerance statement of + or - .007, does this apply to the thickness as well or only the machined features because plate stock is not held to this tolerance.<br />A: tolerance is + or - .007 unless otherwise noted.</p>

<DESC>Synopsis:
<p>**Note: This opportunity was previously posted as FA8202-14-R-1001, please refer to that number for information on how to gain access to the bidders library; however, for all information from this point forward refer to solicitation number FA8202-14-R-1004.</p>
<p>NOTICE: This is not a solicitation but rather a Pre-solicitation Synopsis as required by FAR 5.2. The purpose of this synopsis is to inform the market that the Air Force anticipates releasing a solicitation in the near future as a total Small Business Set-Aside. The proposed North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) Code is 541330, Engineering Services, Military and Aerospace Equipment and Military Weapons which has a corresponding size standard of $35.5M. The Government is interested in all small businesses to include 8(a), Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned, Hub zone, and Women-Owned small business concerns.</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION<br />The Air Force is seeking potential contractors who are interested in providing engineering services to the A-10 System Program Office (SPO) with an anticipated award date of 16 September 2014. This acquisition will be for a single award, 5-year, indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (ID/IQ) type contract with the option to extend services for an additional six months IAW FAR 52.217-8. It is anticipated that there will be 46 tasks associated with the requirement and each having a period of performance from 12-18 months. This notification is a synopsis of a solicitation for potential contractors who have the skills, experience, data or data-rights, and knowledge required to successfully complete this effort for the A-10 SPO at Hill Air Force Base, Utah and does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that a procurement will be accomplished. This is not a request for proposal or invitation for bid. To be considered as a potential source for this requirement, a Contractor will be required to submit data in response to the future solicitation, verifying capabilities to meet the requirements on solicitation.<br />BACKGROUND<br />The A-10 SPO is the primary integrator for all modifications and sustainment changes for the weapon system and the current and anticipated dynamic battlefield environments drive many modernization and sustainment changes to the A-10 legacy aircraft, creating unique requirements to maintain the A-10 throughout its life cycle. Modifications affecting all A-10 functional areas and interfaces to include mechanical, structural, electrical, avionics, weapons, support equipment and operational flight programs (OFP), continue to evolve at an unprecedented pace. The A-10 SPO requires systems engineering support to fulfill its role as prime integrator.<br /><br />OBJECTIVE<br />This effort is to acquire engineering services to identify new and developing technologies that can support the accomplishment of A-10 missions and either eliminate or minimize operational and/or sustainability gaps. The Contractor will have to perform integrated systems engineering to deconflict and integrate A-10 baselines, architecture, programs and processes. These include the necessary tools, templates and training for efficient future acquisition and sustainment of the A-10 aircraft. Specific tasks include the provision of a deconfliction matrix, updates, integration and support of products, views or documents called out in the Performance Work Statement (PWS), development of the A-10 Platform Obsolescence Plan, the analysis for the Support Equipment Roadmap, baseline maintenance, A-10 Weapon System Management Environment (AWSME) maintenance, and configuration technical support . The Contractor must obtain applied knowledge of current Air Force Systems and maintenance engineering processes, as well as logistics management best practices using ERP/APS processes in governmental agencies. Additional knowledge specifically related to Department of Defense (DoD) and Air Force logistics goals, objectives, and current practices is also required. The Contractor must be familiar with use of the DoD Architecture Framework (DODAF) 2.0 as a system engineering tool as well as the documents listed in the Appendices of the PWS.</p>
<p>TASK REQUIREMENTS<br />See attached PWS <br />Please note that the Government will not exclude any specific contractor from competition on this requirement, unless a contractor is automatically excluded as a result of a regulatory exclusion of certain type of contractors (e.g. small business set-aside).<br /><br />NOTES<br />This is not a request for proposal (RFP) or an invitation for bid, nor is it to be construed as a commitment by the Government. The Government does not intend to make an award on the basis of this synopsis <br />Contract performance may also involve data that is subject to export control laws and regulations. Only contractors who are registered and certified with the Defense Logistics Services Center, and have an approved DD Form 2345, will be provided copies of any related solicitation or other data subject to foreign disclosure restrictions.<br /><br />CONTACT INFORMATION<br />Primary points of contact are:<br />&bull; Capt Jennifer Hutchison, Contract Negotiator at jennifer.hutchison@us.af.mil<br />&bull; Nathan Lee, Contracting Officer at nathan.lee.3@us..af.mil<br />&bull; Keith Lewis, Program Office at keith.lewis.7@us..af.mil</p>

The computers and equipment within each shelter will communicate via TCP/IP sockets.   <br>      <br>   4.3.	Inter-Site Communications   <br>   4.3.1.	HCLOS Communications System   <br>   4.3.1.1.	A HCLOS communications network shall be provided between the CO EWOC, ESs, and EAs. Harris RF-7800W or compatible HCLOS communications system shall be used to provide an easy to use and robust communications network and to be interoperable with existing EW elements using the same Harris radios   <br>   4.3.1.2.	The features shall include:   <br>   a.	Voice and data communications.   <br>   b.	A telephone set or more shall be provided at each shelter for intra-site and inter-site VoIP connectivity.   <br>   c.	Management system to configure the radios and set up the communication links.   <br>   d.	Secure communications with the best possible commercial grade encryption capability. The encryption keys can be keyed-in into the system manually through a fill-gun, key-pad, or any other approved mechanism.   <br>   e.	Data rates that can accommodate tasking traffic, different functions, and any bandwidth consuming applications.   <br>   f.	Should support point-to-point (PTP) and point-to-multipoint (PTM) configurations.   <br>   g.	IP networking support.   <br>   h.	Frequency range above 3000 MHz (if contractors selected a compatible radio with frequency range below 3000 MHz, a guaranteed interference cancellation mechanism should be in place). Compatible radios in the frequency range below 300 MHz are not acceptable   <br>   i.	Mast mounted. If selected to be mounted on the EA shelter, should not affect the performance of the system.   <br>   j.	Support repeater configuration (radio relay)   <br>   k.	Contractors must understand that the terrain in the user country is diverse; as a result each company will have, in most cases a unique terrain. Radio links in one case will be approximately 70 Km, and in another case not more than 25 Km. When a PTP configuration is essential for one case, a PTM configuration may work for another case.   <br>   4.3.2.	HCLOS Radio Relay Towers   <br>   4.3.2.1.	We estimate that for some regions in the user country, the distances between EW elements (ES, EA, and EWOC) will be more than 30 Km which makes it difficult to secure connectivity with each other, a fixed-site radio towers configuration must be proposed to provide extended range communications for a single company.   <br>   4.3.2.2.	Each HCLOS radio tower consists of two radios, two amplifiers, one Omni antenna, one directional antenna and a relay unit. The user country will provide the towers and power for the radio equipment, Figure 1 depicts an example tower configuration. The configuration shall require 4 radios, i.e. 2 per tower.   <br>       <br>   Figure 1.  HCLOS Communications Network   <br>      <br>   4.3.3.	Existing IP-Based Network Infrastructure   <br>   4.3.3.1.	The EWOC shall have an IP interface to be directly connected to the existing IP network or through a router.   <br>   4.3.3.2.	The LAN at the CO EWOC and the LAN at the fixed site can be connected through a router. Traffic from/to both LANs can be routed between each other.   <br>   4.3.3.3.	The user country owns a wide coverage TETRA (Terrestrial Trunked Radio) communications network. It is preferable that all EW sub-systems be TETRA-enabled to supplement other communications when operating within coverage areas. This arrangement may require interference cancellation mechanism.   <br>      <br>   US Army Communications- Electronics Command, CECOM Acquisition Center - DAAB07, ATTN: AMSEL-AC, Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD 21005

<p><strong>Description<br /></strong>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG), is anticipating to award a Firm-Fixed Price non-competitive purchase order to the Cleveland Clinic Lerner Research Institute in Cleveland, Ohio to provide assays of TMAO, carnitine, and Choline for 1500 samples obtained from the ongoing ATBC trials. Because this order is to continue on-going research already being performed by the Cleveland Clinic Lerner Research Institute, the Cleveland Clinic Lerner Research Institute is the only source capable of fulfilling this requirement.</p>
<p>The services herein are being procured in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures as authorized by FAR Part 13.106-1 (b)(1). The North American Industry Classification System code is 541990 and the business size standard is $14 million.</p>
<p>Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation. This will be awarded as a firm fixed price type contract.</p>
<p>Period of Performance shall be 5.5 months from date of award (est. 5/1/2014-10/15/2014).</p>
<p><strong>Background</strong><br />There is convincing evidence for a role of red and processed meat in colorectal cancer, but the mechanisms underlying the association between red/processed meat and colorectal cancer are not clear. Colorectal cancer is the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths in both men and women in the U.S. Elucidating the mechanism underlying the association between red/processed meat and colorectal cancer may help to identify intervention targets, which could reduce colorectal cancer morbidity and mortality. Recent studies demonstrated that trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) is produced from choline and carnitine, compounds found in large quantities in red/processed meat and produced by gut bacteria. Moreover, TMAO is associated with cardiovascular disease, atherosclerosis, and inflammation. NCI proposes that gut microbiota may be a major determinant in modifying colorectal cancer risk associated with red/processed meat intake via TMAO production. TMAO and the gut microbiota may account for inconsistent results from past studies, and may highlight the mechanism by which red/processed meat is associated with colorectal cancer. TMAO has been associated with increased inflammatory markers, which may impact cancer risk, and may also contribute to formation of the carcinogen N-nitrosodimethylamine.</p>
<p>The Cleveland Clinic Lerner Research Institute will assess whether carnitine/choline and TMAO are associated with colorectal cancer in a case-cohort study nested in the ongoing Alpha-Tocopherol Beta-Carotene Trial (ATBC). Our primary aim is to determine the association between TMAO, as a potential integrative measure of red/processed meat intake and the gut microbiota, and colorectal cancer. The overarching goal is to provide insight into the mechanism underlying the association between red/processed meat intake and colorectal cancer.</p>
<p><strong>Purpose and Objectives of the Procurement</strong><br />This procurement will assess the role of carnitine/choline and TMAO in risk of colorectal cancer by assaying these compounds in sera in a case-cohort study nested within the ATBC Trial which is ongoing at the Cleveland Clinic Lerner Research Institute. This procurement will utilize serum samples from ~750 colorectal cancer cases and 750 controls in ATBC. Assays will be completed in Dr. Hazen's laboratory at the Cleveland Clinic, which has extensive expertise in TMAO plasma measurements. Cleveland Clinic Lerner Research Institute will measure serum carnitine, choline, and TMAO. TMAO will be measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS), the gold standard method for measuring TMAO. The Hazen laboratory already has panels set up to assay TMAO and many other analytes with this method. Choline and carnitine will be analyzed by stable isotope dilution LC/MS/MS analyses using established methods. For all assays, the laboratory will be blinded to case-cohort status. Each batch will include an equal distribution of colorectal cancer cases and disease-free individuals. 10% of the batch will include quality control samples used to calculate assay coefficients of variation.</p>
<p>Our primary aim is to determine the main effects of TMAO on colorectal cancer. In order to fully explore this association, this procurement will also investigate the associations between serum precursors of TMAO (carnitine, choline) and the disease endpoint.</p>
<p>Secondary aims are to:<br />1. Since TMAO is a biomarker only recently studied in relation to any disease, we will explore the associations that are related to the proposed role of TMAO in colorectal cancer. Specifically, this procurement will investigate the association between meat intake and serum metabolites (TMAO, carnitine, choline). This procurement will also explore the interrelationship between plasma TMAO, carnitine, and choline. Lastly, this procurement will determine whether there is an association between meat intake and colorectal cancer in the overall ATBC cohort (~29,000 men; ~ 825 cases) as well as the subset in which TMAO will be measured (~700 cases).<br />2. Investigate, in an exploratory analysis, whether TMAO is a mediator of the association between red/processed meat and colorectal cancer.</p>
<p><strong>Contractor Requirements</strong><br />The contractor shall perform the following tasks:<br />1. Receive and catalog approximately 1500 serum samples. The receipt of biologic samples should be logged in a MS Excel file including the information of ID, amount of serum received, and date of receipt. To facilitate this, an excel file will be provided by the Government and will include: sample ID and volume provided. The Contractor will add the date of receipt, an internal ID, test/assay date, and values for each serum measurement of interest.<br />2. Analyze carnitine, choline, and TMAO in 1500 serum samples using LC/MS/MS and record the results in the Excel file above.<br />3. Provide a plan for determining if the replicate values are in agreement and for repeat duplicates, as needed. Any insurmountable problems in the analysis of samples shall be reported to the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) within three days of when they happen.<br />4. Send data to the NCI.<br />5. The dates of service will extend 5.5 months from the date of award (estimated period of performance is 05/01/2014-10/15/2014).</p>
<p><br />This notice is not a request for competitive quotation. However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities. The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can perform the requirement. Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 12:00 PM ET, on April 21, 2014. For further information, please contact Brenda Oberholzer, Contracting Officer via electronic mail at oberholzerb@mail.nih.gov. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. No collect calls will be accepted. No faxed or emailed capability statements will be accepted. In order to receive an award, contractors must be registered and have valid certification in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA) thru sam.gov.

The firm(s) will need to have direct contact with Federal, State or local regulatory agencies to ensure compliance with regulations, codes, policies, and permitting processes.</p>
<p><strong>SPECIALIZED SERVICES:</strong></p>
<p>In the course of doing business with Architect/Engineering firms under contract with the Denver Service Center (DSC), the DSC occasionally needs to obtain specialized services from subconsultants under the prime contract. In these instances, the majority of the work may be performed solely by the subconsultant with little involvement of the prime contractor. Even though the work is performed primarily by the subconsultant, DSC will ensure that the prime contractor is involved in all discussions and all correspondence is routed through the prime contractor. Prime contractors have indicated their concerns with the ceiling amounts and the effect these "pass-throughs" would have on the cap. This has been taken into consideration in establishing the maximum contract amount for this solicitation and the resultant contract(s). Prime contractors submitting statements of qualifications are advised that the DSC will continue to acquire such specialized services. The DSC does not allow the prime consultant an administrative handling or coordination fee on sub-consultant's services.</p>
<p><strong>TECHNICAL EVALUATION CRITERIA:</strong></p>
<p>Statements of Qualification will be evaluated by a selection committee of the National Park Service personnel based upon the following primary criteria, applied to the firm, the proposed team, and the proposed key personnel, listed in descending order of importance.</p>

<DESC>This is a solicitation for U.S. Transportation Command's (USTRANSCOM) requirement to procure international and domestic commercial express package service for the United States (US) Government. For both segments (international and domestic), the scope of work requires the contractor to provide time-definite, door-to-door pick-up and delivery, transportation, timely and accurate Intransit Visibility (ITV), Government Third Party Payment System (TPPS) participation, and customs clearance processing. Specific to international transportation services, the contractor shall provide international commercial express package delivery service for the Department of Defense (DoD), civilian federal agencies, and cost-reimbursable contractors for shipments up to and including 300 lbs. For domestic transportation services, the contractor shall provide domestic express delivery service inclusive of next-day, second-day, and third-day delivery for the DoD and cost-reimbursable contractors for delivery of packages up to 150 lbs within CONUS and for delivery of packages up to 300 lbs between CONUS and Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico, and within Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico. The period of performance will consist of a one year base period effective 1 October 2014 through 30 September 2015, two (2) one-year option periods effective 1 October 2015 through 30 September 2017, and one six-month option to extend services.<br />&nbsp;
<p>Interested offerors must participate in the CRAF program and maintain CRAF status throughout the duration of the contract. A class Justification and Approval (J&amp;A) document encompassing this program, which authorizes other than full and open competition was approved on 3 October 2013. It is the Government's intent to award approximately three IDIQ contracts for International Transportation Services and approximately three IDIQ contracts for Domestic Transportation Services to provide flexibility of choice and service coverage. The Government reserves the right to award more or fewer IDIQ contracts in each service segment if it is determined to be in the best interest of the Government. Offerors who propose on and receive awards in both service segments (i.e., International and Domestic Transportation Services) will be awarded only one IDIQ contract which encompasses the International and Domestic Transportation Service requirements.</p>

<AWARDEE>Nutonian, Inc.
<DESC>Air Force Materiel Command, Air Force Life Cycle Management Center, Wright-Patterson AFB OH, intends to negotiate a sole source Firm-Fixed Price contract for Eureqa Server with Desktop in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 15.2, as supplemented with additional information in this notice. The contract will be awarded to Nutonian, Inc. Market research was previously conducted and it has been determined that this is a sole source requirement IAW FAR 6.302-1.
<p>This is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation is available. All interested sources must respond in writing with clear and convincing evidence to support their ability to provide timely and effective services within one (3) days of this publication. A determination by the Government not to compete this action based on responses received is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>
<p>Authority: 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), Justification: Supplies (or services) required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible sources and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.</p>
<p>Market research was conducted with only one respondent: Nutonian, Inc. Ms. Jill Willingham, AFLCMC/AQP, 1790 10th Street, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH 45433-7630, has been appointed as Ombudsman to hear concerns from offerors, or potential offerors, during the proposal development. The purpose of the Ombudsman is to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. Existence of the Ombudsman does not diminish the authority of the program director or the contracting officer. Accordingly, the Ombudsman does not participate in the preparation of solicitations, the evaluation of proposals or the source selection process and, therefore, for routine matters on individual solicitations, please contact the buyer at the telephone number listed herein. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. Any questions regarding this acquisition should be directed to the Contract Negotiator, Emily Hardy at (937) 255-3398 or e-mail: emily.hardy.1@us.af.mil. Should you desire to contact the Ombudsman, Ms. Jill Willingham can be reached at (937) 255-5472, e-mail: jill.willinghamallen.1@us.af.mil.</p>
