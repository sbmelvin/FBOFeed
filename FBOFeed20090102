<DESC>The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, Snake River Area Office in Burley, ID, intends to award a sole source purchase order to Progressive Irrigation District, 2585 N. Ammon Rd., Idaho Falls, ID for trash rack cleaning at four siphons under the Ririe Outlet Channel located near Ririe, in Bonneville County, Idaho.  The Ririe Outlet Channel was constructed by the Corps of Engineers to convey flood waters from Ririe Reservoir to the Snake River.  The outlet channel cuts through the middle of the Progressive Irrigation District and required the construction of four siphon crossings on the major canals/lateral in the district.  The Corps of Engineers transferred the outlet channel and siphons to Reclamation in the late 1970's and through 1995, Reclamation used staff at Ririe Dam to clean the trash racks for the four siphons.   In 1995, staff was reduced and Reclamation made the decision to contract out the trash rack cleaning.  An evaluation of the districts in the outlet channel area indicated that only Progressive Irrigation District maintains a work force equipped to inspect and clean the trash racks.  In addition, the district has staff in the area on a daily basis as they maintain a large canal and lateral distribution system which included trash racks of their own.  One principle benefit of having Progressive Irrigation District complete the trash rack cleaning is the fact that the district is aware of current conditions, potential problems, and related issues without requiring an inspection of just the four trash racks.
The irrigation season is approximately 150 days long and at a minimum, the trash racks need to be inspected and cleaned at least daily.  Also, depending on the time of the year and related weather, these tasks may be repeated several times per day.   Specifically, during the early part of the irrigation season the siphons may take three of more trips per day including night visits.
The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only a single source under the authority of FAR 6.001(a) using FAR Part 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and there is no solicitation available.  However, proposals received by January 16, 2009, will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  
Inquiries will be accepted by FAX at 208-678-4321 attention Gaye Mangum, SRA-2314, or by email to gmangum@pn.usbr.gov

General Instructions
FOB Destination is applicable to this solicitation.  Inspection and acceptance will be made at Destination by the Government. Delivery will be made to the Fleet Readiness Center-SW, San Diego, CA 92135. 
The following provisions and clauses are applicable and are hereby incorporated into the solicitation by reference.  The full text of the clauses/provisions from the FAR and DFARS can be accessed via the Internet using the following website addresses - www.arnet.gov/far/ and http://farsite.hill.af.mil/vfdfarspdf.htm.  It is the responsibility of the offerors to obtain copies of the necessary provisions and or clauses that are required as a part of this solicitation.  Required clauses/provisions that are not submitted may render an offer not to be accepted by the Government. 
FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors Commercial Items (NOV 2007).  NOTE: This provision must be reviewed completely. It contains the guidelines for submission of your quotation.
FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation - Commercial Items (JAN 1999).  The Government intends to make one Firm Fixed Price Requirements contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.
The following factors shall be used to evaluate the quotation:
Factor (1) Technical Capability.   To be determined technically acceptable, the contractor must furnish information, e.g.: descriptive literature that provides sufficient technical information for the products being offered to be evaluated by the Government. 
Data must be submitted in accordance with FAR 52.212-1(b)(4). Provide information in an electronic (pdf preferred) if possible.  
Contractors meeting Factor (1) will have their quotation further evaluated under Factors (2) and (3).
Factor (2) Past Performance.Contractors are required to provide Past Performance data on your companies' two most recently completed federal government contracts (Not to exceed (3) years since completion) for like or similar material and services required by this solicitation. If you do not have federal government contracts, list state, local or commercial contracts.  Provide contract number, date of contract, quantity, unit price, total cost and the name of government activity or commercial company, point of contact/phone number. This performance data will be used to evaluate your companies past performance in meeting contract cost/price, technical and delivery objectives. Information should be provided on the Past Performance Data Sheet.  Information utilized will be obtained from these references as well as any other sources who many have relevant information. 
Offers which lack relevant past performance history will receive a neutral rating for this factor. Any offeror's proposal which has no relevant past performance history, while rated neutral, may not represent the most advantageous proposal to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful proposal when compared to the proposals of other offerors.
NEUTRAL: No relevant past performance available for evaluation. Offeror has asserted that it has no relevant directly related or similar past performance experience. Proposal receives no merit or demerit for this factor.
OUTSTANDING: No risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, or of any degradation of performance, or lack of customer satisfaction based upon the offeror's past performance.
SATISFACTORY: Very little risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, or of degradation of performance, or lack of customer satisfaction based upon the offeror's past performance.
MARGINAL: Significant potential risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, and of degradation of performance based upon the offeror's past performance. 
Factor (3) Pricing.Contractors must provide a current unit pricing for all CLINs specified for the Base Year and all option years and a total cost for the Base Year and option years quoted.  The unit price shall remain constant throughout the base year and any subsequent option year (price may change year-to-year). Only those offers which are determined by the Contracting Officer to have an acceptable Factor (1), TECHNICAL CAPABILITY, will be further evaluated under Factors (2) and (3).  In the second step of evaluating those offers determined under Factor (1) to be acceptable, Factor (2), PAST PERFORMANCE, is considered more important than Factor (3), PRICE.  Offeror's PRICE will be the final discriminate in the   evaluation.  Should Factors (1) and (2) be equal between/amongst competing offerors, the offeror with low price will prevail.
Quotations which take exception and do not meet the government's requirement may be determined to be unacceptable and not considered for award. At the discretion of the Contracting Officer, the government intends to evaluate quotations without discussions and award a Firm Fixed-Price contract. Each initial offer should contain the contractors best terms from technical, delivery and pricing standpoint. 
The following clauses are applicable to this combined synopsis/solicitation - FAR 52.204-7 Central Contractor Registration (JUL 2006); 52.212-3, Offeror Representation and Certifications-Commercial Items ALT I (APR 2002) - NOTE: 52.212-3 is considered a "fill-in."

<CONTACT>Monique B. Williams, Contracting Officer, Phone 301-492-3640, Fax 301-492-3437, Email monique.williams@nrc.gov
<DESC>The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) intends to issue a Request for Proposal for a full and open competition for the project titled, “Westinghouse Simulator Re-Host.”  The contract type will be Time and Materials.  The anticipated period of performance for this contract is five (5) years which includes one (1) base year and four (4) option years.  

The Office of Human Resources Training and Development (HRTD), requires that the Westinghouse full-scope control room simulator be re-hosted from its current computer system to an industry-standard processor that will be on Intel or Intel-compatible processor technology.  The software shall run under either the Microsoft Windows or Linux operating systems.  When complete, the simulator shall be capable of running all of the scenarios, plant evolutions, and simulated failures which can currently be run.  The objective is to improve long-term simulator maintainability and remove obsolete computer systems.

Specifically, the Contractor will do the following tasks:

•	Replace the Westinghouse-provided executive system software with executive system software that is more compatible with current operating systems and software development utilities;

•	The Contractor shall provide a suite of software tools that are used to develop and update the simulator mathematical models;

•	The Contractor shall supply a replacement instructor station that is compatible with the new computer system and executive system and that has, as a minimum, the same capabilities as the existing instructor station;

•	The Contractor shall supply the necessary hardware and software to interface with the present control bench board input/output (I/O) system; and 

•	The Contractor shall approach this project, to the maximum extent possible, as a turn-key project.  

This requirement does not anticipate subcontracts; therefore a small business subcontracting plan is not required.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 611430.  Proposals for this requirement may be submitted by all concerns, i.e. large businesses, small businesses, small businesses owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, and service disabled veteran-owned small business.

The preferred method of distributing the NRC Procurement information will be through Federal Business Opportunities (www.fbo.gov).  It is the responsibility of the recipient of this solicitation to ensure that it has been received in its entirety and NRC bears no responsibility for data error resulting from this transmission.  The Contracting Officer has enabled the, “Interested Vendors List (IVL)” feature in fbo.gov for offerors that are interested in teaming opportunities for this requirement.  

This solicitation will be posted on fbo.gov (The Government Point of Entry (GPE) on or around January 16, 2009.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>Expressions of Interest Sought

Requirement:

The United States Government currently occupies office and related space in a building under lease in Rochester NY that will be expiring. The Government is seeking to lease approximately 2943 contiguous rentable square feet of office and related space. The rentable space must yield a minimum of 2543 contiguous ANSI/BOMA Office area square feet (OASF). The lease term requirement is for 10 years. The space must be available for occupancy by July 1st 2009. The delineated area is, the inner loop of Rochester

Other Applicable requirements include:

1.	Proximity to Metrorail
2.	Parking 6 reserved surface spaces for official Government vehicles
3.	Offered space must meet Government requirements for security, fire safety and handicapped accessibility. 

The Government is considering alternative space if economically advantageous. The Government will use the information it receives in response to this advertisement as a basis to develop a cost-benefit analysis and to determine whether to compete the lease requirement or pursue a sole source justification to remain at its current location. In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Government’s requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications infrastructure, and non-productive agency downtime.

<DESC><p>THIS IS A MARKET RESEARCH/SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE SEEKING INFORMATION ONLY. THE GOVERNMENT IS LOOKING FOR BUSINESS SOURCES THAT CAN OR COULD PROVIDE THE FOLLOWING: Information from companies, research and development laboratories (public and private), or other sources about commercially available oil filtration systems that may be used for filtering contaminations particulates, jet fuel and water from low viscosity 1010W oil.</p>
<p><br />i. This Request for Information (RFI) is part of an overall strategy to extend the life of our 1010W (MIL-L-6081) lubrication oil used as a preservation agent in the aircraft's fuel tank and engine fuel systems during aircraft storage. The information obtained by sources sought will be used to develop a feasibility study that will be coupled with a hands-on evaluation to identify which system or systems should be considered for implementation. The Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Group (AMARG) is assessing the market to gain information about commercial oil filtration systems for potential use in the Processing-In of aircraft for storage. Information about the filtration system's ease of use, and compatibility with existing systems will be considered. Reliability, availability and maintainability are also areas of interest.<br />The following capabilities, in a non-prioritized order, are of specific interest to AMARG:<br />&bull; must separate jet fuel from the 1010W low viscosity oil (less than 10% content)<br />&bull; separate water (not to exceed 200PPM of water)<br />&bull; separate particle counts (not to exceed 1.2 microns)<br />&bull; reliable system with very little maintenance</p>
<p>ii. GENERAL INFORMATION ON THE AMARG PROCESSING-IN OF AIRCRAFT FOR STORAGE<br />&bull; 1010W oil is used as a preservation agent for the storage of aircraft. Oil is pumped into the aircraft's fuel tank and fuel lines<br />&bull; AMARG re-uses oil taken from stored aircraft. Oil is pumped back into one of seven holding tanks<br />&bull; Oil can be re-used until its content reaches a 25% threshold of fuel and a certain micron level of particles (1.2 microns). <br />&bull; AMARG currently processes 3,000 to 20,000 gallons of oil in an 8-hour shift (one shift operation)<br />&bull; AMARG stores new and used oil in seven (7) holding tanks totaling 57,000 gallons</p>
<p>iii. REQUIREMENTS OF FILTRATION SYSTEM<br />AMARG is requesting detailed product literature, specifications and procedures, to assist in determining the capability of the system against specific AMARG requirements and future needs. Filtration system vendors are invited to participate initially by providing information about their products. Based on the information provided and market research, selected vendors will be given the opportunity to continue in the assessment process by demonstrating capabilities of their system offering or components as needed to perform a more in-depth assessment of functional capabilities. Other evaluation criteria include: <br />&bull; Method and duration of processing 15,000 gallons of oil<br />&bull; Filtration capabilities with respect to particle counts and water in parts per million (PPM)<br />&bull; Labor required to man the equipment<br />&bull; Flow rate in gallons per minute (GPM)<br />&bull; Maintainability<br />&bull; Standards compliance<br />&bull; Training support<br />&bull; System costs plus annual preventative maintenance costs<br />&bull; Expandability<br />&bull; Certification or evaluation by external bodies<br />The goal of the assessment is to identify new capabilities and evaluate existing commercial products against specific functional requirements and future needs.</p>
<p>iv. Please note that this is a REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY. This is NOT a request for proposal and there is no solicitation package available at this time. Participation does not imply any obligation by AMARG or the United States Government or any agency thereof. Proprietary information will be protected to the greatest extent provided by law. THE GOVERNMENT WILL NOT PAY FOR ANY INFORMATION RECEIVED IN RESPONSE TO THIS REQUEST, NOR WILL WE COMPENSATE ANY RESPONDENT FOR ANY COSTS INCURRED IN DEVELOPING THE INFORMATION PROVIDED. WE WILL ALSO NOT PAY FOR ANY DEMONSTRATION NOR COMPENSATE ANY RESPONDENT FOR ANY COSTS INCURRED WITH DEVELOPMENT OR PERFORMANCE OF A DEMONSTRATION THAT MAY BE REQUESTED.</p>

<DESC>Contracting Office Address
U.S. Department of Health & Human Services, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, Office of Acquisition and Grants Management, 7500 Security Blvd, M/S C2-21-15 Baltimore, MD 21244-1850, UNITED STATES
Introduction
The purpose of this Notice is to determine the availability of potential small businesses (e.g., 8(a), service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, veteran-owned small business, and women-owned small business) capable of acting as the national administrative contractor for the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA) 1 Section 1011, Federal Reimbursement of Emergency Health Services Furnished to Undocumented Aliens program.  

Background

Section 1011 of the MMA (Federal Reimbursement of Emergency Health Services Furnished to Undocumented Aliens) (http://www.cms.hhs.gov/UndocAliens/Downloads/sec1011.pdf) requires that the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services (DHHS) directly pay certain hospitals, physicians, and ambulance suppliers2 for their un-reimbursed costs of furnishing certain emergency services3 to certain patients4.  In response to this statutory mandate, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) is seeking an administrative contractor for the Section 1011 program.  

Section 1011 appropriated $250 million per year for each of fiscal years (FYs) 2005 through 2008, for provider payments, and requires that these funds remain available until expended.  As of December 2008, $328.8 million remains.  Section 1011 funds are allocated by state and the amount of each state’s allocation differs from each other, each determined according to the size of its resident alien population and the number of alien apprehensions made each year, as determined by statistics provided by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.  The Section 1011 program will continue operations until all funds are expended, even though no additional monies will be appropriated beyond FY 2008.

The Provider Billing Group, within the CMS Center for Medicare Management, is charged with contracting oversight, administration, and management of the Section 1011 program, which became operational at award of the first administrative contract in July 2005.  The original effective date of the Section 1011 program was for claims with dates of service May 10, 2005 and after.  Total provider payments have historically averaged approximately $50 million per quarter and are required to be made electronically.  The program will continue operations under its current administrative contract through calendar year 2009.   The contractor that is awarded the second administrative contract for the program will inherit existing government-owned systems, property, processes, and protocols for continuing program administration.  The contractor will also receive training from the existing administrative contractor for a prescribed period of time (a “transition period”), after which the new administrative contractor must be fully independent and operational by January 1, 2010.  The new contractor must further meet at least the requirements identified below.

Notes

1 Pub. L. 108-173

2 Eligible providers include hospitals, physicians, and ambulance services (including both Indian Health Service facilities whether operated by the Indian Health Service or by an Indian tribe or tribal organization, and Critical Access Hospitals)

3 Eligible services include health care services required by the application of section 1867 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395dd), and related hospital inpatient and outpatient and ambulance services.  

Note #3 History: 
Sections 1866(a)(1)(I), 1866(a)(1)(N), and 1867 of the Social Security Act impose specific obligations on Medicare participating hospitals that offer emergency services.  These obligations concern individuals who come to a hospital emergency department and request examination or treatment for medical conditions, and apply to all of these individuals, regardless of whether or not they are beneficiaries of any program under the Act.  Section 1867 of the Act sets forth requirements for medical screening examinations of medical conditions, as well as necessary stabilizing treatment or appropriate transfer.  In addition, section 1867(h) of the Act specifically prohibits a delay in providing required screening or stabilization services in order to inquire about the individual's payment method or insurance status.  Section 1867(d) of the Act provides for the imposition of civil monetary penalties on hospitals and physicians responsible for negligently violating a requirement of that section, through actions such as the following: (a) Negligently failing to appropriately screen an individual seeking medical care; (b) negligently failing to provide stabilizing treatment to an individual with an emergency medical condition; or (c) negligently transferring an individual in an inappropriate manner (Section 1867(e)(4) of the Act defines "transfer" to include both transfers to other health care facilities and cases in which the individual is released from the care of the hospital without being moved to another health care facility).
 
These provisions, taken together, are frequently referred to as the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA), also known as the patient anti-dumping statute.  EMTALA was passed in 1986 as part of the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (COBRA).  Congress enacted these anti-dumping provisions in the Social Security Act because of its concern with an increasing number of reports that hospital emergency rooms were refusing to accept or treat individuals with emergency conditions if the individuals did not have insurance.  

4  Payment under Section 1011 is allowed for patients who are any of the following: (A) Undocumented aliens, (B) Aliens who have been paroled into the U.S. at a U.S. port of entry for the purpose of receiving eligible services, (C) Mexican citizens permitted to enter the U.S. under the authority of a biometric machine-readable border crossing identification card (laser visa) issued in accordance with the requirements of regulations prescribed under section 1101(a)(6) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(6)).

Examination Engagement for Review of Medicare Advantage Organizations and Prescription Drug Plans’ Financial Information

THIS IS NOT A FORMAL REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP) AND DOES NOT COMMIT THE CENTERS FOR MEDICARE AND MEDICAID SERVICES (CMS) TO AWARD A CONTRACT NOW OR IN THE FUTURE.

This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE to determine the availability of companies (small, large, disadvantaged, other) that are qualified to support CMS in the examination engagements for the review of the Medicare Advantage Organizations (MAOs) and Prescription Drug Plans (PDPs). 

Background:  From the beginning of the Medicare program in 1965, Medicare has recognized the unique nature of Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs) and HMO-like entities and has provided for alternative payment methodologies appropriate for such organizations. The original Medicare amendments to the Social Security Act included the authority for prepaid plans to receive payments for physician services on a basis other than individual charges. Even before the enactment of the federal HMO Act in 1973, the 1972 amendments to the Social Security Act provided authority to contract with HMOs on a risk-sharing basis and on a cost basis. 

The Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act (TEFRA) was passed in September 1982 in which Congress mandated the provision of managed care plan options to Medicare beneficiaries. The statute allowed Medicare beneficiaries to enroll in HMOs reimbursed on a cost basis (also known as MCOs) or “risk-contracting” HMOs.  HMOs reimbursed on a cost basis are reimbursed for “reasonable cost” incurred for Medicare covered services rendered, related administration on those medical services, plan administration, and a defined special administration.  The special administration is reimbursed 100%.  

In 1996, Section 202 of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) added section 1893, to the Social Security Act.  Section 1893 established the Medicare Integrity Program (MIP).  MIP was established to strengthen CMS’s ability to deter waste, fraud and abuse in the Medicare program.  It provides for separate and stable long term funding for MIP activities.  MIP expands CMS’s contracting authority so the agency can more aggressively carry out program safeguard functions.  

The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA) established the Medicare+Choice (M+C) program, allowing additional types of managed care organizations to secure Medicare contracts. 

A major intent of the BBA was to replace TEFRA with a new managed care options (i.e. M+C plans, etc.) for beneficiaries. It allowed for new beneficiary options in addition to the well established types of HMO options operating under TEFRA contracts. 
 

The recently-enacted Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA) has expanded the role of private entities in providing benefits to Medicare beneficiaries. First, the law adds a new section to the Social Security Act, 1860D (“Part D”) that offers prescription benefits beginning in 2006 through Prescription Drug Plans (PDPs). Secondly, the statute allows for payments to Medicare Advantage Organizations (MAOs) “local plans” formerly M+C plans, and creates a new type of private plan, “Regional” MA plans or Regional Preferred Provider Organizations (RPPOs).

CMS’s Office of Financial Management (OFM) has overall responsibility for the fiscal integrity of all Agency programs which includes the mandated one-third financial audit requirement.  OFM will conduct annual audits of the financial records of at least one third of the MAOs and PDPs as required by Sections 1857(d)(1) and 1860D-12 of the Social Security Act.

Description of work: The main objectives of the examinations are to provide assurance that Medicare Advantage and Prescription Drug payments were proper and organizations’ self reported information used to determine payment amounts were valid and correct. The audit contractor shall document the results of the examination, extrapolate the value of appropriate exceptions to the entire population and propose payment adjustments.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes solicitation AG-0116-S-09-0015 and is being issued as a Request for Proposals.  No other written solicitation will be issued.  This notice and any incorporated provisions include those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-26 date June 2, 2008.  Proposals are being solicited from Small Business Concerns only.  The NAICS code associated with this acquisition is 481212 and the small business size standard for that code is: less than 1,500 employees. The government has a requirement for refueling several remote radio repeater sites located in Southeast Alaska.  These sites are situated on or near mountain tops where there is no road access and are accessible only by helicopter.  The weather conditions at these sites can vary considerably during any season.  The sites include fixed 500 gallon propane tanks.  A data table included as an attachment to this notice indicates the name, location (latitude and longitude), elevation, and estimated gallons of propane required at each of the repeater sites.  The Government anticipates full “liquid out” tanks to be sling load transported to the remote site via helicopter rated for the specific load.  A fuel mechanic shall then remove the barrel from the sling, transfer the fuel to the on-site tank(s), and repeat until all tanks are at maximum capacity.  Fuel tanks and lines at each site shall be checked for condition and leaks prior to fuel transfer.  If a leak(s) are detected, the contractor shall isolate the leak and provide the Government with a repair estimate.  The contractor shall record the actual gallons of propane delivered and the gauge reading after delivery for each repeater site.  Delivery documentation shall include date of fill, gauge reading, gallons propane delivered, and be furnished to the Government concurrent with the contractor’s invoice.  The radio repeater sites are part of a high priority communications system and must be kept operational at all times to facilitate employee and aircraft tracking.  The offeror must have experience with this or similar type tasks due to the associated flight risks.  LINE ITEM 0001  Liquid Propane Gas, delivered to various remote mountain top radio repeater sites, 7,300 Gallons (estimated) , Price per Gallon $________,  Total Price $_________.LINE ITEM  0002  Helicopter Fuel (to be treated as a reimbursible cost).  Estimated Fuel Cost: $_________ LINE ITEM  0003  Delivery (excluding helicopter fuel) and mechanical transfer to fixed tanks, 1 Job, Lump Sum Price $__________.  Note:  The quantity of liquid propane gas is estimated.  The Government will pay for the actual quantity of fuel delivered at the quoted unit price.  Helicopter fuel will be a significant cost element in the performance of the contract and will be treated as a reimbursible cost.  The Contractor shall invoice the Government for helicopter fuel consumed in the performance of the work as calculated in accordance with the aircraft fuel consumption rate and the contractor’s tariff or normal business operations.  As each site is refueled, the contractor may invoice the governement for actual propane and helicopter fuel costs (CLINs 0001 and 0002).  Delivery (CLIN 0003) payment will be made upon completion of the delivery to all sites.  The Government anticipates delivery will commence on or about July 1, 2009 and all deliveries shall be concluded within 60 days of the commencement of delivery operations.  FAR 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders—Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition and the following clauses are checked as applicable:  52.219-6, 52.222-3, 52.222-19, 52.222-21, 52.222-26, 52.222-35, 52.222-36, 52.232-33, and 52.222-41 (the applicable Service Contract Act wage determination is an attachment to this notice).  FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions—Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition.  FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation—Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition.

Interested companies must provide company name, contact person, address, phone number, fax number, email address and the names of representatives who will be attending. As a reminder, all attendees from outside the United States must have the appropriate Foreign Visit Request to attend the Industry Day Conference.  Conference facility space is limited and will be accommodated on a first-come-first-served basis.  Attendance is not mandatory and will not affect eligibility for future contract actions.<BR><BR>On Wednesday, January 14 2009, the Government will host one-on-one discussions with those interested in meeting with the Decontamination Family of Systems (DFoS) Program Manager.  Discussions will be limited to 20 minutes.  Sign-up procedures for these meetings will be posted at the conference and will be on a first-come-first-served basis.<BR><BR>A Request for Information (RFI) and Test Evaluation Criteria for the Future Decontaminant(s) will be posted on the Natick Contracting Division (NCD) website at https://www3.natick.army.mil/upcoming.cfm on or about January 5, 2009.  Comments and questions regarding the RFI and test evaluation criteria that are received by January 9, 2009 will be addressed during the conference.  All comments and questions regarding the RFI and test evaluation criteria will also be addressed on the NCD website.<BR><BR>Summary of Planned Acquisition Strategy:  The acquisition strategy and evaluation  phases will be discussed in detail during the conference.  The Government anticipates the use of FAR Part 12 Acquisition of Commercial Items utilizing simplified acquisition procedures as defined in FAR Part 13 to contract with industry for available decontaminants that meet the specified performance requirements.  Five (5) phases of activity are planned.  In Phase I the Government will execute a Request for Information (RFI) to identify and assess commercial decontaminants that have potential for integration with the JSTDS-SS.  In Phase II the Government will purchase small quantities (e.g. 700 units (e.g. gallons, lbs, etc) of selected candidate decontaminant(s) and conduct an independent Government evaluation which includes Kinetics, Pot Life, and initial compatibility evaluations with the JSTDS-SS, detectors and Individual Protection Equipment. In Phase III the Government will procure additional quantities (e.g. 1,000 units) of candidate decontaminant(s) (identified as top performers from phase II) and begin a more detailed evaluation of efficacy on select materials, material compatibility, shelf life and high/low temperature kinetics.  In Phase IV the government will purchase large quantities (e.g. 10,000 units) of candidate decontaminant(s) (identified as top performers from phase III) and conduct an independent Government evaluation to complete efficacy and materials compatibility testing, verify selected decontaminant(s) meet all JSTDS-SS  related requirements for Packaging, Handling, Storage & Transportation (PHS&T) and ensure the selected decontaminants have no negative effect on the systems reliability.  In Phase V, the Government will procure and initiate fielding of the decontaminant(s) identified as best meeting the Governments requirements.<BR><BR>Industry Day Conference Agenda<BR>Tuesday, January 13 2009<BR>0830 - 0900 Registration <BR>0900 - 0905 Introductions<BR>0905 - 0930 Agenda/Ground Rules  <BR>0930 - 1000 Simplified Acquisition Strategy <BR>1000 - 1100 Future Decontaminant RFI/Evaluation Criteria for Phase I<BR>1100 - 1130 Test Validation for Phase II, III & IV  <BR>1130 - 1200 JSTDS-SS Overview <BR>1200 - 1330 Lunch <BR>1330 - 1400 Lessons Learned: Peroxide, Engineering Concerns, and DF200<BR>1400 - 1430 Decontaminant Logistic Issues/Warfighter Burden (Chemical School)<BR>1430 - 1500 JSTO Efforts<BR>1500 - 1530 Hazard Mitigation Material and Equipment Restoration (HaMMER) <BR>1530 - 1630 Q&A <BR><BR>Directions<BR><BR>Conference Facility <BR>The conference center is approximately 50 miles south from Reagan National Airport (DCA) and 65 miles north from Richmond International Airport (RIC).
