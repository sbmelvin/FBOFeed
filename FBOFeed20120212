DOWNTIME DOES NOT INCLUDE SCHEDULED PMs OR TIME CONTRACTOR IS WAITING ON VA PROVIDED PARTS. If downtime exceeds sixteen (16) consecutive hours, the Contracting Officer may exercise the option to hire an alternative source to resolve the problem.

			DOWNTIME					%DECREASE

			12 - 13:59 HOURS				20%

<DESC>The 177th Fighter Wing NJANG intends to award a firm-fixed price sole source blanket purchase agreement to Texas Mgt Associates, Inc. (TMA) for repair/overhaul of F-16 radar absorption panels. Currently TMA is the only source approved by the System Program Office, Engineering section, at Hill AFB for contract repair. The SPO is responsible for researching and applying TO standards for the entire F-16 fleet and has the authority to authorize approvals for repairs, refurbishment, and/or any deviations. The SPO does not have the organic capability to refurbish these panels because these panels were not originally designed to need replacement. Because the F-16 fleet service life has been extended and structural modifications have taken place, these panels have become brittle and are now beyond fair wear and tear and require maintenance actions.<br> <br>This notice is for informational purposes only; no formal solicitation will be issued as a result of this announcement. This is not a request for quote.  <br>This is a special notice prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii), Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. However, any firm that believes it can meet this requirement may give written notification to the Contracting Officer within 3 days from the date of publication of this announcement. Supporting evidence must be in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to comply with the requirement. Responses received will be evaluated; however, a determination by the Government to compete the proposed procurement based on the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. If no responses are received, the 177th Fighter Wing will proceed with awarding a fixed price type blanket purchase agreement to Texas Mgt Associates, Inc. for repair/overhaul services. Point of Contact for this requirement is bethelee.bullock@ang.af.mil.<br><br>Contracting Office Address:<br>177 Fighter Wing<br>400 Langley Road<br>Egg Harbor Twp NJ 08234-9500<br>

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. <br><br>The solicitation number is W911QY-12-R-0006 and is issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP), unless otherwise indicated herein. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular FAC 2005-53, effective July 5, 2011. This will be a full and open competition to provide a Joint Sensitive Equipment Wipe (JSEW) that will be used to decontaminate sensitive equipment (such as weapons system optics and electronics) and non-sensitive equipment under NAICS code 325998 -- All Other Miscellaneous Chemical Product and Preparation Manufacturing. <br><br>The small business size standard is 500 employees. Multiple awards are anticipated. The number of awards will be dependent upon the number of Offerors with qualifying products and available funds. Any contract awarded as a result of this solicitation will be a Firm Fixed Price Contract awarded using Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR 12. Funds are not presently available for this acquisition. No contract award will be made until appropriated funds are made available. Contract award(s) resulting from this solicitation are subject to availability of funds. <br><br>The Attachments listed in this solicitation may be downloaded from the ASFI website: https://acquisition.army.mil/asfi and from the Natick Contracting Division website https://www3.natick.army.mil. The Government intends to award a contract(s) WITHOUT DISCUSSIONS with Offerors, but reserves the right to conduct discussions if determined to be necessary in the best interests of the Government. <br><br>DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENT:<br><br>This solicitation is for the provision of all labor and expertise necessary to provide a Joint Sensitive Equipment Wipe (JSEW) in accordance with the requirements of this solicitation. The JSEW concept represents an individual product or kit (e.g., wipe, gel, spray, and ancillary equipment such as glove(s), sponge(s), towel, etc) intended to decontaminate sensitive and non-sensitive equipment, which can be easily carried by the warfighter during decontamination operations and/or while conducting missions that may require decontamination to be performed. The following product characteristics are desired: <br><br>- Commercial products with the ability to decrease the level of gross chemical agent contamination from 10 g/m2 to 1 g/m2 in support of thorough decontamination on sensitive and non-sensitive equipment. <br>- Commercial products that can be applied directly to equipment surfaces and capable of removing gross contamination within five minutes following application. <br>- Commercial products that are available in durable packaging that can be easily opened by a Warfighter wearing Mission-Oriented Protective Posture (MOPP) 4. <br>- Products that are non-hazardous, non-flammable and inherently safe, minimizing hazards to both personnel and the environment, and that do not produce uncontrollable residual hazards during the decontamination process. <br>- Products that do not cause material/equipment degradation when used to decontaminate sensitive and non-sensitive equipment. <br>- Products that do not cause false positives/negatives for fielded tactical detectors. <br>- Products that do not degrade military relevant Individual Protection Equipment (IPE) or the effectiveness or ability of fielded decontamination products.<br><br>Each JSEW, in its designed configuration of components, must perform the functions necessary for successful completion of the JSEW mission, meet all of the physical characteristic requirements in the Performance Specification (PSPEC) (Attachment 4) and decontaminate chemical agents on sensitive and non-sensitive equipment to the efficacy levels specified in the PSPEC. Potential solutions for JSEW include, but are not limited to, a wipe impregnated with a decontaminant; a dry wipe; a decontaminant applied via a wipe and removed with a second wipe; multiple wipes contained in a single package; a spray bottle of decontaminant with some form of removal media; a gel applied to the surface and peeled off, or other configuration that meets the requirements of the PSPEC. The unit of measure in this solicitation is each (EA). The Offeror is to consider "one each" as all of the necessary components, packaged together as one item or kit, necessary to decontaminate sensitive or non-sensitive equipment as specified in the PSPEC. <br><br>For full text of this Combined Synopsis/Solicitation, proposal format and instructions, evaluation criteria, attachments and all other documentation, please click the Additional documentation link under "Additional Info" below:<br><br>
