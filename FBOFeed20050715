<DESC>The objective of this contract is to retain closing services for acquisitions of wetland and grassland easements on behalf of the United States of America, acting by and through the Natural Resources Conservation Service, United States Department of Agriculture, pursuant to Title XII of the Food Security Act of 1985, as amended, 16 U.S.C. 3837.

The Wetlands Reserve Program, Emergency Watershed Protection Program/Floodplain, Grasslands Reserve Program, and the Farm and Ranchland Protection Program authorize the acquisition of easement rights from willing landowners for the purpose of restoring and protecting wetlands and grasslands.  The NRCS is the lead agency within the USDA charged with administering these programs.

The contractor shall furnish all closing services, including obtaining title insurance from a title company qualified and authorized by law to issue title insurance policies in the state where the land lies and be approved by the State Insurance Commissioner or equivalent.  In addition, the title company should be on the approved list of the U.S. Attorney General.  The Contractor will perform the same closing services as in a commercial transaction including disbursement of funds, obtaining and recording deeds, and any necessary, curative instruments to assure merchantable insurable title to the easement in the name of the United States of America, by and through the Secretary of Agriculture, to the wetland and/or grassland easement.

The closing services will be performed in the county courthouse of the county in which the wetland and/or grassland easement is located, unless the Contractor, landowner, and NRCS representative mutually agree to a different location.

The Contractor is responsible for having a current knowledge of the requirements of state law in connection with closing real estate transactions and title clearance.  The title insurance company and their issuing agents must be authorized by law to furnish title insurance and must be approved by the by the State Insurance Commissioner in the state where the land lies.  In addition, the title insurance company must be on the U.S. Attorney General’s list of approved companies.

The Contractor will provide evidence of liability insurance coverage for errors and omissions in the amount of at least $1,000,000 and fidelity coverage of at 	least $500,000 on each individual who will have access to the WRP, EWP, GRP or FRPP funds or provide an indemnification agreement from the title insurance for which the Contractor will close the transaction(s) satisfactory to the NRCS providing for reimbursement to NRCS for any loss caused by fraud or dishonesty 	or failure by the attorneys, agents, or employees of the Contractor to comply with NRCS’ written closing instructions.  The ALTA Closing Protection Letter 	Revised 3/27/87 is satisfactory to meet this condition of responsibility.  Evidence of liability must be provided prior to contract award.

Upon completion of the closing, the Contractor will send to NRCS the ALTA U.S. Policy Form 9/28/91, naming the United States of America, by and through the Secretary of Agriculture, as the insured, in the amount of the purchase price as of the date and time of recording of the Warranty Easement Deed to the United States of America.  The policy of title insurance will be free and clear of any and all encumbrances (exceptions) to the title except those shown as acceptable in the OGC Preliminary Opinion.  At the time of closing, the Contractor will provide a Settlement Statement to the landowner, in the form similar to HUD-1 (8-87) RESPA, HB 4305.2.

Upon receipt of the survey plat by the NRCS, the Contractor will forward the preliminary title package to the contracting officer at the NRCS state office within ten (10) business days.  Upon receipt of the PTO of the OGC, the Contractor will close the transaction within ten (10) business days of receipt of payment.  Within five (5) business days of closing, the contractor will forward the final package to the contracting officer at the NRCS State Office.

Work performance required by this SOW will involve access to potentially sensitive information about governmental and landowner issues.  All Contractor personnel must comply with the terms of AGAR 452.224-70, Confidentiality of Information, as well as provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 552a.  Additionally, the Contractor’s employees shall comply with privacy of personal information relating to natural resources conservation programs in accordance with Section 1244 of Title II of the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002 (P.L. 1078-171).

The Contractor will ensure that personnel prohibit discrimination in all aspects of programs and activities related to the Contract on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, religion, age, disability, political beliefs, sexual orientation, or marital or family status.

Only the NRCS Contracting Officer may authorize a modification to this contract.  Any questions may be directed to the Contracting Officer, Sue Jones at (605) 352-1213 or via fax at (605) 352-1270.  All technical questions shall be directed to Vicki Supler, Contract Specialist, at (605) 352-1204.

<DESC>The Reversible Barriers (ReBar) program is soliciting proposals due 14 September 2005 for initial selections.  Point of Contact (POC): Tom McCreery, Program Manager, Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Special Projects Office (SPO), 3701 North Fairfax Drive, Arlington, Virginia 22203-1714; e-mail: BAA05-38@darpa.mil (e-mail contact preferred). OBJECTIVE:  Military operations on the ground include both direct combat and other dangerous and labor-intensive activities such as searching buildings for weapons or personnel, hostage rescue, ground intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR), and more. These kinds of activities are especially prevalent in military operations in urban terrain (MOUT) and counter-insurgency, and are very manpower-intensive.  For example, US Army doctrine states that for a large two-story building, 60 soldiers are required to safely clear the building.  Many of these troops are “leave behinds” who guard doorways and hallway intersections. Outdoors, US and allied forces must block and secure roads, conduct hostage rescue missions, and execute other dangerous and manpower- and materiel-intensive operations. The ability to quickly and easily prevent or restrict access to both building and outside areas would be tremendously advantageous to US forces, especially if this could be done in a rapidly reversible manner. The goal of the Reversible Barrier (ReBar) program is to develop barriers that can be rapidly emplaced and reversed to allow fluid US force movement. This new generation of barrier technology should have a set of features including (a) light-weight and portable; (b) very strong and resistant to various types of attack; (c) quick and easy to install; and (d) rapidly reversible only for U.S. and allied personnel. Both indoor and outdoor barriers must be applicable to a range of sizes (e.g., inside: doorways, windows, and hallways; outside: bridges, urban roads, and alleys); however the technologies for inside and outside barriers do not necessarily have to be the same. Finally, the reversible barrier technology developed through ReBar must be safe for troops to use and must not pose unacceptable environmental hazards.  To achieve the extraordinary level of compactness and portability, it is apparent from first principles that the ReBar system will need to be, at least in part if not entirely, chemically based. The goal of the Indoor Site Access Denial (ISAD) portion of the ReBar program is to develop barriers that (a) use no more than 5kg of material per barrier; (b) are compact enough so that a minimum of two barrier systems could be carried in a standard issue rucksack; (c) can stand up against forces equivalent to attack by a fully equipped infantryman for one hour; (d) can resist commonly available chemicals and fire; (e) can be installed to completely block a standard sized interior doorway (34” x 81”) in under 30 seconds including securely attaching the barrier to the doorway; and (f) can be reversed in less than one minute. The goal of the Outdoor Site Access Denial (OSAD) portion of the ReBar program is to develop barriers that (a) use no more than 30 kg of material per barrier; (b) can fit in the space of one Mk19 40mm grenade ammunition case; (c) can stand up to one hour of an attack by a group of fully equipped infantrymen, battering ram, or attack with a light pickup truck such as a ½ ton Toyota; (d) resist attack with commonly available chemicals and fire; (e) can be installed to block a two-lane bridge in under five minutes including secure attachment to the bridge surface, and (f) are reversible in less than five minutes.  PROPOSAL SUBMISSION:  Proposers must obtain the BAA05-38 Proposer’s Information Pamphlet (PIP) which provides further technical and administrative detail for this BAA including the technologies of interest, evaluation criteria, funding processes, and format of proposals.  Proposals not meeting the specified format described in the PIP may not be considered for award.  The PIP is not classified and may be obtained from the FedBizOpps website at www.fedbizopps.gov. A table of important dates and milestones is provided in the PIP.   These include a Pre-proposal Conference to be held 17 August 2005 in San Antonio, TX at the Southwest Research Institute.  This announcement, the PIP, and Unclassified material from the Pre-proposal Conference will be available on the ReBar Website, http://rebar.swri.org. To be considered for funding during the initial round of selections, proposals must be received no later than 1600EST, 14 September 2005. Proposals should be mailed to DARPA, 3701 N. Fairfax Drive, Arlington, VA 22203 Attn: Mr. Tom McCreery/BAA05-38/Document Control. Questions regarding this BAA or comments on the PIP may be e-mailed directly to BAA05-38@darpa.mil.  It is anticipated that contracts will be awarded on or about November 2005.  The Government will not be liable for the cost of proposal preparation and submission.  Proposals must be submitted in accordance with this announcement and the PIP.  There will be no other solicitation issued in regard to this requirement.  Proposers should be alert for any BAA amendments that may be published on the FedBizOpps website.  ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST:  Each cost proposal shall contain a section satisfying the following requirements: awards made under this BAA are subject to the provisions of the FAR, subpart 9.5, Organizational Conflict of Interest.  All Proposers and proposed subcontractors must affirmatively state whether they are supporting any DARPA technical office(s) through an active contract or subcontract.  All affirmations must state which office(s) the Proposer supports and identify the prime contract number(s).  Affirmations shall be furnished at the time of proposal submission and the existence or potential existence of organization conflicts of interest, as that term is defined in FAR 9.501, must be disclosed.  This disclosure shall include a description of the action the Proposer has taken, or proposes to take, to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate such conflict.  If the Proposer believes that no such conflict exists, then it shall so state in the section.  It is the policy of DARPA to treat all proposals as competitive information and to disclose the contents only for the purposes of evaluation.  The Government intends to use non-Government personnel as special resources to assist with the logistics of administering the proposal evaluation and providing selected technical assistance related to proposal evaluation.  These support personnel are restricted by their contracts from disclosing proposal information for any purpose and are required to sign Organizational Conflict of Interest Non-Disclosure Agreements.  By submission of its proposal, each Proposer agrees that proposal information may be disclosed to those selected contractors for the limited purpose stated above.  Any information not intended for limited release to support contractors must be clearly marked and segregated from other submitted proposal material.

A pre-proposal meeting is tentatively scheduled for September 14, 2005.  The time and location of the pre-proposal meeting and due date for submission of proposals will be included in the solicitation documents.  

All firms responding to this solicitation will be required to submit a business and technical proposal for evaluation.  Proposals will be evaluated using weighted factors, as further described in the Solicitation.

The proposed procurement is a Small Business set aside.  NAICS code:  337215.  Business Size Standard: 500 employees

The MMP increment 1 provided a ?low-risk technical program? that integrated two communications systems into the same ICBM LCC equipment rack - EHF transmit/receive capabilities and VLF/LF Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) mandated High Data Rate (HIDAR) secure message reception.  MMP increment 1 is in the final phases of production and deployment at the three ICBM Space Wings.  MMP Advanced EHF (AEHF) modification (increment 2) will provide, by 2010, EHF Extended Data Rate (XDR) functionality with the capability to operate on the Transformational Satellite (TSAT) constellation, using the AEHF XDR waveforms defined in the AEHF Payload to Terminal Interface Control Document (ICD) to facilitate transformation to Network-Centric Operations.

<DESC>This is a Pre-solicitation Notice for the General Services Administration.  GSA will
will be issuing a RFP solicitation for Design-Build Services for a project located at the 230 N. First Avenue, Phoenix, AZ, Federal Building and United States Courthouse. Design Intent Bridging Documents have been completed and will be used to solicit bids from qualified Design-Build contractor. These documents will serve as the approved Design Intent, to be used by the awarded contractor to complete Construction Documents.

This project will involve the North and South elevations of the building, where the current fresh air intakes are located. The mechanical rooms, located at the North and South elevations, currently use fresh air intake fed through on-grade and above-grade openings from the basement to the 8th floor.  The Design Intent Bridging Documents require the construction of a new intake air shaft from the street level to the 8th floor that will limit fresh air intake to the areas at the 5th floor and above. The shaft will be sealed at the floors below the 5th floor.

The estimated timeframe on this project is ten months for both design and construction.  All work will need to be closely coordinated with GSA to ensure undisturbed and normal operations of the building and its tenants during the construction period.  Any disruptive work may have to be scheduled for after hours.  The normal building hours are Monday through Friday 6AM – 6PM.  The total estimated budget on this project is $500,000 - $1,000,000.  All employees working on this project will need to pass a full background check through the Department of Homeland Security.  Only those who have passed the security check will be allowed to work on the project.

The solicitation will be issued on Monday, August 1, 2005 and will close on Wednesday, August 31, 2005 at the close of business.  A pre-solicitation conference and site walk will be held on Tuesday, August 9, 2005 at 9 AM at the 230 N. First Avenue Federal Building and Courthouse in the Joint Use Conference Room on the second floor, Room #205.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Laboratory of Biosystems and Cancer (LBC), Center for Cancer Research (CCR) plans to procure, on a sole source basis, data entry and file development from the initial first year of the prospective follow-up study to the Stavanger Nested Case-Control Study of Preeclampsia with Norwegian University of Science and Technology, School of Medicine, NO-7489 Trondheim, Norway.   The acquisition is being conducted under the simplified acquisition procedures authorized in FAR Part 13. The North American Industry Classification System Code is 541710 and the business size standard is 500 employees.  Background: The Laboratory of Biosystems and Cancer, Center for Cancer Research, NCI, requires the data entry of and file development from the first year of follow-up study of questionnaires and other data collection techniques to the 1993 birth cohort of the study known as: The influence of preeclampsia on hormonal and anthropometric status in boys and girls at 10 and 13 years of age: Follow-up of the Stavanger population–based nested case-control study, (heretofore known as the Puberty Follow-Up Study).   The ultimate purpose of this research project is to explore the biological mechanisms underlying why women who suffered from preeclampsia during pregnancy and their offspring are at significantly reduced risk of breast cancer (in mothers and daughters of that pregnancy) while the male offspring are at the lowest risk of prostate cancer identified in the literature.  The information collected during the first year of data collection will need to be keyed, entered, and developed in an analytic file for analysis of the major study objectives.  Given the large sample size of 1,000 parent-offspring pairs in the original birth study, there is the opportunity to have the statistical power to compute hormonal and other growth factor differences in the study population.  Dr. Lars Vatten was the primary author to the research based in the Rogaland Hospital in Stavanger, Norway of the population-based study of women diagnosed with preeclampsia in pregnancy and their offspring and a comparable set of normotensive controls.  His analysis of the original birth study identified significant growth retardation in newborns of preeclamptic in contrast with newborns of normotensive mothers as well as hormonal differences in the cord blood of the offspring of the two pregnancies.  These hormones are associated with reduced risk of breast cancer in animal models and in human epidemiologic research.  Dr. Vatten and his team therefore have the experience with the study cohort and have collaborated with the Rogaland Central Hospital to develop the file and link to other available registries in Norway. This is the only population-based study to date of preeclampsia and these women represent all women, who were diagnosed with preeclampsia in pregnancy in the birth years from 1993 through 1995 who resided in the Stavanger area in Norway.  The NCI has the opportunity to conduct a follow-up of these mothers and children, linking with the original study database.  The questionnaire items focus on dietary intake during the index pregnancy and since the birth of the index child, lifestyle and demographic characteristics, family history of cancer, and family history of reproductive disease, including preeclampsia in the mother’s and biological father’s families.  Period of Performance:   estimated three months.  The Norwegian University of Science and Technology, School of Medicine is the only known source to the NCI that can provide the aforementioned requirements. The Investigator has been involved in the original birth study and has worked for many years with the Medical Director of The Rogaland Central Hospital.  Their insights from the original study as well as their scientific leadership in the area of preeclampsia provide extraordinary knowledge and experience in the Norwegian linked birth-cancer registry system, the public health record system, and in this particular study population.  They have worked with the study data sets over the years and can thereby lead a team in the data analysis of the follow-up study.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirements, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The capability statement and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can fully meet the requirements herein.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 PM EDT on July 29, 2005.  If you have any questions, please submit them in writing via electronic mail to Karen Gardner, Contract Specialist at gardnerka@mail.nih.gov or by fax 301-402-4513. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received shall be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. No collect calls will be accepted.  In order to receive an award, contractors must be registered with the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) at www.ccr.gov and the online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA) at http://orca.bpn.gov.

<DESC>In accordance with Simplified Acquisition Procedures the National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences (DCCPS), Applied Research Program (ARP), intends to procure on a sole-source basis with the Public Health Institute, 555 12th Street, Oakland, CA 94607 for follow-on to a previous contract (263-MQ-216193) conducted by the Public Health Institute to conduct quality-assurance work across several languages for the 2003 California Health Interview Survey (CHIS), by applying two survey pretesting procedures:  behavior coding of fielded survey interviews, and cognitive interviewing.  
The ARP plans, conducts and supports research related to evaluating the quality of survey questionnaires used for cancer risk factor surveillance.  As part of this mission, the ARP sponsors research intended to develop and evaluate novel forms of questionnaire quality assessment and evaluation.  The Public Health Institute shall:  a) conduct analysis and dissemination of previously conducted behavior-coding data from the CHIS to include quantitative analysis, using logistic regression and other appropriate statistical techniques, to assess the contributions of both demographic factors and cultural/linguistic factors in assessing the performance of CHIS questions, with a focus on cancer-relevant measures that are asked of all adult respondents (e.g., diet and nutrition, cancer prevention and screening variables), for the adult survey and to disseminate the findings from the quantitative analyses through the production of a research manuscript, such that the contractor shall collaborate with the NCI Project Office to produce a report aimed at publication in a peer-reviewed health journal ; (b) conduct cross-cultural cognitive interviewing of survey questions identified as problematic within CHIS based on behavior coding analysis, and (c) conduct cross-cultural cognitive testing on an NCI-developed cancer-risk perception scale that has previously been evaluated by a separate survey research organization, for purposes of independently comparing the results across organizations.  The Public Health Institute was the contractor who preformed the initial study and they are the only organization that has the data and is able to do this follow-up study.  The work to be completed requires a significant amount of prior experience and knowledge with quality assessment of data previously collected as part of the California Health Interview Survey (CHIS), across several languages.  The Public Health Institute has previous experience with a cross-cultural behavior coding and cognitive interviewing, especially as targeted to the CHIS which make them uniquely qualified to perform the above stated requirements.  Continuity of this on-going study is crucial to this project and the Public Health Institute is the only known source to the end-user who has the data to complete this project. This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the entire above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities.  All information furnished shall be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI researcher to determine if it can meet the requirements of this synopsis.  An original and one copy of the capability statements must be received in the Contracting Office by 1PM EDT (local Washington, D.C. time) on August 1, 2005.  Faxed and emailed capability statements are NOT authorized.  All questions must be in writing and may be emailed to Debbie Moore at dm170b@nih.gov or faxed (301) 402-4513.  It is the vendor’s responsibility to call (301) 402-4509 and verify that questions were received.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. In order to receive an award from the NCI contractors must be registered in the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA) in order to receive an award.  Please refer to http://orca.bpn.gov in order to register.   In addition, contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) www.ccr.gov.  No collect calls will be accepted.  NAICS: 541990; Size Standard is 6 million.

<DESC>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) High Altitude Long Endurance (HALE) Project at Dryden Flight Research Center (DFRC) has a need for a Contractor to develop specific models for HALE class of vehicles simulator. NASA/DFRC intends to procure these services from University of Michigan, Prof. Carlos Cesnik, Aerospace Engineering Department, 50 Thompson Street, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48109-1340. Carlos E. Cesnik is an expert in the areas of active nonlinear aeroelasticity, structural mechanics and smart structures and extensive experience infinite element modeling, and structural and design optimization. Mr. Cesnik developed a strain-based geometrically nonlinear beam dynamics analysis which will be utilized to accomplish this work. Development to be performed is to create a coupled 6-DOF vehicle simulation with the nonlinear strain-based structural formulation for high-aspect ratio lifting surfaces. The resulting tool will be integrated in DFRC simulation environment for future HALE class of Vehicles. Equations of motion modules developed will build on the PI's previously developed Matlab-based computer code Nonlinear Aeroelastic Simulation Toolbox (NAST), and made compatible with DFRC simulation modules and structure. The simulation will contain different sources of nonlinearities that are computationally time-consuming. Classification of the different nonlinearities for a given aircraft configuration will allow the elimination of time-consuming calculation of nonlinear terms that do not significantly affect the vehicle's response. Two main levels of simulation will be pursued: batch and real-time simulations. A low-order strain-based nonlinear structural analysis coupled with unsteady potential flow aerodynamics form the basis for the aeroelastic model, and needs to account for the interactions between wakes of different lifting surfaces, or interference between fuselage and wings, for a representative nonlinear structural flexibility model. Report detailing all equations, assumptions, methods used to arrive at the conclusions drawn on all work. (1 job, 12 Months after contract award) Software models in Matlab format (1 job, 12 Months after contract award) The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12 or 13. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 3:30 p.m. local time on ___8/1/05________.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.

<DESC>NASA/JSC has a requirement to increase the Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Maximum for the Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory (NBL)/Space Vehicle Mockup Facility (SVMF) Operations Contract (NSOC), NAS9-02102. The contract supports operations at two critical facilities; the NBL and the SVMF at the NASA Johnson Space Center (JSC). Both facilities support crew training and development activities critical to the Space Shuttle and International Space Station (ISS).  Any disruption to schedules or operations at these two facilities would adversely impact critical deadlines and potentially disrupt the Space Shuttle flight manifest. The engineering portion of this contract requires the delivery of facility and mockup projects which are built to exacting standards and in accordance with strict regulations required by the nature of their use.  The mockups delivered for the SVMF must be manufactured to human use standards and in accordance with strict guidelines. The mockups manufactured for use at the NBL must be made in accordance with requirements which support their usability in a water environment, must be made neutrally buoyant and must have the ability to accept modifications in both a dry and wet (under water) environment.  Facility projects for the NBL and SVMF require knowledge of the facility, the interfaces, and the systems within each facility. The NBL has a large number of complex systems, some of which are life support and critical to sustaining the ability to perform underwater training for suited subjects.  This requires that the individuals or company performing the upgrade be extremely knowledgeable of all aspects of engineering and facility operations. The projects to be performed are highly technical and require an in-depth knowledge of the facilities and operational schedules.  Without this knowledge, a contractor proposing to do the work would be unable to perform and to integrate the required modifications and/or upgrades in a timely manner and in a manner that does not interfere with on-going training and development schedules.  The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C.2304(c)(1) and 10 U.S.C. 2304(d)(1)(B) as contemplated by the provisions of FAR 6.302-1.  This provision states that full and open competition need not be provided for when the services required by the agency are available from only the original source in the case of a follow-on contract for the continued provision of highly specialized services.  The provision also states that this exception is applicable when it is likely that award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition or there would be unacceptable delays in fulfilling the Agency’s requirements.  Because of the above considerations, including unacceptable costs and delays that would be incurred to conduct a competition and/or select a different contractor, the potential benefits from competition do not justify accepting these substantial risks to the Space Shuttle and ISS programs.    The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. See Note 26.  See Note 22.  Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.  All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the Agency.   An Ombudsman has been appointed. See NASA Specific Note "B".

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is issuing Request For Proposal Number R-CHI-00808 in support of the HUD Headquarters, Office of Policy Development and Research (PD&R), Program Evaluation Division.  One contract is expected to be awarded as a result of this solicitation for collection and analysis of administrative data/records of the Moving To Opportunity (MTO) Demonstration Program.  The MTO program implemented an experimental design to allow measurement of the impact on poor families of moving from high poverty public and assisted housing in five large cities to low poverty neighborhoods through the use of a housing voucher. HUD has continued to track these families to allow for this final impact evaluation. The base contract is for the final impact evaluation. This evaluation involves a base contract and two options. This procurement is being issued on a negotiated basis. The contractor will develop data matching agreements with States to obtain unemployment insurance, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), and food stamp records for the Moving To Opportunity (MTO) sample.  HUD will provide the data match to its housing assistance data systems. The contractor will analyze these data to report on the impact of the demonstration on employment rates, wages and TANF, Food Stamp, and housing assistance participation rates. Option 1 provides for in-person data collection and a report on a sub-sample of households using the instrument designed in the base contract. Option 2 provides for an expansion of the sample of households to supplement the data being used for the option 1 analysis and report.  The base contract has a duration of 72 weeks due to the often-prolonged time periods to negotiate data agreements with States.  Option 1 would add 84 weeks to the contract. Option 2 would run concurrent with Option 1. If option 1 and/or Option 2 are executed the total contract period would be 156 weeks (three years). This procurement is unrestricted. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541720 (Research and Development in the Social Sciences and Humanities) and the size standard is $6 million, average for the last three years. A cost-reimbursement type contract is expected to be awarded as a result of this solicitation, however the Government reserves the right to award the most appropriate type of contract. The solicitation package will be available on or about 15 days form this notification and proposals will be due on or about 45 days from this announcement. Special Announcement: This notice will be posted on HUD’s Internet Home Page since HUD posts all required notices of its contracting opportunities at http//www.hud.gov/offices/cpo/Index.cfm  Potential offerors who download copies of solicitations from HUD’s Home Page Contracting Opportunities or FedBizOpps will not automatically receive any amendments to those solicitations. You are advised to check back frequently to see if HUD has issued any amendments to solicitations you have obtained. Hard copies of this solicitation may be obtained by writing to: Wayne Bernacki, Contract Specialist, HUD Contracting Operations Branch, 77 West Jackson Blvd., Room 2517, Chicago Illinois 60604-3507 or you may contact Wayne Bernacki at 312/886-2760, extension 2505.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE IS FOR INFORMATION ONLY – The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) intends to negotiate on a SOLE SOURCE basis with the National Center for Rural Health Works (NCRHWks) at Oklahoma State University, Department of Agricultural Economics, 508 Ag Hall, Stillwater, OK  74078, to continue development of a national information center (Rural Health Works) that will provide analysis, technical assistance, and information to policymakers, researchers, State Offices of Rural Health, Cooperative Extension Service and rural communities on the importance of health care services to the local economy.  

The focus of this project has been to (1) train State-level officials in how to measure the economic impact of health care services (IMPLAN), (2) conduct analysis of the economic impact that selected health policies have on the local economy, (3) conduct a full community engagement/planning process and (4) help providers identify new service opportunities that was developed by the Oklahoma State University.  Most States have participated in these training workshops. The Government intends on using the lessons learned from this successful project on a national basis. 

The program originated through the Extension Program at Oklahoma State University (OSU) and has also been maintained and further developed through the Extension Program at OSU.  OSU has provided the NCRHWks activities and products to Oklahoma rural communities for the past 25-30 years and continues to provide them each year.  The OK program was the original basis of the NCRHWks program; it was modeled and the templates and sample technical reports were developed by OSU at their own expense and became the pilot of the NCRHWks original initiative in 1998.  OSU has continued to develop and provide additional products, as well as providing technical expertise, training, and advice to the other States in their statewide NCRHWks program development.  The OK program through OSU Extension has become the National Center for Rural Health Works.  OSU has the expertise and trained staff to provide the training and technical expertise to other States, and to continue their development of new health impact areas. 

The anticipated period of performance for this project is for one (1) year with 2 twelve month option periods.  The statutory authority is FAR Part 6.302-1(a)(2) and 41 USC 253(c)(1), only one responsible source, no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements without substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.  Oklahoma State University developed the models and the database that RHW uses.   Any other organization would have to duplicate the database that has been developed by Oklahoma State University at their expense.  A Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition has been prepared by the Government.  Any interested party may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement by submitting a capability statement in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to perform the services without incurring substantial cost duplication.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  A draft Statement of Work is attached for informational purposes only.  A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.   The NAICS Code is 541990.   See Numbered Note 22.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center for Cancer Research (CCR) Genetics Branch (GB) intends to procure the Biotage Pyrosequencer PSQ HS 96 System SNP it has had in the laboratory for 10 months under a Leasing Agreement from Biotage Inc., 1725 Discovery Dr., Charlottesville, VA  22911.  One of the GB studies is the identification and/or characterization of molecular markers that may be utilized in the early detection and prevention of cancer.  The current emphasis is on the tumor-specific promoter region methylation of genes important in breast and prostate carcinogenesis.  The Biotage HS SNP Pyrosequencer will be used in the quantitative assessment of the methylation status of many CpG sites simultaneously of genes important in prostate carcinogenesis.  The Biotage PSQ Pyrosequencing HS 96 System SNP is based upon proprietary chemistry developed by Biotage/Pyrosequencing.  The technology is a sequencing-by-synthesis method that relies on luminometric detection of pyrophosphate release upon nucleotide incorporation via an enzymatic cascade.  The pyrosequencing technique offers a fast and efficient way to identify DNA (or cDNA) sequence variation and allows for the simultaneous and quantitative evaluation of variation in regions of up to 60 bases.  The assays require a small amount of sample and have been shown to be able to quantify the degree of sequence variation with high accuracy.  The PSQ Pyrosequencing HS 96 System SNP must be able to:  1) be able to determine gene methylation quantitatively down to 5% levels; 2) be able to determine quantitative methylation of multiple CpG sites simultaneously (at least 50 base pair regions); 3) be sensitive enough to determine PCR yields as low as 50 ng of product; 4)   have a 96-plate format for high throughput analysis; and 5) have adequate software for conversion of data into Microsoft Excel.  Biotage is the only known source to the NCI researcher that can provide a commercial piece of equipment that meets the aforementioned requirements.  This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the entire above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities.  All information furnished shall be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI researcher to determine if it can meet the requirements of this synopsis. This acquisition will be processed under FAR Part 12 – Acquisition for Commercial Items and will be made pursuant to the authority in FAR 13.5 to use simplified procedures for commercial acquisitions.  An original and one copy of the capability statements must be received in the Contracting Office by 1PM EDT (local Washington, D.C. time) on July 22, 2005.  All questions must be in writing and may be emailed to Debbie Moore at dm170b@nih.gov or faxed (301) 402-4513.  It is the vendor’s responsibility to call (301) 402-4509 and verify that questions were received.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. In order to receive an award from the NCI contractors must be registered in the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA).  Please refer to http://orca.bpn.gov in order to register.   In addition, contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) www.ccr.gov.  No collect calls will be accepted.

<DESC>The Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology intends to enter into negotiations with MetroSage, LLC 26896 Shake Ridge Road, Volcano, CA 95689-9610 with the intent of awarding a sole sole contract in accordance with FAR 6.302-1 and 13.106-1(b). The resulting contract will provide software enhancements to the existing proprietary Pundit/CMM MetroSage software to assist the Dimensional Metrology Program (DMP) within the Manufacturing Engineering Laboratory of NIST,  to develop technology to improve US industrial dimensional metrology.  Of particular interest to the DMP is the development of software that allows the calculation of task specific measurement uncertainty of coordinate measuring machines (CMMs).  This type of software leverages the extensive knowledge of metrology experts at NIST and elsewhere into a package that is accessible to typical industrial practitioners.  The DMP has developed a type of computer simulation, known as “simulation by constraint” to allow the calculation of CMM task specific uncertainty, and this technique has been incorporated into a software package known as Pundit/CMM by MetroSage.  The Pundit/CMM software provides an extensive graphical interface that allows industrial users to specify their particular measurement conditions and then executes the simulation by constraints calculation yielding the measurement uncertainty result.  

Currently, the DMP is performing research and development efforts to expand CMM uncertainty calculation capabilities.  Specifically, NIST seeks the ability to calculate the CMM measurement uncertainty for a small number of “prototypical” workpieces based on an interview conducted between the software and the industrial user (Phase I); this is analogous to the interview process conducted by “TurboTax” software for the purpose of determining federal tax liability.  Additionally, NIST seeks the ability to apply this method of calculation to workpieces having complex surfaces (Phase II).
 
The resulting contract is anticipated to be a one year effort and not to exceed the Simplified Acquisiton Threshold.

All responsible sources shall respond by submitting by e-mail a written narrative statement of capability, including detailed technical information and other literature demonstrating the ability to meet the above requirements to the point of contact listed in this notice. The responsible source shall specifically identify their authority to modify the MetroSage proprietary source code to accomplish this effort. The response must be sufficient to permit agency analysis to establish a bona fide capability to meet the requirement. Failure to submit documentation will result in the Government proceeding with negotiations. NO TELEPHONE CALLS WILL BE ACCEPTED AND MESSAGES LEFT WILL NOT BE RETURNED. Any questions should be directed to Albert.Petto@nist.gov.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

The form has two parts: Part I  Contract-Specific Qualifications, and Part II General Qualifications.  Although there has been a slight delay in the implementation, firms interested in the  electronic submission of the Standard Form 330 part II will soon be able to submit it to the Business Partner Network (BPN) at www.bpn.gov. For a logon and password, firms will use their DUNS number and the Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) t hey selected when registering on the CCR web site, www.ccr.gov. Part II is prepared on a branch office basis, which aligns with the assignment of DUNS Numbers.  Submission of the SF330 Part II to the BPN is voluntary.  However, it will increase a firms vi sibility in the Federal marketplace and may lead to opportunities for contracts that are exempt from public announcement.  Do not submit a SF 254 or a SF 330 Part II to the Architect Engineer Contract Administration Support System (ACASS). ACASS will be mo dernized in late 2004 to retrieve the SF330 Part II data from BPN and make it available to contracting agencies.  Until then, agencies will require A-E firms to submit Part II with Part I when responding to a solicitation of A-E Services.  A Part II is req uired for each branch office of the prime firm and any subcontractors that will have a key role in the proposed contract.  After ACASS is modernized, contracting agencies have the option of requesting firms submit Part II with Part I or retrieving Part II from ACASS if a firm has one on file in BPN. You may direct any policy questions on the SF330 Part II to Marilyn Nedell at the ACASS Center at (503) 808-4590, or by email at Marilyn.B.Nedell@usace.army.mil Use the help feature on BPN for general questions about the use of BPN. You shall include in your SF 330 Part I and Part II package, ten (10) projects for which the firms have completed the design and construction phase services.

Past Performance is based on timeliness of delivery and customer satisfaction within past three (3) years.  Your offer should contain sufficient detail to evaluate your ability to meet the stated requirements.  Please provide three (3) references (names, phone numbers, and e-mail addresses, if available) for past performance.  The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by including only the price for the basic requirement; i.e., options will not be included in the evaluation for award purposes. The following provisions are incorporated by reference: 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors—Commercial Items; 52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications Commercial Items (Reps and Certs must be submitted with offer); 52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions—Commercial Items.

A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further actions by either party.  Before the offer’s specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer, whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.  Offers are due by 3:00 p.m. on July 27, 2005, to the attention of Linda Mullen via email at lmullen@comdt.uscg.mil.  For information call Linda Mullen at 202/267-1639.

<CONTACT>Point of Contact, Scott Fogle, Purchasing Agent, Phone (513) 487-2049
<DESC>NAICS Code: 421490   Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) Amendment #2:  Technical question and answer.  The original response date of 07/22/05 remains unchanged. The 90 days to deliver from start of the contract is tight.  We can deliver a working AUV system to EPA within the 90 days but it  would not be fitted with the high performance navigation module. The AUV that would be delivered within the 90 days would be operational and it would be adequate for the EPA technician to start using the AUV and navigating via dead reckoning.  The additional module can be delivered within 150 days  of contract start or 60 days after the base unit is delivered. Is this acceptable? Answer:  Yes, that is acceptable Amendment #1 Information:   Technical Question & Answers AUV Requirement,  The Original response date of 07/22/05 remains unchanged. Would there be a problem using a Russian built  fuselage with a U.S. designed and built drive and electronics?  Answer:  There is no prohibition against using a Russian built fuselage, as long as commonly replaced parts (such as O-rings) are readily available (i.e., if the fuselage comes with unusually sized O-rings that are difficult to  purchase for replacement, that would be unacceptable). We use high mega-pixel Japanese built SLRs and specialized Japanese video cameras.  In our system we use a video camera and an SLR - we have the video camera coupled to the eyepiece of the SLR, so that both video and an SLR still use the same  optical chain.  Would such a system implementation be acceptable? Answer:   Yes. This is a combined synopsis/request for quote for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  Quotes are being  requested and a written RFQ will not be issued.  Shipping charges need to be included in price.  The current NAICS code is 423490 for this requirement. (the previous NAICS code from 1997 was 421490, which is also listed in the synopsis).  The specifications for the Autonomous Underwater Vehicle  (AUV) are as follows:    Synopsis: An Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) is an advanced technology, multipurpose swimming robot that can effectively measure environmental parameters used to access ecological health and species-habitat interactions in aquatic environments.  AUVs  can be configured  with a variety of sensor packages to measure water quality, with video cameras to map habitats and biota (e.g. shellfish), and with side scan sonar to acoustically image seabed properties in both shallow and deep environments. This instrument will be a key component in a variety of research  projects at AED in the Habitat Effects Branch, which currently is conducting research in support of the Aquatic Stressors Framework's plan for Altered Habitat Research and focuses on coastal marshes, estuaries, and near shore habitats at the scale of habitat elements and habitat mosaics up to and  including entire coastal ecosystems.   The Aquatic Stressors Framework states that spatial habitat mapping will be a "vital tool" in application of the stressor-response models, and thus habitat mapping of shorelines, lakes, estuaries, and sub-estuaries should be a part of the quantitative research  involved in creating the models.  AUVs are ideal tools for assessing and mapping habitats and biota over large spatial scales and at speeds comparable to the rate processes of interest.  By outfitting the AUV with a video camera, side scan sonar unit, CTD and dissolved oxygen probe, real-time  measurements of habitat quality and quantity (e.g. bottom topography, presence of shellfish beds, dissolved oxygen levels, stratification, seagrass bed areal extent and level of patchiness) can be collected relatively rapidly.  The habitat and biota data collected by the AUV will be essential for  ground truthing, over large spatial scales, the habitat alteration (stressor)-species response models and habitat suitability indices currently under development by the Habitat Effects Branch.  This instrument will contribute to research that will (1) synthesize habitat quantity, quality, or  arrangement (stressors), and (2) quantitatively relate these habitat alteration stressors to fish, shellfish, or wildlife (responses), thus supporting the Altered Habitat Research Plan's APM 5 (Report characterizing relationships of between abundance, quality, and arrangement of various habitat  types ad selected biotic assessment endpoints in coastal systems) and APM 6 (Synthesized quantitative species-habitat relationships suitable for developing regional habitat-based bio-criteria for shorelines, lakes and estuaries).  As dissolved oxygen level is an assessment endpoint for the  Watershed Diagnostics Branch, the AUV, equipped with the fast-response dissolved oxygen sensor, will be a valuable research tool for this branch as well (APM- Report on the sensitivity of food web responses to nutrient loading coastal systems). In addition, the potential exists for the AUV to be  used as a tool for large scale monitoring and assessment efforts in a range of habitats in support of the Coastal Assessment (Goal 8) and Aquatic Stressors (Goal 2) research efforts. Furthermore, we can conceive potential uses of the AUV at Gulf Ecology Division (GED), Mid-Continent Ecology  Division (MED), Western Ecology Division (WED) and by EPA regions and partners.   General Specifications: o	The AUV must be easily lifted by two people, deployable from a small-craft or from shore, and therefore must be small and light (see specific specifications list). o	The AUV must be modular  in design allowing simple assembly and disassembly and be comprised mainly of commercial off-the-shelf components. o	All of the source code for the AUV's instrumentation control and navigation software, and detailed schematics of all electronic circuits must be provided to enable field  troubleshooting.  A troubleshooting guide is also required. o	The modular hull sections must be lightweight and constructed of materials immune or highly resistant to corrosion.  All pressure containers must be sealed with o-rings. o	The AUV must be fully operational in water temperatures ranging  from -1.6?C to 35?C and remain unharmed for storage, and operational for testing in air temperatures ranging from -10?C to 45?C.   o	A connection to the central processing computer must be externally available through an underwater connector. o	A graphical user interface (GUI) must be provided for  planning of safe mission waypoints and to monitor the mission progress.  The navigation planning and monitoring must be facilitated with electronic charting software that allows input and explicitly accounts for magnetic variation. o	The AUV must be capable of remotely accepting mission plans and  updates from a computer.  The AUV must be capable of telemetering positional information and scientific data, to the remote computer. o	The AUV should have a secondary transponder (i.e., pinger locator device) in case of loss of AUV.		 o	The AUV operations must be independent of acoustic  positioning systems.	 o	When the AUV is transiting underwater between waypoints, navigation is to be performed using dead-reckoning algorithms or preferably via an inertial navigation system.  Dead reckoning is to be performed using algorithms that compensate for currents and account for  intermittent GPS updates. o	While the AUV is at the surface, a geographic position is to be measurable using WAAS-enabled or differential GPS. o	The AUV package must include rugged shipping containers for all components. o	The AUV package must include a corrosion-resistant equipment stand that  supports the AUV during setup, maintenance, and troubleshooting activities, and for secure storage on the deck of a ship. o	The AUV package must include an expendable items spares kit for field repairs (connectors, o-rings, wiring harnesses, replacement fins or shrouds if easily damaged during  deployment and recovery operations, etc.), and include a complete parts list of all commercial off-the shelf and custom AUV components.  A list of part numbers and pricing must be included for all custom AUV components. o	AUV demonstrations by the Contractor must be organized and conducted by the  Contractor in coordination with the government representatives.  For these demonstrations, only the costs associated with the government representatives' meals, incidental expenses, lodging, and the transportation will be incurred by the government.  All other costs of the demonstrations are to be  incurred by the Contractor.   o	Post-award AUV on-site services shall include training on all AUV hardware and software systems. o	The operational performance and specification compliance of the candidate AUV must be fully demonstrated to U.S. EPA's AED scientists prior to acceptance of the AUV and  associated payment in-full. o	Software must meet the requirements of Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act.

<DESC>THIS ANOUNCEMENT IS DELETED IN ITS ENTIRETY AND WILL BE REENTER AT A LATER DATE.


THIS NOTICE IS FOR INFORMATION ONLY – The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) intends to negotiate on a SOLE SOURCE basis with the National Center for Rural Health Works (NCRHWks) at Oklahoma State University, Department of Agricultural Economics, 508 Ag Hall, Stillwater, OK  74078, to continue development of a national information center (Rural Health Works) that will provide analysis, technical assistance, and information to policymakers, researchers, State Offices of Rural Health, Cooperative Extension Service and rural communities on the importance of health care services to the local economy.  

The focus of this project has been to (1) train State-level officials in how to measure the economic impact of health care services (IMPLAN), (2) conduct analysis of the economic impact that selected health policies have on the local economy, (3) conduct a full community engagement/planning process and (4) help providers identify new service opportunities that was developed by the Oklahoma State University.  Most States have participated in these training workshops. The Government intends on using the lessons learned from this successful project on a national basis. 

The program originated through the Extension Program at Oklahoma State University (OSU) and has also been maintained and further developed through the Extension Program at OSU.  OSU has provided the NCRHWks activities and products to Oklahoma rural communities for the past 25-30 years and continues to provide them each year.  The OK program was the original basis of the NCRHWks program; it was modeled and the templates and sample technical reports were developed by OSU at their own expense and became the pilot of the NCRHWks original initiative in 1998.  OSU has continued to develop and provide additional products, as well as providing technical expertise, training, and advice to the other States in their statewide NCRHWks program development.  The OK program through OSU Extension has become the National Center for Rural Health Works.  OSU has the expertise and trained staff to provide the training and technical expertise to other States, and to continue their development of new health impact areas. 

The anticipated period of performance for this project is for one (1) year with 2 twelve month option periods.  The statutory authority is FAR Part 6.302-1(a)(2) and 41 USC 253(c)(1), only one responsible source, no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements without substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.  Oklahoma State University developed the models and the database that RHW uses.   Any other organization would have to duplicate the database that has been developed by Oklahoma State University at their expense.  A Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition has been prepared by the Government.  Any interested party may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement by submitting a capability statement in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to perform the services without incurring substantial cost duplication.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  A draft Statement of Work is attached for informational purposes only.  A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.   The NAICS Code is 541990.   See Numbered Note 22.

<DESC>This Request for Information (RFI) is issued by the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) Nationwide Automatic Identification System (NAIS) Project Office (G-AIS). This RFI is for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a Request for Proposal (RFP) or as an obligation on the part of the USCG to acquire any products or services.  The USCG does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or otherwise pay for the information requested.  Submission of a response to this RFI is entirely voluntary.  The voluntary submission of a response to this RFI shall not obligate the USCG to pay or entitle the submitter of information to claim any direct or indirect costs or charges or any other remuneration whatsoever.  In compliance with the Maritime Transportation Security Act (MTSA) 2002, emerging maritime security requirements, and the need to improve vessel traffic services (VTS) and navigational safety, the USCG is developing an NAIS that will support Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) over the Nation’s navigable waters and adjacent sea areas.  MDA is the effective understanding of anything associated with the global maritime environment that could affect the security, safety, economy, or environment of the United States.  AIS is an international protocol which adheres to the International Telecommunications Union Sector for Radiocommunications (ITU-R) Recommendation M.1371-1 standard for ship-to-ship, ship-to-shore, and shore-to-ship communication of information, including vessel identity, position, speed, course, destination and other data of critical interest for navigation safety and maritime security.  AIS equipment is required domestically and internationally aboard many commercial vessels.  The information provided by NAIS will support most of the nation’s maritime interests, including the safety of vessels and waterways through collision avoidance and traffic management, safeguarding the nation through detection, identification, and classification of vessels from within national waters to thousands of miles offshore.  NAIS will complement other surveillance and intelligence systems that aid the essential process of identifying vessels requiring further investigation and action.  NAIS information will be displayed in command and control (C2) systems that receive USCG national maritime Common Operational Picture (COP) feeds, along with data and intelligence correlated as appropriate, with data from other Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and federal agency sources.  NAIS information will also be available to federal, state, and local port partners in support of security and safety operations.   NAIS will consist of an integrated system of AIS equipment (e.g., receivers, transmitters, antennas, etc.), data storage, processing, and networking infrastructure.  The intention of the NAIS Project is to use existing infrastructure and interoperate with other systems, federal agencies, and entities, as much as possible.  External systems will be included in the context of NAIS services, e.g., command and control (C2) systems, law enforcement databases, vessel traffic services (VTS), and notice of arrival databases, for the purpose of sharing infrastructure, quickly implementing capabilities, and improving performance.  NAIS has the capability of sending and receiving AIS messages, via a Very High Frequency (VHF) Data Link (VDL), to and from AIS equipped vessels, Aids to Navigation (ATON), and Search and Rescue (SAR) aircraft.  NAIS may leverage several types of platforms to support AIS receive and transmit infrastructure (e.g., towers) or receive-only infrastructure (e.g., aircraft).  AIS message data shall be transported over a wide area network (WAN) utilizing diverse, remote site connectivity (e.g., leased T-1 circuits, microwave, fiber optics).  NAIS shall process (e.g., validate, filter) and store AIS-provided vessel track and static data.  External systems shall be enhanced to provide data processing functions (e.g., vessel tracking correlation, intelligence processing, and anomaly detection), user interfaces, and indirect access for some NAIS users (e.g., USCG Deepwater assets, public and port partners).  All solutions shall be certified and accredited for compliance with all U.S. Federal, DHS, and USCG information assurance policies.  Preliminary high-level functional requirements are outlined as follows.  RECEIVE/TRANSMIT:  NAIS shall provide the capability to receive and transmit AIS messages via the VDL to and from all AIS equipped vessels within ports, navigable waters, and coastal areas out to 24 nm.  The system shall also be able to receive some AIS messages out to 2000 nm of the baseline from which U.S. territorial waters are measured.  Receive and transmit capabilities shall operate on all AIS channels as defined in ITU-R M.1371-1.  The AIS network shall consist of AIS reception and transmission sites; these sites may be completely separate or combined.  Monitoring and management of message traffic, frequency usage and interference throughout the area of required coverage shall be provided.  Methods of detecting and locating an interferer with AIS messaging and frequencies; and mitigating spoofing and jamming will be incorporated.   NETWORK:  The network shall route and transport data between AIS base stations, user interfaces, data processing capabilities, and external users.  A plan for Spectrum authorization/management shall be provided (See NTIA Manual of Regulations and Procedures for Federal Radio Frequency Management). INTEROPERABILITY: NAIS shall leverage USCG enterprise architecture components to provide interoperability among USCG and external entities’ networks, databases, and systems.  Users may access AIS-related capabilities via external systems.  DATA PROCESSING:  NAIS shall store, retrieve, archive, and recover vessel data received, created, modified, and transmitted.  NAIS may leverage an existing data warehouse.  NAIS shall automatically verify and validate AIS data (e.g., position reports) through comparison with other AIS received information (e.g. time difference of arrival) and with other available independent sensors and data sources.  USER INTERFACES:  NAIS shall provide user interfaces (to the extent possible incorporated with or as modules of existing and planned command and control, analysis and information retrieval systems) for data analysis, system administration, and AIS message management.  The data analysis user interface shall include a means for users to query historical data via the archive.  Existing systems shall support vessel identification & tracking, vessel inspection & target selection, vessel traffic management, vessel movement analysis, maritime incident investigations, ATON and SAR.  ADMINISTRATION: NAIS shall provide network administration, system diagnostics, and physical status monitoring and alarm capabilities.  Each installation shall monitor its own performance and condition.  System monitoring capabilities shall not interfere with or degrade normal system functions.  NAIS may leverage existing administration capabilities and facilities (e.g., network operations center).  Software and network administration shall include the capability to monitor the health of the centralized software and network that is receiving and processing the data transmitted from remote sites/platforms as well as the capability to monitor system security in order to preserve the integrity of the AIS data received (current and historical). The USCG invites industry to respond with information regarding existing and planned capabilities for technical solutions, components, and implementation strategies similar to requirements being considered and described in this RFI.  The USCG is also interested in the technical feasibility and state of the market for achieving such requirements. The Government requests that no proprietary or confidential business data be submitted in response to this RFI. Due to a variety of limitations, the USCG does not plan to entertain questions related to the substance of this RFI. Industry days, pre-solicitation, and/or pre-proposal conferences may be held, pending the level of interest. Industry is advised that Government support contractors will review non-proprietary information.  Responses to this RFI can be submitted no later than July 28, 2005 to Ms. Eleni Jernell (G-ACS-5D) via email at ejernell@comdt.uscg.mil or via mail at U.S. Coast Guard, 1900 Half Street SW, Washington, D.C., 20024, Attn: Ms. Eleni Jernell (G-ACS-5D).  Questions related solely to the transmittal of a response should be directed to Ms. Jernell at (202) 475-3298 or Tom Brust, Phone (202) 475-3192, Fax (202) 475-3905, Email tbrust@comdt.uscg.mil.  Responses received after July 28, 2005 may not be reviewed. Responses should include the name and telephone number of a point of contact having authority and knowledge to discuss responses with Government representatives.

<DESC>This Request for Information (RFI) is issued by the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) Nationwide Automatic Identification System (NAIS) Project Office (G-AIS). This RFI is for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a Request for Proposal (RFP) or as an obligation on the part of the USCG to acquire any products or services.  The USCG does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or otherwise pay for the information requested.  Submission of a response to this RFI is entirely voluntary.  The voluntary submission of a response to this RFI shall not obligate the USCG to pay or entitle the submitter of information to claim any direct or indirect costs or charges or any other remuneration whatsoever.  In compliance with the Maritime Transportation Security Act (MTSA) 2002, emerging maritime security requirements, and the need to improve vessel traffic services (VTS) and navigational safety, the USCG is developing an NAIS that will support Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) over the Nation’s navigable waters and adjacent sea areas.  MDA is the effective understanding of anything associated with the global maritime environment that could affect the security, safety, economy, or environment of the United States.  AIS is an international protocol which adheres to the International Telecommunications Union Sector for Radiocommunications (ITU-R) Recommendation M.1371-1 standard for ship-to-ship, ship-to-shore, and shore-to-ship communication of information, including vessel identity, position, speed, course, destination and other data of critical interest for navigation safety and maritime security.  AIS equipment is required domestically and internationally aboard many commercial vessels.  The information provided by NAIS will support most of the nation’s maritime interests, including the safety of vessels and waterways through collision avoidance and traffic management, safeguarding the nation through detection, identification, and classification of vessels from within national waters to thousands of miles offshore.  NAIS will complement other surveillance and intelligence systems that aid the essential process of identifying vessels requiring further investigation and action.  NAIS information will be displayed in command and control (C2) systems that receive USCG national maritime Common Operational Picture (COP) feeds, along with data and intelligence correlated as appropriate, with data from other Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and federal agency sources.  NAIS information will also be available to federal, state, and local port partners in support of security and safety operations.   NAIS will consist of an integrated system of AIS equipment (e.g., receivers, transmitters, antennas, etc.), data storage, processing, and networking infrastructure.  The intention of the NAIS Project is to use existing infrastructure and interoperate with other systems, federal agencies, and entities, as much as possible.  External systems will be included in the context of NAIS services, e.g., command and control (C2) systems, law enforcement databases, vessel traffic services (VTS), and notice of arrival databases, for the purpose of sharing infrastructure, quickly implementing capabilities, and improving performance.  NAIS has the capability of sending and receiving AIS messages, via a Very High Frequency (VHF) Data Link (VDL), to and from AIS equipped vessels, Aids to Navigation (ATON), and Search and Rescue (SAR) aircraft.  NAIS may leverage several types of platforms to support AIS receive and transmit infrastructure (e.g., towers) or receive-only infrastructure (e.g., aircraft).  AIS message data shall be transported over a wide area network (WAN) utilizing diverse, remote site connectivity (e.g., leased T-1 circuits, microwave, fiber optics).  NAIS shall process (e.g., validate, filter) and store AIS-provided vessel track and static data.  External systems shall be enhanced to provide data processing functions (e.g., vessel tracking correlation, intelligence processing, and anomaly detection), user interfaces, and indirect access for some NAIS users (e.g., USCG Deepwater assets, public and port partners).  All solutions shall be certified and accredited for compliance with all U.S. Federal, DHS, and USCG information assurance policies.  Preliminary high-level functional requirements are outlined as follows.  RECEIVE/TRANSMIT:  NAIS shall provide the capability to receive and transmit AIS messages via the VDL to and from all AIS equipped vessels within ports, navigable waters, and coastal areas out to 24 nm.  The system shall also be able to receive some AIS messages out to 2000 nm of the baseline from which U.S. territorial waters are measured.  Receive and transmit capabilities shall operate on all AIS channels as defined in ITU-R M.1371-1.  The AIS network shall consist of AIS reception and transmission sites; these sites may be completely separate or combined.  Monitoring and management of message traffic, frequency usage and interference throughout the area of required coverage shall be provided.  Methods of detecting and locating an interferer with AIS messaging and frequencies; and mitigating spoofing and jamming will be incorporated.   NETWORK:  The network shall route and transport data between AIS base stations, user interfaces, data processing capabilities, and external users.  A plan for Spectrum authorization/management shall be provided (See NTIA Manual of Regulations and Procedures for Federal Radio Frequency Management). INTEROPERABILITY: NAIS shall leverage USCG enterprise architecture components to provide interoperability among USCG and external entities’ networks, databases, and systems.  Users may access AIS-related capabilities via external systems.  DATA PROCESSING:  NAIS shall store, retrieve, archive, and recover vessel data received, created, modified, and transmitted.  NAIS may leverage an existing data warehouse.  NAIS shall automatically verify and validate AIS data (e.g., position reports) through comparison with other AIS received information (e.g. time difference of arrival) and with other available independent sensors and data sources.  USER INTERFACES:  NAIS shall provide user interfaces (to the extent possible incorporated with or as modules of existing and planned command and control, analysis and information retrieval systems) for data analysis, system administration, and AIS message management.  The data analysis user interface shall include a means for users to query historical data via the archive.  Existing systems shall support vessel identification & tracking, vessel inspection & target selection, vessel traffic management, vessel movement analysis, maritime incident investigations, ATON and SAR.  ADMINISTRATION: NAIS shall provide network administration, system diagnostics, and physical status monitoring and alarm capabilities.  Each installation shall monitor its own performance and condition.  System monitoring capabilities shall not interfere with or degrade normal system functions.  NAIS may leverage existing administration capabilities and facilities (e.g., network operations center).  Software and network administration shall include the capability to monitor the health of the centralized software and network that is receiving and processing the data transmitted from remote sites/platforms as well as the capability to monitor system security in order to preserve the integrity of the AIS data received (current and historical). The USCG invites industry to respond with information regarding existing and planned capabilities for technical solutions, components, and implementation strategies similar to requirements being considered and described in this RFI.  The USCG is also interested in the technical feasibility and state of the market for achieving such requirements. The Government requests that no proprietary or confidential business data be submitted in response to this RFI. Due to a variety of limitations, the USCG does not plan to entertain questions related to the substance of this RFI. Industry days, pre-solicitation, and/or pre-proposal conferences may be held, pending the level of interest. Industry is advised that Government support contractors will review non-proprietary information.  Responses to this RFI can be submitted no later than July 28, 2005 to Ms. Eleni Jernell (G-ACS-5D) via email at ejernell@comdt.uscg.mil or via mail at U.S. Coast Guard, 1900 Half Street SW, Washington, D.C., 20024, Attn: Ms. Eleni Jernell (G-ACS-5D).

<DESC>This announcement constitutes a Request For Information (RFI) for planning purposes.     This is NOT a Request for Proposal.   NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENTS EXIST AT THIS TIME.  The intent of this  RFI is to assist the Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) in conducting market research of industry to identify innovative approaches to providing a broad based support package that is efficient and embraces continuous process and product improvement to optimize the life cycle support provided to the Navy/Marine Corps forces operating ALQ-99 Tactical Jamming System (TJS), worldwide.  To provide a more cost-effective readiness solution for the entire ALQ-99 TJS, Performance Based Logistics (PBL) support is being considered for the entire inventory and peculiar support/test equipment.  PBL support of the ALQ-99 Pod includes, but not limited to, maintenance planning and analysis, supply support, configuration management, and obsolescence management.  A draft Statement of Work is available on the website located at https://c802tdc4.crane.navy.mil/pod/pod.htm.  To get access to this website, you will need to register at http://www.crane.navy.mil/tdc.  When registering, use Kim Horn as the Government POC and ALQ-99 TJS POD PBL as the justification for access.  
As delineated in Title 10 USC Sec. 2464, ALQ-99 TJS depot maintenance must be performed at a Government owned and operated facility, by Government personnel.     For depot level maintenance, public/private partnership is the required approach to meet Title 10 USC core logistics capability requirements.    
Industry Days will be held at Crane, IN on 13-14 July 2005 from 1000 – 1800.  The purpose of Industry Days is to discuss ALQ-99 TJS product support  by providing an overview, tours, and question and answer session in the form of a public forum.    The point of Contact for visit requests or travel information is Kim Horn, kimberly.horn@navy.mil.  Request interested parties submit  their intent to attend Industry Days and and submit visit request by  11 July 2005.  Questions regarding PBL may be submitted in writing to Dora Hill at dora.hill@navy.mil or Trudy Carroll at trudy.carroll@navy.mil.   Questions submitted prior to 11 July 2005 may be addressed during Industry Days, however, all questions and answers will be posted on the website, https://c802tdc4.crane.navy.mil/pod/pod.htm .  
The AN/ALQ-99 TJS is the first fully integrated, computer controlled, support jamming system. The AN/ALQ-99 intercepts and automatically processes electromagnetic signals and power manages the system's transmitters to effectively jam large numbers of diverse threats with very high effective radiated power. Since its deployment in the early 1970's aboard US Marine Corps and US Navy carrier-based EA-6B Prowler aircraft, this system has undergone multiple upgrades. The EA-6B/ALQ-99 combination has become an indispensable fleet asset, fully integrated into all air wing combat missions.
The ALQ-99 is comprised of an On Board System (OBS) and a Tactical Jamming System (TJS). The OBS includes the receiver, processor, and aircrew interfaces and is used to collect tactical electronic order of battle (EOB) data which can be disseminated through the command and control system while airborne, and which can be recorded and processed after missions to provide updates to various orders of battle. The TJS includes a selection of mission-configured jammer pods carried as external stores. The modular open architecture of the TJS facilitates optimizing transmitters and antennas for a given frequency range, as well as tailored mission configurations. 
	Each jammer pod contains a ram air turbine generator, two selectable transmitter modules with associated antennas, and a universal exciter that is interfaced with and controlled by the onboard system and aircrew. The scope of the PBL includes the 2,500 weapon replaceable assemblies (WRAs) comprising the TJS portion of the ALQ-99 system only. 

DISCLAIMER:  This RFI is issued solely for information and analytical purposes and does not constitute a solicitation.  There is no solicitation in process at this time.

Revamping content of womenbiz.gov web site
Proposed project would focus primarily on increasing the robustness of the content aformentioned web site, utlizing input and beta testing from a select number of women business owners and federal agency women's business advocates in Offices of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization (OSDBU's) who will be identified by the NWBC.  Secondarily, we seek recommendations on reorganizing and reprogramming the web site to take advantage of new web technologies.

STATEMENT OF WORK – 
REVAMPING CONTENT OF WOMENBIZ.GOV WEB SITE 




BACKGROUND

The National Women’s Business Council is a bi-partisan public policy advisory body created to serve as an independent source of advice to the President, Congress, and others on economic issues of importance to women business owners.  The Council is committed to:
•	Conducting research on issues of importance to women business owners and their organizations; 
•	Communicating these findings widely; 
•	Connecting the women’s business community to public policy makers; and 
•	Providing a platform for change to expand and improve opportunities for women business owners and their enterprises.

Several years ago, in response to demand from the women’s business community for information and guidance on how to access federal government procurement markets, the National Women’s Business Council launched the web site www.womenbiz.gov. The side contains information on the steps required to enter into the federal procurement arena, including links to government agency web sites and information on procurement fairs and matchmaking events.

However, in the years since the launch of that site, there have been advances in Internet/web site technology and more information and links in the federal procurement system. This proposed project would focus primarily on increasing the robustness of the content and included linkages of the aforementioned web site, utilizing input and beta testing from a select number of women business owners and federal agency women’s business advocates in Offices of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization (OSDBUs), who will be identified by the NWBC. Secondarily, we seek recommendations on reorganizing and reprogramming the web site to take advantage of new web technologies. (This should be listed separately in the cost proposal.)

STATEMENT OF WORK

Task Number One:	Review womenbiz.gov web site and make preliminary recommendations on revamping, increasing content and connectivity of web site. If option to restructure web site is approved by NWBC, provide preliminary recommendations on restructuring of web site pages.

Task Number Two:	In consultation with NWBC staff, assemble two small (6-8 each) groups to act as virtual focus groups or beta testers: 1) women business owners who are active or interested in the federal marketplace; and 2) staff of federal OSDBU offices who are charged with working to increase their agency’s spending with women-owned small businesses. They will be asked to review the existing site, provide recommendations, and review and perhaps beta test the proposed changes.
Task Number Three:	After review of proposed changes, provide NWBC with a page by page
update of the content of the womenbiz.gov web site, in a mutually agreed-upon format. 

Task Number Four:	If web site structural changes are agreed to, provide the new or altered pages in a mutually-agreed upon format, working with SBA web master staff to beta test the structural changes. 

Task Number Five:	Provide final archived copies of all text and/or code, both electronically for easy integration to the existing site and on CD for archival purposes.. 


PROGRESS REPORTS

The contractor shall be required to provide regular reports detailing the progress made on the project and identifying and addressing problems encountered. This progress report shall be delivered to the Contracting Officer’s Technical Representative (“COTR”). Progress payments will be made upon receipt of these regular reports, up to 80% of the contract value. Upon successful completion of the project and provision of all deliverable products for the project, the final payment of 20% of the contract value will be approved and made.

<DESC>Due to system constraints we are unable to modify synopsis issued on 16 Jun 05 under RFP SP0600-05-R-0318 to correct the classification code from 91 to J.

The Government intends to execute an unrestricted procurement for services to include hydrostatic testing, refurbishment, conversion (Helium), and installation of pressure gauges on Government-owned trailers that are either currently in or will be used after conversion, for the delivery of bulk helium.

Subject solicitation will be issued on or about 17 Jun 05 and posted to the FedBizOpps web page (http://www.fedbizopps.gov/).  Award of one or more Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contract(s) with a minimum quantity of 3 trailers and a maximum quantity of 39 trailers, is anticipated to be awarded on or about 30 Jun 05 as the procurement is being conducted under the Unusual and Compelling Urgency authority of FAR 6.302-2.

<CONTACT>LISA HAYES PURCHASING AGENT 3034452606     lhayes@do.usbr.gov;
<DESC>The Bureau of Reclamation has a requirement for Environmental Consulting services to conduct a specialized technical review of soils exposed in trenches across the Busted Boiler fault for Ridgeway Dam.  The review will consist of two parts: a field review and preparation of a letter report on the field descriptions and geologic interpretation of the soil profiles, especially the estimated ages and timing constraints indicated by soil profile development. Firms that are interested in this procurement must have knowledge of the following areas and must submit their qualifications by e-mail.  (1) Studied soils on Quaternary deposits similar to those exposed in the trenches along the Busted Boiler fault. (2) Experience interpreting geologic deposits associated with potential tectonic faults that were studied as part of seismic and geologic hazard assessments. (3) A detailed knowledge of the properties and development rates of soils on geologic deposits and in geomorphic settings similar to those near the Busted Boiler fault. (4) Experienced in the problems associated with interpreting ages from soil development, especially those associated with soils on loess, alluvium, and bedrock in southwestern Colorado. Firms that believe they can provide the required services described above are encouraged to identify themselves and give written notification to the Contracting Officer.  Those firms believing they can provide similar service must provide supporting evidence that they can furnish the services identified above in sufficient detail to demonstrate the respondent's ability to meet the stated requirements. The Government will consider all responses received within 3 days of the date of publication of this notice.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Inquiries will only be accepted by e-mail at lhayes@do.usbr.gov.  Responses should include the firm's Dun and Bradstreet number (DUNS) and Tax Identification Number (TIN).

<DESC>NIST seeks information on commercially available Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectrometers that have a custom optical interface.  

NIST may procure such spectrometers after results of this market research are obtained and analyzed and specifications are developed after a determination is made regarding which FTIR spectrometers can meet NIST's minimum requirements.  Such spectrometers are intended to become an integral part of a planned Automated High Throughput Measurement system.  The system will consist of an articulated robot and multiple analytical instruments.  The initial instrument configuration will consist of (4) Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometers, (2) UV-Vis Spectrometers, and (1) NIST developed Glossmeter.  Since the system is expandable, additional instruments can be added at a later date.  The articulated robot is the “controller” that determines which instrument a sample is analyzed by and in what order.  Its purpose is identify the sample, retrieve it from a sample rack, insert it into the proper instrument and then retrieve it when the analysis is finished.  The limiting step in this measurement system is the collection of FTIR spectra.  The addition of four FTIR spectrometers will allow the system to decrease the measurement time for a set of samples. 

Companies that manufacture or sell commercially available FTIR spectrometers are requested to email detailed specifications for such commercially available system(s) to joseph.widdup@nist.gov no later than the response date for this sources sought notice.  Specifications shall include detailed funcational and performance capabilities for the spectrometer itself (including the interferometer, the beamsplitter, the source, the detector, the optics, the case, and the electronics), the custom optical interface, and the software.

Also, the following information is requested to be provided as part of the response to this sources sought notice:

1.  Name of the company that manufactures the spectrometer(s) for which specifications are provided.

2.  Name of company(ies) that are authorized to sell the spectrometer, their addresses, and a point of contact for the company (name, phone number, fax number and email address).

3.  Indication of number of days, after receipt of order, that is typical for delivery of such systems.

4.  Indication of whether each instrument for which specifications are sent to joseph.widdup@nist.gov are currently on one or more GSA Federal Supply Schedule contracts and, if so, the GSA FSS contract number(s).

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6 as supplemented with additional information contained in this notice.  This procurement is being conducted under Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13.  This solicitation document incorporates provisions and clauses that are in effect through the July 2005 Federal Acquisition Regulation revision, which includes the consolidation of all Federal Acquisition Circulars through 2005-04.  This acquisition is NOT small business set-aside and the NAICS code is 926150.  This announcement constitutes the formal Request for Quotation (RFQ) and a written solicitation WILL NOT be issued.  It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine (NLM) to procure authoritative herbal and dietary supplement information for inclusion in the MedlinePlus and MedlinePlus en español websites on a sole source basis from Natural Standard, Cambridge, Massachusetts.  MedlinePlus is NLM’s web-based consumer information resource that includes health topic pages, drug information and other links to Internet resources of interest to the consumer.  Currently, MedlinePlus  receives over 60 million page hits per month.  The inclusion of authoritative herbal and dietary supplement information is an important new feature for health consumers.  Natural Standard offers equivalent content in both English and Spanish.  The “bottom line” monographs are written at a consumer reading level.  Natural Standard includes individual authorship statements, provides graded scales of effectiveness for any remedies, is based on peer-reviewed evidence, and contains references to the evidence.  Illustrations accompany the monographs.  The provider offers a choice of delivery methods including XML, NLM’s preferred delivery method.  No other sources or combination of sources provides the features that Natural Standard offers.  Further awards to any other sources would result in  both substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition and unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements.  The period of performance is anticipated for a period of twelve (12) months with options for four (4) successive one-year periods.  The proposed acquisition will be procured under FAR Part 12 - Acquisition of Commercial Items.  This is not a Request for Quotation (RFQ), nor is an RFQ available, however, all responsive sources may submit a proposal in a timely manner which will be considered by NLM.  Firms interested in responding to the notice must be able to provide the services as specified above.  Responses must be in writing and must be received in the office within fifteen (15) calendar days from the publication date of this notice.  Proposal must include pricing information.  Inquires regarding this procurement may be made to the National Library of Medicine, Office of Acquisitions Management, 8600 Rockville Pike, Building 38A, Room B1N20, Bethesda, Maryland 20894, Attention: Uyen H. Phuong, Lead Purchasing Agent, on (301) 496-6127.  Fax requests WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION:
The contractor shall provide an epifluorescence microscope in combination with a digital camera to meet photo microscopic needs.  The contractor shall provide the epifluorescence microscope in combination with a digital camera per the minimum requirements shown herein.

This microscope with digital camera will be utilized by the National Ocean Service to meet the photo microscopic needs of the Marine Biotoxins Program.  At a minimum:

Requirements:

•	The system must be fitted with the following objective lenses: PLAN FLOUR 20X, PHI, NA> 0.5, WD < 2 mm; PLAN FLOUR 40X, PH2, NA > 0.75, WD < 0.51mm; PLAN APO 40X, NA > 0.90, WD < 0.20 mm; PLAN APO 60X OIL, NA = 1.42, WD < 0.15mm; PLAN APO 100X OIL, NA > 1.35, WD < 0.12mm.
•	The system must include an oil top condenser lens with NA = 1.4.
•	Optics must include brightfield, phase contract and differential interference contrast (for the three PLAN APO lenses) capabilities.
•	Six position fluorescence filter cube. Microscope is required to have a filter turret capable of simultaneously holding 6 fluorescence filter cubes, offering room for expansion.
•	The system must be fitted with the following epi-flourescence filters (by Chroma catalogue number): 31001 (FITC); 41012 (FITC LP emission); 31000 (DAPI); 41007 (Cy3); 6100V2 (DAPI/FITC/TRITC).
•	The system must be equipped with a 12 bit digital camera with > 12.5 mega pixel resolution capable of producing 36 bit RBG color depth; camera is supplied with dedicated software, including a time-lapse function that allows a series of images to be acquired in a sequence or in an AVI format and played back immediately.
•	Sliding prism camera port for the attachment of the camera system with three light settings: 100% eyepieces, 100% camera, and 20% eyepieces/80% camera.  The 20%/80% eliminates the need to switch back and forth between eyepiece viewing and the digital camera while the 100% settings allow for maximum light transmission to the eyes or digital camera.
•	 Built in aperture diaphragm and field stop on the fluorescence illuminator.  Adjustment of the aperture diaphragm can reduce stray light scattering and improve image contrast.  Adjustment of the field stop limits the area of the sample that is illuminated, thereby reducing collateral photo-bleaching.
•	Installation and customer training by factory authorized and trained representative.
•	Five year parts and labor warranty; 1 year warranty on electrical components.

NOTE:  THE ABOVE ARE MIMUMUM REQUIREMENTS.

The Contractor shall travel to the host country to meet with relevant project officials and with the U.S. Embassy.    The Contractor shall contact the Commercial Section at the U.S. Embassy upon arrival and prior to departure for briefing and debriefing meetings.   While the Embassy may be able to assist the Contractor in arranging some initial meetings with host country officials, the Contractor is responsible for arranging the meetings as well as logistics for the visit, i.e., hotel accommodations, transportation, and interpretation services. In some cases, the Contractor may need to Contract with a local entity to assist with these logistics.  Local entities may not provide the technical work of substance for the creation of the DM report. 

2.5		CONTRACTOR MEANINGFUL DISCUSSIONS

The Contractor shall hold meaningful discussions with appropriate contacts to determine and gauge the interest of potential project financiers and potential U.S. suppliers and assess whether the proposed project(s) is economically, financially, and technically viable.  The Contractor shall analyze the potential procurement of U.S. goods and services for project implementation by categories and dollar values.  The analysis shall include an assessment of the project risks and its financial viability, the priority of the project and political/social/organizational support it has, potential sources of financing, and the capability and experience of the project sponsor.  The analysis shall also include an assessment of the social and economic development impacts of the proposed project.

2.6		USTDA REPORT OBJECTIVES

If the Contractor recommends that USTDA fund the study(ies) in a phased approach, and/or if any outstanding issues should be resolved or conditions met before funding is approved, those phases, issues and/or conditions should be clearly explained in the recommendation.

2.6.1		The Contractor shall provide a final report to the USTDA, which will: 

2.6.1.1		assess and justify whether or not USTDA should provide funding for a study of the proposed project(s); 

2.6.1.2		 assess any alternative or other activities which the Contractor sees as viable options for USTDA consideration; and 

2.6.1.3	          provide recommendations on the above information in a final report that analyzes all relevant issues

2.6.2		Contractor recommendations shall be based upon USTDA funding criteria, which are that the project must: 

2.6.2.1 	be likely to receive implementation financing, and in addition, have a procurement process that provides “equal access” to U.S. firms;

2.6.2.2		represent an opportunity for sales of U.S. goods and services that is many times greater than the initial investment of USTDA assistance;

2.6.2.3		be a development priority of the project sponsor and country where the project is located and have the endorsement of the U.S. Embassy in that nation; and

2.6.2.4		involve U.S. companies that are facing market entry problems and/or strong competition from foreign companies, which often receive subsidies, and other support from their governments.

6 		PROJECT DESCRIPTIONS AND PROFILE

The purpose of the definitional mission (DM) is to evaluate two potential USTDA projects in the financial services sector in Mexico.  The first is a financial education project that will target the “unbanked” segment of the population that has not accessed formal banking services, with a special focus on the recipients of remittances.  The second is a request from Financiera Rural, a Mexican Development Agency, for technical assistance to expand and improve the quality of its rural financial institutions training programs.  The purpose of the definitional mission is to obtain additional information and evaluate prospective funding activities for each of the projects.  The DM consultant will also survey U.S. and other countries’ experiences with similar programs to identify relevant examples and successful strategies.


Financial Education Project

Remittances, for this purpose, are the portion of immigrant workers’ earnings remitted to family members in their respective countries of origin.  In 2005, remittances from the United States to Mexico are expected to reach $20 billion.  This total exceeds all foreign direct investment and development assistance to Mexico combined, and is second only to oil exports in terms of sources of national income.  Although remittances could significantly impact economic development, limited financial education by recipients, primarily in rural areas, has impeded the potential for leveraging the development impact of remittances.  

Currently, less than 30% of the population is estimated to have access to banking accounts or other basic financial services.  During recent bilateral meetings, the Secretaria de Hacienda, Mexico’s Ministry of Finance, highlighted the need for financial education in Mexico.  By providing individuals with information about credit and banking services, financial education (also referred to as financial literacy) programs can help build financial knowledge and use banking services effectively. The scale and scope of remittances can be a powerful tool to open up financial systems.  Through the proposed financial education project, millions of people can be brought into the financial system and remittances can be leveraged by linking flows to local finance institutions, home mortgages, and the securitization of bonds for on-lending to small businesses. The financial education project will help maximize the development impact of remittances by helping the Mexican population take advantage of the financial system and increase domestic savings. 

The DM consultants will work with Hacienda to determine the appropriate grantee for the financial education project and to identify the Mexican institutions that would participate in the “train the trainers” program.  It is expected that the scope of the technical assistance will include the development of educational materials and training targeted to recipients of remittances and other segments of the population that do not have savings accounts or utilize other financial services. It is anticipated that the technical assistance will also involve an examination of other countries’ experiences with financial education and draw on “lessons learned” that may be relevant to Mexico. For example, in the United States, the Treasury Department chairs a Financial Literacy and Education Commission that is developing a national strategy for financial education.  Another potentially relevant example is the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation’s (FDIC) “Money Smart” training program, which consists of 10 training modules designed to help adults outside the financial mainstream learn how to take advantage of banking and credit services.  The Money Smart “train the trainer” program uses banks, community organizations, and other entities to build program delivery capacity.

Financiera Rural Training Program

Financiera Rural (FR) is an arm of the Mexican Government that was created in 2002 to foster the development of Mexico’s rural areas through credit and technical assistance for rural producers and rural financial institutions.  The technical assistance is granted through FR’s “Formation, Training, and Advisory Services Program for Rural Producers and Rural Financial Institutions,” which was designed to enhance credit and contribute to the development of a rural financial system in Mexico.  The topics covered by the program include business plan development, systems and technological infrastructure, and tailor-made seminars.  FR administers training by engaging roughly 2,000 independent professional trainers that are approved by FR.

The depth of knowledge of the existing trainers is insufficient to meet the demand of the rural sector and their number has also proven to be inadequate.  FR is requesting USTDA support to train new and re-train existing trainers and establish a formal “certification” process for trainers in order to improve the overall quality of FR’s program to an international best practices level.  In addition, USTDA’s technical assistance would train evaluators to assess the success of FR’s program.  The expansion and improvement of its services is of priority to FR.

The DM consultants will be expected to work with FR to develop the appropriate terms of reference for the technical assistance/training requested by FR.



 
Annex I

IMPACT ON U.S. LABOR STATEMENT

The Foreign Operations, Export Financing and Related Programs Appropriations legislation restricts U.S. foreign assistance from being used to provide: (a) any financial incentive to a business enterprise currently located in the United States for the purpose of inducing such an enterprise to relocate outside the United States if such incentive or inducement is likely to reduce the number of employees of such business enterprise in the United States because United States production is being replaced by such enterprise outside the United States; (b) assistance for any project or activity that contributes to the violation of internationally recognized workers rights; and (c) direct assistance for establishing or expanding production of any commodity for export by any country other than the United States, if the commodity is likely to be in surplus on world markets at the time the resulting productive capacity is expected to become operative and if the assistance will cause substantial injury to United States producers of the same, similar, or competing commodity. 

 
Annex II

USTDA Nationality Requirements

The purpose of USTDA's nationality, source, and origin requirements is to assure the maximum practicable participation of American contractors, technology, equipment and materials in the pre-feasibility, feasibility, and implementation stages of a project.


USTDA STANDARD RULE (GRANT AGREEMENT STANDARD LANGUAGE):

Except as USTDA may otherwise agree, the following provisions shall govern the delivery of goods and services funded by USTDA under this Grant Agreement: (a) for professional services, the Contractor must be either a U.S. firm or U.S. consultant; (b) the Contractor may use U.S. subcontractors without limitation, but the use of subcontractors from host country may not exceed twenty percent (20%) of the USTDA Grant amount and may only be used for specific services from the Terms of Reference identified in the subcontract; (c) employees of U.S. Contractor or U.S. subcontractor firms responsible for professional services shall be U.S. citizens or non-U.S. citizens lawfully admitted for permanent residence in the U.S.; (d) goods purchased for implementation of the Study and associated delivery services (e.g., international transportation and insurance) must have their nationality, source and origin in the United States; and (e) goods and services incidental to Study support (e.g., lodging, food, and transportation) in host country are not subject to the above restrictions. USTDA will make available further details concerning these standards of eligibility upon request.

NATIONALITY:
1.	Rule

Except as USTDA may otherwise agree, the Contractor for USTDA funded activities must be either a U.S. firm or a U.S. consultant. Prime contractors may utilize U.S. subcontractors, but the use of host country subcontractors is limited to 20% of the USTDA grant amount.
2.	Application

Accordingly, only a U.S. firm or U.S. consultant may submit proposals on USTDA-funded activities. Although those proposals may include subcontracting arrangements with host country firms or individuals for up to 20% of the USTDA grant amount, they may not include subcontracts with third country entities. U.S. firms submitting proposals must ensure that the professional services funded by the USTDA grant, to the extent not subcontracted to host country entities, are supplied by employees of the firm or employees of U.S. subcontractor firms who are U.S. individuals. 

Interested U.S. firms and consultants who submit proposals must meet USTDA nationality requirements as of the due date for the submission of proposals and, if selected, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity. These nationality provisions apply to whatever portion of the Terms of Reference is funded with the USTDA grant. 
3.	Definitions

A "U.S. individual" is (a) a U.S. citizen, or (b) a non-U.S. citizen lawfully admitted for permanent residence in the U.S. (a green card holder).

A "U.S. consultant" is (a) a U.S. citizen whose principal place of business is in the United States, or (b) a non-U.S. citizen lawfully admitted for permanent residence in the U.S. (a green card holder) whose principal place of business is in the U.S.

A "U.S. firm" is a privately owned firm which is incorporated in the U.S., with its principal place of business in the U.S., and which is either (a) more than 50% owned by U.S. individuals, or (b) has been incorporated in the U.S. for more than three (3) years prior to the issuance date of the request for proposals; has performed similar services in the U.S. for that three (3) year period; employs U.S. citizens in more than half of its permanent full-time positions in the U.S.; and has the existing capability in the U.S. to perform the work in question. 

A partnership, organized in the U.S. with its principal place of business in the U.S., may also qualify as a "U.S. firm" as would a joint venture organized or incorporated in the United States consisting entirely of U.S. firms and/or U.S. individuals.

A nonprofit organization, such as an educational institution, foundation, or association may also qualify as a "U.S. firm" if it is incorporated in the United States and managed by a governing body, a majority of whose members are U.S. individuals.
SOURCE AND ORIGIN:
1.	Rule

In addition to the nationality requirement stated above, any goods (e.g., equipment and materials) and services related to their shipment (e.g., international transportation and insurance) funded under the USA Grant Agreement must have their source and origin in the United States, unless USTDA otherwise agrees. However, necessary purchases of goods and project support services which, are unavailable from a U.S. source (e.g., local food, housing and transportation) are eligible without specific USTDA approval.
2.	Application

Accordingly, the prime contractor must be able to demonstrate that all goods and services purchased in the host country to carry out the Terms of Reference for a USTDA Grant Agreement that were not of U.S. source and origin were unavailable in the United States. 
3.	Definitions

"Source" means the country from which shipment is made.

"Origin" means the place of production, through manufacturing, assembly or otherwise.
Questions regarding these nationality, source and origin requirements may be addressed to the USTDA Office of General Counsel by calling (703) 875-4357.
