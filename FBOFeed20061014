<CONTACT>Don Clifton Purchasing Agent 7037871061     donald.clifton@mms.gov;
<DESC>The U.S. Department of the Interior, National Business Center/GovWorks, on behalf of Marine Barracks Washington,  intends to negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 using Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) to acquire Scarlet Red Dress Coats.  The most prevalent factor supporting the sole source is the unique color pallet to match the existing dress coats in use by the Marine Drum & Bugle Corps.  The Government believes that the only responsible source capable of satisfying the agency requirement is Aura-Shield, Midlothian, Va 23113.   A justification for other than full and open competition has been prepared in support of this acquisition.   No Request for Quotation (RFQ) will be issued and no response will be made to letters or telephone requests for a copy of the solicitation. This is not a request for competitive quotes, but serves as a procurement notice to fulfill public posting requirements in accordance with FAR 5.101(a)(1).     This requirement is unrestricted and the NAICS code 315222 and PSC code 8415 apply. Responsible firms believing they can provide the required items are encouraged to identify themselves and give written notification to the Contracting Officer referencing action item #AN66215.    All responses will be fully considered. If no affirmative responses are received by 3:00p.m. EST October 23, 2006 to the effect that a comparable source exists, an order will be placed with Aura-Shield for the requirements stated here. POC:  Don Clifton, MMS, Procurement Operations Branch, 381 Elden Street, MS 2510, Herndon, VA  20170.  Questions must be e-mailed to Don Clifton at Donald.Clifton@mms.gov.  TELEPHONIC QUESTIONS OR REQUESTS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED OR ACKNOWLEDGED

<DESC>The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source (Colorado Springs World Arena) for leasing a performance location for use by the USAF Academy Band under the authority of FAR 13.106.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received within 48 Hours after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally by considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Sole Source is based upon the sole source justification document below.  


SUBJECT:  Sole Source Justification 

1.  Agency Identification:  This is a Justification and Approval for the sole source rental of the Pikes Peak Center for The USAF Academy Band.  This acquisition is being requested by The USAF Academy Band and supported by the 21st Contracting Squadron at Peterson AFB.

2. Nature and Description of the Action Being Approved:  The USAF Academy Band performs several public concerts in Colorado Springs each year in support of the community relations mission.  In order to fulfill this mission, a concert hall must be procured.  The best venue to meet our needs is the Pikes Peak Center.

3.  Description of the Supplies or Services:  2006 and 2007 Performance dates are as follows:     

28 Oct 06 ? Performance		
11 Dec 06 - Concert Band load-in and rehearsal
12 Dec 06 ? Evening Performance
13 Dec 06 ? Evening Performance
11 Feb 07 - Performance
4 Mar 07 ? Performance
22 Apr 07 - Performance
14 May 07 - Concert Band load-in and rehearsal
15 May 07 - Concert Band performance - Armed Forces Week concert

Expected total cost is $.  Please see Statement of Work for further details.


4.  Statutory Authority:  Lieutenant General Rosa, Superintendent, the United States Air Force Academy mandated this venue.  Included in this request are provisions for lighting, sound, facility rental, ticket printing, stagehands, and operational staff necessary to support this event.  Requested venue is the Pikes Peak Center, Colorado Springs, CO.  Phone: (719) 477-2101.  POC:  Ms. Dorothea Lischick.  Email:  dlischick@worldarena.com

5.  Unique Qualifications:  As Commander of The USAF Academy Band, I have been directed by Lieutenant General Rosa, Superintendent of The United States Air Force Academy to hold our 2006 concerts at the Pikes Peak Center in order to alleviate security and audience transportation concerns that make using the Academy?s Arnold Hall unusable for our specific needs.  The Pikes Peak Center is the only local venue available that can offer size, acoustics and logistical support for events of this magnitude.  Therefore, we request only the Pikes Peak Center be considered for award of this contract

6.  Description of Efforts Made to Solicit Many Potential Sources:  Our knowledge of concert halls in the local area is complete.  Since there is only one that meets our needs, the selection process was simple.

7.  Statement of Determination of Fair and Reasonable:  (To be completed by the Contracting Specialist) 

8.  Description of Market Research Conducted:  It is essential that The United States Air Force Academy Band and the United States Air Force produce the highest quality community-relations performances possible.  The Pikes Peak Center possesses all the equipment, experience, acoustic properties and unsurpassed first-hand knowledge necessary to accomplish musical performances in a world-class manner, within the price point specified by our budget.  The Pikes Peak Center is uniquely qualified to hold our events because it is the only acoustically viable venue large enough to handle the 2000 plus audience attendees (per concert) within the Colorado Springs area.  Last year (2006), The USAF Academy Band delighted over 12,500 audience members in four concerts that ensured a continued strong bond between our military members and the local community.  The intent of our 2007 concert series is to increase USAF Academy and Air Force community-relations initiatives by performing seven local concerts at the preferred Colorado Springs music performance venue the Pikes Peak Center.  Performing our concerts at the Pikes Peak Center will reduce logistics and security concerns and offer a better concertgoer?s experience when compared to using the USAF Academy?s Arnold Hall Theater.  The Pikes Peak Center?s unique auditory and seating capabilities will undoubtedly leave our audiences with a lasting impression of the professionalism and readiness of the USAF Academy and our Air Force.  Our organization has done extensive research to find a concert hall that is acoustically viable and has an audience capacity of at least 2200.  The geographic front-range area includes three acceptable facilities.  In addition to the Pikes Peak Center, two other halls with acceptable acoustics and seating are located in Denver and Greeley.  Boettcher Hall (POC Mr. Drew Armstrong 303-640-2637) is the facility in Denver.  Monfort Hall Union Colony Center is in Greeley (POC June Lindenmeyer 970-350-9460).  While the other facilities also meet our minimum seating and acoustical needs, they cannot support the more than 500,000 El Paso County residents who live too far away to attend Academy Band concerts at these venues.

<SOLNBR>AG-9360-S-07-0003
<RESPDATE>112406

<CONTACT>Steve Roehr, Contracting Officer, Phone 702-839-5575, Fax 702-839-5599, Email sroehr@fs.fed.us - Charlene Byrd, Procurement Assistant, Phone 702-839-5561, Fax null, Email cbyrd@fs.fed.us
<DESC>This is a request for proposal to develop an interagency Wilderness education plan for improved visitor experiences, increased public awareness about Wilderness and Wilderness related issues, and increased resource protection in designated Wilderness areas in southern Nevada.  Four federal agencies (the Bureau of Land Management [BLM], the National Park Service [NPS], the U.S. Forest Service [USFS] and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service [USFWS]) are now working to jointly examine the Wilderness education needs within southern Nevada in an interagency context. The USFS is the lead agency for this Wilderness education planning project.  
  
Some of these Wildernesses have received little to no impact from human use while others are in the urban interface and receive a great deal of visitation and the associated impacts from that use.  This interagency Wilderness education plan will be for the following 20 Wildernesses and 1 Proposed Wilderness:

1.	Arrow Canyon:  27,530 acres, BLM
2.	Lime Canyon:  23,233 acres, BLM
3.	Jumbo Springs: 4,631 acres, BLM
4.	Muddy Mountains:  48,019 acres, BLM and NPS
5.	Jimbilnan:  18,879
6.	Pinto Valley:  39,173 acres, NPS
7.	Mount Charleston:  57,442 acres, FS and BLM
8.	La Madre Mountain:  47,180 acres, FS and BLM
9.	Rainbow Mountain:  24,997 acres, FS and BLM
10.	North McCullough:  14,763 acres, BLM
11.	Black Canyon:  17,220 acres, NPS
12.	Eldorado:  31,950 acres, NPS and BLM
13.	South McCullough:  44,245 acres, BLM
14.	Wee Thump Joshua Tree:  6,050 acres, BLM
15.	Ireteba Peaks:  32,745 acres, NPS and BLM
16.	Nellis Wash:  16,423 acres, NPS
17.	Spirit Mountain:  33,518 acres, NPS and BLM
18.	Bridge Canyon:  7,761 acres, NPS
19.	Desert National Wildlife Refuge (Proposed Wilderness) approximately 1.3 million acres, USF&WS.  
20.	Meadow Valley Range: 123,488 acres, BLM (Ely and Las Vegas Field Offices)
21.	Mormon Mountains: 157,938 acres, BLM (Ely and Las Vegas Field Offices)

There is substantial public interest in the Wilderness areas and each agency is currently receiving numerous inquiries regarding recreational opportunities, boundaries and access. The agencies, however, do not have prepared responses, informational literature, brochures, signage, Wilderness education programs or maps to provide to the public.  There are, however, projects currently underway to survey and post the Wilderness boundaries and provide maps of the Wilderness to the public.  There is also a project underway to place Wilderness information on the local internet web sites of each agency as well as on a Southern Nevada Interagency website.  

The Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) is Connie Moen.  She can be contacted at (702) 839-5562 with questions concerning the actual work to be performed.  Questions of an administrative and contracting nature should be addressed to the Contracting Officer, (CO), Steve Roehr at (702) 839-5575.

The Solicitation will be available at this site for download no later than 10/28/2006.
