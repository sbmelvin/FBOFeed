<DESC>The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), Center for Primary Care Research, through the Division of Acquisitions Management(DAM), Program Support Center, plans to award a 2
month sole source contract using simplified acquisition to the Center to Improve Care of the Dying - Rand, 1700 Main Street,
P. O. Box 2138, Santa Monica, CA 90407.  The anticipated date of award is August 26, 2002.

To write the NHDR, AHRQ staff examined a variety of existing national healthcare databases.  While national databases can measure disparities among most priority populations, a number of exceptions are noted.  Specifically, existing national databases are not designed to capture end-of-life healthcare, especially in non-institutional settings.

In addition, a database of Medicare claims during the last three years of life had been developed and could be used to support analyses for the NHDR.  Hence, the purpose of this contract is to support analyses of disparities in end-of-life care by RAND to be
used in the NHDR.

The contractor shall be responsible for but not limited to the following tasks.  Recommend a list of analyses that could be conducted related disparities in end-of-life care.  Conduct analyses agreed upon, provide draft summary tables of analyses along with supporting description of methods, provide final summary tables of analyses along with supporting description of methods and interpretation of findings, review section of NHDR related to end-of-life  analyses to ensure that we have interpreted analyses appropriately.

The proposed simplified acquisition is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of far 6.302.  Interested persons may identify their interest by responding to the requirement within 10 days after the date of publication of this notice.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed simplified
acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

No solicitation is available.

For further information, please contact Nora Tyson in Rm. 5C-03, Parklawn Building, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, Md. 20857 or on 301-443-8826.

Loads may be single items or comprised of multiple, odd-shaped bundles.  The cargo system must be capable of in terfacing with the ECDS platform, which is similar to the 463L (HCU-6/E) pallet in length (108-in) and width (88-in), with similar tie-down provisions that will be supplemented by platform deck provisions.    The ECDS cargo restraint shall be simple in des ign, maintenance, operation, and have the potential for refurbishment.  The ECDS cargo restraint system must have the following capabilities: 1) Contain single or modular loads of 10,000 lbs (total rigged weight) and provide adequate restraint for aerial t ransport and delivery (airdrop); 2) Compatible with the ECDS platform and the 4633L pallet; 3) Capable of gravity release airdrop operations from an altitude of 500 feet AGL, at 140 to 150 knots indicated air speed (KIAS); 4) Durable, lightweight and reusa ble 12 times (threshold) and 25 times (objective); 5) Deliver loads in fully mission capable (FMC) condition with minimal modification to standard airdrop rigging (threshold) and FMC condition with no change to the airdrop rigging (objective); 6) Capable o f being rigged in a time not greater than the time required for current comparable CDS loads with like capacities (threshold) or less than time of currently required (objective); 7) Capable of storage in the same climate categories (hot, basic, and cold) a s current airdrop items; 8) Must be supportable by the standard Army logistics system, and maintainable by MOS 92R rigger personnel at organizational level; and 9) Must not degrade the overall performance of current airdrop operations.  Emphasis will be gi ven to durable lightweight materials, simplified rigging procedures and low/simplified maintenance.   The objective of this solicitation is to acquire, test and evaluate cargo restraint systems capable of meeting the aforementioned requirements.  To be con sidered, offerors shall submit proposals with supporting analytical or test data and drawings of their product.  The proposals and data submitted will be evaluated to determine the products ability to meet above requirements.  Offerors of proposals that ar e determined to be acceptable after the initial evaluation and within the competitive range will be awarded a FFP purchase order to deliver 2 (minimum) to 10 (maximum) sample cargo restraint systems for testing and evaluation.  The Government anticipates m ultiple awards for cargo restraint systems to test and evaluate.  Test cargo restraint samples will undergo evaluation by Army users for fit, form and function, and will also be subjected to static and dynamic ground testing as well as airdrop testing.  Af ter testing and evaluation, a down-select will be conducted by an Integrated Product Team (IPT) to determine a single offeror to be issued an Cost-Plus Award Fee (CPAF) IDIQ contract to deliver 10 (minimum) to 100 (maximum) ECDS cargo restraint systems.

The proposed Technical Assistance will provide the Ente Regulador de los Servicios P?blicos (Ente), Panama?s telecommunications and broadcasting regulatory body, with the assistance to develop a suitable framework for the migration from analog to digital television and radio broadcasting, and for exercising appropriate oversight during the migration process.  At present, only a minimal legal/regulatory framework is in place; essentially, that framework specifies that the migration will take place over a ten-year period, during which time current concessionaires will receive free use of one digital channel for each analog channel on which they are currently broadcasting.  The framework statutes also assign responsibility to the Ente for establishing the standards, procedures and practices for carrying out the migration.

The question of which standard should be adopted for digital TV broadcasting is currently a matter of vigorous debate within many Central and South American countries.  Three standards ? U.S., European and Japanese ? are currently vying for general adoption, and the proponents of each of these standards are actively seeking to expand their respective ?spheres of influence.?  Some Central and South American countries have already adopted the U.S. standard, or have expressed an intention or inclination to do so, while others are considering the European standard as well.

TDA-funded Technical Assistance for the Ente Regulador in Panama will include the following tasks:

?	Task 1. Initial Review
?	Task 2. Survey of Major Panamanian Broadcasting Organizations
?	Task 3. Analysis of Migration to Digital TV/Radio in Panama
?	Task 4. Organizational Analysis
?	Task 5. Elaboration of New Legal/Regulatory Framework
?	Task 6. Draft and Final Report and Presentation

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $280,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (TDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from TDA, at 1621 N. Kent Street, Suite 200, Arlington, VA 22209-2131.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, TDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm?s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want TDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to TDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to TDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, TDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling TDA.

The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to provide an answer to a question submitted with regard to the solicitation and to change the closing date of this solicitation. 1.  Answer to submitted question: Q:  Will the customer allow a minimum charge to be paid for every time a truck visits a site to make a delivery, regardless of the amount of nitrogen delivered? A:  Yes.  This is the reason every year of the contract has two CLINs, one for the cost of the nitrogen itself and one for the weekly cost of delivery.  Because this is a fixed-price contract, the contractor may invoice for the entire quoted delivery fee for each week, even though the contractor may only charge for the actual amount of nitrogen delivered. 2.  The closing date for submission of offers is changed from 15:00 PST on 16 Oct 2002 to 15:00 PST on 22 Oct 2002. 3.  All other terms and conditions of the solicit ation remain unchanged.

AFRL Rome has a requirement to enhance existing Information Extraction (IE) applications that are already under development for various user sites, and to develop advanced automated IE techniques to better meet our users' requirements for effective text exploitation.  Existing IE applications include, but are not limited to, the Intermediate Text Exploitation ATD (ITEA) for the National Air Intelligence Center (NAIC), IE applications for the Joint Warfare Analysis Center (JWAC), and the IE CounterDrug system for SOUTHCOM and the Joint Inter-Agency Task Force-East (JIATF-E).  Access to these sites and most of their textual data requires a Top Secret clearance.  Enhancements are needed to make required improvements to these systems, and to evolve and extend the systems' functionalities to more effectively exploit information in text, to better meet the needs of specific user sites, and to better meet the special needs of various types of users at these sites.  This will involve researching, developing, and transitioning enhancements to the systems' architectures, and to the IE, Information Management, Database Management, Knowledge Base, Analysis and Visualization, and Pre- and Post-processing functionalities.  It will also involve working closely with users, at various classified user sites, to collect user requirements, develop concepts of employment, analyze data, perform system installations, provide demonstrations and familiarization, evaluate system performance, collect iterative feedback on the system, and to provide maintenance support.  If IE technology does not exist or is not mature enough to meet our users' requirements for effective text exploitation, the intent is to research advanced IE techniques to address these IE technology gaps.  In addition, new IE applications may be developed, if needed, to meet the unique text exploitation requirements of specific user groups.  The technology developed under this effort will support the global awareness requirement for military and intelligence applications.  This effort is to provide the necessary mechanisms for fast, effective, affordable, and unbiased access to those system integration, IE, and related contractors who are best qualified to meet the aforementioned requirements, as determined by the Government.  Anticipated deliverables include software and technical documentation.  An indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity cost-plus-fixed-fee (completion) type contract is contemplated with an ordering period of 60 months.  The prime contractor and system integrators for this contract must have Top Secret SCI security clearances.  Responses to this sources sought are requested from small businesses and will be used for market research purposes and possible set-aside.  Should the determination be made to select this as a small business set-aside, another notice will be posted reflecting such.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 541710 and the size standard for small business is 500 employees.  Respondents to this announcement should indicate whether they are a small business, 8(a) concern, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, women-owned small business, or historically black college or university (HBCU) or minority institution (MI) (as defined by the clause at DFARS 252.226-7000).  As discussed at FAR 19.502-2(b)(2), in making R&D small business set-asides, there must be a reasonable expectation that offers will be obtained from at least two responsible small business concerns and also a reasonable expectation of obtaining the best scientific and technological sources consistent with the demands of the proposed acquisition for the best mix of cost, performances, and schedules.  The same considerations would apply to any HBCU/MI set-aside.  Therefore, respondents should provide a statement of capabilities and information demonstrating management and technical experience on similar acquisitions and resources necessary to successfully compete for this award.

Include complete references, contract titles, dollar values, points of contact and telephone numbers.  The Government will evaluate relevant experience information based on (1) information provided by the Offeror, (2) information obtained from the references provided by the respondent, and/or (3) data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources.  Respondents must demonstrate knowledge/expertise in the following areas (where "extraction" refers to information extraction from unstructured text):  IE from unstructured text (domain portable techniques that need to be applied to very large volumes of text from diverse textual media);  Verb Sense Disambiguation (VSD);  high precision extraction and  normalization of temporal and spatial information; correctly determining the normalized temporal and spatial information to associate with extracted information objects (entities, relationships, events);  within document co-reference resolution;  automated creation of Entity Profiles;  Cross-Document Merging of information extracted from unstructured text;  Relationship Extraction;  concept-based Event Extraction;  automated domain-porting of IE to new user topics and sources;  high precision extraction of entities, relationships and events from case-insensitive text;  automated IE, Analysis and Visualization Systems;  open systems architectures;  Systems Integration; Requirements Analysis and Specification;  software development;  effective software development processes;  risk mitigation;  and project management.

<DESC>COMMERCE BUSINESS DAILY RELEASE 


The Naval Research Laboratory, in conjunction with Naval Facilities Engineering Service Center, plans to evaluate environmentally friendly fire fighting foam candidates as Aqueous Film Forming Foam (AFFF) alternatives.  AFFF is used aboard Navy ships to combat liquid fuel fires.  It is the best available agent for rapid fire extinguishing and burn back resistance of aviation, shipboard, chemical process and petrochemical hydrocarbon fuel fires.  The very chemical structures of the agent that makes it effective for fire fighting also results in undesirable environmental consequences including:  persistence in the environment, potential bioaccumulation in human tissues and toxicity at certain concentrations.  Additionally, solvents in foam readily volatilize and discharge to interfere with wastewater treatment plants.  The trend is clearly toward stricter regulation of the chemicals in AFFF and of the discharge of AFFF into the environment.  The objective of this program is to identify foam(s) with firefighting performance similar to Military Specification AFFF with improved environmental characteristics.  The program is scheduled to start in fiscal year 2003.  The fire fighting performance, stability, foamability, and biodegradability will be evaluated to assess the suitability of submitted products as alternatives.  All testing is expected to be funded by USN and be completed in FY2003.  Interested vendors are invited to participate in this evaluation program and should submit letter of interest and data quantifying improved environmentally characteristics.  Vendors are encouraged to submit non-fluorocarbon surfactant products. Vendors' Technical Point of Contact should be supplied for follow-up information. Offerors are requested to provide rough-order-of-magnitude estimates of the cost to develop the
various technologies, as well as estimated development timeframe.  Such estimates would
be non-binding on the offerors.  This announcement is a request for information and no contract
will be awarded pursuant to this announcement.  The requested information is for planning
purposes and does not constitute a commitment, implied, or otherwise, that a procurement
action will be issued nor will the government pay for the information solicited.    Information may be submitted to: ATTN:  Dr. Patricia A. Tatem, Naval Research Laboratory, Code 6180, 4555 Overlook Avenue, Washington, D.C. 20375. Ph. (202) 767-6965; email tatem@ccs.nrl.navy.mil.  Please do not send any chemicals at this time. No telephone responses will be accepted.

<DESC>SECTION I
Description:  Market research and Request for Information (RFI) for commercial support services (CSS) for C-130B/F/H/H-30 aircraft and commercial variants, and related T-56 engines and avionics in support of Foreign Military Sales (FMS).  RFI is to identify opportunities to decrease costs, improve efficiency, and increase level of logistical services for FMS customers. 
Disclaimer: This Market research and RFI is for planning only, and shall not be considered a Request For Proposal (RFP), an obligation from the U.S. Government (USG) to acquire any products or services, or authorization to incur any cost in anticipation of such authorization.  Funding is currently not available to execute acquisition for this program.  The USG does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or pay for information solicited.  This information is subject to change and in no way binds the USG to pursue any course of action described herein.  If the USG chooses to issue a RFP, another notice will be published.  Foreign firms and foreign nationals will not be allowed to participate directly in any resultant acquisition due to section 42(B) of the Arms Export Control Act restrictions that apply when FMF credit funds are used.  Competition is limited to sources incorporated within the United States (US) providing majority of products and services from the US.
SECTION II
Background: HQ United States European Command (HQ USEUCOM) has identified a potential need for a commercial program to provide C-130 aircraft sustainment support to FMS customers in Saharan and Sub-Saharan Africa.  Program will likely initially involve 24 aircraft belonging to four countries, and must be able to expand in future years to include up to 106 aircraft from 13 countries.   
SECTION III
Purpose:  RFI is to solicit technical and business information from industry to aid in the formulation of a competitive best value contact for C-130 CSS as detailed below.  Aggregate of information received is intended for use in the development of the government strategy, performance work statement (PWS), and future solicitations.  RFI is to give industry the opportunity to participate in designing the initiatives that will optimize wholesale logistical support of participating FMS customers, encourage exchange of information on the technical aspects of the program and likely costs, and determine the viability of industry to provide the services in the manner envisioned.
SECTION IV
Description: RFI description manifests the USG?s need for single point repairable supply and depot maintenance management of a C-130 CSS program for FMS customers.  HQ USEUCOM is formulating requirements for a PWS to acquire a full range of aviation related support services as follows:
- Parts management for repairables and consumables (order, stock, issue and rotate), 
sustainment management engineering, component repair and return, acquisition and repair of non-standard parts, depot maintenance and overhaul, airframe, component, and engine modification, conversion and upgrade, necessary TMDE and ground support equipment (GSE), technical assistance, scheduled and emergency on-site field teams, and operational and maintenance training. 
- This initiative has two primary goals: 
(1) Decrease FMS customer costs in supporting C-130s in several African countries by achieving economies of scale, 
(2) Provide cost-effective single source for parts, and component and depot maintenance services.  Facilities may be the company?s own, the US Government?s, or leased.  Distance from customer country locations in Saharan and Sub-Saharan Africa should be considered in an effort to keep response times and costs low.  -USG will perform as an intermediary and provide oversight for the FMS customers through in-process reviews, status and workload report reviews, site visits, and other methods.  
- The potential contract is a competitive best value single award indefinite delivery indefinite quantity (ID/IQ) for an anticipated period of five years. The anticipated award date is April 2003 for 3 year period. At the three-year point the remainder of the program will continue in one-year option increments predicated on receipt of valid requirements from the FMS community indicating a desire to continue operating the aircraft, and a desire to continue with and/or extend the contract.
-Proposed major PWS areas to be addressed: program management (financial, program integration, security of facilities, equipment, and documents, and information technology); sustainment engineering (quality assurance, systems improvement, configuration management, and system safety); materiel management (acquisition, forecasting, resource planning, inventory and document control, disposition and disposal, packaging, packing, preservation, and transportation); technical publications (maintenance and distribution); maintenance (aircraft performance upgrade, aircraft refurbishment/overhaul, aircraft repair, T-56 engine overhaul and modification to commercial standards, component repair and overhaul, test measurement and diagnostics equipment (TMDE)); Contracted Field Teams (CFTS) (technical and engineering services, all levels of maintenance and repair, aircraft shipping and delivery, CONUS and OCONUS operational flight crew and maintenance training, and safety, supply system, GSE/TMDE, and systems training.

<DESC>Request for Information (RFI) of Networking Services

I. INTRODUCTION:   The Department of Commerce (DOC)'s Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite (POES) program will commence operational support for a new joint program for the exchange of weather satellite data with the European Organization for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT) in October of 2004.  This RFI in intended to solicit industry input for networking services to operate a Local Area Network (LAN) for DOC in Suitland (Maryland) in October of 2003. The services shall also include a Wide Area Networking extension to interface with a telecommunication service provider to manage data flows from both EUMETSAT (in Darmstadt, Germany) and from NOAA (in Suitland (Maryland), Wallops Island (Virginia), and Fairbanks (Alaska)). 

II. SCOPE:   DOC is seeking information that will allow DOC to acquire and operate a Network Operating Center designated as "IJPS NOC" in Figure 1.  The "IJPS NOC" will interface to four separate DOC entities indicated by SOCC, CEMSCS, Fairbanks CDA, and Wallops CDA in Figure 1.   The dashed lines in Figure 1 will only be used for SOCC backup operation - where traffic will be re-routed from IJPS Networking Infrastructure to respective CDAs. The NOC will also interface to distinct telecommunication carriers contracted by EUMETSAT and NOAA to exchange the data between the two organizations. The NOC contractor will be responsible for both the installation of NOC LAN infrastructure, operations and maintenance of the NOC infrastructure, and the interface to the telecommunications carriers.  

The NOC will be used to distribute the weather satellite data indicated in Table 1.  Table 1 provides a listing that characterizes the different data streams of weather data that will be exchanged between SOCC, CEMSCS, CDAs and telecommunication carriers via the NOCC . All communications exchanges listed shall involve duplex communications. All interfaces shall be considered a local interface at the respective facilities in this document.

Specifically, this RFI seeks the following information: 

"	Ideas and suggestions that proposes an implementation plans for NOC operations.
"	Approximate cost information (Rough Order of Magnitude Estimates) for services and infrastructure.
"	Services delivery schedule and infrastructure deployment schedule.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards & Technology (NIST) has a requirement for a preventative maintenance contract for the ALS 200 wafer stepper.  Background: The lithography facility in the 814 clean room is used by most of the clean room general users.  Some of the circuits that are made are next generation voltage standards, terahertz detectors, x-ray detectors, SQUIDs, quantum qubit devices, small magnetic devices, MEMS devices, single electronics, and semiconductor spin devices.  Most fabrication processes use between 2 and 10 levels of lithography and use a single wafer or a single chip. The crux of all device fabrication in the clean room is the wafer stepper.  This system is an ALS 200 (serial # 1726) originally made by GCA Corp, which was taken over by Ultratech Stepper.  This machine has custom modification to both the stage and software to enable it to expose single chips.  All fine lithography and most of the rest of the lithography go through this tool.  Because of the complexity of the system and the need for high uptime (when the stepper is broken, fabrication ceases in the clean room), a reliable service contract is needed.  Statement of Work:  All repairs shall be accomplished on-site at NIST.  Preventative maintenance on the machine shall be performed monthly.  Remedial maintenance shall be performed on an as-needed basis.  There will be full phone support 24 hours/day, 7 days a week to facilitate repair and maintain the proper machine operation to qualified NIST personnel.  If problems cannot be solved with phone support, there must be an emergency service call, of which four (4) may be permitted per year.  The emergency service must be performed within 48 hours after the request is made.  The contractor must supply all parts for the preventative maintenance, but all other parts will be the responsibility of NIST to procure.  The contractor must have past experience specific to the ALS 200 model.  This contract may be cancelled with a 60 day notice.  This procurement is being conducted per FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures (NTE $100K).  This is the complete statement of work.  There is no separate package available.  Interested sources must submit a proposal by close of business November 6, 2002.  Technical merit as well as price will be used to evaluate offers.  As the technical merit becomes more equal, price becomes a greater factor.  Please include Federal Tax ID Number, business size, and Dun & Bradstreet Number.  Terms and Conditions and agency level protest procedures can be found on web site http://oamweb.osec.doc.gov/CONOPS/#REFERENCE.  Hard copy in full text available from office address and phone number listed in notice.  Anticipated award date November 8, 2002.  Contracting Officer: Michelle Sandoval.  Technical Contact: Paul Dresselhaus, 303-497-5211.

<SUBJECT>63 -- Commercialization of Ultraviolet Laser Induced Fluorescence Technology
<DESC>SANDIA NATIONAL LABORATORIES SEEKING INDUSTRIAL PARTNERS TO COMMERCIALIZE ITS ULTRAVIOLET LASER INDUCED FLUORESCENCE TECHNOLOGY.
Sandia National Laboratories (SNL), operated by Sandia Corporation, a Lockheed Martin Company, under contract with the United States Department of Energy, is seeking one or more industrial partners to commercialize its ultraviolet (UV) laser induced fluorescence (LIF) technology applied to standoff detection of biological weapons (BW) signatures in aerosol clouds.  A demonstration system, referred to as the Ares lidar, has recently been developed to address homeland security applications by providing advanced warning of BW threats at high value facilities and high visibility events.  The Ares lidar consists mainly of commercial off-the-shelf components, including the laser, collection telescope, detectors, and command and control electronics.  The system is mounted on a 2-axis gimbal to provide broad area scanning, and is currently deployed in a commercial van.  The system can be operated while mounted in the van or relocated to a facility rooftop, or similar location, for in-place operation.  The Ares system is microprocessor controlled and is intended to operate in a fully autonomous mode, scanning the horizon for aerosol clouds and probing suspect clouds for biological content.  Built in analysis tools evaluate the elastic backscatter signal from each laser pulse, generating cloud position and location information.  Once a suspect cloud is detected, the Ares system is automatically reconfigured to probe the cloud and collect dispersed fluorescence information for biological discrimination.  All data is processed in near real time and provided to the system operator for evaluation and subsequent action.  The UV LIF technology is well suited for both civilian and military applications where advanced warning is critical.  The technology has been evaluated at a number of locations against releases of biological simulant and typical battlefield interferents.  Although upgrades continue to be pursued at Sandia to increase system performance and decrease false alarms, the UV LIF technology is considered to be sufficiently mature to proceed with commercialization.  Note: THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT. Parties interested in commercializing SNL?s UV LIF technology should provide a written statement of interest including a commercialization plan and a description of corporate capabilities relevant to commercializing the technology.

<SUBJECT>B -- WHITE PAPERS SOUGHT FOR PROPOSED RESEARCH TO SUPPORT THE TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT AND RESEARCH PROGRAM CONCERNING THE AREA OF OIL SPILL RESPONSE RESEARCH.
<DESC>This announcement solicits White Papers, of not more than five (5) pages in length, for specific areas of interest to the Minerals Management Service (MMS) Technology Assessment and Research (TA&R) Program, Oil Spill Response Research (OSRR). The MMS web site has descriptions of OSRR activities, the scope of MMS interests, and past projects. The web site address is  <http://www.mms.gov/tarp/safety.htm> http://www.mms.gov/tarp/. We encourage interested parties to view the information presented on the site when considering submitting white papers. BACKGROUND: Oil Spill Response Research (OSRR) sponsored by the Minerals Management Service (MMS) through the Technology Research and Assessment Program is directly integrated into MMS's offshore operations and is used in making regulatory decisions pertaining to permit and plan approvals, safety and pollution inspections, enforcement actions, and training requirements. MMS proposes to expand its existing OSRR program consistent with our statutory responsibility and the provisions of the Oil Pollution Act of 1990. As oil and gas industry activities increase in the deep water of Gulf of Mexico and the and ice-infested Beaufort Sea of Alaska, research must be broadened to address unknown factors concerning mechanical equipment performance and reliability as well as alternative countermeasures, including in situ burning, chemical dispersants and viscous oil pumping. The principal objective of this request for White Papers is to address innovative or technological advancements among several general topics of current interest to MMS. As a result of the White Papers submitted in accordance with the terms of this announcement, selected proposals shall be requested. Projects selected for eventual funding by MMS shall receive funding from FY 2003 funds. The MMS anticipates a total of $300,000 to $500,000 may be available for the initiation of new research proposals addressing OSRR topics in FY 2003 with projects being identified through this announcement and additional avenues. Typical projects envisioned to address the topics set forth below may require one quarter to one man-year effort, and prospective offerors shall bear this in mind when responding to this request. OBJECTIVES: The proposed objectives for the FY 2003 OSRR activities include, but are not limited to, research related to the following:  1)Innovative Oil Spill Containment and Recovery Technologies for the Open Ocean - new technologies that will facilitate the cleanup of spilled oil (both light and high density) in the open ocean. A subject of particular interest is response techniques and equipment for removing heavy oils and emulsions from the sea surface. MMS seeks proposals to performance test and evaluate these full-scale prototypes and non-commercially available technologies at Ohmsett - the National Oil Spill Response Test Facility, located in Leonardo, New Jersey. American Society of Testing and Materials (ASTM) testing standards will be used, as applicable, in these evaluations. 2)Development of New Testing Capabilities for Ohmsett. Over the past several years the testing capabilities have been expanded by: developing tests to evaluate fire-resistant oil spill containment booms in waves and flames; testing chemical dispersants; and testing equipment in cold water and broken ice. MMS is seeking proposals to expand and develop additional oil spill response test capabilities at Ohmsett. 3)Innovative Oil Spill Containment and Recovery Technologies in Broken Ice -new technologies that will facilitate the cleanup of spilled oil in broken ice. MMS seeks proposals to performance test and evaluate these full-scale prototype, non-commercially available technologies, and/or adaptations of existing technologies to contain and /or recover oil in a range of broken ice conditions, focusing on the types of broken ice typically found in the nearshore areas of the Alaskan Beaufort Sea where oil exploration activities are taking place or are planned. Tests would be conducted at Ohmsett. ASTM testing standards will be used, as applicable, in these evaluations. 4)Develop New Technology for Separation of Oil, Ice and Water - MMS is seeking proposals to develop new technology for the separation of oil, ice and water related to oil spill response in broken ice and ice infested waters, focusing on the types of broken ice typically found in the nearshore areas of the Alaskan Beaufort Sea where oil exploration activities are taking place or are planned. 5)Testing and Evaluation of Equipment for the Recovery and Pumping of High Density and Viscous Oils - new technologies that will facilitate the recovery and pumping of heavy and viscous oils. MMS seeks proposals to performance test and evaluate these full-scale prototype, non-commercially available technologies, and/or adaptations of existing technologies to recover and pump heavy and viscous oils. Tests could be conducted at Ohmsett. 6)Surface Blowout Oil Droplet Size Distribution Experiments - At present, computer models are used to predict the oil droplet size distribution generated by surface and sub-sea oil well blowouts. Oil droplet size distribution and evaporation of the oil droplets are two factors that strongly influence the pattern of surface oiling downwind of these blowouts. There are two different regimes for gas-driven atomization, based on orifice diameter. For the smaller orifice regime, equations used are based on experimental data that cover the range of gas-to-liquid ratios of interest to blowout studies. There are no experimental data for large orifices (in the size range of interest in blowouts) in the gas-to-liquid range of interest. MMS is seeking proposals to address this data gap and improve the state-of-the-art. 7)Oil Spill Drill Evaluation Methodology -- MMS conducts approximately 50 oil spill drills per year. Evaluations are generally based on the National Preparedness for Response and Exercise Program (PREP) guidelines. Through statistical analysis, inferences on the impacts of training, company size, spill management team size, drill scenario complexity, duration of drill, and/or any other number of variables could be made in order to improve operator preparedness. MMS is seeking proposals to develop a standardized, quantitative based, spill drill evaluation methodology that would allow MMS to conduct quantitative analysis of the resultant data. Development of the drill methodology would serve as the foundation for new policies to be used in determining timeliness and effectiveness of actions taken by an operator during a spill event. 8)Oil Spill Alarms and Monitors - MMS is seeking proposals to conduct a state-of-the-art assessment of alarms and monitors for the detection of spilled hydrocarbons on the water's surface. 9)Estimation of Spill Size from a Blowout - In accordance with MMS regulations, each operator is required to determine a worst case volume for their facilities. There are major differences regarding how each operator now makes this determination. MMS is seeking proposals to develop a methodology for predicting worst case release volumes from offshore facilities during a blowout. We envision development of a standardized process similar to the model MMS developed for pipelines that would provide consistency to this process. Those intending to submit white papers on this topic should contact the MMS POC to obtain documentation for the pipeline model. 10)Effectiveness of Sorbents for the Removal of Residue Remaining from the In Situ Burning of Oil on Water - Following a successful in situ burn operation, a small amount of residue remains on the water. Manuals and guidelines on in situ burning indicate that sorbents should be used to remove this residue. Little experimental research has been conducted on the effectiveness of this method using actual burn residues. MMS is seeking proposals to evaluate the effectiveness of various sorbent products for the recovery of residues from burns of a wide range of crude oil viscosities. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION: The MMS is interested in research initiatives relative to oil spill response, safety and pollution practices related to offshore operations. As a result of the White Papers, selected proposals will be sought and evaluated for funding. Efforts to be considered should be to the above stated issues and/or other related issues to the offshore operations. Multi-year funding of project is acceptable. HOW TO RESPOND: White Papers, not more than five (5) pages in length, an original plus five (5) copies and one (1) electronic copy to be submitted concurrently in pdf format on CD or standard 3  inch diskette shall be submitted to U.S. DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, MINERALS MANAGEMENT SERVICE, 381 ELDEN STREET, HERNDON, VIRGINIA 20170-4817, not later 4:00 PM, EST November 26, 2002.
