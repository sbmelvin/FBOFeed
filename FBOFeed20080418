<CONTACT>Mary Pat Shanahan, Contract Specialist, Phone 412-386-4453, Fax 412-386-6843, Email mshanahan@cdc.gov
<DESC>The recent tragic events at the Crandall Canyon, Darby, Alma, Sago, and Jim Walter Resources #5 (Brookwood) coal mines have all highlighted the need for reliable communications between miners inside and outside of mine (both before and after a disaster). Present hardwired communications systems may fail due to exposure to explosions, roof falls, inundations, and fires.  During subsequent escape and rescue efforts, it is vital that communications, tracking, and atmospheric monitoring systems (AMS) remain operational. Survivability of these systems can be enhanced by component hardening and system redundancy. The contractor is encouraged to be creative and provide arguments for the development of any new or novel techniques that can help to enhance equipment reliability and survivability.

On June 15, 2006, the “Miner Improvement and New Emergency Response Act of 2006” (MINER Act), was signed by the President to amend the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977.  As part of the MINER act, underground coal mine operators must provide for post-accident communication between underground and surface personnel via a wireless two-way medium within three years (i.e., June 2009).  The Act also requires an electronic tracking system for surface personnel to determine the location of any person trapped underground.  Robust and reliable mine communications are critical to this standard for both routine mining operations and in any mine emergency.

Reliability is defined as a set of attributes that bear on the capability of a system to maintain its level of performance under stated operating conditions for a given period of time without failure.  An example of communications reliability is the probability that a message will arrive at its intended destination within a reasonable time and without undesired alteration of the text or loss of meaning.  Reliability assessment is the determination of whether existing hardware, firmware, and/or software have achieved a specified level of operational reliability.  For example, wireless networks are more prone to failures than hardwired networks and can have loss of access due to weak transmission power, underground terrain environment, interference, etc.  Therefore the reliability requirements of wireless networks need to be rigorously assessed.

Survivability is defined as the property of a piece of equipment or a system that provides a defined degree of assurance that the device or system will continue to work during and after a natural or man-made disturbance (explosion, fire, roof fall, pillar burst, power outage, inundation, etc.).  For the purpose of this RFP, the survivability consists of two principal aspects: hardening and redundancy.

Redundancy, is defined to exist where, after a mine incident occurs and communications are lost, a miner can travel a short distance from the affected area and still communicate with surface personnel.  Redundancy is desired in all areas of the mine where hardwired and/or wireless coverage is provided, and the level of redundancy achieved will be a significant consideration.  Various likely mine disaster scenarios need to be considered and evaluated on the effectiveness (reliability, survivability, maintainability, and ease of use) of the redundant solutions in all areas of the mine with particular focus on the active mining section.

Hardening is defined as the measures taken to improve the ability of the system components to continue to perform during and after mine incidents including, but not limited to, explosions, roof falls, water inundations, fires, and power outages.  Various approaches to hardening the system need to be listed and discussed.  The successful quoter will focus on the active mining section(s) as it is the most likely location for a catastrophic event to occur.  Hardening and redundancy may be more difficult to achieve in this area.  Communication with, and tracking of, miners in face areas is essential.  All major exposed external components associated with the communication, tracking and AMS systems for the purpose of hardening such systems should be examined.  

NIOSH recommends that both hardwired and wireless systems should support legacy UHF/VHF mine communication devices that are commonly used in mines today in order to minimize the impact on existing mine communication systems.  NIOSH also suggests that in the near term, equipment survivability will be best achieved through additions and improvements to the existing leaky feeder systems and/or systems that supplement the existing leaky feeder system, rather than replacement of the existing leaky feeder system.  Moreover, the contractor is encouraged to propose alternative approaches where it can be demonstrated that substantial benefits in cost, performance, reliability and/or survivability can be achieved by deviating from any solution(s) currently envisioned.

Mine phones can be an integral part of an integrated communication system.  While mine phones do not meet the definition of wireless, they can provide a redundancy to those systems that are wireless.  However, the routing of cables, placement of phones, and the means used to harden the system must be carefully planned.  Some companies are currently working on developing wireless devices that are capable of communicating over the existing phone system.

At a minimum, the communication, tracking and AMS systems will likely be extended through the track entry, if present.  This is where most leaky feeder systems are installed in mines today and where the highest reliability and best quality of service (QoS) is desired to be maintained.  However, it is desired to provide system coverage in all entries of the mine; i.e., to provide reliable, high quality and survivable coverage in the belt entry and primary escape way as well as the track entry.  Some of the options that the contractor may choose to include are:  (1) propose to run leaky feeder in each entry, (2) install wireless mesh nodes in these areas, or (3) propose an alternative solution, perhaps employing antennas split off from entries containing leaky feeder or any other variation that will achieve the survivability objective.

A particularly important aspect of system reliability is the availability of power via the emergency backup systems.  This is a particularly difficult issue to address for systems that are used in underground coal mines.  In a disaster situation, often times primary power has to be disconnected from the mine thus requiring that any post disaster system has to rely on battery back-up.  The rescue operations can last for long periods of time.  An added complication is that ventilation controls are often disrupted and therefore the atmosphere has to be treated as being potentially explosive due to methane.  Therefore, systems survivability and reliability solutions must consider the trade off between battery life, survivability/reliability, and the potential of batteries of becoming potential ignition sources.

The minimum survivability requirement is to identify areas within an underground mine where an accident could cut off communications to those in by and to provide an adequate level of hardening or redundancy to minimize such damage.  Consider relevant mine-specific situations that might result in the loss of elements of the integrated communication and tracking infrastructure.  For each unique situation consider what steps are needed to ensure survivability and/or provide for a redundant or alternative means of maintaining the communication and tracking capability.  Situations of concern would include, but should not be limited to:
	Potential fire source areas
		Electrical equipment, motors, power centers, etc.
		Conveyor belts
		Underground shops
	Potential areas of explosive force pathways
		Intersections of sealed areas
		Intersections of completed sections
	Potential ground control failure areas
		Areas with potential roof problems
		Areas with potential rib problems
	Potential areas for impacts by mining equipment
		Travel ways
		Charging stations

The contractor is encouraged to be creative and provide arguments for the development of any new or novel materials or techniques that can enhance equipment reliability and survivability.

This requirement is being solicited as full and open competition.

The CDC expects to award a single cost reimbursement plus fixed fee type contract, and the period of performance is expected to be approximately one year from date of award.     

The complete solicitation document, and reference material, if applicable, will be available for downloading at https://www.fbo.gov  on or about May 1, 2008 and proposals will be due on or about May 31, 2008.  All interested contractors are asked to identify themselves to the Contracting Office’s Point of Contact listed in this announcement.  

It is the responsibility of perspective proposers to stay abreast of additional postings regarding this solicitation at the FedBizOpps internet site.

The Contractor shall include the substance of this provision in all contracts of employment and in all subcontracts hereunder.<BR><BR>The Office of Acquisition Management (A/LM/AQM), Department of State (DoS), is processing this acquisition at the request of the CA/CST.  This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of an HP digital sender.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Governments requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company.CA/CST has identified the Canon S5 camera as the only camera on the market that works with our current Software Development Kit.  If we were to change the software development kit, we would have to re-engineer several of our systems.  We would have to change our Immigrant Visa and non-Immigrant visa software in order to be compatible with the new SDK.  Furthermore, we would have to replace all of the 2000 cameras we previously deployed because they would no longer be compatible with the new SDK because it is virtually impossible and highly impracticable to run two SDKs on the same system.  The costs of developing a new SDK, retrofitting our two visa software systems for compatibility and replacing all cameras currently in the field would be prohibitive, wasteful and not in order with our duty as stewards of the taxpayers money.  
The 41 USC 253(c)(1), and FAR 6.302-1 are cited at the statutory authority.As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractors unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Departments requirements as a key component of the Departments networking system.The requirement will be competed as the IT community responds to price requests on FedBid.<BR><BR>

<DESC>The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), National Institutes of Health (NIH), is planning to add additional locations and Centers to the National Children's Study (NCS).  The Government anticipates multiple contract awards to organizations or institutions for the requirement described below in this announcement.  More details will appear in the Request for Proposals (RFP) to be issued in approximately 2 to 4 weeks after the date of the publication of this announcement.  This announcement is intended to inform interested offerors of a planned RFP, of important background information, and of some key requirements essential for responding to the RFP.
Background information on the Study is available on the NCS web site www.nationalchildrensstudy.gov.  The Study is a large, long-term longitudinal study of environmental influences on children's health and development.  This Study will explore a broad range of environmental factors that could influence the health and development of children.  For this Study, environment is broadly defined to include biological, chemical, physical, social and behavioral influences on children.  The broad range of outcomes includes obesity, diabetes and physical development; injuries; asthma; pregnancy-related outcomes; and mental health issues.  The Study's goal is to better understand how various exposures and genetic factors affect or are associated with children?s health, disease and development.  The Study will include a sample of approximately 100,000 children born in the U.S. beginning with early pregnancy or before and following the children for a wide range of health and developmental outcomes and environmental exposures until at least 21 years of age.  More detail about the design and methods for the NCS can be found in the Research Plan on the NCS web site www.nationalchildrensstudy.gov. 

Information will be collected from participants in the Study who reside in one of the 105 locations selected as primary sampling units for the first stage of a multi-stage sampling process.  The Study locations are identified on the map and list of Study Locations at http://www.nationalchildrensstudy.gov/about/locations/.  The information will be collected by Study Centers that perform the data collection activities in the Study locations.  It is important to distinguish the Study Centers (organizations or institutions engaged in conducting the study) from the Locations (geographic areas, counties) where eligible participants reside. 

In the initial phase of this Study, which was awarded in September of 2005, data will be collected in seven geographic areas in the United States to pilot the full NCS study methods.  Data collection in each of these seven geographic locations is being conducted by a single Study Center, referred to as Vanguard Locations and Centers respectively.  The Vanguard Centers will begin enrollment of Study participants and data collection as a pilot approximately one year prior to initiation of enrollment in the non-pilot full protocol.  

Subsequent to the first Vanguard pilot year, the Study anticipates accruing study locations in three waves or stages separated by one to two years subject to availability of funds.  Contracts for additional Study Centers to conduct data collections in a subset of the Locations were awarded in 2007. The current procurement is for the award of additional contracts to conduct data collections in as many of the 58 additional Locations.  These Locations are listed at the end of this announcement.  Additional information about the timing of implementation for these Locations will be provided in the RFP.  The Government anticipates future solicitations to cover data collections in Locations for which there is no successful proposal in response to this solicitation. 

To serve as Study Centers for the Study, interested offerors must demonstrate the ability to conduct the Study in one or more of the 58 Study Locations listed at the end of this announcement.  The following background information and some key requirements are provided to alert interested offerors to certain aspects of the anticipated solicitation:  

1.  Offerors proposing to become a Study Center must propose to carry out the Study at one or more of the 58 Study locations listed at the end of this announcement. 
2.  Study Locations (generally corresponding to a single county but occasionally groups of adjacent counties, as indicated below) where a proposing Study Center offers to conduct the study must be located either:  a) in the state where the proposing Study Center is located; or b) in a state that is contiguous with the state of the proposing Study Center.  The location of the Study Center is considered to be that of the location of the primary institution in the offeror's proposal. 
3.  Current Study Centers are eligible to submit proposals to serve as Study Centers for additional locations.
4.  Offerors proposing to become a Study Center must demonstrate a clear understanding of the methods and complexity of this Study.
5.  Offerors proposing to become a Study Center must demonstrate an ability to gain community support and input to optimize subject recruitment, retention, and dissemination of Study findings. 
6.  Where feasible, offerors are strongly encouraged to propose to be a Study Center for data collection in multiple locations.  There is no limit to the maximum number of locations that an offeror may include in the proposal.
7.  To maintain a representative sample as much as possible with each wave of location accrual, geographic distribution and maintaining sample representativeness, in addition to the technical merit of the proposals, may be factors in determining the timing of implementation of the Study and initiation of recruitment and data collections in Study Locations.  
8.  Only one Study Center will conduct the Study at any single location.  Study Locations (Counties) may not be shared or split between more than one Study Center.
9.  Organizations and institutions are encouraged to establish partnerships and teams with other entities where appropriate or necessary to establish the strongest capability to perform the Study.
10.  A pre-proposal conference to answer questions and provide clarification about this procurement is anticipated and a date and time will be announced with the release of the RFP.  The pre-proposal conference will be held in the Washington, D.C. area and will be a live webcast.  The specific location for the conference will be announced with the release of the RFP and on the NCS web site www.nationalchildrensstudy.gov.

The RFP is anticipated to be posted on FedBizOpps (FBO) website:  http://www.fedbizopps.gov, through the NICHD website:  http://www.nichd.nih.gov/funding/grantcontract/, and the NIH Guide for Grants and Contracts website:  http://grants1.nih.gov/grants/guide/index.html in approximately 2 to 4 weeks after the date of the publication of this announcement.  The due date for submission of proposals in response to the RFP is anticipated to be on or about April 1, 2008.  Information in the anticipated RFP supersedes any information in this pre-solicitation announcement.  This acquisition has been designated as full and open competition under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 541712.  Any questions concerning this announcement must be submitted in writing to Fred Ettehadieh, Contract Specialist, at fe19w@nih.gov or addressed to, NIH, NICHD Contracts Management Branch, Office of Acquisitions, NIDDK, NIH, 6100 Executive Boulevard, Room 7A-07, MSC 7510, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-7510 (if hand-delivered or sending by delivery service--6100 Executive Boulevard, Suite 7A-07, Rockville, Maryland 20852).  The secondary Point of Contact is Elizabeth Osinski, Contracting Officer, at eo43m@nih.gov at the same address as above.  No collect calls will be accepted.  This is not an RFP and this announcement does not commit the Government to award a contract.  The reference number to be used for this announcement is:  NIH-NICHD-NCS-08-21.  All correspondence must cite the reference number as provided.

<DESC>Request for information- Chemical Infrastructure Risk Assessment:

The Chemical Security Analysis Center (CSAC), part of  the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Directorate of Science and Technology (S&T), is seeking sources to execute various components of a probabilistic risk assessment (PRA) focused on the chemical supply chain.  The DHS Directorate of S&T is tasked with researching and organizing the scientific, engineering, and technological resources of the United States and leveraging these existing resources into technological tools to help protect the homeland.  The Chemical Countermeasures Program Area will support this effort through the Chemical Infrastructure Risk Assessment program (CIRA).  The CIRA is a formal statistical risk assessment which will calculate the acute risk to human health (lethalities and casualties)  and the economic consequences due to a terrorist-initiated  release of DHS Appendix A list of Chemicals of interest (http://www.dhs.gov/xlibrary/assets/chemsec_appendixafinalrule.pdf (Appendix A) from a point in the chemical supply chain.  The assessment will consider a number of factors such as technical and financial resources of the terrorist group, initiating frequency of events, interdiction frequency, efficacy of post-event mitigation measures, medical mitigation and dissemination of the released chemical.  The uncertainty associated with each of the events and parameters will be carried through the calculation so that the final risk is expressed as a mean or median value with an overall uncertainty band.  The economic consequences of the release, in terms of damage and lost production of affected facilities, damage to transportation infrastructure and the secondary effects to related businesses as well as medical costs, will be calculated.  The economic impact of decontamination and costs for reentry to an area will also be estimated as part of this program. 

The tasks described in the attached RFI will support a quantitative risk assessment of events that could occur within the chemical supply chain making, using, storing or transporting Appendix A chemicals at or above the standard threshold quantity (STQ). The risk assessment is expected to be based on a similar methodology developed by the nuclear industry and modified for use in the Bioterrorism Risk Assessment (BTRA) and chemical terrorism risk assessment studies (CTRA) previously conducted for DHS.  

The risk assessment will be broken into distinct project areas commensurate with the tasks described in the attached RFI.   Each project area will be assessed and awarded separately, so potential performers whose expertise are limited to one area may choose to submit a response to this RFI  that is limited/focused to that task/project area.   

In responding to this RFI, please provide a 3-5 page summary, containing a description of the technical approach to be taken to address a particular task and a rough order of magnitude (ROM) of the scope of the effort.

Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

A.  Scope of Work

  1.	The contractor shall furnish all of the necessary equipment, labor, supplies, and supervision to replace pipe insulation throughout the GSA steam distribution system.  Work is to be performed at various locations throughout the District of Columbia.

  2.	The contractor shall replace pipe insulation and aluminum jacketing as listed in the table. The old insulation needs to be removed from most of the piping except where noted in the “Description of work” column for only re-insulation and jacketing.  The new insulation shall be SSL 850-degree fiberglass insulation.  The contractor shall install two layers of 2-inch-thick insulation on the steam line, with top and bottom layers overlapping 50% of their length.  The contractor shall install one layer of 2-inch-thick insulation on the pumped condensate and trap return lines.  The contractor shall wrap the insulation with .016-inch stucco-embossed aluminum jacketing secured with 3/4" stainless steel bands and wing clips every 18 inches.  The expansion joints and valves are not to be re-insulated.

  3.	The steam and condensate lines shall remain energized during this project.  There are approximately 14 tunnel sections and no manholes where piping is to be insulated in this project.  Access is gained to the tunnels through personnel openings with ladders and through material access openings.  Most of the tunnel entrances are in the sidewalk, although several entrances are in the street.  The contractor is responsible for coordinating with the city for lane closures where necessary.  The pipes are between floor level and 6 feet high, and are supported by rollers and pipe guides resting on concrete pedestals and steel stanchions in the tunnels.  The average temperature of the tunnels is anywhere between the outside air temperature and 130 degrees F.  The tunnels have ventilation fans in most areas.  There are 120-volt electrical outlets every 40 feet in the tunnels.

  4.	The contractor shall supply all of the insulation, aluminum jacketing, stainless steel bands with wing clips, and elbow insulation and jacketing for this project.  All of the steam line elbows are 90-degree elbows, while the pumped condensate and trap return line elbows are a mix of 90-degree, 45-degree, and miscellaneous-angle elbows.  Aluminum end caps are not to be installed or included in the fixed price or unit pricing.  Exposed ends of the fiberglass insulation shall be sealed with Childers Chil-Perm WB CP-35 vapor retarder coating or government-approved equivalent, and the jacketing cut and bent over to cover the end of the insulation (see attached picture “jacketing covering end.jpg”).

  5.	The contractor shall notify the government representative when each item number has been completed so that the completed work can be inspected by both parties.  If the completed work has been approved by the government representative, both parties are to sign or initial their approval next to the item number.  A dumpster, a job box, and a ladder may be placed at the West Heating Plant.  The contractor can work anytime between 6 am and 4:30 pm Monday through Friday.

FOR INFORMATION ONLY: This project is required by the Armys Military Construction (MILCON) Transformation initiatives under the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC), the Global Defense Posture Realignment (GDPR) (formerly known as Integrated Global Presenc e Basing Strategy (IGBPS)), the Army Modular Force (AMF) program, and the Armys Grow the Force (GTF) initiative.  The Army must posture facilities to effectively orient combat capabilities where they can most effectively organize, train, and deploy to sup port ongoing operations worldwide.  The Assistant Chief of Staff for Installation Management (ACSIM) has challenged the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) to find ways to streamline its acquisition and construction processes in order to reduce costs and speed up overall delivery of projects, while at the same time providing quality facilities.  The Army requires a minimum 15% reduction in cost and a minimum 20% reduction in time to occupancy.  USACE, in response thereto, created eight Centers of Standardi zation (COS) that are not only the design centers of expertise but also will become the acquisition experts for the facility types for which the COS is assigned.  Forty-one facility types were identified for standardization.  Of those forty-one, SWF has be en assigned responsibility for the Unaccompanied Enlisted Personnel Housing (UEPH), Basic Training (BT) Barracks, Advanced Individual Training (AIT) Barracks, Central Issue Warehouses and General Purpose Warehouses.  SWF has also been requested by Army to provide a standard barracks design for the newly designated Warrior in Transition WIT) facilities.  The primary execution of the work under the SWF COS responsibility will be based on facility-type Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts.   The IDIQ contracts are based around current known requirements within four (4) geographic regions identified as Northwest (CO, IA, ID,IL, IN, KS, MI, MN, MO, MT, NE, ND, OH, OR, SD, UT, WA, WI, WY); Northeast (CT, DC, DE, MA, MD, ME, NH, NJ, NY, RI, VA, VT, WV); Southwest (AR, AZ, CA, LA, NM, NV, OK & TX); and Southeast (AL, FL, GA, KY, MS, NC, SC, TN) for an approximate value in excess $3.1 billion.   SCOPE OF WORK:   Unaccompanied Enlisted Personnel Housing (UEPH), or other similar facilities:  UEPH facilities will house single soldiers and is intended to be similar both functionally and technically to apartment type housing in the private sector.  The soldiers room s hall include, but not be limited to: private sleeping areas, walk-in closets, a shared bathroom and kitchenette.  Additional facility and functional support amenities shall be provided as outlined in the project Scope of Work.  The varying components for t his facility will be: building occupancy requirements, regional soils and climatic conditions, facility structural considerations, HVAC systems, and the exterior architectural features.  Therefore, the overall building design and configurations will vary a s required to meet project specific requirements.  It is the intent of Government to issue design-build Request for Proposals (RFPs) under the contracts awarded as a result of this solicitation, which may be used as the basis for subsequent RFPs/task order s at the same or other installations within the region, i.e., adapt-build and/or as fully-designed RFP/task orders.

<DESC>Request for InformationCategory: Real Property Management
DisclaimerThis Request For Information (RFI) is issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a solicitation.  In accordance with FAR 15.202(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  Respondents are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI.  Respondents needing confidential treatment for any proprietary information they furnish must mark their responses accordingly and USBR will ensure proper handling.  Responses to this RFI will not be returned.  Respondents will not be notified of the result of the review.
IntroductionThe Department of the Interior's (DOI) Bureau of Reclamation (USBR or Reclamation) is developing its requirements to collect and manage the reporting requirements associated with the asset inventory and linking real property assets with the appropriate financial data.  In addition USBR is looking to fulfill Federal Real Property Council (FRPP) reporting requirements issued in June of 2007.
USBR is open to alternative ideas and therefore encourages respondents to provide information about alternative methods (COTS Products) for meeting/further defining the requirements within this RFI.
BackgroundExecutive Order 13327 was signed on February 4, 2004 and is the authority for the President's Management Agenda (PMA) for Real Property Asset Management in the Federal government.  There are a number of related activities such as disposition of assets, transportation, motor vehicles, energy, and space management that have links with real property assets, most of which are reported in a number of data systems across the Federal government, DOI , and USBR.  Most of the activities are being monitored through the use of scorecards by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) as part of the PMA.
E.O. 13327 created the Federal Real Property Council (FRPC), which has a senior real property officer from each agency in the Federal government represented on the council.  Through collaborative efforts with staff from FRPC members, created the data elements that came to be known as the FRPP.  Initially there were 23 data elements introduced in the fall of 2005 and there are currently 24 data elements with the most recent addition being incorporated in June 2007.  The FRPP managed by the GSA and takes the place of the Form 1166 that was the official reporting document for real property assets in the Federal government.
Business NeedUSBR personnel have been using Microsoft's Access and Excel software for the inventory and data reporting needs into the FRPP.  Staff has recognized the need for more sophisticated approaches and solutions for using and sharing corporate data within USBR as well as for external reporting requirements such as the FRPP.
Current requirements USBR believes are "Must Have":
(1)	A web based solution accessible by user account anywhere within the USBR network.(2)	Ability to collect, manager, and report on USBR Assets in accordance with the 2007 Guidance for Real Property Inventory Reporting, Issue date:  June 8, 2007 (2007 Guidance).  
(3)	Ability to collect, manage, and report on USBR Assets three (3) additional data elements for financial reporting purposes.  (acquisition cost, accumulated depreciation, and interest during construction)(4)	Logging to include access, changes (additions, deletions, modifications) to data elements(5)	Upon data entry validation for conformance to the 2007 Guidance and include agreement between data fields(6)	Cost file summary report (730 Report) for real property data (See Appendix A for details.)(7)	Ability to manage users account access levels to regional data, multiple regions, or all regions.(8)	Ability to manage users permissions levels such as read only, edit only, creation and deletion or any combination of these roles.(9)	Ability to handle a minimum load of 30 users across USBR(10)	Export capabilities to; 1) Extensible Markup Language (XML); and 2) Microsoft Excel.(11)	Reporting capabilities such as; total number of assets by asset type, total number of assets by legal interest, total number of assets by status, total acreage by rural an urban acres, total square footage, total value by asset type, total annual operating cost, number of constructed assets by asset type and use code, number of dispositions reported by disposition method, number of real property unique identifiers reported in year XX and not in year YY, performance measures, and certification of information.(12)	Mass Upload capabilities to incorporate current USBR FRPP data being tracked in MS Excel format.(13)	Secure application to meet Federal Requirements for a multi-use system.(14)	Generate administrative variance reports (graphically/text format) displaying updated data and for data not uploaded during the year, or specific data call time range.
Current requirements USBR believes are "Would be nice to have":
(1)	Ability to easily import/export and/or dynamically link to other COTS products such as for example IBM Maximo (2)	Ability to easily import/export and/or dynamically link to custom build application that may be specific to USBR.  This can be demonstrated by explaining the capability of your solution to link to application and the technology used.

<SUBJECT>electron imaging detector (camera) compatible with an electron energy loss spectrometer/image filter attached to a 300 kV transmission electron microscope
<SOLNBR>NIST-08-SS10
<RESPDATE>050108
<CONTACT>Todd D Hill, Phone 301-975-8802, Email todd.hill@nist.gov
<DESC>The National Institute of Standards & Technology (NIST) seeks information on commercial vendors that are capable of providing a high resolution and high performance electron imaging detector (camera) compatible with an electron energy loss spectrometer/image filter attached to a 300 kV transmission electron microscope. The results of this market research will be used to identify vendors that are capable of meeting the required specifications and delivery date. Requests for price quotations and delivery schedules will be generated base on the information obtained. 

NIST has a need for an electron imaging detector that would meet the following requirements:

1.	11 megapixel CCD sensor (4008 pixels by 2672 pixels) with a high-resolution phosphor scintillator capable of recording electron images and diffraction patterns. The CCD must have a regulated Peltier cooler to keep the dark current low and stable and anti-blooming technology; the CCD must have a minimum of 14-bit data digitization and be capable of frame rates in excess of 14 fps; the sensor must be controlled automatically via a Windows-based software platform capable of saving data in an open format such as TIFF as well as formats compatible with Gatan Microscopy Suite products (DM3-formats).

2.	The CCD camera must mount on the bottom flange of a JEOL 3010 UHR-TEM and provide X-ray shielding to allow safe operation at 300 kV, as well as be pneumatically retractable so as to not interfere with the operation of a pre-existing electron energy loss spectrometer (Gatan Image Filter) instrumentation.

3.	The vendor would be expected to modify the pre-existing Gatan Image Filter so that the focus cross-over of the GIF magnetic sector prism would accommodate the added retractable CCD camera (requirement 1) while guaranteeing that the GIF continues to perform to the original manufacturer’s (both hardware and software) specifications.


NIST is seeking responses from all responsible sources, including large, foreign, and small businesses.  Small businesses are defined under the associated NAICS code for this effort, 333314, as those domestic sources having 500 employees or less.  Please include your company’s size classification in any response to this notice.  

Companies that manufacture electron image detectors are requested to email a detailed report describing their abilities to todd.hill@nist.gov no later than the response date for this sources sought notice.  The report should include achievable specifications and any other information relevant to your product or capabilities.  Also, the following information is requested to be provided as part of the response to this sources sought notice: 1. Name of the company that manufactures the electron image detectors for which specifications are provided. 2. Name of company(ies) that are authorized to sell the electron image detectors, their addresses, and a point of contact for the company (name, phone number, fax number and email address). 3. Indication of number of days, after receipt of order that is typical for delivery of such systems. 4. Indication of whether each instrument for which specifications are sent to todd.hill@nist.gov are currently on one or more GSA Federal Supply Schedule contracts and, if so, the GSA FSS contract number(s). 5. Any other relevant information that is not listed above which the Government should consider in developing its minimum specifications and finalizing its market research.

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: Arial; letter-spacing: 0.1pt;">This Request for Information (RFI) is intended to provide source material
that will permit the National Cancer Institute to develop a state-of-the
science summary of available technology for digital pathology techniques.
Specifically the technology review will focus on two topics: 1) scanning and
creating digital image files of stained microscopic glass (both whole tissue
sections and tissue microarrays) and 2) techniques for performing
semi-automated or automated analysis of immunohistochemical stains,
immunofluorescence stains or in-situ hybridization assays performed on tissue microarray
sections.<span>&nbsp; </span>This information will be used for
planning infrastructure development at the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and should

does not intend to award a cooperative agreement, grant, or contract on the
basis of responses to this RFI or to otherwise pay for the preparation of any
information submitted or for the Government's use of such information.</span><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: Arial;"> <span>&nbsp;</span>Based on the response to this RFI, the NCI may
issue a Request for Proposals (RFP) at an undetermined time in the future or
use the information to guide purchases of equipment, adaptation of specific
methodologies or conduct specific methodologic research. <span>&nbsp;</span>THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS
TIME, no basis for claims against NCI shall arise as a result of a response to
this Sources Sought notice or the NCI&rsquo;s use of such information as either part
of our evaluation process or in developing specifications for any subsequent

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: Arial;">In addition,
this notice is also being utilized as market research. The NCI is specifically
interested in determining the types of organizations available in the
marketplace that provide these technologies. In particular, the NCI is seeking qualified
small business concerns [including Small Disadvantaged Businesses (SDB),

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: Arial;">This Notice
is a time-sensitive Request for Information (RFI) on state-of-the-science technologies,
methodologies and protocols for scanning microscopic slides stained with
hematoxylin and eosin or used for immunohistochemical/immunofluorescence or
in-situ hybridization assays. This RFI will provide source information needed to
summarize technologies that can be employed by the National Cancer Institute to
develop an Applied Molecular Pathology (AMP) laboratory that will analyze
tissue biomarkers in large numbers of extremely valuable formalin fixed
paraffin embedded tissues collected in epidemiologic studies, clinical trials
and other investigations.<span>&nbsp; </span>It is
envisioned that the AMP will play a critical role in helping NCI advance its
mission of translating biomarker discovery into human populations. <span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span><strong></strong></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: Arial;">Responses
(no longer than 25 pages in MS Word or pdf format) may be submitted via e-mail to
Mr. Michael P. Marino, Contract Specialist, NCI, at Michael.Marino@nih.gov.<span>&nbsp; </span>All responses must be received by 3:30 PM (Eastern
prevailing time) on May 16, 2008.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; font-family: Verdana; color: purple;">Background: </span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: Arial;">Molecular
analysis of large numbers of tissue specimens collected in research studies is
critical for translating advances in cancer biology to patient research and
eventually improving public health and clinical practice. A critical challenge
for achieving this goal is to identify methods for standardized, rapid,
cost-effective analysis of tissue based assays based on technologies such as
immunohistochemistry and in situ-hybridization. To meet these goals, NCI is
developing a high throughput Applied Molecular Pathology (AMP) laboratory that
will use tissue microarray technology in combination with other high throughput
methods to characterize large numbers of fixed human tissue samples collected in
a range of studies.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: Arial;">Meeting the
aims of the AMP presents technical challenges related to tissue collection,
tissue microarray production and assay standardization. <span>&nbsp;</span>Information related to best technologies for these
procedures has been requested through a separate RFI.<span>&nbsp; </span>This RFI focuses specifically on
methodologies needed to create digital images of pathology slides, develop
matched databases of images and annotated information, and analyze images of
tissue based assays. Developing these methods is critical for the large
specimen / assay throughput anticipated for the AMP.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: Arial;">Image
scanning and archiving is necessary to facilitate web-based slide reviews,
which permit data sharing among collaborators at remote centers.<span>&nbsp; </span>The capacity to sort images is also important
for interpretation; for example, it is sometimes useful to simultaneously score
the same tissue microarray core for several related markers simultaneously,
rather than scoring each marker separately. Concurrent access to images of hematoxylin
and eosin stained whole sections linked to cores, can provide the architectural
clues necessary for making fine distinctions, such as separating non-invasive
from invasive regions of a tumor. In summary, methods that permit relatively
inexpensive, rapid preparation of image archives with flexible sorting capacity
is central to the success of this effort. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: Arial;">High
resolution scanning of slides is useful for facilitating human scoring of
tissue based assays; however, the ability to review such assays is inveitably
limited by availability of trained staff, incomplete intra- and inter-observer
agreement, and the capacity of human observers to quantitatively assess assay
results such as percentages of cells stained or staining intensity.
Semi-automated approaches that allow expert reviewers to train algorithms to
complete these functions holds the potential to address these concerns partly,
although concerns remain about computer-based methods for distinguishing target
from non-target cells and artifacts from true signals. In addition,
interpreting results in different cell compartments (nucleus, cytoplasm, cell
membrane) can pose challenges for automation.<span>&nbsp; </span>Semi-automated systems would reduce workload by allowing an instrument
to approximate the read of human experts, and future advances may permit better
measurement than possibly by visual assessment. Ultimately, it would be desirable
to relate assays signals to internal standards that reflect quantitative
molecular content, rather than a pathologist&rsquo;s subjective score.<span>&nbsp; </span>Complete automation might be needed to
combined high numbers of specimens with assays for multiple different markers. Similar
to the issues posed by semi-automated systems, advances in automation are tied
to the capacity of instruments to actually achieve object identification and
signal validation. Methods for simultaneously measuring co-expression of
molecules in tissue by sing multiplexed assays with distinguishable signals (i.e.
different fluorophores or chromagens) represents yet another opportunity to
enhance this field of investigation. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: Arial;">In summary,
the NCI AMP will seek to combine best methodologies for tissue microarray
construction with methods for image archiving, database construction and
management and techniques for achieving high specimen throughput, cost
effective, standardized assay scoring. The AMP will provide an environment for
testing and developing new methodologies in collaboration with extramural
academic and industry partners. This activity will function as the
translational vehicle for the discovery pipeline driven by molecular profiling
and basic science efforts.</span></p>

<DESC><p>This Request for Information (RFI) is intended to provide source material for a state-of-the science summary of available tissue microarray technology and for planning infrastructure development at the National Cancer Institute (NCI). It should not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the Federal Government, the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and the NCI.  The NCI does not intend to award a cooperative agreement, grant, or contract on the basis of responses to this RFI or to otherwise pay for the preparation of any information submitted or for the Government's use of such information.  Based on the response to this RFI, the NCI may issue a Request for Proposals (RFP) at an undetermined time in the future or use the information to guide purchases of equipment, adaptation of specific methodologies or conduct specific methodologic research.  THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME, no basis for claims against NCI shall arise as a result of a response to this Sources Sought notice or the NCI's use of such information as either part of our evaluation process or in developing specifications for any subsequent requirement.</p>
<p>In addition, this notice is also being utilized as market research. The NCI is specifically interested in determining the types of organizations available in the marketplace that provide these technologies. In particular, the NCI is seeking qualified small business concerns [including Small Disadvantaged Businesses (SDB), Woman-owned Small Businesses (WOSB), Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) Small Businesses, Veteran-Owned Small Businesses (VOSB) and Service-Disabled Veteran-owned Small Businesses (SDVOSB] which provide these technologies. Based on the responses received from this announcement, an acquisition may be solicited as a Total Small Business Set-Aside.</p>
<p>Purpose:</p>
<p>This Notice is a time-sensitive Request for Information (RFI) on state-of-the-science technologies, methodologies and protocols for tissue microarray production, sectioning, slide preparation and slide storage with maintenance of molecular stability. This RFI will provide source information needed to summarize technologies that can be employed by the National Cancer Institute to develop an Applied Molecular Pathology (AMP) laboratory that will analyze tissue biomarkers in large numbers of extremely valuable formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissues collected in epidemiologic studies, clinical trials and other investigations.  It is envisioned that the AMP will play a critical role in helping NCI advance its mission of translating biomarker discovery into human populations.</p>
<p>Responses (no longer than 25 pages in MS Word or pdf format) may be submitted via e-mail to Mr. Michael P. Marino, Contract Specialist, NCI, at Michael.Marino@nih.gov.  All responses must be received by 3:30 PM (Eastern prevailing time) on May 16, 2008.<br /></p>
<p>Background:</p>
<p>Respondents are invited to provide input related to any or all topics.</p>
<p>Molecular analysis of large numbers of tissue specimens collected in epidemiological and clinical studies is critical for relating advances in cancer biology to cancer etiology and pathogenesis, population-based prevention, cancer surveillance, clinical practice and other key areas with direct implications for patients. It is recognized that meeting this goal presents unique challenges, foremost of which is the identification of best available technology for rapid, cost-effective, standardized performance of assays on routinely collected formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissues.  To meet these goals, NCI is developing a high throughput Applied Molecular Pathology (AMP) laboratory that will use tissue microarray technology in combination with other high throughput methods.</p>
<p>Meeting the aims of the AMP presents technical challenges. Tissue based research often uses archival material that has been collected, fixed, and prepared using non-standardized and sometimes suboptimal protocols. Variable processing procedures are often encountered in multi-center studies, which are especially challenging for tissue microarray construction which results in the inclusion of specimens from multiple sources in single tissue microarray blocks. In addition, most facilities currently produce tissue microarrays manually, which limits throughput, limits uniformity in construction and creates need for technologists with specialized skills. Therefore, methods for pre-processing tissue blocks prior to tissue microarray preparation as well as standardizing tissue microarray construction itself are needed.</p>
<p>Since the multitumor (sausage) tissue block (Battifora H Lab Invest 1986) and the tissue microarray (Kononen J Nat Med 1998) were described, advances have allowed laboratories to build tissue microarrays with enhanced features including: 1) inclusion of small targets, such as normal structures and non-invasive lesions; 2) standardized core placement with high density; 3) flexibility in core diameter; and 4) sectioning with high levels of core retention. Advances have been made that permit sectioning of tissue microarray blocks with minimal tissue loss related to preliminary sectioning ("facing" the block) and methods have been proposed to improve transfer of cut sections to glass slides with preservation of core spacing and minimal background when viewed microscopically. These improvements permit the exploratory use of tissue microarrays in applications that have stringent technical requirements such as assessment of multiple markers simultaneously (dual or multiplex staining); fluorescence or chromogenic in-situ hybridization and potentially other types of assays or assay combinations (quantum dots, combined immunohistochemical and nucleic acid probes, etc.). Nonetheless, many assays require pre-treatment to unmask targets, resulting in loss of tissue cores in sections. Tissue microarrays may be particularly susceptible to this problem because each core represents a small area for slide contact compared with a whole tissue section.</p>
<p>In summary, the NCI AMP will apply best methodologies for tissue microarray construction and utilization to support NCI studies and will provide an environment for testing and developing new methodologies in collaboration with extramural academic and industry partners. This activity will function as the translational vehicle for the discovery pipeline driven by molecular profiling and basic science efforts.</p>
<p>Information Requested:</p>
<p>I General Information (Optional) - contact information, including name, institution / organization, telephone and fax numbers and e-mail address; website URL</p>
<p>II Information Technology - software for inventory, tracking and data recording.</p>
<p>Intake of thousands of blocks from multiple sources related to different projects is an important challenge for high throughput pathology, given that receipt is often continuous, unpredictable in timing and may include loaned blocks that must be returned to sources within promised timeframes. Information is sought related to software and approaches for:</p>
<p>&bull;	Tracking source (donor) tissue blocks, microscopic slides prepared from such blocks, tissue microarray blocks and stained and unstained tissue microarray slides<br />&bull;	Software for building tissue microarray maps<br />&bull;	Software for recording assay interpretations with easy exportable functions into commonly used statistical packages such as SAS, Stata and others permitting creation of relational databases that combine assay data with epidemiological, clinical and pathologic data</p>
<p>III Quality Assurance - measures for assessing source (donor) blocks</p>
<p>Tissue microarray quality may be limited by the poorest quality specimens selected for inclusion within blocks. For example, in automated approaches, a single problematic block may lead to instrument malfunction which can result in damage to the microarray block under construction.  Poor quality blocks may also contribute tissue cores that pose problems later in the process during assay performance or scoring of arrays secondary to spot loss. Information is sought re:</p>
<p>&bull;	Procedures for assessing tissue block quality prior to tissue microarray preparation<br />&bull;	Techniques for assessing tissue thickness within blocks<br />&bull;	Specialized paraffins for re-embedding donor blocks to avoid shattering and cracking during tissue microarray preparation and that provide uniform sets of optimized donor blocks for target core extraction</p>
<p>IV Tissue Microarray Devices, related technology and procedures</p>
<p>Most tissue microarrays are constructed by microscopically examining slides of hematoxylin and eosin stained sections of source (donor) blocks, identifying and marking targets on these slides, aligning marked slides and corresponding blocks and then using devices to manually remove tissue cores from corresponding target areas in the blocks. Source blocks with faint tissue outlines (often adipose rich) may pose problems for matching regions of interest on slides to blocks, especially for small targets.  This approach also assumes that targets that appear satisfactory based on one 5 micron section will yield cores of 2 mm or more in length with target preservation. This problem is exacerbated given that target cores transferred to tissue microarray blocks may be placed at varying depths within recipient blocks, requiring repeated sectioning of the tissue microarray block to reach a depth at which all cores are represented. Similarly, nucleic acid extraction from tissue cores with variable representation of targets through the z-axis may yield disappointing results.  Information is requested regarding:</p>
<p>&bull;	Devices for manual tissue microarray construction<br />&bull;	Robotic devices for automated or semi-automated tissue microarray construction<br />&bull;	Paraffins for use in preparing tissue microarray blocks<br />&bull;	Procedures for "curing" tissue microarray blocks prior to sectioning<br />&bull;	Strategies for ensuring equal depth of placement of cores in tissue microarray blocks<br />&bull;	Devices for sectioning tissue microarray blocks to minimize tissue wastage<br />&bull;	Procedures for transferring sections of tissue microarray blocks to glass slides that optimize / maintain core orientation, produce maximal optical transparency when mounted on slides, create minimal artifact / interference with regard to immunohistochemistry, in-situ hybridization and other tissue based assays and provide excellent slides for scanning and potential automated image analysis for assay interpretation <br />&bull;	Methods for increasing adhesion of cut sections to slides, thereby reducing tissue shedding when sections are treated to expose assay targets such as antigen unmasking ("antigen retrieval") for immunohistochemical assays or exposure of nucleic acids for hybridization techniques<br />&bull;	Novel methods for increasing assays sensitivity with minimal target unmasking procedures (e.g. mild antigen retrieval methods), thus preserving adhesion of tissue microarray sections to slides<br />&bull;	Best practices for removing tissue cores for extraction of nuclei acids with maintenance of targets through full-thickness of cores (z-axis) and potential for high sample throughout without inter-specimen contamination</p>
<p><br />V Archiving and storage of cut unstained tissue microarray sections</p>
<p>Amassing data indicate that many antigens degrade in cut unstained tissue sections mounted on glass slides when stored at room temperature under ambient conditions. This recognition has prompted recommendations to dip cut unstained sections in paraffin, store in anoxic conditions (nitrogen gas; vacuum) or store slides at cool temperatures. Information is sought related to:</p>
<p>&bull;	Best techniques for storing cut unstained tissue sections mounted on glass slides to maintain antigen preservation for immunohistochemical assays<br />&bull;	Data related to length of antigen preservation when cut sections are stored under alternative antigen preserving conditions such as those listed above</p>

<DESC><p>***NOAA's Acquisition &amp; Grants Office, Mountain Region Acquisition Division, intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with Droplet Measurement Technologies, Inc. Boulder, CO for a new single-particle soot photometer for detection of single-particles containing black-carbon. The new instrument must be able to detect individual black carbon amounts in aerosols in amounts equivalent to particle diameters of 90-600 nm. In addition, the instrument must be able to detect the coating state and coating amount of individual black carbon particles for particles in the above size range. In addition, the new instrument must be fully compatible with existing black-carbon detection systems (e.g., hardware components and software) from Droplet Measurement Technologies, Inc., currently in use in NOAA/ESRL/CSD. Only Droplet Measurement Technologies, Inc. offers an instrument (the Single-Particle Soot Photometer (SP2)) that meets these performance specifications. The instrument must also comply with certificated aircraft specifications for operation on board NCAR research aircraft. The system shall include: Single-Particle Soot Photometer (SP2) analyzer with rack-mount chassis, Series I collection optics, volume flow control for purge and sheath flow, avalanche photodiode for scattering channel, PMT detectors for two incandescence channels, two-quadrant detector for leading-edge detector, and sample pump. It includes computer data system with standard interface cards for operation of SP2. NOAA/ESRL/CSD operates an SP2 system on board the NOAA WP-3D and NASA WB-57F research aircraft. The new SP2 will be used to support expanded aircraft operations on the NCAR GV HAIPER research aircraft, to make measurements in the laboratory and ground-based atmospheric sampling sites, and to serve as a backup system and spare parts for failure of the current airborne system
<p>***The sole source determination is based on the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) requirement for the SP2 system for which Droplet Measurement Technologies, Inc., is the developer, and also holds the patent rights for the SP2. No other commercial source currently provides an instrument that detects single-particle black-carbon amounts that is compatible with existing SP2 system hardware. Thus, a single-particle soot detector that has hardware components compatible with the SP2 is only available from Droplet Measurement Technologies, Inc.</p>
<p>***This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation package is available. However, firms that believe they can provide equipment that fully meets the Government's requirements may submit substantiating documentation in writing to the identified point of contact within 15 days after publication of this synopsis. Such documentation will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to conduct a competitive procurement, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.</p>

<DESC>BACKGROUND:
The Department of Labor through its Employee Benefits Security Administration (EBSA), Office of the Chief Accountant (OCA), administers a comprehensive program to protect the interests of participants and beneficiaries of employee benefit plans. On April 13, 1987, EBSA was delegated new authority and assigned responsibility for the administration of the Department of Labor's responsibilities under the Federal Employees' Retirement System Act of 1986 (FERSA or the Act). 

EBSA is required to administer and to enforce the fiduciary responsibility, prohibited transaction, and bonding provision of the Act. This work includes the review of the records of participants in the Federal Retirement Thrift Savings Plan (TSP), a defined contribution pension plan for Federal employees. These requirements parallel, in many ways, the standards for fiduciary conduct which have been administered and enforced by the Department of Labor since the enactment of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA).  FERSA Subsection 8477(g) requires the establishment of a program to carry out audits to determine the level of compliance with the fiduciary responsibility requirements and requirements dealing with prohibited activities of fiduciaries. 

The Contractor shall assist the Government in carrying out the fiduciary compliance audit responsibilities delegated to EBSA under the FERSA. The Contractor shall perform all work in accordance with the Statement of Work and all the other terms and conditions of the contract.

REQUEST FOR INFORMATION:
The purpose of this RFI is to afford industry and academia an opportunity to provide information as to the type of audit services that would be relevant to EBSA/OCA. All potential sources are invited to submit a proposal or an approach for providing support and a very brief statement that addresses the respondent's knowledge, ability and experience. The use of information received from industry and academia shall be used to complete final solicitation documents at the discretion of EBSA/OCA. Eligibility to participate in future acquisition does not depend on responding to this notice. The Government will not critique a potential offer's information. Proprietary information is not being solicited and, if included, should be indentified as such. Contractors submitting any replies per this RFI must have a Commercial and Government Entity Code (CAGE Code) and be registered in the Central Contractors Registration (CCR) at www.ccr.gov. All materials submitted in response to this RFI will become the property of the Government. 

DISCLAIMER RESPONSES
Responses to this RFI are not offers and cannot be accepted by DOL to form a binding contract. All responses are for informational purposes only.

<a href="mailto:damon.mcnally@us.army.mil">TACOM - Warren Acquisition Center</a>
<DESC>The US Army TACOM Life Cycle Management Command (LCMC) is conducting a Market Survey to obtain information on commercial industry capability to satisfy US Army requirements for a Full Width Mine Plow (FWMP), Lane Marking System (LMS) and Combat Dozer Blade (CDB) mountable on the Assault Breacher Vehicle (ABV).  The requirement will be achieved in a single step versus an evolutionary series or steps.  The Market Survey document is hosted on the TACOM LCMC Procurement Network, and may be accessed by cutting and pasting the following URL in your Internet Browser: http://contracting.tacom.army.mil/ssn/ABV_Market_Survey_18Apr08.doc/  In summary,   the ABV is based on the M1A1 Abrams tank chassis with a fabricated turret unique to the ABV.  The ABV has two Mine Clearing Line Charges (MICLIC), a FWMP, a CDB and a LMS.  The Government would provide a M1A1 Abrams tank for the testing of a proposed FWMP, LMS and CDB.  The ABV must create a cleared and marked lane that is 15 feet wide and 14 inches deep (objective); 13 feet wide and 10 inches deep (threshold) through minefields 200 meters long consisting of Anti-personnel (AP) and Anti-tank (AT) mines.  The ABV is required to clear and mark the lane in 6.5 minutes (objective); 8 minutes (threshold). The ABV must also be capable of clearing complex obstacles to enable passage of the maneuver element through the breach.  The soil is assumed to be unfrozen with no rocks larger than 32 centimeters in diameter. The threshold is to plow the described width and depth in loose sand and soft silt (objective: hard clay and hard silt).  The ABV must also have the capability to breach the following non-explosive simple obstacles with a CDB: 1.52 meter concrete cube (threshold), urban rubble (threshold), log post obstacle (threshold), log crib (objective), abatis (objective).  The FWMP and CDB assemblies must be detachable within 10 minutes (threshold); 5 minutes (objective), from inside the crew compartment using Basic Issue Items and on-board equipment.  The FWMP and CDB assemblies must also have a travel-lockout to hold and lock the blade in its stowed position during vehicle travel.  The ABV with the FWMP installed must be capable of traversing a 15 degree ramp when loading and unloading from an amphibious ship and traverse from that ramp onto a Landing Craft Air Cushion (LCAC), or other vessel, without dunnage, and without damage to the ramp or vessel.  The ABV has a comparable capability to the M1A1 Abrams to climb vertical walls, cross trenches, climb up 60 percent grade slopes and negotiate a 40 percent side slope.  When combat-loaded, the ABV will weigh less than 60 tons (objective); less than 70 tons (threshold).  These weights include having the FWMP, CDB and LMS installed on the M1A1 Abrams tank.  The ABV FWMP must provide survivability against explosive blasts and complete the mission.  It must survive the equivalent of two Iranian M-19 Anti-Tank Mine detonations on its FWMP and still complete the mission attempt of clearing one lane thru the mine field to the standard listed above.  The ABV LMS must be capable of using marking poles currently in US Army inventory, NSN 6230-99-791-5361.  The ABV lane markers will denote the edge(s) of the cleared lane up to 300 meters in length, in day, night, and combat conditions.  The LMS must be capable of operation by a two man crew in the closed hatch configuration.  Please answer as many questions as applicable to your products.  Not all questions need to be answered.  Additionally, any supplemental information concerning the performance, human factors engineering/safety, reliability/maintainability, etc. of your products or any other literature concerning your company's warranty program, product longevity, dealership network, and reputation would be useful in this survey.  POC for the Market Survey is Mary Pasqual, mary.pasqual@us.army.mil.  Responses are due no later than 16 May 2008, and may be submitted by email to the POC above.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New England District is issuing a Sources Sought Announcement for a construction project for Phase III Dredging of the Federal navigation channel in the Cocheco River, Dover, New Hampshire to determine the interest, availability, and capability of HUBZone and Small Business concerns as described below. The NAICS code for this procurement is 237990.  The estimated construction cost is between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000.<BR><BR>The work to be accomplished is a continuation of the first two phases of maintenance dredging of the Cocheco River Federal navigation project in Dover, New Hampshire.  The 3 mile long channel is authorized for a depth of 7 feet Mean Lower Low Water (MLLW) and a width of 60 to 75 feet, but narrowing to 30 feet through two ledge areas.  The channel is being maintained to only 6-feet-deep MLLW in select areas.  The sediment material is contaminated with Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAH) and various heavy metals, and will be disposed of in an adjacent upland Dredge Material Disposal Facility (DMDF) which was constructed and is operated by the project Local Sponsor, the City of Dover, NH.  This final Phase III work involves dredging of approximately 7,000 cubic yards of sand, silt, and cobbles/boulders from select locations of the authorized channel.  Dredging will be performed by closed bucket, mechanical dredge, and the material will be transported by scow to the offload site located at the upstream limit of the 3 mile long Federal navigation channel.  Overflow of the scows will not be permitted.  Material will then be transferred to watertight trucks and hauled  mile to the DMDF.  Hydrographic surveys and electronic positioning/ monitoring equipment will required to control and guide the dredging operations so as to prevent over-dredging beyond the lines and grades shown on the drawings.  Oil booms, spill containment techniques, and other measures necessary to protect the environment from potential contamination due to spillage of the dredge sediments will be required.  It is estimated that the Phase 3 dredging work will require 21/2 months to complete.  Contaminated sediments will require the contractor's on-site personnel to be 40-hour trained in Hazardous Waste Operations.  If the river ices up, the contractor may be required to suspend dredging operations.  The allowable dredge window is from November 15th through March 15th.  Dredging operations will be permitted 24 hours per day, and 7 days per week within the stated dredge window.<BR><BR>Interested firms should submit a capabilities package to include the following:  business classification (i.e. HUBZone, etc.) as well as qualifications and experience in performing the work requirements stated above.  Please include a specific example of the firms experience with dredging, transporting, and disposing of contaminated sediments in a riverine environment.  Proof of bonding capability is required.  Responses are limited to twenty pages.  Responses are due May 15, 2008.  Responses should be addressed to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New England District, 696 Virginia Road, Concord, MA 01742-2751, ATTN:  Ms. Rachael Raposa.  Firms interested shall provide the above documentation in one original form and one copy.  The Government will not pay for any material provided in response to this market survey nor return the data provided. The results of this survey will be considered to be in effect for a period of one year from the date of this notice.  This is not a request to be placed on a solicitation mailing list nor is it a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an announcement of a solicitation.

<DESC>Sandia National Labs seeks participation in an organizational workshop on fault-tolerant spaceborne computing using new technologies to take place from May 28-30, 2008 in Albuquerque, New Mexico.

The workshop's vision will be next generation spaceborne computing employing hardened versions new technologies being introduced by the commercial sector, such as multi-core, accelerators, FPGA, nano memories, and interconnect. In the near future, an engineer will be able to give a mission much more on-board compute capability by deploying a mixture of emerging power-efficient components. The components will be compatible with each other due to choices and system architectural standards developed by this workshop and subsequent activities. The workshop will also discuss the adaptation of parallel, heterogeneous software tools from the commercial sector to the envisioned space hardware. The implications of evolving microelectronic technology on the physical processes of radiation hardening will be a key topic as well.

Overall, the goals of the workshop will be to benchmark the current state of the art and technology roadmaps, and assess projected future needs and gaps.

Due to space limitations, attendees must obtain an invitation before 
attending. Qualified attendees may obtain an invitation and more 
information from Erik DeBenedictis, (505) 284-4017 or erikdebenedictis@sandia.gov

Robotics Collaborative Technology Alliance (CTA)


The U.S. Army Research Laboratory (ARL) is developing preliminary plans for a new CTA on Robotics, addressing some of the fundamental scientific and technological underpinnings to enable the future deployment of highly autonomous unmanned systems, including ground, air, and surface vehicles, on the battlefield.  The workshop will consist of technical sessions in the areas of (1) perception, (2) intelligence, (3) human-robot interaction, (4) dexterous manipulation and unique mobility, and (5) integrated performance.  Workshop participants are welcome to give a short briefing describing their ongoing research efforts in order to help define the state-of-the-art in Robotics and/or identify fundamental technical barriers that might be addressed by this initiative.  The presentation should address technical barriers in this area of robotics, the capabilities enabled if these issues were resolved, and potential approaches to addressing these issues.  

Cognition and Neuroergonomics Collaborative Technology Alliance (CTA)

The U.S. Army Research Laboratory (ARL) is developing preliminary plans for a new CTA on Cognition and Neuroergonomics, which aims to use a multi-dimensional approach (e.g., genetics, computational modeling, neuroimaging, and performance) to:  optimize information transfer between the system and the Soldier, identify mental states and individual differences that impact mission-relevant decision making, and develop technologies for individualized analyses of neurally-based processing in operational environments. The workshop will consist of technical sessions in the areas of (1) leveraging the capabilities inherent to the perceptual-motor system while minimizing limitations (2) understanding and leveraging the neural processes underlying complex decisions and (3) predicting and validating individual differences in neuro-cognitive processing in scenarios reflecting operational stressors.  Workshop participants are welcome to give a short briefing describing their ongoing research efforts in order to help define the state-of-the-art in cognition and neuroergonomics and/or identify fundamental technical barriers that might be addressed by this initiative, the capabilities enabled if these issues were resolved, and potential approaches to addressing these issues.  

Network Science Research and Technology Center of Excellence


The U.S. Army Research Laboratory (ARL) is developing preliminary plans for a potential Network Science Research and Technology Center of Excellence consisting of four components: a Social Cognitive Networks Research Center, an Information Networks Research Center, a Communication Networks Research Center and an Integration Center for evaluation and analysis of research outputs and overall management of the Center of Excellence.

Workshop participants are welcome to give a short briefing describing their ongoing research efforts in order to help define the state-of-the-art in the technical areas related to Network Science and Information Fusion or identify fundamental technical barriers that might be addressed by this initiative. The submissions for the presentations should address technical barriers in the areas pertaining to Network Science as described here, the capabilities enabled if these issues were resolved, and potential approaches to addressing these issues.  The workshop will consist of technical sessions pertaining to the following areas:


The Social Cognitive Networks Research Center will execute a basic and applied research program to significantly advance the state-of-the-art in how networks influence and are influenced by human behavior in the context of military decision making.  The workshop will cover how people interface with the network and the information products generated by the Tasking, Collection, Processing, Exploitation, and Dissemination (TCPED) process, how they process situational information, especially its representation to humans and how they make military decisions under the stresses of combat.  This Center will also execute research in understanding of social networks as input to an overall networking architecture.

The Information Networks Research Center will execute a basic and applied research program to significantly advance the state-of-the-art in knowledge management, self-organizing services, secure information flows and information networks with the aim of providing revolutionary enhancements to the way DoD exploits battle command, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance data for land warfare.   In order to reduce information and communications network overload, information must be stored in knowledge bases that are easily accessible through autonomic self-organizing services across varying security domains to facilitate fusion of disparate data sources and information sources.  The information networks research will exploit the full range of potential data sources including imaging and non-imaging sensors, communications, human reports, geospatial data, etc.  As part of the workshop, there will be discussions to identify critical technology enablers such as modeling and performance metrics of integrated information network systems, and closed-loop networked architectures to address TCPED capabilities.  

The Communication Networks Research Center will execute a basic and applied research program to enhance the military communication infrastructure to enable a dynamic, wireless, mobile environment that supports a heterogeneous mixture of individual soldiers, ground vehicles, airborne platforms, unmanned aerial vehicles, robotics, and unattended ground sensor networks.  The research will investigate complex wireless infrastructure operating over noisy wireless channels with high levels of interference and jamming, while on-the-move with highly mobile nodes and mobile network infrastructure.  The environment for the network includes rapidly changing network topologies requiring autonomic adaptation and self-configuration. There will be discussions on techniques to model (at sufficient fidelity and with sufficient scale), design, analyze, predict, and control the behavior of secure tactical communication networks, sensing, and command-and-control networks.

PSA
Requirements for Basic Self-Defense Training
March 19, 2008
District of Columbia Pretrial Services Agency
Statement of Work
Requirements for Training on Basic Self-Defense for Community
Corrections Officers
I. Introduction
The DC Pretrial Services Agency (PSA) is an independent entity within the
Court Services Offender Supervision Agency (CSOSA). CSOSA was
established by the National Capital Revitalization and Self-Government
Improvement Act of 1997 and was certified as a federal agency under the
Executive Branch in August 2000.
PSA’s Training and Career Development Center (T&CDC) is the primary
developer of this Statement of Work based upon a critical mission-related
need for approximately 140 PSA employees to be trained in basic self-defense
skills.
II. Scope
The very nature PSA’s work as a federal law enforcement agency may present
staff with threats to their personal security to which they must know how to
respond safely. In response to a recent revision of its existing policies, PSA
will now require certain personnel to complete basic self-defense training. In
order to support this new requirement, PSA’s Training & Career Development
Center has identified the need for a qualified vendor to provide self-defense
training to approximately 140 PSA employees.

This acquisition is 100% set aside for small business.
PSA assists judicial officers in both the Superior Court for the District of
Columbia and the United States District Court for the District of Columbia in
formulating release recommendations and providing supervision and services
to defendants awaiting trial that reasonably assure that those on conditional
release return to court and do not engage in criminal activity.

Page 3 of 5
PSA does not currently work in the “field,” e.g. make home visits, therefore
training on safety hazards faced while working in the “field” for the basic selfdefense
class should not be included. PSA employees do not carry weapons
of any sort, e.g. guns, pepper spray, taser guns, etc., so training should not
address how to use weapons as a means of self-defense. However, PSA
employees do facilitate arrests of defendants who have outstanding warrants.
The actual arrests are made by police officers and/or building security officers
who are armed so the occasion may arise when they will need to know how to
respond as an unarmed individual should the police officer or building
security officer draw and/or fire his/her weapon.
This statement of work addresses a specific need for basic self-defense classes
for up to 140 PSA employees.
III. Training Objectives
Goal 1. The goal is to deliver basic self-defense classes for up to 140 PSA
employees (for a total of 14 classes with 10 participants per class). Equipment
will be provided by PSA (amts, batons, bags, etc.).
After having completed self-defense training, participants should be able to:
Objective 1. identify the most common objects found in the office that
can be used as weapons;
Objective 2. recognize the signs of a possible confrontation and then,
using verbal diffusion techniques, successfully de-escalate
the confrontation to prevent it from becoming physical;
Objective 3. demonstrate the use of “control tactics” using the most
reasonable amount of force (as identified in PSA policy on
staff safety) necessary to safely extricate themselves from
the most common types of confrontations facing
community corrections staff;
Objective 4. defend themselves, using the most reasonable amount of
force necessary and in compliance with PSA policy of staff
safety, should they be physically threatened in an office;
Objective 5. defend themselves, using the most reasonable amount of
force necessary and in compliance with PSA policy of staff
safety, should they be physically threatened outside of the
office, e.g. entering and exiting buildings, parking
structures, etc. and

Objective 6. explain PSA’s policy on staff safety and demonstrate how
to safely resolve confrontations at all levels described in the
policy.
IV. Technical Requirements
• The contractor shall provide instruction to employees on basic selfdefense
(for a total of 14 classes with 10 participants per class).
• Classes should be conducted April 2008 through July 2008.
• Instruction for basic self-defense should be designed, in collaboration
with PSA, for community corrections officers and address scenarios
typically faced by them.
• All instruction must be in compliance with applicable agency safety
policy, e.g. policy on staff safety.
• Training must include instruction on both verbal and nonverbal defense
tactics.
• Instruction should be interactive in nature and include experiential
learning techniques when at all possible. Because adult learning theory
suggests that individuals have different learning styles, various
instructional strategies shall be employed to teach content. Group work,
simulation and other interactive instruction shall be utilized in order to
allow for deep learning. Participants shall have an opportunity to apply
competencies covered in the classroom in order to receive instructor
feedback.
• All courses should provide evaluations for participants. Participants
should have the opportunity to practice all techniques learned and then
demonstrate them to the instructor who will provide immediate
feedback.
• All training materials must be grammatically correct with no typos. All
participant manuals/guides should be professionally presented, e.g.,
bound, etc.
• Vendor will be responsible for providing any and all handouts,
participant manuals, etc.
• All training must be in compliance with Section 624 of the Treasury,
Postal Service and General Government Appropriations Act of 1997
which “Prohibits…employee training…containing [the following]
elements: (1) inducing high emotional or psychological stress; (2)
associated with religious, quasi-religious, or "new age" belief systems;
(3) offensive to, or designed to change, participants' personal values or
lifestyle; or (4) related to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or

acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) other than that necessary
for specified purposes.”
• Total costs should include any and all travel costs, if applicable
The Contractor shall propose for review and approval by training staff:
• The recommended course length in order to accomplish all objectives;
• A full-course description of the basic self-defense class to include
objectives and how the course will be relevant to the target audience;
• Description of interactive and experiential instructional strategies to be
used in both classes;
• Course outline for the basic self-defense class that demonstrates how
strategies will be employed;
• Any available materials/handouts to be provided learners in the training;
• Three references, at least one from the Federal Government that
demonstrates extensive experience delivering self-defense training to a
federal law enforcement agency;
• The method of evaluation used to evaluate participants’ learning; and
• Information regarding experience delivering self-defense instruction for
law enforcement agencies.
V. Deliverables
The contractor shall deliver:
1. Instructor led basic self-defense training for up to 140
community corrections officers (for a total of 14 classes with 10
participants per class).
2. Course materials (approved by the PSA training office) for all
participants in the basic self-defense course.
The following is the justification for a sole source award:
Community Corrections Institute (CCI) provides training specifically for corrections and law enforcement agencies.  In 2007, PSA contracted CCI to assist in developing PSA’s Safety program including certifying designated employees to become Certified Self-Defense Instructors as well as training additional employees (approximately 140) in Basic Self-Defense techniques. 

In July 2007, CCI conducted a Train-the-Trainer class at which time seven (7) PSA employees were certified to instruct Basic Self Defense Tactics.  The class was conducted according to the curriculum written and copyrighted by CCI.   CCI provided all training materials including the curriculum, handouts and presentations to be used by all of the certified instructors for subsequent classes.  The Self Defense class has been designated as a mandatory class for PSA Operations staff.  As of this date, approximately half of PSA Operations staff has been trained using the curriculum provided and instructed by CCI. 

In order to maintain consistency in the training and ensure the safety of the law enforcement personnel, the agency intends to award a purchase on a sole source basis to CCI. The 140 PSA Operations staff to be trained will receive training in the same manner as the previous 140 employees, using the same curriculum and training materials.

This acquisitions is offered as 100% set aside for small business.  Sole source award will be made using a written request for quotation. Anticipated award date is April 30, 2008.

Protests filed with the agency should clearly state that they are an “Agency Level Protest under Executive Order No. 12979.”  (Note:  DLA procedures for Agency Level Protests filed under Executive Order No. 12979 allow for a higher level decision on the initial protest than would occur with a protest to the Contracting Officer; this is not an appellate review of a Contracting Officer’s decision on a protest previously filed with the Contracting Officer).

			(A)  Customer name and address

<p>Name Brand Justification for Aquatrak Items</p>
<p>The Aquatrak Model 3000 Transducer, the Aquatrak Model 4110 Controller, and the Aquatrak 4100 installation kits make up the standard water level monitoring system used on the CO-OPS environmental monitoring stations on the Atlantic, the Gulf of Mexico, the Caribbean, and throughout the Pacific. CO-OPS uses these monitoring stations for predicting and measuring water levels and currents, and disseminating this information to maintain safe maritime navigation and waterborne commerce. This information is also used for many practical purposes to include nautical charting, coastal engineering and tsunami and storm surge warnings. The procurement of these system components is in support the existing monitoring stations. Implementing different system components in place of the current system components will result in additional cost and resources. Also, there will be resulting delay for testing, training, and purchase of support equipment.</p>
<p>Under the current CO-OPS operating system any environmental monitoring system that has not previously been approved must be subjected to a series of tests to ensure the quality of the data produced by that system and the durability of that system for the intended use. These tests usually include bench testing using controlled conditions and physical measurement, controlled environmental testing to check a system's reliability under different conditions, and long term comparison testing with accepted systems at multiple real world locations. These tests and the analysis of the resulting data take a large amount of time, money, and resources to conduct.</p>
<p>CO-OPS monitoring stations are designed for optimal performance with the inclusion of this specific system. A change of any component of the system will result in a need to redesign the existing stations to accommodate the new or altered system.</p>
<p>CO-OPS cannot risk the possibility of new mounting hardware to be developed and purchased to mount a new or altered system.</p>
<p>The data collection platforms at the CO-OPS monitoring stations are programmed to collect data from this specific Aquatrak equipment. If different system components are implemented additional cost for software development, programming, calibration and testing will be required with no certainty of their successful integration between all existing systems. <br /><br />Using another type of system will require the purchase of additional equipment so that the field crews can support multiple systems types in a given region.</p>
<p>CO-OPS also has the ability and equipment to calibrate and repair this Aquatrak equipment. If different system components are implemented new equipment for that system will need to be developed and purchased. Additional training will also be required for those tasked with calibrating and repairing this equipment.</p>

(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.  Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.
(c) Special rules.  The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.           

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.     The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.     OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).     Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.     Informal forum with the Ombudsman.     Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.     If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.           Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.     Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.     In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).     Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.     Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.     If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.     The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.           Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.     The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.     Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).     If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.     This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.     To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).     Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

<DESC><p>The purpose of this notice is to amend the pre-solicitation notice posted on 18 April 2008, and notify interested vendors that the solicitation will be posted on or about 19 May 2008.&nbsp; The solicitation is still undergoing committee and legal review and is currently not&nbsp;ready to be released to the general public.&nbsp; The Government intends to solicit an Indefinite Delivery Requirements Contract (IDC) with a basic period of performance of a base year with four option years for Roof Repairs/Replacement at Andrews Air Force Base, MD. The contractor shall provide all plant, labor, supervision, equipment, materials, transportation, and perform all operations necessary to provide repair services and new construction to include, but not limited to, the following roofing systems: Built-Up Roofing (BURS), Standing Seam Metal Roofing (SSMR), Strip Shingles Roofing (SSR), and Modified Bitumen Sheet Roofing (MBSR). The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for this acquisition is 238160, size standard of $13 million, and will be issued as a Total HubZone Set-Aside. Basis of award will be Performance Price Tradeoff (PPT) with technical evaluation factors. A competitive best value source selection will be conducted in which the competing offerors' past performance history, and response to the Technical Evaluation criteria, when combined, will be evaluated on a basis significantly more important than cost/price considerations. The resultant award will be a firm fixed price construction contract. The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the low offeror if the offer is judged to provide the overall best value to the Government. All eligible and responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the agency. An offer guarantee will be required when requested by the Contracting Officer. The estimated magnitude of this project, to include option years, is between $10,000,000 and $25,000,000. Interested contractors must be registered with the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) at www.ccr.gov and with Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) at http://orca.bpn.gov. in order to be considered for award. CCR can also be reached by calling 1-888-227-2423.&nbsp;The solicitation&nbsp;can be accessed at the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website at www.fbo.gov. Potential offerors are responsible for monitoring the website for the release of the solicitation package and updated information. The government will not provide copies of the solicitation, blueprints, specifications or a plan holder's list. Telephone requests for information will not be allowed and all technical questions regarding the solicitation must be emailed to ryan.battad@us.af.mil with a courtesy copy to kerry.callahan@andrews.af.mil. This notice does not obligate the Government to award a contract, it does not restrict the Government in its ultimate acquisition approach, nor does it obligate the Government to pay for any proposal preparation costs.</p>

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to re-submit the pre-solicitation notice of 3/20/08, under NAICS code 541620 and update the response date.
The original pre-solicitation notice is as follows:  
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Office of Prevention, Pesticides, and Toxic Substances (OPPTS), Office of Pesticide Programs (OPP) is soliciting potential offerors, in order to competitively award a cost reimbursement contract for services involving the consolidation, review, and evaluation of toxicology scientific data on pesticides, using Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 15 - Contracting by Negotiation Procedures.  
The Environmental Protection Agency and the states (generally the State Department of Agriculture) register or license pesticides for use in the United States. In addition, anyone planning to import pesticides for use in the U.S. is required to notify EPA. Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) (http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/7/ch6.html) provides EPA the authority to register pesticides.Under the mandates of FIFRA and the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), as amended by the Food Quality Protection Act of 1996, and modified by the Pesticide Registration Improvement Act (PRIA), a pesticide may be registered if its use will not result in unreasonable risks or unreasonable adverse effects to humans or the environment.

<DESC>THIS IS ONLY A PRESOLICITATION NOTICE SYNOPSIZING A PROPOSED CONTRACT ACTION BEFORE THE RESULTING SOLICITATION IS ISSUED IAW FAR 5.2.

The Department of State (DOS) anticipates releasing Request for Proposal (RFP) S-AQMMA-07-R-0056, on or about May 2, 2008.

This announcement is a follow up to modification 07, Pre-Solicitation Notice, posted on Jan 08, 2008 and the previous synopsis posted on May 24, 2006; sources sought 01 posted on May 24, 2006; modification 01 posted on Jun 05, 2006; supplemental information 01 posted on Jun 08, 2006; modification 02 posted on Aug 08, 2006; modification 03 posted on Aug 14, 2006; modification 04 posted on Sep 22, 2006; modification 05 posted on Dec 04, 2006.  

The maximum total estimated value of each of the contracts that result from this solicitation will be $550,000,000 for the base year and four option periods and the minimum amount the government is obligated to pay each year is $5,000 to each contractor.

The government contemplates making one contract award to four small businesses, as follows: two (2) awards to 8(a) contractors; one award to a Hub Zone contractor; and one award to a Service Disable Veteran Owned Business. The government reserves the right, if it determines it is in its best interest, to award more than this number of contracts noted for each category above.  

The prime contractor must express in writing to the contracting officer which small business category group it wants to be considered in, in order to be considered for award.  Failure of a prime contractor to indicate its desire by a written declaration in its cover letter-page may be reason for the government to determine that the contractors’ proposal is non-responsive and therefore will not be further considered for award.  

No prime contractor will be allowed to compete in two different category groups at the same time from this announcement and under the RFP.  This does not affect any subcontractor relationships, or; MENTOR-PROTÉGÉ, JOINT VENTURE and TEAMING PARTNERSHIP relationships, as they may team up with as many prime contractors as they want.

The Office of Acquisition (AQM) in the DOS seeks to issue a multi-award Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity firm price Labor Hour Contract to assist DOS in its effort to provide labor assistance in management and other areas of disciplines as outlined in the Request for Proposal RFP.  These services will be required in support of domestic operations in the United States of America.  A sampling of positions/services include: Accounting Clerk, Administrative Assistant, Computer Assistant, Court Reporter, Document Prep Clerk, Drafter, Driver (Courier), Duplicating Machine Operator (OT), General Clerk, Film/Tape Librarian, Key Entry Operator, Photographer, Procurement Coordinator Receptionist/Operator, Secretary, Shipping/Receiving Clerk, Word Processor I Accounting Clerk, Accountant, Library Technician, and Management Analyst; also other labor categories may include, but are not limited to, program management, financial, information technology, and other administrative services.  These are not all of the labor categories. All of the labor categories will be set forth in the RFP. 

It is anticipated that this contract effort may employ over 300 full time positions working at offices within DOS.  The primary focus will be on the Washington D.C. area, but other support services may be needed by other DOS/Bureau organizations around the country and will be expressed in the RFP and specifically by task orders.  There may be a need for the contractor personnel to travel within the United States occasionally, but this travel requirement is minor and cannot be forecasted in advance.  If travel is required it will be handled on a case by case basis as presented within the task order(s).  The travel may be part of the person’s duty for the office where they are employed.  

Small business(es) are strongly encouraged to seek a contract under this announcement—via either: setting-up a MENTOR-PROTÉGÉ relationship; a JOINT VENTURE relationship; a TEAMING PARTNERSHIP; or a legitimate subcontracting relationship with either a large or small business(s).  These teaming arrangements shall be evaluated against the criteria in the RFP.  This is only a suggestion from the government and not a directive; therefore, it shall be totally up to the small business to develop it’s own business plan that it feels comfortable with and to decide what the best opportunity will be for its’ company to achieve the requirements set forth in the RFP.  

Capability statements from potential 8(a) Mentor-Protégé program, Joint Venture Agreements and Teaming Partnerships with subcontractors’ relationships shall be reviewed as acceptable or non-acceptable in accordance with Small Business Administration’s regulations concerning the specific teaming arrangements.  

Offerors must ultimately possess a Defense Security Service (DSS) Top Secret Facility Security Clearance (FCL) for contract performance. Firms with an FCL at a lower level (Interim Secret or Final Secret) would be eligible for contract award but will be limited to competing on task orders up to the Secret level only.  The Bureau of Diplomatic Security will sponsor selected Offerors who are either uncleared or who only possess an Interim Secret or Final Secret FCL for a Top Secret FCL.  

As contract performance is contingent upon issuance of an FCL, it is imperative that the Offeror cooperate with all requirements and deadlines imposed by DSS.  A time period
of 90 days will be allotted for the issuance of an FCL.  If the Offeror does not have the requisite clearance within that timeframe, the Government reserves the right to award to the next qualified Offeror.   Other than U.S. Government sponsorship for the FCL, the 
U. S. Department of State assumes no responsibility for clearance processing.  A bidder DD Form 254 will be issued to each offeror.

 The Government intends to evaluate each proposal and may award a contract without discussions with any offerors.  Therefore, the offeror’s initial proposal should contain the offeror’s best terms from a technical and cost or price standpoint.  

There are a total of three (3) Evaluation Factors. There are four (4), Sub-Technical Factors under Volume I as follows; (a). Management Approach and Technical Capabilities, (b).  Personnel Qualifications, (c). Organizational Experience, and; (d). Resumes of Project Manager, Assistant Project Managers and any company officers that bring credence and experience to the contract requirement, Volume II is for Past Performance and Volume III is for Price.  

If the contractor chooses any arrangement as an 8(a) Mentor-Protégé program, Joint Venture Agreements and Teaming Partnerships with any major subcontracting relationship, then the prime contractor must provide financial statements for itself and each first tier subcontractor that makes up the teaming arrangement.  A major subcontractor relationship is any contractor entity that will provide over 20% in any given year of services in dollars to the prime contractor for this contracting effort.
  
The Government's objective is to obtain the highest technical quality considered necessary to achieve the project objectives, with a realistic and reasonable price.  Technical evaluation factors are more important than price; however, between quotes that are evaluated as technically equal in quality, price will become a major consideration in selecting the successful Offeror(s). The Government reserves the right to make an award to other than the low priced offeror if the superior technical submission, or the submission indicating a reduced performance risk, warrants paying a premium.  

Award will be made on a “Best Value” Basis.  As technical merit of the offeror proposal becomes more equal, the evaluated cost or price may become the determining factor. The Contracting Officer shall determine what trade-off between technical merit and cost or price promises the greatest value to the Government, cost or price and other factors considered.

Offerors are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFP.  

No Pre-Proposal Conference is scheduled for this RFP.  

All contractor questions concerning the RFP shall be expressed in writing and sent be e-mail to williamsh@state.gov.  Any questions received after the date outlined in the RFP shall be returned unanswered and shall not be considered.  

This notice is for future information concerning the release of the RFP.  The RFP will be transmitted through FedBiz on or about the date indicated above in the first paragraph of this announcement.  The contractor’s proposal as described in Section “L” of the RFP will be sent to Mr. Howard Williams, Jr. no later than 3:00 pm EST as described in the RFP.  

Please wait until the RFP is released before you submit questions to Mr. Howard Williams, Jr. via email at:  williamsh@state.gov.  Make sure you have placed the solicitation number “S-AQMMA-07-R-0056” on the “SUBJECT” header-line of any e-mail sent to DOS for consideration.

<DESC>GENERAL INFORMATION:  The U.S. Government appreciates the time and effort taken to respond to this survey.  The U.S. Government acknowledges its obligations under 18 U.S.C. 1905 to protect information qualifying as CONFIDENTIAL under this statute.  Pursuant to this statute, the U.S. Government is willing to accept any trade secret or confidential restrictions placed on qualifying data forwarded in response to the survey questions and to protect it from unauthorized disclosure subject to the following:<BR><BR>1.  Clearly and conspicuously mark qualifying data as trade secret or confidential with the restrictive legend (all caps) CONFIDENTIAL with any explanatory text, so that the U.S. Government is clearly notified of what data needs to be appropriately protected.<BR><BR>2.  In marking such data, please take care to mark only those portions of the data or materials that are truly trade secret or confidential (over breadth in marking inappropriate data as CONFIDENTIAL may diminish or eliminate the usefulness of your response - see item 6 under Instructions for Completing the Questionnaire, below).  Use circling, underscoring, highlighting or any other appropriate means to indicate those portions of a single page which are to be protected.<BR><BR>3.  The U.S. Government is not obligated to protect unmarked data.  Additionally, marked data that is already in the public domain or in the possession of the U.S. Government or third parties, or is afterward placed into the public domain by the owner or another party through no fault of the U.S. Government will not be protected once in the public domain.  Data already in the possession of the U.S. Government will be protected in accordance with the U.S. Governments rights in the data.<BR><BR>4.  Confidential data transmitted electronically, whether by physical media or not, whether by the respondent or by the U.S. Government, shall contain any restrictive legend, with any explanatory text, on both the cover of the transmittal e-mail and at the beginning of the file itself.  Where appropriate for portions only of an electronic file, use the restrictive legends CONFIDENTIAL DATA BEGINS: and CONFIDENTIAL PORTION ENDS.<BR><BR>5.  In any reproductions of technical data or any portions thereof subject to asserted restrictions, the U.S. Government shall also reproduce the asserted restriction legend and any explanatory text.<BR><BR> <BR>DESCRIPTION OF INTENT:<BR><BR>THIS IS A MARKET SURVEY REQUESTING INFORMATION IN SUPPORT OF THE FOLLOWING PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENT.  No contract will be awarded from this announcement.  This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an announcement of a forthcoming solicitation.  Also, it is not a request seeking contractors interested in being placed on a solicitation mailing list.  Response to this questionnaire is voluntary and no reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this Market Survey and any follow-on information requests.  Data submitted in response to this Market Survey will not be returned.  No solicitation document exists at this time, and calls requesting a solicitation will not be answered.<BR><BR>PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENT:<BR><BR>The purpose of this questionnaire is to obtain information on commercial industry capability to satisfy US Army requirements for a Full Width Mine Plow (FWMP), Lane Marking System (LMS) and Combat Dozer Blade (CDB) mountable on the Assault Breacher Vehicle (ABV).   The requirement will be achieved in a single step versus an evolutionary series or steps.<BR><BR>The ABV is based on the M1A1 Abrams tank chassis with a fabricated turret unique to the ABV.  The ABV has two Mine Clearing Line Charges (MICLIC), a FWMP, a CDB and a LMS.  The Government would provide a M1A1 Abrams tank for the testing of a proposed FWMP, LMS and CDB.  The ABV must create a cleared and marked lane that is 15 feet wide and 14 inches deep (objective); 13 feet wide and 10 inches deep (threshold) through minefields 200 meters long consisting of Anti-personnel (AP) and Anti-tank (AT) mines.  The ABV is required to clear and mark the lane in 6.5 minutes (objective); 8 minutes (threshold). The ABV must also be capable of clearing complex obstacles to enable passage of the maneuver element through the breach.  The soil is assumed to be unfrozen with no rocks larger than 32 centimeters in diameter. The threshold is to plow the described width and depth in loose sand and soft silt (objective: hard clay and hard silt).  The ABV must also have the capability to breach the following non-explosive simple obstacles with a CDB: 1.52 meter concrete cube (threshold), urban rubble (threshold), log post obstacle (threshold), log crib (objective), abatis (objective).<BR><BR>The FWMP and CDB assemblies must be detachable within 10 minutes (threshold); 5 minutes (objective), from inside the crew compartment using Basic Issue Items and on-board equipment.  The FWMP and CDB assemblies must also have a travel-lockout to hold and lock the blade in its stowed position during vehicle travel.  The ABV with the FWMP installed must be capable of traversing a 15 degree ramp when loading and unloading from an amphibious ship and traverse from that ramp onto a Landing Craft Air Cushion (LCAC), or other vessel, without dunnage, and without damage to the ramp or vessel.  The ABV has a comparable capability to the M1A1 Abrams to climb vertical walls, cross trenches, climb up 60 percent grade slopes and negotiate a 40 percent side slope.  When combat-loaded, the ABV will weigh less than 60 tons (objective); less than 70 tons (threshold).  These weights include having the FWMP, CDB and LMS installed on the M1A1 Abrams tank.<BR><BR>The ABV FWMP must provide survivability against explosive blasts and complete the mission.  It must survive the equivalent of two Iranian M-19 Anti-Tank Mine detonations on its FWMP and still complete the mission attempt of clearing one lane thru the mine field to the standard listed above.<BR><BR>The ABV LMS must be capable of using marking poles currently in US Army inventory, NSN 6230-99-791-5361.  The ABV lane markers will denote the edge(s) of the cleared lane up to 300 meters in length, in day, night, and combat conditions.  The LMS must be capable of operation by a two man crew in the closed hatch configuration.<BR><BR><BR>INSTRUCTIONS FOR COMPLETING THE QUESTIONNAIRE:<BR><BR>1.  Number each response with the appropriate question number.<BR><BR>2.  You do not have to repeat the question in your response. <BR><BR>3.  If you cannot answer a question, please indicate No Response.<BR><BR>4.  If a response will satisfy another question, state: See response to question XXX.<BR><BR>5.  Include relevant sales media and product manuals.  If providing an ACROBAT formatted manual, annotate the manual to indicate which material is applicable to the questions.  If preferred, include Internet Web links to locations where animations/videos may be viewed.<BR><BR>6.  If your sales media and/or manuals contain a restricted distribution statement, issue a release statement indicating that the restricted material may be distributed to Army personnel involved with this market investigation.<BR><BR>7.  Spell out any acronyms in their first instance.<BR><BR>8.  Clearly mark any proprietary information.  If applicable, the front page of your response package should state:  Proprietary Information Contained.  Provide a release statement indicating that the proprietary information may be distributed to Army personnel involved with this market investigation.<BR><BR>9.  A copy of the Tri-Lateral Design and Testing Code (TDTC) is available on the Internet at http://www.dtic.mil/dticasd/sbir/sbir032/a213.pdf.<BR><BR>10..

<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Walla Walla District, CENWW, 201 North 3rd Avenue, Walla Walla, WA  99362, intends to issue a Sole Source Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity Solicitation to provide Traditional Property Management Assistance Services for The Corps of Engineers, Walla Walla District (Corps) in compliance with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act, 36 CFR Part 800, and a Programatic Memorandum of Agreement signed 4 March 1982.  The statutory authority for permitting other than full and open competition for this requirement, 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), and implemented by FAR 6.302-1(a)(2), which authorizes other than full and open competition when there is only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.<BR><BR>Tasks under the proposed contracts will support Corps responsibilities regarding management of traditional cultural properties associated with members of the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation.  The Tribe will be offered a sole source contract for management assistance regarding traditional cultural sites recognized by their own members.  The term 'traditional cultural property' refers to a class of historic property that is eligible for inclusion in the National Register because of its association with cultural practices or beliefs of a living community that (a) are rooted in that communitys history, and (b) are important in maintaining the continuing cultural identity of the community.  Such places may not come to light through the conduct of archeological, historical, or architectural surveys. The existence and significance of such locations often can be ascertained only through interviews with knowledgeable users of the area (National Register Bulletin 38).  Only consultation and coordination with the living effected community can disclose the existence of possible traditional cultural properties and determine their significance.  <BR><BR>The proposed contracts feature a base year and four (4) option years.  The value of the base year will not exceed $100,000.  Likewise, the value of each option, if awarded, will not exceed $100,000.  The guaranteed minimum for the base year is $9,000.  The guaranteed minimum for each of the option years, if awarded, will be $5,000.  Included will be FAR Clause 52.217-8 Option to Extend Services, which the Government may award an additional six months requiring continued performance of any services within the limits and at the rates specified in the contract.<BR><BR>CONTRACTOR SERVICES: Services under this contract will pertain to sites located on federal fee-owned lands administered and managed by The Corps of Engineers.  The contractor will be expected to provide a wide range of management assistance services.  The Contractor shall furnish to the Corps all services, labor, materials, and equipment to carry out work specified in, and in accordance with standards, quantities, and schedules described in, individual task orders.  These activities shall include, but not be limited to, identification, assessment (including determination of project effects), and treatment.  As more fully set out in individual task orders, the Contractor shall access traditional cultural property data sources (records and oral histories), identify and evaluate traditional cultural properties, assess project effects on such properties, and assist in preparing and implementing preservation plans.  The Contractor will be required to submit reports of all work performed on individual task orders under this contract to the Government according to the schedule stipulated in each individual task order.  The Corps will identify deliverables in each task order.  <BR><BR>PROFESSIONAL QUALIFICATIONS: The principal investigator involved in fieldwork and report preparation for the tasks, shall meet the Secretary of the Interiors Standards for Professional Qualifications (36CFR61.8 Appendix A).  Crew leaders and other supervisory personnel who meet the Secretary of Interior's standard are preferred, but personnel with substantial pertinent experience and demonstrated ability to carry out TCP-related field and laboratory documentation procedures may be utilized in this role.  Staff responsible for preparing reports must have demonstrated ability to carry projects to completion through the reporting phase.  <BR><BR>Traditional cultural properties, and the beliefs and institutions that give them significance, should be systematically addressed in programs of preservation planning and in the historic preservation components land use plans (National Register Bulletin 38, Guidelines for Evaluating and Documenting Traditional Cultural Properties).  The Bulletin states that The unique aspects of identifying and evaluating traditional cultural properties have to do with tapping into the specialized knowledge and information that is maintained within the traditional community.   Information pertaining to location, character, condition of, and potential impacts to traditional areas is necessary for the Corps to effectively manage these areas.  Traditional information about areas identified as traditional cultural properties is only available from the effected community.  Any effort to obtain competition would not be reasonable because only the effected community has the necessary information about their traditional cultural properties.<BR><BR>ADMINISTRATIVE INFORMATION:  The solicitation will be available on the FedTeDS website:  https://www.fedteds.gov   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541720 with a Size Standard of $6.5.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Walla Walla District, CENWW, 201 North 3rd Avenue, Walla Walla, WA  99362, intends to issue a Sole Source Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity Solicitation to provide Traditional Property Management Assistance Services for The Corps of Engineers, Walla Walla District (Corps) in compliance with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act, 36 CFR Part 800, and a Programatic Memorandum of Agreement signed 4 March 1982.  The statutory authority for permitting other than full and open competition for this requirement, 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), and implemented by FAR 6.302-1(a)(2), which authorizes other than full and open competition when there is only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.<BR><BR>Tasks under the proposed contracts will support Corps responsibilities regarding management of traditional cultural properties associated with members of the Yakama Nation.  The Tribe will be offered a sole source contract for management assistance regarding traditional cultural sites recognized by their own members.  The term 'traditional cultural property' refers to a class of historic property that is eligible for inclusion in the National Register because of its association with cultural practices or beliefs of a living community that (a) are rooted in that communitys history, and (b) are important in maintaining the continuing cultural identity of the community.  Such places may not come to light through the conduct of archeological, historical, or architectural surveys. The existence and significance of such locations often can be ascertained only through interviews with knowledgeable users of the area (National Register Bulletin 38).  Only consultation and coordination with the living effected community can disclose the existence of possible traditional cultural properties and determine their significance.  <BR><BR>The proposed contracts feature a base year and four (4) option years.  The value of the base year will not exceed $100,000.  Likewise, the value of each option, if awarded, will not exceed $100,000.  The guaranteed minimum for the base year is $9,000.  The guaranteed minimum for each of the option years, if awarded, will be $5,000.  Included will be FAR Clause 52.217-8 Option to Extend Services, which the Government may award an additional six months requiring continued performance of any services within the limits and at the rates specified in the contract.<BR><BR>CONTRACTOR SERVICES: Services under this contract will pertain to sites located on federal fee-owned lands administered and managed by The Corps of Engineers.  The contractor will be expected to provide a wide range of management assistance services.  The Contractor shall furnish to the Corps all services, labor, materials, and equipment to carry out work specified in, and in accordance with standards, quantities, and schedules described in, individual task orders.  These activities shall include, but not be limited to, identification, assessment (including determination of project effects), and treatment.  As more fully set out in individual task orders, the Contractor shall access traditional cultural property data sources (records and oral histories), identify and evaluate traditional cultural properties, assess project effects on such properties, and assist in preparing and implementing preservation plans.  The Contractor will be required to submit reports of all work performed on individual task orders under this contract to the Government according to the schedule stipulated in each individual task order.  The Corps will identify deliverables in each task order.  <BR><BR>PROFESSIONAL QUALIFICATIONS: The principal investigator involved in fieldwork and report preparation for the tasks, shall meet the Secretary of the Interiors Standards for Professional Qualifications (36CFR61.8 Appendix A).  Crew leaders and other supervisory personnel who meet the Secretary of Interior's standard are preferred, but personnel with substantial pertinent experience and demonstrated ability to carry out TCP-related field and laboratory documentation procedures may be utilized in this role.  Staff responsible for preparing reports must have demonstrated ability to carry projects to completion through the reporting phase.  <BR><BR>Traditional cultural properties, and the beliefs and institutions that give them significance, should be systematically addressed in programs of preservation planning and in the historic preservation components land use plans (National Register Bulletin 38, Guidelines for Evaluating and Documenting Traditional Cultural Properties).

BELO HORIZONTE INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM PROJECT.  The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study for an Integrated Traffic Information Management System( ITIMS) for Belo Horizonte's Traffic and Transportation Company (Empresa de Transportes e Transito de Belo Horizonte SA, BHTRANS). 

The feasibility study would review the application of an ITIMS for the integration of all traffic management operations within the city.  BHTRANS is looking to integrate all of the information generated by its various departments and operations in one central database that would include a GIS based system.  

The ITIMS envisioned by BHTRANS would include the automation of all field operations handled by the field operations and emergency teams by way of hand-held computers to register the field information and quickly transfer that information by wireless communications to the intelligent traffic control system center.  Once all the field information is received in the central control, then the information would be available for use within the entire BHTRANS organization allowing users to benefit from the most up to date traffic information.  Traffic information could then be displayed and posted on a web site for the benefit of the public.  BHTRANS would like to explore the potential of marketing and selling the available traffic information to the public, similar to what is done by some private companies in the U.S.

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $294,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background desk study report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  To request the RFP in PDF format, please go to: https://www.ustda.gov/USTDA/FedBizOpps/RFP/rfpform.asp  

Requests for a mailed hardcopy version of the RFP may also be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm?s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English and Portuguese directly to the Grantee by 1:00pm (local time), April 22, 2008 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.
