In accordance with FAR 5.207 (c) (15) (ii); all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency.
Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. 
Note: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the Ombudman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Interested parties are invited to call the Ombudsman at (405) 734-8241. DO NOT CALL THIS NUMBER FOR SOLICITATION REQUESTS.
Qualification Requirements:  Due to the complexity and criticality of this part, only actual manufactures that have successfully completed all testing required by the original company responsible for the design, or manufacturers that have successfully completed all testing on items determined by the government to be similar in complexity and criticality and can be considered approved sources for this item.  
Authority: 10 U.S.C. 2304(C)(1), Justification: Supplies (or Services) required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source(s) and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The proposed contract action is for supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one, or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. A Determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.
Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer.
It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement make contact with the firm listed.
Electronic procedures will be used for this solicitation. Hardcopies of the solicitation will not be sent from this office. The solicitation will be available for download only at www.fbo.gov.

<DESC>The goal of the Phoenix program is to develop and demonstrate technologies to harvest and re-use valuable components from retired, cooperative, non-operating satellites in or near GEO and, using those components, demonstrate the ability to create new space systems at greatly reduced cost. Phoenix seeks to demonstrate around the-clock, globally persistent communication capability for warfighters more economically by robotically removing and re-using GEO-based space apertures and antennas from de-commissioned satellites in the graveyard or disposal orbit.<br /><br /><br />This DARPA-BAA-13-12 is associated with previously posted DARPA-SN-13-16 Phoenix Proposers' Day Announcement, available through the following link:<br /><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Calibri', 'sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 11pt; mso-ascii-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-hansi-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-bidi; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA"><a href="https://www.fbo.gov/spg/ODA/DARPA/CMO/DARPA-SN-13-16/listing.html">https://www.fbo.gov/spg/ODA/DARPA/CMO/DARPA-SN-13-16/listing.html</a></span>

However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.

Drawings/specifications will be available through the DIBBS solicitation link in the synopsis on the solicitation issue date. The proposed contract is restricted to domestic sources under the authority of FAR 6.302-3. Accordingly, foreign sources, except Canadian sources, are not eligible for award. The solicitation document contains information that has been designated as "Militarily Critical Technical Data." Only businesses that have been certified by the Department of Defense, United States/Canada Joint Certification Office, and have a valid requirement may have a copy of the solicitation document. All requests for copies of the solicitation document must include a certified copy of DD Form 2345, Militarily Critical Technical Data Agreement. To obtain certification, contact: Commander, Defense Logistics Information Service (DLIS), ATTN: U.S./Canada Joint Certification Office, 74 Washington Avenue North, Battle Creek, MI 49017-3084 or call the DLIS at (800)-352-3572.

<p dir="ltr" align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">The Contracting Officer may utilize on-line Reverse Auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation. During the course of the on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307.</p>

<DESC>The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) contemplates awarding one (1) Labor-Hour contract for one base year and four option years. This will be a competitive procurement set-aside for Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses (SDVOSBs) under NAICS Code 541611 (Size Standard: $14 million). This acquisition is subject to the availability of funds.
<p>The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) requires the professional services of one full-time individual or two part-time individuals who have the appropriate knowledge, skills, and experience to continue the operation of the Center for Substance Abuse Prevention (CSAP) Workplace Helpline for a contract period of one year with four optional years. The one full-time individual or two part-time individuals will work a maximum total of 40 hours per week. It is estimated that an average of 8 to 10 inquiries are received per day. The Helpline individuals will normally operate the Helpline Monday through Friday (except for Federal holidays).</p>
<p>In 1986, Presidential Executive Order 12564 required that each Federal Executive branch agency develop and implement programs to address drug abuse in their workplaces with a comprehensive program that would include a written policy, access to employee assistance program services, employee education, supervisor training, and drug testing. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) was required to oversee the development of the Federal-wide program and help agencies with implementation efforts. In addition, HHS was required to establish and operate a toll-free telephone service for business and industry that would answer questions about drug abuse in the workplace. The toll-free telephone service, which is the subject of this requirement was initiated in 1987 and has continued uninterrupted since. Under the Reorganization of the Alcohol, Drug Abuse and Mental Health Administration on October 1, 1992, the administrative responsibility for managing this telephone consulting service was transferred to the CSAP/SAMHSA. In light of CSAP's prevention mission, the Workplace Helpline began to consult on alcohol issues and problems as well as drugs of abuse. Additionally, the Workplace Helpline expanded its scope of coverage to include any community-based program whose mission is to reduce or eliminate the problems of alcohol and drugs of abuse in its community workplace.</p>
<p>The Workplace Helpline responds to a critical need on the part of its largest constituent-small businesses. As has been the case since its inception, the Workplace Helpline receives most of its requests for assistance from small business owners (i.e., employee populations of 250 or less) who represent the vast majority of enterprise in the American economy. Small businesses also represents the segment least informed and least involved in addressing workplace alcohol and drug abuse problems. The Workplace Helpline also answers a significant number of calls by individuals inquiring about workplace drug testing and substance abuse prevention and treatment issues regarding prescription drugs, illicit drugs, and alcohol use. The service is available to all 50 States and territories of the United States and has assisted employers from other countries.</p>
<p>The estimated date for issuance of the RFP is March 19, 2013 with proposal responses due April 19, 2013. The solicitation may be obtained in any of three ways: by mail; picked up in person at 1 Choke Cherry Road, Room 7-1067, Rockville, MD 20857; or FedBizOpps. If you have a continuing interest in the RFP, notify the individuals identified below that you wish copies of amendments to the RFP (if any) sent to you. Requests for copies of the RFP must be made in writing.

<DESC>This acquisition is proceeding as a <strong>Small Business Set-Aside</strong>, <strong>Invitation for Bids (IFB)</strong>.
<p>This Procurement will be conducted under FSC CODE: Z1KF, SIC CODE: 1629,<strong> NAICS Code: 237990</strong>. The size standard for this code is $33,500,000. All questions should be directed to the Contracting Specialist, Rede Shifferaw, at (415) 503-6554, FAX: No.: (415) 503-6554, e-mail rede.shifferaw@usace.army.mil .</p>
<p><br /><strong>Estimated Cost Range is between $5,000,000 and $10,000,000.</strong></p>
<p><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>JOB DESCRIPTION:</strong></span></p>
<p>The work described consists of all tasks to complete the Wetland Restoration Project (HWRP) located in Novato, California and represents the culmination of over ten years of effort. Included is final shaping of the South Seasonal Wetlands and Tidal Panne Area, and deconstruction of temporary earthen structures, and the dredging of a channel in the Tidal Wetland Area. Also included in the contract are three optional components: one to construct the Bay Trail along the site, the second to dredge the pilot channel from the bay to the project, and the third option to breach and degrade the bayfront levee and to remove remaining access infrastructure.</p>
<p><strong>Seasonal Wetlands Shaping Component:</strong></p>
<p>This component consists of upland earthwork to shape and complete the south seasonal wetlands (SSW) and Tidal Panne areas. The total work (roughly 300,000 CY) includes both excavation and placement of previously dredged material within approximately 75 acre (SSW) and 10 acre (Tidal Panne) work areas (all cut and fills are internal to the areas of construction). The completed work will create a mosaic of shallow ponds to provide for seasonal and tidal habitats after the site is breached and tidal waters are introduced.</p>
<p><br /><strong>Tidal Wetland Component:</strong></p>
<p>This is a multi-tasked component that prepares the Tidal Area of the site for Breach. It includes deconstruction of 2 pump-house facilities, and the removal of a 30" pipe and its bedding that was previously used in bringing the dredged material to the site. Also included is the removal of temporary earthen connector berms which had separated the overall Tidal Area into separate cells during previous filling operations (approximately 45,000 cu yds of excavation), and the digging out of the channel near the breach internal to the site (approximately 50,000 cu yds of excavation). The area for the internal channel cut may be drained and dried in order to facilitate the work, but the breaching of the connector berms will need to be executed in wet conditions. All cuts for this component will be used in adjacent fill areas within the Tidal Area.</p>
<p><br /><strong>Bay Trail Option:</strong></p>
<p>This option is for constructing public access improvements including multi-use trails, ramps, and the South Levee viewing platform. The work entails final fine-grading and compaction followed by application of a gravel sub-base and then a decomposed granite surfacing for the multi-use Bay Trail alignment that runs all along the inner edge of the site. The subbase will be 16' wide and the trail surface will be 12' wide. Total trail length is approximately 14,300 ft. Fencing and signage support features are also included.</p>
<p><strong>Channel Dredging Component Option:</strong></p>
<p>A pilot Channel is to be excavated from San Pablo Bay through the mudflat to the location in front of the breach location at the bayfront levee. The upper layers of this removed material are part of the base contract and must be transported to the adjacent property and stockpiled; the lower portions are presented as an option and will be beneficially reused within the Tidal area of the site. This dredging excavation is approximately 30,000 cu yds.</p>
<p><br /><strong>Breach/Access Deconstruction Option:</strong></p>
<p>This option includes the final breaching of the bayfront levee (excavation of approximately 30,000 cu yds) and the partial degradation along the rest of the bayfront levee (approximately 30,000 cu yds) to allow tidal waters to enter the site. A portion of the excavated material unsuitable for wetland reuse will be stockpiled on property adjacent to the site. Also included in this option is the removal of the temporary bayfront culvert system in the bayfront levee, and final degradation grading of all road access infrastructure that was left in place in order to provide final-phase construction access throughout the site.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><br /><strong>The solicitation will be available on/about 22 March 2013, for Viewing/downloading documents.</strong></p>
<p><strong>All BIDS will be due on/about 22 April 2013/1:00 pm PDT. The specific date and time will be identified in the solicitation.</strong></p>
<p>BIDDERS ARE ADVISED THAT THIS PROJECT MAY BE DELAYED, CANCELED OR REVISED AT ANY TIME DURING THE SOLICITATION, SELECTION, EVALUATION, NEGOTIATION AND/OR FINAL AWARD PROCESS.</p>
<p><strong>ORDERING SOLICITATION:</strong> Plans and specifications will NOT be provided in hard paper copy or CD-ROM format. The solicitation and all amendments for this acquisition will be posted on a secure Government website known as FedBizOpps (www.fbo.gov) once the IFB is issued. Viewing/downloading documents from FedBizOpps will require prior registration in <strong>System for Award Management (SAM)</strong> (www.sam.gov).

<DESC><br />Solicitation Number: <br />FA8634-13-R-2652<br />Notice Type: <br />Sources Sought <br />Synopsis:
<p>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS. THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. REQUESTS FOR A SOLICITATION WILL NOT RECEIVE A RESPONSE.</p>
<p>This Sources Sought Synopsis is issued solely for market research and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation nor is this notice a request for quotation or proposal. The purpose is to improve the Government's understanding of the current marketplace and to identify capable sources which can provide the requirements associated with the following program. The F-15 System Program Office contemplates a single-award Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract for USAF and FMS customers with additional purchase contracts for acquisition and sustainment requirements of the F-15 weapon system. The contract will be used by AFLCMC/WW, and is intended to cover those types of supplies/services which have historically been acquired sole source from the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), and future requirements for which the Government would solicit and negotiate on a sole source basis as authorized by FAR Part 6. This is not bundling of efforts that might otherwise be acquired from a source or sources other than the OEM. Potential delivery orders under this IDIQ may include activities such as design, integration, test and production of future modifications and enhancements to the F-15 weapon system as well as product support to include, but not limited to field and depot level support, sustaining engineering, software support, data rights, technical data, aircrew and maintenance trainers, initial spares, provisioning and support equipment. Orders under this IDIQ will be primarily supply type contracts with incidental services. A large portion of the orders will be for upgrades/acquisitions, with smaller portions of repair and maintenance type orders. The following are discriminating requirements for the purpose of determining whether a company has the capability and previous experience necessary to perform this effort. Interested parties must have access to all below items:</p>
<p>a) F-15 weapon system and subsystem-engineering drawings, <br />b) F-15 depot technical data, <br />c) Manufacturing equipment/machines, <br />d) Test equipment, <br />e) Calibration equipment, <br />f) Clean rooms and environmentally controlled facilities<br />g) Facilities capable of controlling classified programs</p>
<p>The US Government is unable to provide the above listed proprietary data, equipment, or facilities listed above. The estimated ceiling amount for the program is $5B based on a 5-year period of performance with one follow-on five year option. Contract efforts are subject to FAR 52.232-18 availability of funds. Anticipated award date is estimated to be approximately December 2014 for the basic contract and the initial delivery order. This publication is intended to elicit responses from sources with the knowledge, skills, data, equipment, proper facilities and the capacity to meet the Air Force's requirements.</p>
<p>The source must be able to perform (as a minimum) all the following tasks; provide contractor evaluation and repair/upgrade in accordance with approved technical data procedures on all F-15 weapon system items and ground support equipment; identify, evaluate and recommend solution for F-15 weapon system supportability anomalies; design, test and integrate hardware modifications with the aircraft and other equipment and/or software; design, code, and test software changes to the F-15 aircraft weapon system and ground support systems; identify and evaluate impacts to the AF mission planning systems; develop, deliver, and maintain F-15 system related technical data. This effort will include administrative support, interface with flight test organizations, and manufacture of hardware, firmware, and compliance with Air Force retrofit processes.</p>
<p>The Air Force cannot project the precise F-15 weapon system acquisition and sustainment requirements to be acquired. Some past, current and projected upgrades/acquisitions include (but are not limited to) digital video recorder; Panoramic Helmet NVG compatibility; computerized fault reporting system; AF mission support system; advanced targeting pod; PLV processor replacement; radar warning receiver upgrade; GPS/EGI integration; advanced Smart Weapon integration; continued OFP support; continuing flight test support; TISS technology insertion; aircrew/maintenance trainer upgrade and support; secondary power system upgrade; beyond line of sight communications; joint mission planning system integration; identification friend/foe upgrade; JHMCS integration; advance display core processor; IRST upgrade; SATCOM; digital HUD upgrade; ADDL upgrade; Dual Digital CAS; MCCP; ALHTK; special studies/white papers.</p>
<p>The F-15 Systems Office is continually surveying the market to identify sources able to perform all previously mentioned requirements. Qualified sources must have the knowledge and capability to perform all stated requirements starting approximately December 2014. Interested sources must submit the following information for Air Force assessment:</p>
<p>a) Description of existing F-15 weapon system experience relative to acquisition and sustainment support activities to include an outline of previous work performed;</p>
<p>b) Description of capability to design, develop, integrate, fabricate, test, install, and support modifications and enhancements to F-15 weapons systems; including the contractor's capability to provide classified (up to the SECRET clearance level) and unclassified hardware and documentation storage/handling;</p>
<p>c) Qualifications of lead management and engineering personnel projected to work on this contract (to include education, background, accomplishments, and other pertinent information relevant to the task outlined above);</p>
<p>d) Efficient organizational structure, with emphasis on how this program fits into the overall company's weapon system integration and sustainment process;</p>
<p>e) Information on existing laboratory, test and production facilities needed to accomplish these requirements, including TEMPEST facilities needed to develop and test hardware and software;</p>
<p>f) Information on deficient capabilities to include but not limited to the above listed capabilities and the proposed fix to those deficiencies.</p>
<p>g) Firms responding to this announcement should indicate whether they are a large business, small business, small disadvantaged business (SDB), woman-owned small business (WOSB), economically disadvantaged women-owned small business (EDWOSB), 8(a)-certified business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business (SDVOSB), veteran-owned small business (VOSB), or Historically Underutilized Business Zone small business (HUBZone). The National American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this action is 336413, size standard 1,000 employees; please indicate number of employees relative to the size standard of 1,000. All prospective contractors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database to be awarded a DoD contract.</p>
<p>h) Contact information to include: name of company, CAGE code, address, company point of contact, phone number, and email address;</p>
<p>Respondents should also state whether they are interested in being a prime contractor for this requirement or a subcontractor.</p>
<p>NOTE: Submissions are limited to 100 pages 8.5 x 11-inch pages with no smaller than 12-point font. Only affirmative responses to this notice will be assessed to the extent necessary for the Government to determine the technical capability of F-15 integration.</p>
<p>The capabilities package should be brief and concise, yet clearly demonstrate an ability to meet the stated requirements. Recent, relevant experience in all areas should be provided. Teaming and/or subcontracting arrangements should be clearly delineated and previous experience in teaming must be provided.</p>
<p>Acquisition strategy has not yet been determined; market research results will assist the USAF in determining whether this requirement will be a full and open, small business set-aside, or sole source acquisition.</p>
<p>Note that, if there is sufficient demonstrated interest and capability among small business contractors, a key factor in determining if an acquisition will be a Small Business Set-Aside is that two or more potential small business prime contractors must be capable of performing at least 50% of the effort, as defined in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting. The clause reads, in part, as follows: "Limitations on Subcontracting (Dec 1996) ... (b) By submission of an offer and execution of a contract, the Offeror/Contractor agrees that in performance of the contract in the case of a contract for - (1) Services (except construction). At least 50 percent of the cost of contract Performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the concern. (2) Supplies (other than procurement from a non-manufacturer of such supplies). The concern shall perform work for at least 50 percent of the cost of manufacturing the supplies, not including the cost of materials ..." Provide specific details and rationale as to how compliance with FAR clause 52.219-14 would be achieved, including specific details regarding teaming arrangements, etc. If subcontracts are to be used, provide anticipated percentage of effort to be subcontracted and whether small or large businesses will be used. Teaming and/or subcontracting arrangements should be clearly delineated and previous experience in teaming must be provided.</p>
<p>Note that, if this effort is not set-aside for small business, small business utilization will be considered. Request that large and small businesses provide a reasonable expectation for small business utilization as a percent of total contract value. Please provide supporting rationale for the recommended percentage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All submissions are requested to be made electronically by 4 pm EST on 5 April 2013 and sent to the F-15 Program Office, Attn: david.earl@wpafb.af.mil. Submissions must not exceed 4 MB.</p>
<p><br />Any information submitted by respondents to this synopsis is strictly voluntary. This synopsis is for information and planning purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government reimburse the respondents for any costs associated with their responses. This synopsis does not constitute a Request for Proposals (RFP), or an Invitation for Bids (IFB), nor does its issuance restrict the Government as to its ultimate acquisition approach.

<p>Guidelines<br />Guidelines consist of the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR), the Department of State Acquisition Regulations, the CO's letter of delegation of authority appointing the COR or GTM, the terms and conditions of the contracts, and official INL bureau guidelines. In addition, the incumbent must be able to determine application of basic administrative policy statements concerning the issue or problem being studied, which may include reference to pertinent legislative history, related court decisions, state and local laws, or policy initiatives of agency management. The incumbent must also consider and adhere to various other existing federal regulations, and the interaction between DOS policies, legislation, the Foreign Assistance Act, and other authorization and appropriations in the INL account, applicable National Security and Presidential Decision Directives, OMB Circulars, the Foreign Affairs Handbook (FAH), the Foreign Affairs Manual (FAM) and DOS financial operating procedures and policies.</p>
<p>Complexity<br />The programs implemented by INL are generally highly complex multi-year development and capacity-building programs. The programs often require the ability to resolve critical problems and achieve difficult goals that may impact on other programs.</p>
<p>Programs are also characterized by large obligations of USG funds, a potentially high-risk security environment, a geographically broad operating platform, demanding program schedules, frequently-changing requirements, politically sensitive outcomes, multiple interagency and international actors, multiple contractor and sub-contractor relationships, and intense audit/oversight scrutiny. Detailed plans, goals, objectives and evaluation criteria are required for the long-range implementation and administration of the programs. Decisions concerning planning and organizing the programs are complicated by the intricacy of the contracts and the need to deal with multilayered concepts. Problems can arise that require intuition - the ability to tell when something is wrong or is likely to go wrong; inductive reasoning - the ability to combine pieces of information to form general rules or conclusions (includes finding a relationship among seemingly unrelated events); and deductive reasoning - the ability to apply general rules to specific problems to produce answers that make sense.</p>
<p>Physical Demands<br />The work requires the ability to travel to and from several remote areas. The work requires an above average resistance to fatigue and physical hardships. Successful completion of a State Department Class 1 unrestricted medical exam is required. Extended assignments to remote program sites will be required, necessitating the ability to walk medium to longer distances (hundreds of yards or more) on generally irregular dirt or stone surfaces, in both hilly and flat terrain. Additionally, those undergoing medical treatment or taking certain medicines that limit their physical or mental abilities may find it difficult to adhere to the limitations recommended by their physician(s). Travel on helicopters and/or cargo-oriented fixed wing aircraft may also be required. Those with ear or other problems, who do not easily adapt to pressurized environments or higher but non-pressurized environments, will find the travel requirements of these positions difficult. Climate conditions are also a factor. Work is often done in extremes of cold and heat, in dusty and windy environments, and frequently outdoors. Those with circulation problems or difficulties adapting to climate extremes or extremely dusty environments will find this aspect of the work difficult and may not be capable of passing the State Department required medical exam.</p>
<p>III. POSITION ELEMENTS<br />Supervisory Controls: The COR carries out duties on behalf of the CO, but reports to the INL Director at Post. The GTM is delegated authority by the CO to assist the COR. The incumbent's actions, decisions and recommendations are reviewed on the basis of demonstrated professional judgment, results achieved and conformance with appropriate laws and regulations.</p>
<p>The period of performance will be one year from the date of award with four option years.</p>
<p>Level of Effort: Hours for this full-time position will be the core hours of U.S. Embassy Kabul: 8:30am to 5:30pm Sunday through Thursday with a minimum of fifty-five hours per week.</p>
<p>Travel and Position Location: The position is located within Regional Commands throughout Afghanistan. Frequent travel in and around the assigned province is likely. All movements within Afghanistan will be covered by the U.S. military and/or INL air wing and motor pool assets, and all travel outside of Afghanistan will be covered by commercial airlines.</p>
<p>Pre-deployment support for the Afghanistan-based Advisor: The advisor will be required to attend four (4) weeks of basic familiarization training at the Foreign Service Institute in Washington D.C. prior to deployment.</p>
<p>Life Support: Life support for the Advisor will be provided by other USG service providers and is not to be included in this task order proposal. INL/INL Kabul will provide the incumbent with access to the Embassy compound. The incumbent will have access to hardened and/or regular cars (exact type will be dependent on the security situation) from motor pool for transportation. Housing will be assigned through the Embassy's PRT Office in coordination with INL and the PRT Commander.</p>
<p>IV. EVALUATION CRITERIA<br />* Meets minimum requirements for COR ______ YES ______NO<br />* Meets minimum requirements for GTM ______ YES ______ NO</p>

<DESC>Synopsis: <br />This is a Request for Information (RFI) issued for planning purposes, as defined in FAR 15.201(e). This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The Department of Defense (DoD) is not seeking proposals at this time and will not accept unsolicited proposals. This notice is open to all sources.
<p>Background and Mission: <br />The Joint Project Manager Transformational Medical Technologies (JPM-TMT) focuses on the advanced development of adaptable platform technologies and broad-spectrum medical countermeasures (MCMs) to counter emerging, genetically engineered, or unknown threats. JPM-TMT's Countermeasures for Multi-Drug Resistance-Bacterial (CMDR-B) program develops therapeutics for Biological Warfare Agents (BWAs) that cannot be mitigated by existing MCMs.</p>
<p>To ensure Warfighter capability-in the face of the continuing emergence of multi-drug resistant bacteria and advancements in biotechnology that enable development of genetically engineered, drug resistant bacteria-there is a need to identify new chemical classes of antibacterial compounds and new bacterial targets. Accordingly, the goal of the CMDR-B program is to develop long-term, broad-spectrum therapeutic solutions to defeat antibiotic resistant BWAs.</p>
<p>Purpose and Objectives: <br />The CMDR-B program is considering development of a therapeutic for antibacterial resistance mitigation with potential solutions including development of combinations of existing FDA-approved therapeutics that act synergistically to overcome antibacterial resistance; development of adjunctive molecules which interfere with antibiotic resistance mechanisms; and development of novel therapeutics (i.e., novel chemical entities) for which there is no known bacterial resistance.</p>
<p>Interested parties should fully describe their medical countermeasure (therapeutic) and provide all available information with respect to criteria A-M below. If an MCM candidate meets only some of the criteria, a portion of a criterion, or otherwise has capabilities not specifically called out by the criteria, JPM-TMT still strongly encourages a response to this RFI so that a more complete understanding of the state-of-the-art may be obtained. MCMs developed by the commercial sector, academia, the United States Government, and international entities are acceptable.</p>
<p><br />A. Antimicrobial MCMs that either directly or indirectly prevent or treat disease caused by pathogenic bacteria (either gram positive or gram negative). MCMs should be either FDA-approved or currently in development and could include novel combinations of FDA-approved drugs. For this purpose, drugs can be defined as: <br />&bull; two or more antibiotics<br />&bull; an antibiotic with a molecule that augments the activity of the antibiotic<br />&bull; a novel single molecule. <br />The chemical entity for the MCM should be identified as well as its relationship to existing FDA-approved drugs, if applicable (e.g., fluoroquinolone, 4th generation cephalosporin). Only those MCMs at Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 3 or higher are to be included (see below for MCM TRL definitions). Accordingly, using the MCM TRL definitions provided below, specify the maturity of the MCM and discuss the TRL steps that have been completed.</p>
<p>B. MCM in vivo activity against all bacterial species for which data is available, and provide a brief summary of the approach of the analysis.</p>
<p>C. MCM activity (in vitro and/or in vivo) against one or more of the following biothreat agents:<br />a. Bacillus anthracis<br />b. Yersinia pestis<br />c. Brucella spp.<br />d. Burkholderia mallei<br />e. Francisella tularensis<br />f. Burkholderia pseudomallei</p>
<p>D. MCM effectiveness in disease models for septicemia and/or inhalation (in vitro and/or in vivo) with endpoint used in the study for efficacy identified (e.g., increased survival rate and/or ability to stop/minimize/reverse the progression of signs and symptoms of infection, as compared with controls).</p>
<p>E. MCM mechanism of action:<br />a. Host immune modulation or disruption of bacterial immune evasion mechanisms. <br />b. Disruption of bacterial life cycle.<br />c. Disruption of common pathways of bacterial pathogenesis (through bacterial or host targets).<br />d. Mitigation of resistance to current therapeutic options.</p>
<p>F. MCM utility as a post&#8208;exposure prophylactic, or post&#8208;symptomatic treatment, with reported therapeutic window. Drugs with an intended pretreatment indication may be reported, but MUST also show in vivo efficacy as a post-exposure prophylactic or post-symptomatic treatment.</p>
<p>G. MCM potential utility against multi-drug resistant bacteria.</p>
<p>H. For adjunctive molecules, MCM ability and mode of action to abrogate a specific mechanism of antibiotic resistance.</p>
<p>I. Novelty of the compound class and any known mechanisms conferring resistance to the compound.</p>
<p>J. Novelty of the therapeutic target and any known mechanisms conferring resistance to the compound.</p>
<p>K. Route of administration.</p>
<p>L. Suitability as a platform technology adaptable to other MCM discovery applications (e.g., a chemical scaffold that is rapidly adaptable to multiple pathogenic threats and which could be tailored to generate a therapeutic solution for a new pathogenic threat once that threat has been characterized).</p>
<p>M. Any associated intellectual property rights or patent coverage.</p>
<p><br />Response Requirements: <br />Sources having a potential therapeutic solution in line with the CMDR-B program objectives are invited to respond to this RFI. Responses shall be limited to five (5) pages, including diagrams but not including the cover page, the cover letter (not to exceed one (1) page) and the table of contents. Responses shall be organized to provide concise information to respond directly to the points given in the A-M criteria (as listed above) in the order shown. Respondents may include additional information, such as supporting test reports or pertinent journal articles as desired. However, the five-page response shall stand-alone from the additional information, and shall describe the technology without reference to the additional information. The additional information, if any, shall be separately labeled from the response, and removable from the five- page response without any loss of understanding to the five-page response.</p>
<p>Any and all information submitted in response to this notice is strictly voluntary and in no way obligates the Government or otherwise to make a contract award.

<DESC>MARKET RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY<br />NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL OR SOLICITATION
<p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), is conducting market research to support the Center for Biologics Research and Evaluation (CBER) requirement for a Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Time of Flight (MALDI-TOF) Mass Spectrometer (MS) System.</p>
<p>This sources sought notice is being issued to determine if small business manufacturers or small businesses capable of supplying a U.S. made product that satisfies our requirement of another small business manufacturer exist. The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 334516 - Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing; Small Business Size Standard is 500 employees.</p>
<p>Background: <br />The FDA's Facility for Biotechnology Resources (FBR) within the Center for Biologics and Evaluation Research (CBER) requires an MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometer System with a post warranty preventive maintenance plan, to facilitate the accurate determination of the molecular masses of synthesized ologonucleotides and peptides.</p>
<p>The FBR within CBER provides an array of services, including the synthesis of oligonucleotides and peptides for scientists at CBER and the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER). These oligonucleotides and peptides are utilized to carry out research ranging from gene amplification, DNA sequencing, studies of protein-protein interactions, and vaccine development. The syntheses of oligonucleotides and peptides in the facility are under very stringent quality control (QC). One of the QC methods is the determination of a product molecular weight which provides an important assessment regarding whether the synthesis process works as expected and whether the product is as expected.</p>

<DESC>NASAs Commercial Crew Program anticipates holding a public forum (Industry Touch Point) and One-on-One sessions with interested parties on April 8, 2013 in Colorado Springs, Colorado.  The purpose of this forum is to convey additional details and further develop NASAs Phase 2 acquisition strategy for the Commercial Crew Program Certification. NASA expects to provide additional information on NASAs evolving acquisition strategy and obtain industry input to enable NASA to refine and mature the phase 2 acquisition strategy. NASA would also like to further discuss industrys input obtained from RFI responses (ref. RFI No. NNK13ZOP001L). NASA expects to conduct a morning briefing open to the public and hold 1-hour long One-on-One sessions.  The participation in the One-on-One sessions may be constrained by time and venue capacity. NASA anticipates that potential prime contractors for the Phase 2 acquisition are the most suitable to participate in One-on-Ones. Details concerning the Industry Touch Point agenda/discussion topics, venue, and registration information for the briefing and the One-on-One sessions will be posted by mid-March, 2013.

<p style="text-align: left;">2. Northwestern University (NWU)</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">3. Vanderbilt University</p>
<p>The purpose of these awards is to allow UAMS, NWU and Vanderbilt to continue the implementation, configuration, training, support, data migration, quality assurance and data submission services for their Information Management Systems (IMS). The UAMS, NWU and Vanderbilt IMS are the Clinical Research Information System(CRIS), the Navigator System and Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) system, respectively.</p>
<p>The contracts will be awarded under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(l), FAR Subpart 6.302-l(a)(2) - Only One Responsible Source and HHSFAR 306.302-l(a)2)(iv). These contractors are currently providing their IMS and related services to several NCS Vanguard Study Centers as well as a Regional Operations Center data collection contractor. The award of a new contract will allow the NCS the opportunity to complete the data and operation migrations currently underway and also to complete the comprehensive evaluation of the feasibility, acceptability and cost of these Information Management Systems.</p>
<p>The IMS will continue to adhere to the informatics principles of the NCS including: modular, interoperable, non-proprietary architecture, and inclusive of international data acquisition and transmission standards. Due to the required continuation of operations to ensure human subjects protections, quality data submissions, compliance with NCS study visit schedules, and inherent duplication of costs, the Government has determined that competition of this contract and related services is not feasible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;This notice of intent is not a request for proposal. However, if responsible sources believe that they can perform the above request, they are encouraged to respond by submitting three (3) copies of their capability statements for consideration by the NICHD to Usha Raman, Contract Specialist, NICHD Office of Acquisitions, Contract Management Branch, 6100 Executive Blvd., Room 8B13B, MSC 7510, Bethesda, MD 20892-7510. Phone number, (301) 443-5228; email: ramanu2@mail.nih.gov</p>
<p>All responses must be received in writing by Monday, March 18th, 2013 by 4 PM EST and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the NICHD Contracting Office and the NCS Program Office to make a determination that the party can or cannot perform this requirement. The capability statement will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requ&igrave;rement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>

No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect cost or charges by the Government will arise as a result of the submission of information. All information considered proprietary shall be marked accordingly. The Government shall not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for any improperly identified proprietary information. Properly identified proprietary information will be safeguarded in accordance with government regulations. The purpose of this announcement is solely to gather information from the market place and any responses received will not be considered an offer by the responding party and cannot be returned. No telephone inquiries will be accepted and requests for solicitation packages will not granted, as no solicitation has been prepared at this time.
<p><br />Synopsis: Sources Sought <br />This is a Sources Sought notice intended for small businesses only. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service (NESDIS) of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is conducting market research for the purposes of identifying small businesses who have demonstrated capabilities in the area of engineering. No solicitation of offers is made by this synopsis.</p>
<p>Background:<br />The U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC)/National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)/National Environmental Satellite, Data and Information Service (NESDIS) operates all of the United States operational environmental satellites from the NOAA Satellite Operations Facility (NSOF) in Suitland, MD: Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES), Polar Operational Environmental Satellites (POES), the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (SNPP) satellite, and Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP). NESDIS also supports the Landsat Data Continuity Mission (LDCM) satellite and through international agreement the European Organization for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT)'s Meteorological Operational (METOP) Satellite and Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales's (CNES) Jason-2 Ocean Surface Topography Mission (OSTM). The data gathered from these satellites allow our country's environmental and emergency agencies to monitor and forecast hurricanes and other severe storms, monitor oceans, monitor global climate change, verify ozone depletion and land surface change, monitor critical space environmental parameters, and support search rescue efforts across the globe. NESDIS is also preparing to support such missions as Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR) mission which is scheduled to launch in early 2014; Jason-3 scheduled for launch in early 2015 and the Joint Polar Satellite Systems Satellites (JPSS) scheduled to launch in 2016 as well as the GOES-R satellite system scheduled to launch in 2015.</p>
<p>NESDIS also operates the Search and Rescue Satellite Aided Tracking (SARSAT) Mission Control Center for the United States and its supporting ground system equipment to relay search and rescue data to emergency response agencies. The SARSAT program is an operational program managed within NOAA that utilizes NOAA's operational weather satellites to detect and locate distress signals in the United States and around the World. NESDIS operates and maintains the operational ground system for the SARSAT program which has assets in Guam, Hawaii, California, Florida, and the NOAA Satellite Operations Facility in Suitland, Maryland.</p>

The Department of Veterans Affairs National Energy Business Center (VA-NEBC) Program Contracting Activity Central (PCAC) is seeking interested sources (contractors) for a near-future solicitation and procurement.

In order to complete the Feasibility Study we are now seeking potential sources for hydro-geologic investigations which will be used to characterize subsurface conditions, particularly regarding the stratigraphy, geometry, transmissivity, well yields, hydraulic gradient and water chemistry within the aquifers at the respective sites.

To meet these objectives the hydro-geologic investigations will involve the following activities: 

"	project planning, including health and safety planning, underground utility identification and avoidance, well water management planning and procurement of applicable permits and approvals;
"	drilling borings to characterize aquifer thickness and stratigraphy;
"	installing observation wells in the borings to allow measurement of groundwater elevation, temperature and collection of groundwater samples prior to ATES design and to serve as future monitoring points after ATES implementation; 
"	installing test production wells that will be used for pumping tests from which aquifer hydraulic properties will be estimated; 
"	surveying and gauging of all wells to facilitate preparation of groundwater contour maps from which hydraulic gradient, an important parameter in ATES feasibility evaluation, will be calculated;
"	performing slug tests and pumping tests from which aquifer hydraulic properties will be calculated;
"	collecting and analyzing groundwater samples for geochemical ATES evaluation; 
"	performing a camera survey and collecting representative groundwater samples from the two existing production wells in Chillicothe to evaluate their potential for re-use as ATES warm wells; 
"	performing site restoration activities upon completion of the work; and 
"	preparing a report to include the as built data of the observation and test production wells as well as the results of the measurements and calculations, and recommended sustainable ATES design flow rates.

The contractor shall furnish all materials and labor to fulfill the above objectives.

The Government reserves the right to consider a small business, SDVOSB, VOSB or 8(a) set-aside based on responses hereto so it is in the interest of small businesses to respond to this notice if they feel that they are capable of meeting the requirements of this project.

<DESC>DARPA-SN-13-27, MILITARY IMAGING AND SURVEILLANCE TECHNOLOGY (MIST) TECHNICAL EXCHANGE AND PROPOSER'S DAY CONFERENCE
<p>DARPA will host a technical overview of the MIST program on March 15, 2013. The review will be in conjunction with a Proposer's Day Conference in support of DARPA-BAA-13-27, Military Imaging and Surveillance Technology - Long Range (MIST-LR), Phase 2 Program. The meeting will be held at the DARPA Conference Center, 675 North Randolph Street, Arlington, VA 22203 from 8:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. The purpose of this conference is to provide information on the status and capabilities developed under the MIST program and promote additional discussion on this topic. The Proposer's Day Conference will provide necessary details from MIST-LR, Phase 1 and related efforts; address questions from potential MIST-LR proposers; and provide a forum for potential proposers to discuss their capabilities for teaming opportunities.</p>
<p>PROGRAM OBJECTIVE AND DESCRIPTION: <br />The Military Imaging and Surveillance Technology program is developing fundamentally new electro-optic sensing capabilities to be used on airborne and ground platforms for biometric and target identification applications. The MIST-LR element of the program focuses on long-range geometric and 3-D imaging technology that will allow for target characterization beyond the physical-aperture diffraction-limit of the receiver system. New sensing methods and techniques being developed are based on, but not limited to:</p>
<p>&bull; Computational imaging<br />&bull; Synthetic-aperture imaging<br />&bull; Digital holography<br />&bull; Multi-static laser radar</p>
<p>Current optical imaging systems can provide the capability to identify targets for specific applications or scenarios; however, these systems have significant limitations defined by their size and operational range. The physical aperture of the imaging receiver, the effects of atmospheric turbulence, performance of the receiver array, the power of the illumination source, and the image formation algorithms are the primary defining characteristics of active imaging systems. DARPA believes that to meet the final program objectives, it is necessary to implement the new sensing methods developed in MIST-LR to address all of these areas.</p>
<p>REGISTRATION INFORMATION: Participants must register NLT March 12, 2013, via an email to BAA-13-27@darpa.mil with subject line "MIST Conference Registration". There is no registration fee for attending this conference.</p>
<p>Due to space limitations of the conference facility, attendance will be limited to the first 150 registrants, and no more than 4 representatives per organization or company. When registering for the conference, please include the following information in the body of the email:</p>
<p>&bull; Full Name<br />&bull; Company Name<br />&bull; Company Mailing Address<br />&bull; Email <br />&bull; Phone<br />&bull; A brief statement that details the organization's expertise and experience in long-range imaging systems</p>
<p>A SECRET clearance will be required for this meeting and must be received by March 13, 2013. Please fax your clearance/visit request to DARPA at (703) 528-3655 or send it via email to: VCC@DARPA.mil. Via JPAS, the requesting FSO may send a visit request using the SMO Code: DDAAUS4.</p>
<p>Any security related questions and concerns should be directed to Nisha Lal, 703-526-2046, nisha.lal.ctr@darpa.mil.</p>
<p>The Proposer's Day does not constitute a formal solicitation for proposals or proposal abstracts. Attendance is voluntary and is not required to propose to any potential related Broad Agency Announcements or potential research solicitations on this topic. DARPA will not provide reimbursement for any costs incurred to participate in this Proposer's Day.</p>

<SUBJECT>--Award Notice - Department of Energy
<SOLNBR>DE-SOL-0005351
<CONTACT>Lisa  V. Persson

<a href="mailto:Lisa.Persson@hq.doe.gov">Lisa Persson</a>
<DESC>On February 3, 2013, the Department of Energy Office of Headquarters Procurement Services awarded a sole source contract in the amount of $450,000 to Nixon Peabody, LLP.  The contract number is DE-LP0000090.  The circumstances permitting other than full and open competition are prescribed in FAR 6.302-1, One Responsible Source, under the authority of the Competition in Contracting Act, 41 U.S.C 3304(a)(2).  This contract completes work that was already on-going.  A Notice of Intent for this action was publicized on November 21, 2012.
The contract provides a continuation of critical legal services for the Loan Programs Office (LPO) to advise LPO in connection with the Stephentown Spindle, LLC (Spindle) loan agreement in order to protect the Government?s investment of approximately $25 million in this domestic flywheel-based frequency regulation plant in order to minimize any loss and proactively take prudent and orderly steps to protect its investment in a cost-efficient manner.  Specifically, the services and expertise of legal advisor, Nixon Peabody LLP, are necessary to participate in negotiating, structuring, documenting, and closing any amendments, modifications and waivers to the existing loan, including in restructuring, defaults, insolvencies, and bankruptcy contexts, and providing related advice and representation in such contexts.  The estimated term of this contract is not to exceed 24 months at a total ceiling price of $450,000.  Nixon Peabody LLP is the incumbent contractor that represented DO E in the negotiation of the original loan guarantee agreement, as well as the Spindle loan agreement which resulted from the restructuring in the bankruptcy of the original borrower, Stephentown Regulation Services, LLC (?SRS?).  Nixon Peabody LLP possesses the necessary skills, staffing and expertise to assist LPO with no loss of time and added expense that would occur if a new firm were brought on to provide the services.  Nixon Peabody LLP is uniquely situated to provide these professional legal services to the LPO because it has previously provided transactional legal services to LPO for the original loan guarantee, as well as the promissory note (the Note) transaction with the Spindle project; and is therefore most proficient with the workings and particulars of the transaction documentation.  No other law firm would currently be capable of providing the services sought by the LPO at the necessary level of expertise, including detailed knowledge of existing contractual  arrangements.  The timing of this acquisition is such that award of this contract based on full and open competition is precluded because there is an immediate need for these specialized professional legal services, and only Nixon Peabody LLP, the incumbent contractor, has the capability to provide the services at the necessary level of expertise. The inherent delay in conducting a full and open competition for the specialized professional legal services could put at risk the Government?s ability to protect its interests, which are approximately $25 million.  Because Nixon Peabody LLP is uniquely qualified to provide these services, a full and open competition would not be in the government?s best interests.

<DESC>This notice is being published in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 5.101 requiring the dissemination of information for proposed contract actions. This is a notice of intent to award a sole-source contract and is not a request for competitive proposals.
<p>The United States Navy's Military Sealift Command (MSC) intends to issue a sole-source, firm-fixed-price contract to Supreme Integrated Technology, Inc. for fabrication of a spare davit winch for the life boat system on the M/V KELLIE CHOUEST. Supreme Integrated Technology, Inc. is the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) of this davit system. The specific design and performance factors are proprietary information retained by the OEM. Therefore, it has been determined that it is in the best interest of the Government to have the OEM fabricate the required spare winch, as using another Contractor would first require a determination of the winch design and specifications prior to fabrication, which will generate substantial duplication of effort and cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition. This procurement is being issued using the Simplified Acquisition Procedures, FAR Part 13. The authority for the sole source procurement is cited at FAR 13.106-1.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all responsible sources may submit a capability statement demonstrating the ability to provide the requested items or exception to the intent to purchase on a sole source basis, which shall be considered by the Government if received by Wednesday, March 6, 2013 at 5:00 p.m., local time, Washington D.C. Written responses to this synopsis shall contain sufficient documentation to establish a bonafide capability to fulfill the requirement. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. A determination not to compete this requirement, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government. MSC will not be responsible for any costs incurred by interested parties in responding to this notice. The Government is not obligated to and will not pay for any information received from potential sources as a result of this synopsis. Please email Lisa Bouchelle at lisa.bouchelle@navy.mil with responses or questions regarding this requirement. This notice will close on 6 March 2013 at 5:00 p.m., local time, Washington D.C.</p>

<DESC>The Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training and Instrumentation (PEO STRI) intends to re-compete the Systems Engineering and Technical Assistance (SETA) contract, W900KK-09-D-0006.  The existing contract is with Electronic Consulting Services Inc.  If you would like a copy of the existing contract, please provide a Freedom of Information Act request using the following link: http://www.peostri.army.mil/apps/FOIARequestForm.jsp.  The SETA requirement provides non-personal support services for program management, planning, design, development, engineering, implementation, logistics, evaluation, sustainment, operations and support, acquisition, and ancillary services to PEO STRI and other U.S. Government agencies worldwide.  The services include related activities in support of all aspects of responsive integrated and interoperable infrastructure for Simulation, Training, Testing, and Instrumentation Solutions and Acquisition Services for the Warfighters and the Nation.  The Government will use various market research techniques to identify capable sources and determine its acquisition strategy, which will include, but not limited to, issuance of a Sources Sought Notice (SSN), Industry Day, and one-one-one market research sessions.  The Government intends to issue a SSN in March 2013 which will contain a draft Performance Work Statement (PWS) and a request for information from companies wishing to be considered for the resulting contract.  For planning purposes, a formal Request for Proposal (RFP) is expected to be released in December 2013 or shortly thereafter.  As more information becomes available, you will be notified via updates on FedBizOpps.  The Government anticipates the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 541330, with a small business size standard of $35.5M, will be applicable for this acquisition.  PEO STRI anticipates this requirement will be 100 percent set-aside for small business.  However, a final decision will be based on the results of market research. This special notice is for information purposes only, does not constitute an Invitation for Bid (IFB) or RFP, and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government pay for proposal costs. Comments and questions regarding this notice should be submitted in writing, via e-mail, to Contracting Officer, Ms KeYanna Boone, at, keyanna.boone@us.army.mil or to Mr. Duane St. Peter, Contract Specialist, duane.stpeter@us.army.mil. The subject line for e-mail submission is SETA 2014 re-compete.

<a href="mailto:diane.thornewell@navy.mil">Contract Specialist</a>
<DESC>1.0 Purpose The purpose of this special notice is to gain knowledge of and help the Government understand vendor interest in participating in a series of Performance & Interoperability Quick-looks to include:  Soldier Radio Waveform (SRW) SIQ, Wideband Networking Waveform (WNW) WIQ, and Mobile Users Objective System (MUOS) MIQ.    Information gathered from this survey will assist the government in determining personnel resources and specific test schedules required to assist vendor in these Performance & Interoperability Quick-look events.  These quick-look events allow vendors from both government-funded and internal R&D-funded programs to test their products with the networking waveform reference standard and other network terminals.  This enables multiple procurement sources ensuring a mature marketplace for SRW, WNW and MUOS terminals.  2.0 Background The Joint Tactical Networking Center (JTNC) envisions supporting vendors interested in participating in the SIQ, WIQ and MIQs in order to evaluate and facilitate vendor participation in future key test events, including Network Integration Evaluation (NIE 14.1/14.2) and MUOS End-to-End test events.  The plan is to allow vendors the opportunity to test their platforms against the SRW, WNW, and MUOS reference Implementations in a multi-vendor radio network. Each event (SIQ, WIQ and MIQ) is planned to be conducted in two phases. Phase I will be performed in a laboratory environment which will establish the baseline reference implementation to compare to each vendors host radio platforms. Phase II may include an evaluation of interoperability in a multi-vendor radio network with Over-The-Air Testing (OTA).  The Phase I plan is to conduct test events starting with SRW in May 2013 in Aberdeen Proving Grounds (APG) in Aberdeen, MD, WNW in June 2013, which may be conducted entirely at either APG or SPAWAR Systems Center (SSC) Atlantic in Charleston, SC, or at both facilities, and MUOS in July 2013 at SSC Pacific in San Diego, CA.   The Government may conduct Phase II (Dates TBD) at various locations, to include, Fort Huachuca, AZ, Fort Dix, NJ and/or White Sands Missile Range (WSMR), NM. Phase II is intended to include an OTA multi-tier network architecture.  3.0 Entrance Criteria Vendors will be required to provide radio quantities, with ported waveform versions as follows:  SIQ: Five (5) required [seven (7) desired] radios; running SRW version 1.01.1C, 1.01.2, 1.1.1 or 1.1.1.1  WIQ: Five (5) required [seven (7) desired] radios; running WNW version 4.0.5.1 (or later)  MIQ: Two (2) radios; running MUOS version 3.1  Each interoperability Quick-look participant/vendor must provide all necessary ancillaries to operate the radio platforms, i.e., handsets, data interface cables, power cables for each variant.

<SUBJECT>76--Notice of Intent to Award Sole Sole Source Award - Boise, ID Imagery
<SOLNBR>G13PS00127
<CONTACT>Donald Shannon

<a href="mailto:dshannon@usgs.gov">dshannon@usgs.gov</a>
<DESC>The Department of the Interior, United States Geological Survey intends to award a sole source purchase order (under the provisions of FAR 13.106-1(b)), to the Community Planning Association (COMPASS) of Meridian, ID for imagery to be acquired by COMPASS as described below.
The USGS National Geospatial Program (NGP) has a cyclical need for high resolution leaf-off color orthoimagery in various locations nationwide to support of The National Map, natural resource management needs, coordinated emergency and disaster response needs, as well as additional needs of various other federal, state and local agencies.  Since the existing imagery for the Boise, ID area has become dated, more recent replacement imagery (which is suitable and commonly shared) has been identified as a need for the USGS as well as other federal, state, and local stakeholders. 
The Community Planning Association (COMPASS) is the designated coordinating body for the collection, sharing and dissemination of orthoimagery to state, county and city government for the greater Boise Idaho Metro area which covers two counties and six cities over a 2,000 square mile area.  COMPASS has previously completed multiple successful orthoimagery collections on a two to three year collection interval, and USGS has been a partner with COMPASS in many of those previous projects.  In this regard, the USGS has benefited from both the multiagency data sharing infrastructures developed, as well as associated cost savings resulting from the cost sharing approach.     
For the current cycle, the estimated/potential $50,000 planned USGS purchase order amounts to a contribution of approximately 22% of the estimated final cost of delivering this year's updated collection product.  The remaining costs (78%) of the data collection activity are to be absorbed by COMPASS and/or its partners.  The COMPASS partnership process involves a multiagency agreement on standards, specifications, and data sharing that ensures common data and standards use by all levels of government doing business in the Boise metro area. This eliminates discrepancies and errors that typically occur when multiple data sources are used by multiple agencies and translates to considerable cost savings.  Due to the joint/shared funding of this project by the parties involved, a sole source award to COMPASS for the completed data which results from their project is considered to be in the best interests of the government, as it yields a significant cost savings to the USGS (estimated 78% savings over the cost of a like effort funded solely by the agency).  A sole source award is planned under FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures; accordingly a competitive solicitation will not be published or released under this requirement.   Interested parties may submit a capabilities statement, together with information as to their immediate ability and willingness to contribute a significant portion of the funding and management of a similarly structured partnership and program for the joint costs of funding this activity via email to the buyer noted herein, not later than the closing date for this announcement.

The solicitation will include different site visit dates and points of contact for work in each state.  <br>  <br> See 'Obtaining Solicitation Documents' below.  <br>  <br> Project Description:  <br>  <br> This is a Fully-Designed Project. The Eliminate Phantom Silo project is a part of the New START Treaty between the United States and Russia. The project will require observation and oversight by Treaty Compliance Officers and National Technical Means 'NTM' teams for the agreed to periods of time to perform observance and recording/verification of non-use status on each designated ICBM Launch Facility 'LF' identified under the project. Project will demand accurate scheduling, reporting and management of the entire removal inventory as identified by Treaty Offices. Project requires 103 ICBM LF to be rendered as non-usable and 9 Missile Alert Facilities 'MAF' to have their infrastructure and limited below grade elements demolished. LF and MAF are located in rural areas throughout Wyoming '50 LF, 4 MAF', Montana '50 LF, 5 MAF' and on Vandenberg AFB, California '3 LF'. Work includes running heavy equipment operations throughout 103 LF and 9 MAF encompassing a grid area of approximately 70 miles east-west by 65 miles north-south in WY, 70 miles east-west by 65 miles north-south in MT and 3 California sites located on Vandenberg AFB. The work at each LF will be phased in two separate phases. The first phase will deal specifically with treaty compliance and LF elimination by means of launch door removal and disposal, filling of ICBM launcher tube with debris, rubble and imported gravel to render as non-usable, and other dismantling and demolition of surrounding launcher silo infrastructure. The second phase will require a concrete cap over the launcher tube with access points to other on-site below grade support structures filled and rendered non-usable. The entire LF site 'each approximately one acre' will be graded to a final specified grade. As part of the second phase, the MAF building structure will remain intact, but the overall site will require infrastructure dismantlement, disposal of support equipment, concrete capping and utilizing fill material to obstruct some below ground access areas. The Contractor will have access to material salvage at the LF and MAF sites. Prior to conducting any operations at the LF and MAF, the Contractor will be required to perform Environmental Baseline Surveys for each LF and MAF, no abatement or removal of recorded materials is required as they are to be abandoned in place. It is estimated that approximately 200,000 CY of various fill material 'i.e., earth, gravel, aggregates, etc.' will be required for import and use throughout the sites to complete the work.  <br>  <br> Other site work in WY and MT for each LF includes the removal of all topside appurtenances outside of the vehicle pad area, but within the project limits 'i.e., pull boxes, markers, antenna poles and bases'. All surface items are to be removed to existing grade with removal of exterior shafts and vents to a minimum of six-feet below grade and capped with concrete. The contractor will be required to weld the Launcher Equipment Building 'LEB' blast door closed and LEB access shaft filled to obstruct access. All topside man hatch access will be concrete capped. The final grading shall include gravel fill on the back side of the silo to match with existing grade. Each LF will final graded to drain freely and conform to natural surroundings. Site work in California will include filling of launcher tube with debris, rubble, imported earth and gravel. The contractor will complete backfill operations, construct concrete caps, and complete other site demolition items. Existing hard surface 'asphalt and concrete' located on the sites will remain in place. LEB access will be obstructed/removed and/or filled to eliminate any future access.  <br>  <br> The estimated demolition/construction cost of this project for basic and all options is between $20,000,000 and $30,000,000.  <br>  <br> Bidders - Offerors:  <br> Please be advised of on-line registration requirement for Contractor Registration and for Representations and Certifications Application 'ORCA' is now located in System for Award Management 'SAM' database https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM/.

For those supplies or services requiring qualification, whether the covered product or service is an end item under this contract or simply a component of an end item, the product, manufacturer, or source must have demonstrated that it meets the standards prescribed for qualification before award of this contract. The product, manufacturer, or source must be qualified at the time<br />of award whether or not the name of the product, manufacturer, or source is actually included on a qualified products list, qualified manufacturers list, or qualified bidders list.

If, after award, the Contracting Officer discovers that an applicable qualification requirement was not in fact met at the time of award, the Contracting Officer may either terminate this contract for default or allow performance to continue if adequate consideration is offered and the action is determined to be otherwise in the Government's best interests.<br /><br />(e) If an offeror, manufacturer, source, product or service has met the qualification requirement but is not yet on a qualified products list, qualified manufacturers list, or qualified bidders list, the offeror must submit evidence of qualification prior to award of this contract. Unless determined to be in the Government's interest, award of this contract shall not be delayed to permit an offeror to submit evidence of qualification.<br /><br />(f) Any change in location or ownership of the plant where a previously qualified product or service was manufactured or performed requires reevaluation of the qualification. Similarly, any change in location or ownership of a previously qualified manufacturer or source requires reevaluation of the qualification.

<p>(h) Multiple awards. This award shall be made on an all or none basis.<br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-1)</p>
<p>(ix) Provision 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition along with the following addenda to the provision.<br />52.212-2 Addendum:<br />Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection in which competing Offerors' past performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent Local Exchange Carrier (LEC) or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. Award will be made to the responsible Offeror proposing the combination most advantageous to the Government based upon an integrated assessment of the evaluation factors described below. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) FACTOR 1 - TECHNICAL. The Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of acceptable or unacceptable. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following technical subfactors:<br /><br />Subfactor 1 - Provider Capability <br />1. This factor is met when the Offeror provides evidence they are a telecommunications company having the capability to provide Basic Rate Interfaces (BRI), Commercial Subscriber Lines (CSL), and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>(b) FACTOR 2 -- PRICE. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent LEC or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) FACTOR 3 -- PAST PERFORMANCE. In evaluating PPI, the government will employ several approaches including: reviewing contract references provided by the offeror; seeking PPI through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. Only recent (within the last three years) and relevant PPI (similar or greater in scope, magnitude of effort, and complexity than effort described in this solicitation) will be evaluated. When reviewing PPI, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform the services described in this solicitation. The performance confidence assessment will result in an overall performance confidence rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower. If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer. <br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-2)</p>

<p>(ix) Provision 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition along with the following addenda to the provision.<br />52.212-2 Addendum:<br />Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection in which competing Offerors' past performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent Local Exchange Carrier (LEC) or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. Award will be made to the responsible Offeror proposing the combination most advantageous to the Government based upon an integrated assessment of the evaluation factors described below. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) FACTOR 1 - TECHNICAL. The Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of acceptable or unacceptable. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following technical subfactors:<br /><br /><br />Subfactor 1 - Provider Capability</p>
<p>1a.

<p>(b) FACTOR 2 -- PRICE.

The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent LEC or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) FACTOR 3 -- PAST PERFORMANCE. In evaluating PPI, the government will employ several approaches including: reviewing contract references provided by the offeror; seeking PPI through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. Only recent (within the last three years) and relevant PPI (similar or greater in scope, magnitude of effort, and complexity than effort described in this solicitation) will be evaluated. When reviewing PPI, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform the services described in this solicitation. The performance confidence assessment will result in an overall performance confidence rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower. If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer. <br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-2)</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.   <br>  <br> REQUEST FOR INFORMATION OR SOLICITATION FOR PLANNING PURPOSES (OCT 1997) (a) The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this solicitation or to otherwise pay for the information solicited except as an allowable cost under other contracts as provided in subsection 31.205-18, Bid and proposal costs, of the Federal Acquisition Regulation.  (b) Although proposal and offeror are used in this Request for Information, your response will be treated as information only, it shall not be used as a proposal.  (c) This solicitation is issued for the purpose of obtaining information to serve as a market survey to aid in research associated with the potential development of a full spectrum solar radiation test system.  The Government does not presently intend to award a contract, but desires information on risk, capability, price, innovative research and development methodology and other information in planning the development of a full spectrum solar radiation test equipment.  This is a Request for Information (RFI) issued pursuant to FAR 15.2.  The US Army Redstone Test Center, Climatic Test Division, Redstone Arsenal, AL, on behalf of the US Army, desires to obtain information to serve as a market survey.  <br>  <br> The system's radiation spectrum will more accurately produce solar heating and actinic effects than our current system and will meet the spectrum requirements of MIL-STD-810G Method 505.5.  This system will support a test item area of 8.2 x 16.4 ft, with an optional upgrade to 16.4 x 16.4 ft.  The solar rack will be modular, allowing small test items to be tested with only a portion of the solar luminaries.  The solar test equipment will be mounted on a portable support structure allowing the system to be utilized in multiple environmental test chambers, with interior dimensions of 25 x 25 x 25 ft.  The Solar Test System shall have a spectral distribution that is in compliance with Table 505.5C-I  in MIL-STD-810G.  This spectral distribution and tolerance requirement is illustrated by Table 505.5C-II in MIL-STD-810G.  The Solar Test System shall provide irradiance levels from 27 W/m2 to 1120 W/m2 with a tolerance of +4 percent or +15 W/m2 (whichever is greater).  The Solar Test System shall meet the uniformity requirements specified in Figure 505.5C-3 of MIL-STD-810G at all radiation intensity levels.  The Solar Test System shall be programmable to allow for test profiles as specified in Figure 505.5C-5 of MIL-STD-810G.  The Solar Test System shall allow an adjustable target plane to support test items with a non-uniform height as shown in Figure 505.5C-3 of MIL-STD-810G.  The Solar Test System shall provide the required spectral distribution and intensity when exposed to environmental temperatures from 80 to 140F. The Solar Test System shall have a support structure that allows the system to be portable.  No more than a forklift should be required to move the system.  The Solar Test System shall have accompanying modeling software to provide the necessary parameters to support items of different heights, profiles, and sizes.  This should allow the testing of smaller items with a subset of the luminary rack.  Additionally, this would allow the system to support items with different components of interest at different heights. <br>  <br> As a result of issuing this RFI, the Government expects to receive the following:  (1) A conceptual design and description of the proposed system including which requirements the system will meet, (2) the offeror's experience with Solar Radiation Test Equipment, (3) a budgetary estimate for the proposed system, (4) the projected lead time to provide the proposed system.   <br> After RFI release, there will be a period for question submittal.  All questions must be submitted in writing and reference the RFI number no later than 11:00 am (CST), 25 March 2013 to the contractual point of contact, Tony T. Curtis, via email at tony.t.curtis.civ@mail.mil; telephone requests for additional information will not be honored.  Request must include:  Company name, and appropriate point of contact information.  All questions must be submitted in writing (e-mail) and reference the RFI number; telephone requests for additional information will not be honored.  All RFI responses must be submitted to the technical point of contact, Bill McMahan, 256-876-7626, bill.mcmahan@us.army.mil no later than 3:00 PM Central Daylight Savings Time (CDST), 29 April 2013.  The Government requests that the respondents deliver one electronic soft copy in Microsoft Word or Adobe PDF format.  In addition to the information provided above, all responses to this RFI must include the RFI number, company or institution name, Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code, and point of contact information.  Acknowledgement of receipt will only be issued if a return receipt is requested with the submission.  Please do not submit any classified information.  All information submitted shall be adequately safeguarded from unauthorized disclosure in accordance with FAR Part 15.207.  The Government reserves the right to request further clarification or request presentations to enhance the Government's understanding of the respondent's submittal.  White papers that fail to comply with the above instructions or present ideas that are not pertinent to the subject may not be reviewed.  This is a request for information purposes only.  This notice does not constitute a commitment by the U.S. Army to procure products or services.  THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT INTEND TO AWARD A CONTRACT ON THE BASIS OF THIS REQUEST FOR INFORMATION OR OTHERWISE PAY FOR THE INFORMATION SOLICITED.  No award is intended as a result of the RFI.  Information submitted in response to this RFI is submitted at no cost to the Government and will not be returned.  Any exchange of information shall be consistent with procurement integrity requirements, and all appropriate proprietary claims will be protected to prevent improper disclosure.  In the event you have difficulty reading this RFI, please contact Tony T. Curtis via email at tony.t.curtis.civ@mail.mil for a copy of this notice. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>

<DESC>DESCRIPTION:<br />The Monongahela National Forest (managed by the USDA Forest Service) in West Virginia is seeking to form Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs) to accomplish <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Forest-wide range fencing and vegetation clearing work</span></strong>. Interested Vendors should submit prices for the work they are interested in performing and for the areas in which they are interested in performing as described in this announcement.
<p><br />The Contractor will be required to provide all labor, supervision, tools, equipment, transportation and incidental supplies as required in the Schedule of Items and Specifications of this announcement necessary to perform range fencing and vegetation clearing work. Work will include but is not necessarily limited to barbed wire fence construction (4 strands and 5 strands); removal of old fence line; hand clearing of fence lines; mechanical clearing of vegetation - pond cleaning; mechanical clearing of vegetation - fence line clearing; mechanical clearing of vegetation - brush mowing; mechanical tree treatment - shearing; mechanical tree treatment - shredding; mechanical tree treatment - chainsaw cutting; and liming. A detailed description of each requirement can be found in the attached Description / Specifications / Statement of Work document. All work is to comply with applicable Local, State and Federal codes and is subject to Service Contract Act wage rates.</p>
<p>LOCATION:<br />Located within a day's drive of about &frac12; of the nation's population, the Monongahela National Forest is both popular and accessible; yet feels remote and wild.</p>

<DESC>NASA/NSSC has a requirement for a training program entitled Introduction to FPGA. The objective of the program is to provide hands on, lab intensive training on Xilinx Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) that will build Rocket University participants skills and familiarity with the use of these very useful programmable parts.  This offering shall be held at NASAs Kennedy Space Center beginning April 8, 2013. NASA/NSSC intends to purchase the above curriculum from Hardent, Inc., Montreal, QC, Canada.  Pursuant to FAR 13.106(b), the acquisition of these services has been determined to be reasonably available from only one source.  Competition is impractical for the following reasons: The hardware NASA KSC requests training on is from maker Xilinx, and their training is exclusively offered by Hardent.  The training is the second phase of an offereing previously provided by Hardent.  As such, Hardent is the only vendor capable of providing the training on this hardware type approved by the manufacturer.  Harden has customized the course offering to suit NASA's needs and the content focuses on lab specific applications. Moreover, NASA requires this training to be conducted in a similar manner to the prior session in order to utilize objectives offered under previous training. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using the procedures in FAR Part 12 and Subpart 13.106. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 3:30 p.m. Central Standard time on March 15, 2013.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. Capabilities and qualifications should be submitted to Candice C. Talley at Candice.C.Talley@nasa.gov. An Ombudsman has been appointed.  See NASA Specific Note "B". Any referenced notes may be viewed at the following URLs linked below.

This includes NIH campus, research contractors, collaborators and grantees. These rodents must be monitored to insure they are genetically identical. This allows investigators to duplicate research and use rodents identical to the ones used previously. It allows for consistent research results. The baseline genetic profiles have been developed for each inbred NCI strain and will be compared to all future test results to insure there is no genetic drift in the foundation colonies.

Responses to this offer are required in electronic format.  Offerors shall ensure that the evaluation factors identified herein are adequately addressed in their proposal submissions.  The overall proposal shall consist of three (3) physically separate parts, individually titled Parts 1, 2, and 3.
  Individual volumes shall contain the following:

NOTE:  Offers submitted on NECO will be rejected as Non-Responsive.  An offer may be submitted through e-mail.  No mailed copy will be accepted.  E-mail to charles.e.fletcher@navy.mil.

The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers.

  (i)    	TECHNICAL CAPABILITY 
  (ii)   	PAST PERFORMANCE
(iii)	PRICE

Offerors' proposals will be evaluated first under Factor (i) above, which represents MINIMUM acceptable criteria.
  Under this factor, products offered will be determined to be either technically acceptable or unacceptable.  Failure to meet the minimum criteria for this factor will render the offer to be technically unacceptable and to not be considered for award.  

Only those Offers which meet the minimum requirements established by Factor (i) will be further evaluated under Factors (ii), and (iii).  In the second step of evaluating those offers determined under Factor (i) to be technically acceptable, Factor (ii), PAST PERFORMANCE, is significantly more important than Factor (iii), and PRICE.  

At the discretion of the Contracting Officer, the Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with offerors.
  Each initial offer should, therefore contain the Offeror's best terms from both a price and technical standpoint.   

Factor (i) - TECHNICAL CAPABILITY 

Offerors' technical information will be used to determine whether the items and/or services proposed meet the specifications included in this solicitation.  Therefore, offeror shall provide information that clearly demonstrated experience in performance on similar requirements.  Offers which are determined to be technically unacceptable may not be considered further for award. 

A list of technically acceptable/unacceptable ratings is listed below:

Technically Acceptable/Unacceptable Ratings
Rating	Description
Acceptable	Proposal clearly meets the minimum requirements of the solicitation.
Unacceptable	Proposal does not clearly meet the minimum requirements of the solicitation.

Factor (ii) - PAST PERFORMANCE 

Information submitted as required by SECTION L Past Performance, will be used to make a determination of whether the offeror has a satisfactory record of past performance.
  Offerors should, therefore, provide performance history and references to demonstrate satisfactory performance for up to three prior similar contracts performed within the past three years. 

PAST PERFORMANCE information should be provided on the form provided as an attachment to this solicitation.  Information utilized will be obtained from these references as well as any other sources that may have relevant information. 

Offers which lack relevant past performance history will receive a neutral rating for this factor.  Any Offeror's proposal which has no relevant past performance history, while rated neutral, may not represent the most advantageous proposal to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful proposal when compared to the proposals of other offerors.

Evaluation of Offeror's PAST PERFORMANCE is as follows:

NEUTRAL:  No relevant past performance available for evaluation.
  Offeror has asserted that it has no relevant directly related or similar past performance experience.  Proposal receives no merit or demerit for this factor.

OUTSTANDING:   No risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, or of any degradation of performance, or lack of customer satisfaction based upon offeror's past performance.

SATISFACTORY:  Very little risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, or of degradation of performance, or lack of customer satisfaction based upon the offeror's past performance.

UNSATISFACTORY:  Significant potential risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, and of degradation of performance based upon the offeror's past performance.

Factor (iii)  Price

Award will be made to the responsible offeror that is rated outstanding or satisfactory in Past Performance and offers the lowest price.
 

At the discretion of the Contracting Officer, the Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with Offerors.  Each initial offer should, therefore contain the Offerors best terms from price.

All responsible Offerors are to submit CAGE code, Dunn and Bradstreet number, Tax Identification Number and all applicable specifications regarding this solicitation. 

Proposal must be received no later than 12:00 PM (PST), 11 Mar 2013, Quotes submitted as an attachment to an email should be sent in Word Version 6.0 or higher. Do not mail. Only electronic responses shall be accepted via e-mail.  Each submission should be virus scanned prior to being sent via e-mail to the POC listed: Charles E.
 Fletcher II email: charles.e.fletcher@navy.mil .  Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice questions must be submitted via e-mail. The Government will make every attempt to answer all questions in a timely manner; however, questions submitted within 3 days of the posted closing day may not allow ample time to respond and offerors cannot be guaranteed a response will be issued.  

NOTE: Email submissions are subject to size and type restrictions (typically limited to less than 1 Megabyte in size and only non-executable attachments such as .doc or .pdf files) as well as any other appropriate network security measures.  It is the respondent's responsibility to verify the package was received and can be viewed.

<p>BASIS FOR AWARD</p>
<p>The government intends to award a fixed-price contract to the responsible quoter whose quotation is responsive to the solicitation and is determined to be the best value to the Government using the tradeoff approach. Selection of the best value to the Government will be achieved through a process of evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of each quoter's quotation against the evaluation criteria described below. In determining the best value to the Government, the Technical Capability and Past Performance Evaluation Criteria, when combined, are more important than the evaluated price. The Government is more concerned about obtaining a superior Technical Capability quotation than making an award at the lowest evaluated price. However, the Government will not make an award at a price premium it considers disproportionate to the benefits associated with the evaluated superiority of one technical and management quotation over another. Thus, to the extent that quoter's technical and past performance quotations are evaluated as close or similar in merit, the evaluated price is more likely to be a determining factor.</p>
<p>Factor I - Technical Capability:</p>
<p>a. Contract Requirements:</p>
<p>Quotations will be evaluated on the quoter's ability to provide all the contract requirements relating to meeting space, audio-visual equipment and technical support, food and beverage service, lodging, and business services. Quotations must address the quoter's ability to meet ADA requirements for accessibility as it relates to meeting space, lodging, and parking. Quotations will be evaluated on the quality of the customer services provided, the layout design and quality of the facilities as reflected by the physical layout and atmosphere of meeting space and the maintenance and upkeep of the facilities.</p>
<p>b. Availability of Dates:</p>
<p>Quotations will be evaluated on the ability of the quoter to provide the required services on the dates requested. Additional consideration will be given to quoters who can provide the required services on the preferred dates in order of preference (i.e., 1st choice date, 2nd choice date, and 3rd choice date).</p>
<p>c. Location:</p>
<p>Quotations will be evaluated on the ability of the quoter to provide a facility within Las Vegas, Nevada, with adequate low cost or free parking for participants and presenters.</p>
<p>Factor II - Past Performance:</p>
<p>The quoter must provide a minimum of three (3) references for past performance of similar work performed within the past three (3) years. The information for each reference shall include the following:</p>
<p>1. Name and address of government agency or other non-government client<br />2. Name, title, email and telephone number of Contracting Officer, or other point of contact<br />3. Name, title, email and telephone number of client's program manager, if applicable<br />4. Contract number, period of performance, and total dollar value of contract; and<br />5. Description of services provided.</p>
<p>EEOC will evaluate past performance in terms of customer service on similar requirements. In the event that a quoter has no past performance history, this rating factor will be considered neutral and will neither increase nor decrease the overall rating.</p>
<p>Site Visits: The Government reserves the right to conduct a site visit prior to award of all quoters who are rated to be technically acceptable. The site visit will review and evaluate the same technical items identified in the Technical Capabilities Portion of the technical evaluation factors.</p>
<p>Factor III - Price:</p>
<p>The price quotation will be evaluated against the independent government cost estimate.</p>
<p>Notice: The Government intends to evaluate quotations, and reserves the right to make a contract award without discussions with quoters (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a)). Therefore, the quoter's initial quote should contain the vendor's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions, if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary. The Government also reserves the right to conduct a site visit prior to award. The Government reserves the right of choice of venue should litigation/arbitration of this contract be necessary.</p>
<p>The provisions at 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors - Commercial Items applies to this acquisition. The provisions at 52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items applies to this acquisition. The quoter shall include a completed copy of the provision at 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items with your quote. The quoter shall include a completed copy of the provision at 52.222-52 Exemption from Application of the Service Contract Act to Contracts for Certain Services - Certification with your quote. The Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items and Clause 52.212-5 Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statues or Executive Order-Commercial Items are incorporated by reference. Clause 52.203-6, Restrictions on Subcontractor Sales to the Government &lsquo; Alternate I, Clause 52.222-3 Convict Labor, Clause 52.222-19 Child Labor - Cooperation with Authorities and Remedies, Clause 52.222-21, Prohibition of Segregated Facilities, Clause 52.222-26 Equal Opportunity, Clause 52.222-35 Equal Opportunity for Veterans, Clause 52.222-36 Affirmative Action for Workers with Disabilities, Clause 52.222-37 Employment Reports Veterans, Clause 52.222-41 Service Contract Act of 1965, Clause 52.222-50 Combating Trafficking in Persons, Clause 52.222-53 Exemption from Application of the Service Contract Act to Contracts for Certain Services-Requirements, Clause 52.223-18 Encouraging Contractor Policies to Ban Text Messaging While Driving, Clause 52.225-13 Restrictions on Certain Foreign Purchases, and Clause 52.232-33, Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer &lsquo; Central Contractor Registration are incorporated by reference.

<p>(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.</p>

(End of provision)<br />(xx) NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program. It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is (202) 372-3695</p>

SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION PROCEDURES (SAP)
JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION

SOLICITATIONS MAY BE LIMITED TO ONE SOURCE ONLY IF THE CONTRACTING OFFICER DETERMINES THAT ONLY ONE SOURCE IS REASONABLY AVAILABLE.  THIS DETERMINATION MUST BE SUPPORTED WITH FULL JUSTIFICATION FOR SOLE SOURCE FROM THE CUSTOMER.  WHEN THE CUSTOMER DESCRIBES AN ITEM WITH A PURCHASE DESCRIPTION, WHICH LIMITS THE AVAILABILITY TO ONE SOURCE, THE JUSTIFICATION MUST EXPLAIN WHY THE ITEM IS THE ONLY ONE THAT WILL MEET THE GOVERNMENTS REQUIREMENT. STATEMENTS SUCH AS "ONLY KNOWN SOURCE" OR "ONLY SOURCE WHICH CAN MEET THE REQUIRED DELIVERY DATE" ARE INADEQUATE TO SUPPORT A SOLE SOURCE PURCHASE.  THE CUSTOMER SHALL PROVIDE THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION: 
1. PURCHASE REQUEST OR REQUISITION NUMBER
3023-HD04	2. PROJECT/TASK NUMBER
C-130 LRS-S	3. ESTIMATED AMOUNT (OVER $3,000 BUT NOT EXCEEDING $100,000)

4. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES OR SERVICES REQUIRED AND THE INTENDED USE.
Purchase for 2 ea  Inmarsat Antennas.  The Inmarsat Antenna was designed and manufactured by Ball Aerospace & Technologies Corp. (CAGE: 13993), PN: 513738-519 and is used on the Coast Guards HC-130J aircraft for secure, over the horizon, communications (AirLink System) .  
5. UNIQUE CHARACTERISTICS THAT LIMIT AVAILABILITY TO ONLY ONE SOURCE, WITH THE REASON NO OTHER SUPPLIES OR SERVICES CAN BE USED.  
The Inmarsat Antenna is an integral, mission essential, part of the HC-130J aircrafts AirLink System.   In accordance with Technical Order (TO), 1C-130J-4-93-70-00, this is the only antenna authorized for use in the Coast Guards fleet of HC-130J aircraft, in this application. This is a commercial system and the government does not have the rights to the technical data, the software and hardware necessary to manufacture this antenna; only Ball Aerospace has those rights and equipment and they have not sold or released them to any other entity (ref. attached email).
 
6. REASON THAT SUGGESTED SOURCE IS THE ONLY SOURCE WHICH CAN PROVIDE THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES
The AirLink System, including the Inmarsat Antenna, installed on the Coast Guards HC-130J aircraft fleet was designed and manufactured by Ball Aerospace.  Ball Aerospace alone holds the design and manufacturing data and materials necessary to manufacture the Inmarsat Antenna; furthermore, they have not sold or otherwise released this repair data or equipment to any parties (see attached email).  The use of another antenna in this application on the Coast Guards HC-130J aircraft is not authorized and would compromise aircraft configuration, safety and interoperability with the fleet.  Ball Aerospace is the only know manufacturing source for the Inmarsat Antenna.
 
7. EXPLAIN WHY AN ADEQUATE PURCHASE DESCRIPTION OR OTHER INFORMATION SUITABLE TO SOLICIT BY FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION HAS NOT BEEN DEVELOPED OR ARE NOT AVAILABLE.
The Inmarsat Antenna design, manufacturing data is proprietary to Ball Aerospace.  The government did not buy any of these data rights when the AirLink System for the Coast Guards HC-130J was chosen and purchased. Therefore, the USCG does not have access to the technical data nor does it own the test equipment needed to repair the Inmarsat Antenna. 
8. PROVIDE A STATEMENT OF ACTIONS, IF ANY, THE GOVERNMENT MAY TAKE TO REMOVE OR OVERCOME ANY BARRIERS TO COMPETITION BEFORE FUTURE ACQUISITIONS ARE REQUIRED.  IF THIS IS A FOLLOW-ON ACTION TO A PREVIOUSLY COMPETED ACTION, SO STATE.
The Coast Guard will maintain open communications with Ball Aerospace & Technologies Corp and will continually conduct market surveys to identify possible additional sources that may eventually receive the capability and authorizations needed to manufacture the Inmarsat Antenna. However, granting access to technical packages associated with this antenna is solely a Ball Aerospace business decision. The alternative for the Coast Guard would be to completely replace the AirLink System that is now installed and intergrated on the HC-130J aircraft, which would be cost prohibitive.

<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) was created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID to help local partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries.  Seizing critical windows of opportunity, OTI works on the ground to provide fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief.  Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition.  OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations.  OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high-level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs).  These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the organization's programmatic goals and objectives.  USPSCs are considered employees of USAID for all purposes except programs administered by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) - such as federally sponsored health insurance, life insurance, and retirement benefits.  However, there are several other similar benefits that USPSCs may participate in, such as partial reimbursement for health and life insurance costs, as well as full coverage of workers' compensation, among other benefits.  For more complete information on USPSC benefits, please see page 12 of this solicitation.</p>

<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The Country Representative is a member of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA)/OTI Yemen and Asia Regional Team, reports to the OTI Regional Team Leader, and is based in Sana'a Yemen as the senior OTI representative in the country.</p>
<p>The Country Representative's principal responsibility will be development, oversight and management of DCHA/OTI's Yemen country program.  The incumbent will be called upon to represent OTI's mission and programs to senior-level government officials, in-country visitors, senior officials from other international organizations, bilateral donors and local government officials.</p>
<p>The OTI program in Yemen will support the larger objectives of the U.S. Government and as appropriate any future USAID presence in Yemen. In particular, the OTI program will provide assistance to support the nascent political transition process in Yemen. In close coordination with the Embassy and other USG actors and with consideration of USG priorities, OTI's rapid and targeted programs will address emerging issues and empower local partners potentially to include non-governmental organizations, civil society groups, media outlets, and local and national government offices to reduce or mitigate conflict, increase transparency and accountability, and foster positive political change.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>The objective of this position is to ensure that OTI has a highly-qualified Country Representative in the field that will represent OTI and fulfill the duties and responsibilities of the position.</p>
<p>9.  CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>

<p>Under the direct supervision of the Washington-based DCHA/OTI Regional Team Leader for the Yemen and Asia Team, the Country Representative will:</p>
<p>&bull;	Conceptualize and design program strategies and objectives in close coordination with OTI staff, USAID personnel, U.S. embassy and local civil society officials, based on political analysis and U.S. Government policy.  When necessary, refine strategic objectives and advocate on behalf of new programmatic approaches in country, linked to neighboring country programs, where appropriate;</p>
<p>&bull;	Communicate and coordinate OTI in-country activities between OTI and its implementing partners, the U.S. Embassy, and other donor organizations;</p>
<p>&bull;	Design staffing plans to meet overall program objectives and recruit, train, supervise, mentor and evaluate the performance of in-country OTI staff, providing regular feedback;</p>
<p>&bull;	Monitor local and regional political developments and regularly brief OTI and partner staff on their potential programmatic impact;</p>
<p>&bull;	Manage and provide day-to-day programmatic, operational, and strategic guidance to OTI's implementing partners (contractors and/or grantees) ensuring that activities are contributing to OTI's program objectives and are within the partner's scope;</p>
<p>&bull;	Provide recommendations to the Washington-based Contracting Officer Representative (COR) and/or the Regional Team Leader on implementing partner performance, the appropriateness of the partner's scope to OTI's country objectives, partner's budgets, and modifications thereto;</p>
<p>&bull;	Provide USAID concurrence on all implementing partner activities, including final approval of grantees for grants under contract, in accordance with the USAID's Automated Directives System (ADS);</p>
<p>&bull;	Ensure that OTI's programs and their activities are monitored and evaluated and that lessons learned from the activities feed into ongoing or future activities;</p>
<p>&bull;	Analyze and report on current political developments and security concerns as well as other pertinent information required to achieve OTI's program objectives;</p>
<p>&bull;	Ensure appropriate resource allocation among OTI field offices and implementing partners;</p>
<p>&bull;	Prepare and maintain OTI program budgets for field operations;</p>
<p>&bull;	Serve as OTI's primary liaison with USAID personnel, U.S. Embassy staff, Ambassadors, local government officials, UN organizations, indigenous and international NGOs, and other pertinent agencies and organizations.  Develop and maintain collaborative relationships with them in order to ensure close coordination at the field level, identify the widest range of potential partners and opportunities, and achieve maximum synergy with other programs;</p>
<p>&bull;	Prepare operational plans in collaboration with the U.S. Embassy, including logistics and property use guidelines, closeout and hand-over, security procedures, contingency and evacuation plans;</p>
<p>&bull;	Ensure the use of OTI systems and procedures to maintain effective and efficient management of funds, programming, and monitoring and evaluation;</p>
<p>&bull;	Ensure that all OTI and partner field staff adhere to in-country security guidelines set by the U.S. Embassy Regional Security Officer and other organizations such as the United Nations or host government, as appropriate;</p>
<p>&bull;	Prepare and disseminate programmatic, financial and quarterly reports to the U.S. Embassy, OTI/Washington and other organizations as appropriate;</p>
<p>&bull;	Supervise staff in conjunction with the Regional Team Leader (e.g.  Deputy Country Representative, Program Managers, Program Assistants, Program Admin Assistants, etc).  Provide orientation, training, and mentoring for staff supervised; assign work, explain how duties are to be performed to meet expectations and communicate how the successful performance of those duties will be measured; evaluate staff performance; recognize good performance; communicate where performance needs to be improved; resolve complaints; and approve leave requests and timesheets as well as training, travel and program and operations requests; and,</p>
<p>&bull;	Perform other duties as determined by the supervisor to ensure successful OTI program implementation.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY RELATIONSHIP:<br />The Country Representative will report to OTI's Washington-based Team Leader for Yemen and Asia, or his/her designee, as well as to the Yemen Mission Director.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY CONTROLS:<br />The Supervisor will set overall objectives.  The employee and the supervisor together will develop deadlines, projects, and work to be accomplished.  Work plans, timesheets, regional travel, and funding associated with support costs will be approved through OTI Washington.  The incumbent is expected to take initiative, act independently, and manage his/her tasks with minimal supervision. Though this is a senior field-based position for the OTI Yemen program, the incumbent is expected to actively and proactively collaborate with OTI Washington leadership, and to fully utilize, embrace, and become an expert on OTI systems and processes.  Failure to adequately perform the scope of work above and/or failure to take direction from the Supervisor may result in corrective actions, including denial of step or grade increases, extension of contract probationary periods, performance improvement plans, and/or termination for the convenience of USAID/OTI.</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

Interested Parties: An interested party is an actual or prospective bidder or offeror whose direct economic interest would be affected by the award of a contract or by the failure to award a contract.

Election of forum: After an interested party protests an AMC procurement to HQAMC and while that protest is pending, the protester agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If a protest is filed with an external forum on the same solicitation as the HQAMC-level protest, the HQAMC-level protest will be dismissed.

Processing of HQAMC-level protests: Within 10 working days after the protest is filed, the contracting officer, with the assistance of legal counsel, shall file with the HQAMC Office of Command Counsel (ATTN: AMCCC-PL) one copy of an administrative report in response to the protest. Reports shall be sent by fax, over-night mail or hand-delivered to ensure timely receipt.

52.233-4703	 AMC-LEVEL PROTEST PROGRAM	05/01/2004
If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible contracting officer.  However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC.

The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103.  If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals? (1) [ ] Are, [ ] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (2) [ ] Have, [ ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; (3) [ ] Are, [ ] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <BR> <BR>(4) [ ] Have, [ ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. (ii) Examples. (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. ?362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>
<p>BASIS FOR AWARD:<br />Award will be made to the responsible, technically acceptable quoter, whose quote, conforming to the Combined Synopsis/Solicitation, offers the lowest evaluated price.</p>
<p><br />SHIP &amp; BASE ACCESS <br />Vendors are responsible for correctly submitting forms/applications. Vendors are encouraged to monitor email using "Request a Read Receipt" function and to confirm receipt of facsimile transmissions.</p>
<p>Due to enhanced security measures, ship and base access is required for pre-award ship visits (e.g. ship-check) and for contract performance. Specifically the following permissions are required:</p>
<p>1. El Paso Intelligence Center (EPIC) personnel screening requirement<br />2. Base/Repair Facility Access Request<br />3. Vehicle Access Request<br />4. Ship Access List (vendor-provided)</p>
<p>All forms are available for download on the MSC contracts webpage at http://www.msc.navy.mil. Click on "Contracts" in the upper right corner. "EPIC template" is under "Reference" subheading. Click on "Online Library of Common Documents" for all other forms.</p>
<p>EPIC: Required for access to MSC vessels. Complete EPIC form strictly adhering to format requirements and forward to (CONUS East Coast repairs) MSFSC(underscore)EPIC(underscore)EAST@navy.mil and (CONUS West Coast and HI repairs) MSC.SSUSD.EPIC@NAVY.MIL.

Vendor will be notified by MSFSC of personnel who are denied access to the vessel.</p>
<p>Base/Repair Facility Access: Permit is required to access Navy facilities. Base/Repair Facility Access Request is desired seven days prior to ship check or performance start date. Submit forms per the document instruction and to the Port Engineer. A courtesy copy (CONUS West Coast performance locations only) to Ermanno Magliulo, Engineering Director, at ermanno.magliulo@navy.mil will be appreciated.</p>
<p>RAPIDGate&reg; is being implemented for access to DoD facilities in CONUS, HI, Guam and Puerto Rico. Vendor is responsible to acquire RAPIDGate&reg; status and destination base individual access badge(s) activation prior to performance start date. Delays that may result from inadequate planning are contractor responsibility. Vendor instructions and program information is available at http://www.RAPIDGate.com or tel. 877.727.4342. RAPIDGate&reg; access requires (in succession) (1) Individual Base Commander approval for vendor to access base, (2) Successful vendor RAPIDGate&reg; company annual enrollment, (3) Company employee individual enrollment and possession of RAPIDGate&reg; identification badge for single base or multiple base (enterprise) access. Vendor is responsible to confirm that each employee held annual RAPIDGate&reg; badge is active for the specific facility and performance period in accordance with RAPIDGate&reg; User Agreement (http://www.RAPIDGate.com).</p>
<p>Additional access permissions may be required such as Navy Base Point Loma "Enclave Access request form".</p>
<p>Vehicle Access: Required for vehicle access to Navy facilities. Follow supplemental instructions on Base Access forms or base-specific vehicle access forms.</p>
<p>Ship Access List* (Vendor-Provided): On company letterhead attachment via email, the vendor is required to provide the ship master (courtesy copy the Port Engineer) with an accurate, current list of performing personnel prior to being admitted aboard the vessel. Under no circumstances will a hand-delivered list be accepted.</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.     <br>      <br>   The US Army Corps of Engineers, Seattle District is requesting proposals for non-personnel services to provide drilling and piezometer installations at the Lake Washington Ship Canal.  Services include subsurface borings for the installation of 2-inch diameter PVC piezometers with five-foot long screens.   <br>   The Lake Washington Ship Canal project provides a connective waterway between Puget Sound and Lake Washington through Lake Union.  The Hiram M. Chittenden Locks (Locks) part of the project consists of a small and large lock, a concrete gravity dam and spillway, saltwater drain, guide walls, and fish ladder.  The fish ladder and locks also provide fish passage past the lock and dam structure.  Downstream of the locks, the project consists of a channel 34 feet deep and 300 feet wide from Puget Sound to the Burlington Northern Railway Bridge.  The locks and dam were constructed between 1916 through 1923.  The fish ladder was rehabilitated with a new public viewing center and restrooms added in 1976-77.  The project is a major element in Seattle's economy and provides transit to 80,000 vessels per year.  The project is also a popular tourist attraction, receiving approximately one million visitors per year.   <br>

<DESC>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p>(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>FACTOR 1 - PAST PERFORMANCE:</p>
<p>The offeror shall identify at least two (2) but no more than three (3) relevant (construction, overhaul, repair and alteration of ships) and current federal, state or local government or private contracts performed during the last three (3) years. For each contract, list:</p>

<p>If subcontracting arrangement is proposed, the above data must also be provided for each first tier subcontractor. If a joint effort or teaming arrangement is proposed, highlight previous experience with the proposed team or subcontractor.</p>
<p>The past performance evaluation will take into account the guidelines outlined at FAR 15.305(a) (2) Past Performance Evaluation. The Contractor's past performance will be evaluated according to the following factors and questions: <br /><br />Quality of Product or Service <br />Did the customer get what was specified? <br />Did the customer consider the final product high in quality? <br />If warranty issues arose, were they promptly corrected? <br />Schedule <br />Was the contract completed on time? If not, reason why not (growth work, Contractor delayed, government delayed?) <br />Business Relations <br />How was the customer service? Was the Contractor committed to customer satisfaction? <br />Would you use this company again (Why/Why not)? <br />Management of Key Personnel <br />Were subcontracts involved? Comments?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In evaluating Contractors past performance, the government intends to also review U.S. Coast Guard Contractor Performance Assessment Reports and other existing past performance ratings on relevant contracts. A quoter without a record of past performance will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance. General trends in a Contractor's performance will also be considered.</p>
<p>FACTOR 2 - PRICE:</p>
<p>Offeror's price shall represent the best price in response to the request for quotes. The price shall be evaluated to determine fairness and reasonableness.<br /><br />****Past Performance is more important than Price****</p>
<p>Award may be made without any type of discussions or negotiations. This is based on the Contracting Officer's determination after an evaluation has been completed on all offers.</p>
<p>(End of FAR 52.212-2)</p>
<p>(4) FAR 52.215-20 REQUIREMENTS FOR COST OR PRICING DATA OR INFORMATION OTHER THAN COST OR PRICING DATA (OCT 2010) ALT IV <br />(a) Submission of cost or pricing data is not required <br />(b) If the contracting officer cannot determine price reasonableness either in the initial solicitation or in any change to the contract after award, the contracting officer will require submission information in sufficient detail in order to make such determination.</p>
<p>The information may be as follows:</p>
<p>REQUEST FOR INFORMAL COST BREAKDOWN</p>
<p>In addition to placing your offer in the appropriate place in Schedule of supplies and Prices, it is requested that you provide a breakdown of your costs, to include but not be limited to, those items identified in the sample format below: <br />Trade (i.e. laborers, rigger, etc.) <br />Breakdown of labor grades by trade category <br />Man hours per trade, per labor grade <br />Cost/hour/trade <br />Supplies/materials (description &amp; cost of each) <br />Sub-total <br />Pension Plans <br />Overhead at a rate of ______% <br />Profit at a rate of ________% <br />Total for item _____________</p>
<p>(5) FAR 52.217-7 OPTION FOR INCREASED QUANTITY - SEPARATELY PRICED LINE ITEM (MAR 1989) - VARIATION</p>
<p>The Government may require the performance of the numbered line items, identified in the Schedule as option items, at the unit prices stated in the Schedule. The option quantities shown in the Schedule are estimates only. The Government has the right to require performance of these items at the quantities deemed necessary. Therefore, the Government may exercise an option item on more than one occasion during the contract performance period. The Contracting Officer will provide initial notification of the exercise of an option either verbally, by facsimile, or both. When time is of essence initial notification will be provided verbally followed within 24 hours by a facsimile of confirmation. A contract modification will be executed shortly thereafter to include those options wherein exercise notification was provided. Such options may be exercised at any phase during the contract performance period as stated herein, or any extension of the performance period. To maintain the contract performance period the Contractor shall commence performance of an option item immediately upon receiving initial notification; but, not later than 24 hours thereafter, unless proper sequencing of the work requires a delay in beginning performance of the option. In that case, the option item shall be commenced as soon as proper sequencing permits. The exercise of any option item listed in the Schedule will not normally extend the contract performance period. However, the Contracting Officer may consider a request by the Contractor for contract extension if an option is exercised after 50% of the contract performance period has expired. <br />(End of Clause)</p>

<p>(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge.

<p>(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p><br />(ii) Examples.</p>
<p>(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency.

<p>(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p><br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p>(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>

<CONTACT>Barbara Phillips, Contract Specialist, Phone (937)257-1257, Email barbara.phillips@wpafb.af.mil - JoAnn Parks, Contract Specialist, Phone (937)257-5791, Email joann.parks@wpafb.af.mil
<DESC>Purpose: The purpose of this notice is to&nbsp;invite interested roofing contractors&nbsp;to a Pre-Proposal Conference in conjunction with the anticipated&nbsp;release of&nbsp;the draft Request For Proposal (dRFP).<br /><br />The Enterprise Sourcing Group (ESG) at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base is transforming the way the U.S. Air Force purchases its roofing repair and replacement needs. The ESG will move the Air Force to a regional contract model representing approximately $325 million in total roofing requirements over five years. This will represent a significant change in roofing acquisition for both the Air Force and roofing contractors.
<p>As part of an ongoing effort to more efficiently procure roofing for the Air Force, the ESG is preparing to solicit a targeted number of&nbsp;multiple award, regional indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (IDIQ)-type contracts covering Air Force bases located in the contiguous U.S. This approach is a transformational shift from traditional base-specific contracts to a more strategic approach designed to address ongoing budget and manpower challenges. <br /><br />In conjunction with anticipated release of the draft Request for Proposal, the ESG will be hosting a Pre-Proposal Conference at Wright-Patterson AFB, OH to communicate the preliminary contract requirements that will be contained in the&nbsp; dRFP and to obtain input from interested roofing contractors. There will be no conference fee to participate. Proposed discussion topics for the event include:</p>
<p>&bull; Overview of Strategic Sourcing<br />&bull; Role of Small Business and Teaming Arrangements<br />&bull; Overview of the Air Force Roofing Strategy &amp; Objectives<br />&bull; Review of the draft RFP<br /><br />Interested contractors are invited to attend to learn about this upcoming business opportunity and provide feedback to the Air Force. Additionally, this event will provide an opportunity for contractors to network with potential teaming partners and/or subcontractors.<br /><br />It is the intention of the ESG to&nbsp;release the dRFP&nbsp;by the end of March 2013 which will be posted to FBO as a modification to this Special Notice.</p>
<p>Details of the Pre-Proposal Conference are as follows:</p>
<p>Date: Wednesday, 17 April 2013<br />Duration: 1 Day (approximately 8am-5pm EST)<br />Location: Kenney Hall, Air Force Institute of Technology, Area B, Wright Patterson AFB, Dayton, OH</p>
<p>Please note that the date and location may be subject to change in the event of Sequestration or other unforeseen delays, and the Government cannot be held liable for any costs incurred by you or your company should there be any unforeseen changes to the event. Attendance at the Pre-Proposal Conference, while encouraged, is completely voluntary.</p>
<p>Registration:<br />Attendees should register by clicking&nbsp;the link below. Please note that identifying information will be required to register, so we advise waiting to&nbsp;register until all company attendees are finalized.<br /><br /><a href="https://einvitations.afit.edu/inv/anim.cfm?i=140153&amp;k=36542087E54">https://einvitations.afit.edu/inv/anim.cfm?i=140153&amp;k=36542087E54</a><br /><br />ALL ATTENDEES ARE REQUIRED TO REGISTER IN ADVANCE. NO INDIVIDUALS WILL BE GRANTED BASE ACCESS WITHOUT PRIOR REGISTRATION. <strong>THE FINAL DATE TO REGISTER IS&nbsp;APRIL 8, 2013 by 4:00pm EST.<br /><br /></strong>Parking, base entry procedures and additional information will be provided on this page and on the invitation/RSVP at a later date.</p>

The EEAAD shall support the US Army (USA) Airborne and Special Operations Forces (SOF) communities by providing an enhanced data logging device packaged with an automatic activation device that will activate the reserve parachute of a paratrooper that is unable to activate the reserve on their own, under a partial or total malfunction of his/her main canopy. <br>  <br> DESCRIPTION: <br>  <br> The EEAAD shall automatically activate the reserve parachute by cutting the reserve container closing loop(s) in the event the paratrooper is unable to activate the reserve on their own.  The EEAAD shall function with all current and future MFF parachute systems to include, but not limited to, the MC-4, RA-1, and Hi-Glide; and operate on all high performance fixed, rotary and non-standard aircraft which support the MFF mission at deployment speeds of 70 to 150 KIAS.  It shall offer performance equal to or greater than the current Electronic Automatic Activation Device (EAAD) (Military CYPRES 2 1500 35A www.ssk.us/M-CYPRES_2_users_guide_US_01-2013.pdf), while providing the user the ability to collect and store information from the freefall and canopy flight portions of an MFF operation, for later download and analysis.  This information will allow the user to refine techniques and tactics, and provide a  quote mark black-box quote mark  capability to assist in the investigation of incidents. <br>  <br> REQUIREMENTS: <br>  <br> The system should meet the following performance requirements, which contain both Threshold [T] and Objective [O] levels.  The objective level is the performance goal, while the threshold level is the minimum acceptable performance short of the goal.  Note:  these requirements represent the desired increased capability over the current EAAD performance.  <br>  <br> RESPONSES: <br>  <br> All interested firms and manufacturers, regardless of size, are encouraged to respond to this request for information.

<DESC><p>As required by section 911 of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA), CMS must re-compete its Part A &amp; B Medicare Administrative Contractor (A/B MAC) contracts every five (5) years. The purpose of this contract is to obtain an A/B MAC (hereinafter, referred to as "the Contractor") to provide specified health insurance benefit administration services, including Medicare claims processing and payment services, in support of the Medicare FFS program. The contractor shall perform its responsibilities under the direction of CMS.</p>
<p>The Contractor will perform numerous functions to support health care services for Medicare beneficiaries, which include performing claims-related activities and establishing relationships with providers of health care services, both institutional and professional, for a defined geographic area or "jurisdiction." The Contractor will perform the requirements of this contract in accordance with applicable laws, regulations, Medicare manuals, as well as CMS requirements to ensure the financial integrity of the Medicare program. The Medicare program has complex legal, policy, and operating environments. The Contractor will utilize and interact with all pertinent CMS-required payment schedules, systems, equipment, and operational capabilities in the performance of its functions. Further, the Contractor will not only coordinate its activities with CMS, but must also work with a broad range of Federal, State, and Local government agencies, CMS partners and Contractors, and any other stakeholder in the health care system of the United States.</p>
<p>In accordance with CMS' technical specifications, the Contractor shall receive and control Medicare claims from institutional and professional providers, suppliers, and beneficiaries within its jurisdiction, and will perform all standard or otherwise required editing with respect to these claims to determine whether they are complete and ready for payment. An edit is defined as "logic within the Standard Claims Processing System (or PSC/ZPIC Supplemental Edit Software) that selects certain claims, evaluates or compares information on the selected claims or other accessible source, and, depending on the evaluation, takes action on the claims, such as pay in full, pay in part, or suspend for manual review."</p>
<p>In addition, the Contractor will calculate Medicare payment amounts and remit those payments to the appropriate party. The Contractor also will conduct redeterminations with respect to appeals of claims; operate a Provider Customer Service Program (PCSP) which will educate providers with respect to the Medicare program; will respond to provider telephone and written inquiries; will respond to complex inquiries from Beneficiary Contact Centers (BCCs); and will make coverage decisions for new procedures and devices in local areas. The Contractor also will conduct a variety of provider services, such as enrollment of new providers in the program, answering written inquiries, and educating providers with respect to Medicare's rules, regulations, and billing procedures.</p>
<p>CMS anticipates releasing a solicitation for Jurisdiction J (which includes the states of Alabama, Georgia and Tennessee) on or about January 18, 2013. The contract will include a base year plus four one-year options. The&nbsp; proposal due date is March 8, 2013 with an anticipated award date of August 30, 2013.</p>
<p>This solicitation is expected to be issued as pending availability of funds.</p>

<DESC>This synopsis was originally posted on/about 11 January, 2013 via FedBizOpps.gov. 
 
The synopsis is hereby amended to include the following changes and language:

1) The proposed action number is changed FROM N61331-13-R-1602 TO N61331-13-R-0017.
2) This requirement is being pursued under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13.5, Test Program for Certain Commercial Items. This amendment is in accordance with Class Deviation 2013-O0004, dated 15 January, 2013.
3) The Government will make an award / award determination based on relevant technical factors and the determination of a fair and reasonable price.
4) All other terms, conditions, and languages (below) remain unchanged.

NSWC-PCD CDC2 intends to issue a three-year Indefinite Quantity (IQ) sole source contract to GE Intelligent Platforms Embedded Systems, 12060 S Memorial PKWY, Huntsville, AL, 36803-3308 to procure commercial off the shelf (COTS) parts or slightly modified COTS parts for the Landing Craft Air Cushion (LCAC), Command, Control, Communications, Computers & Navigation (C4N) Systems.
  The items being acquired are:

Nomenclature	Part Number(s)	FY13-FY15 Quantities
PMC 1553 Circuit Card Assembly, QPM-1553-1SG, Up to 80 each
PMC422 Circuit Card Assembly, PMC422, Up to 123 each

This purchase is not suitable for full and open competition and it is in the best interest of the government to acquire this item using a non-competitive purchase for the following reasons:  In accordance with FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii), supplies may be deemed available only from the original source in the case of a follow-on contract for the continued provision of highly specialized equipment when it is likely that award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.
  The items being purchased were specifically tested and evaluated against the Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) technical requirements as provided on the LCAC C4N System Baseline Configuration 3 (SBC3) product specification during the products initial prototyping and evaluation phase.  No other source for these interface boards currently exists.  

The proposed contract action is for supplies for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 334418 and the size standard is 500 employees.
  Any questions relating to this announcement are due 3 days from the date this notice is published, and no later than 1400 local time (CST).  POC is Miles Hooper, Code CDC2, telephone (850) 230-7692; fax (850) 234-4197; or e-mail address Miles.Hooper@navy.mil.

<DESC>In accordance with FAR Parts 12 Commercial Items and  FAR Part 13 Simplified Procedures, The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Assessment and Standards Division, National Vehicle and Fuel Emissions Laboratory (NVFEL), Ann Arbor, Michigan, requires a contractor to provide  a Combustion Aerosol Standards (CAST) with a particulate matter (PM) range of  10nm-200nm or larger. EPA has recognized the need for on-board vehicle exhaust particulate mass (PM) emissions measurement.  The CAST source can produce the type of PM that is generated during the operation of an internal combustion engine (i.e., gasoline fueled spark ignition engines, diesel fueled compression ignition engines, and aircraft engines). Hence, the specifications of the CAST to be procured will be dependent on those widely known characteristics of PM emissions from internal combustion engines, and the most current technology available.  The contractor must provide CAST and software per product specifications. The equipment implementation shall allow for the integration and the ability to fully control the analyzer functions, data collection, processing and reporting in keeping with the current operations.  The delivered CAST shall be new and meet each of the minimum specifications.  The CAST shall include a standard commercial one-year warranty covering all parts and labor.  Training shall be provided to include full descriptions of all functions of the system, hardware, software, operation and maintenance.  The acquisition of this Commercial item will be subject to Full and Open Competition under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 334513 - Instruments and Related Products Manufacturing for Measuring, Displaying, and Controlling Industrial Process Variables with a size standard of 500 employees.  Award will be made on a Best Value Basis.   All responsible sources may submit a quote which shall be considered by the Agency.  Point of Contact for this requirement is Gerold Young, Contract Specialist, at (513) 487-2660, or by email at young.gerold@epa.gov.  Questions must be submitted in writing to Gerold Young via email.

<a href="mailto:alexander.holtet@navy.mil">Contract Specialist</a>
<DESC>UPDATE 04 March 2013:  The purpose of this update is to clarify the Government's intent regarding the request for industry feedback on RFI N00039-14-R-0001.  The Government currently seeks comments from interested parties on the NTCDL SPS and Annexes, via the Microsoft Excel 2003 spreadsheet which was provided with the RFI announcement as a template (file name: NTCDL_RFI_Comment_Form.xls).   In addition, the Government seeks input from interested parties on the various subjects (i.e. Architecture, Performance, Cost) identified in the RFI announcement (file name: RFI PMW 170 NTCDL 8 January 2013.pdf).    Industry comments on the subjects identified in the RFI announcement should be provided to the Government as a separate attachment, in Portable Document Format (.PDF).  Interested parties should provide both forms of input (both files) in one response, due no later than 14 March 2013, 14:00 PST.  Responses shall be submitted via e-mail only to alexander.holtet@navy.mil and heidi.radaford@navy.mil.  Note: email submissions 10MB or larger will automatically be rejected by NMCI so please take this into account when preparing a response.  ************************************************************** UPDATE 25 February 2013: Below is a question received from industry regarding the subject RFI and the Government's response:  Q:)  Is the requirement stated in paragraph 3.4.2, Line 1783-1785 truly intended to allow SWAP for both one flat Panel and Two Large Radome Equipped Antenna Configurations for up to 8 physically separate Rx and Tx Subsystem units and 8 physically separate large antenna units for a total of 16 units with SWAP specified in Tables 3-17 and Table 3-18?  A:)  No, the SWAP cited does not allow for 8 large antenna units.  The parameters of the dishes cited are for reference only.  The RFI is intended for Industry to propose a CDL solution for the threshold requirements.  How the RF sub-system is designed/developed is up to the vendors.  The threshold requirement to be addressed is 5 simultaneous 360 degree-capable CDL missions, to include a maximum range, maximum data rate mission.  ************************************************************** UPDATE 19 February 2013: The Government is hereby extending the time allowed for RFI responses from 28 February 2013 to 14 March 2013, 14:00 PST.  *************************************************************** UPDATE 28 January 2013: Below is a question received from industry regarding the subject RFI and the Government's response:  Q:) Currently, only two contractors have access to KGV-135A devices.  What option is the government considering to allow other contractors, who don't have access to these cryptographic devices, to bid compliant solutions?  A:) The Government does not believe that any vendor needs access to the COMSEC chip/device in order to propose a compliant solution.  However after award determination, the Government will provide the COMSEC chip/device as GFE on the contract to the successful offeror only.  *********************************************************** UPDATE 08 January 2013  The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWAR) in support of the Program Management Warfare / Airborne (PMW/A) 170 is seeking comments from industry on the draft System Performance Specification (SPS) and appendices in preparation for the Network Tactical Common Data Link (NTCDL)acquisition.  THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes  it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. This request for information does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. Further, the Navy is not at this time seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals. Responders are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI; all costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested party's expense. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any is issued. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website and the SPAWAR E-Commerce Central website at https://e-commerce.spawar.navy.mil. It is the responsibility of the potential offerors to monitor these sites for additional information pertaining to this requirement.  Interested parties are requested to respond to this RFI with comments on the subjects identified in the attached RFI announcement (below) entitled, "RFI PMW 170 NTCDL 8 January 2013.pdf."

Each company may request access for up to two representatives.  Each user is required to be a U.S. DoD contractor and have a valid DoD or ECA issued PKI certificate to gain access to the website. If an interested company is a U.S. DoD contractor and does not have a valid DoD or ECA-issued PKI certificate, contact alexander.holtet@navy.mil for further instruction.

<DESC> <br>  The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New England District is issuing a solicitation set aside for certified small business contractors for the repair of the wharf located along the east side of the Block Island Harbor, Block Island, Rhode Island.  The NAICS code for the work described below is 237990, size standard of $33.5M.  The project is planned to be issued in April 2013 as a Small Business Lowest Bid award. The construction will begin after the summer tourist season, and extend over one-two months.  Cost will be in $100,000 to $500,000 range.  Any responsible source meeting this standard may submit a bid to be considered by the New England District.  <br>    <br>  The work of this project involves repairing a wharf damaged by the storm surge from Hurricane Sandy.  The wharf is located on the eastern side of the inner basin of old harbor on Block Island, Rhode Island, and is in front of Ballard's Inn.  Numerous inboard pile caps have become elevated above the tops of the inboard timber piles.  The work involves removing some of the 4 quote mark  x 10 quote mark  deck planks and timber wheel guards in order to provide access to the pile caps.  Sand and rip rap will need to be excavated or moved around each of the inboard piles in order to provide the room necessary to reseat the pile caps on top of the piles.  Once the pile caps are reseated on the inboard piles, steel straps (two per pile) will be installed at each pile, including the outboard piles.  No excavation is necessary at the outboard piles.  After the pile caps have been reseated and the straps installed, the existing timber decking and timber wheel guards shall be reinstalled using existing hardware.  In addition, the inboard fascia board shall be replaced in-kind and two ladders on the outboard face of the wharf shall be replaced.  <br>    <br>  The work of the project requires construction operations immediately adjacent to a busy public restaurant.  Barricades and chain link safety fencing shall be installed in this location to separate the general public from the active construction areas of the project.  The barricades and safety fencing shall be installed prior to the start of all other onsite activities.  The Contractor shall modify and implement other construction methods as necessary to ensure the safety of the public in this area.  <br>    <br>  Please note this solicitation is set aside for certified small businesses under the applicable NAICS code 237990, size standard of $33.5M. This is not a request for proposals at this time, the solicitation requirements and contract documents to include instructions for submission and the response date will be available on or about April 16, 2013.  Neither telephonic, mailed, nor faxed requests for hard copies of this solicitation will be accepted.

<p align="left">Ballard Building</p>
<p align="left">43655 Kalifonsky Beach Road</p>
<p align="left">Soldotna, AK 99669-8218</p>
<p align="left">The General Services Administration (GSA) currently leases 5,010 ABOA/RSF of office and warehouse space</p>
<p align="left">(see NOTE below re: square footage) on behalf of the above stated agency at the Ballard Building. The</p>
<p align="left">current lease expires on 11/4/2012. This memo is in furtherance of a succeeding lease action under the</p>
<p align="left">Simplified Succeeding Lease Model, with the incumbent lessor without full and open competition for continued</p>
<p align="left">occupancy at this leased location. The prevailing authority is GSAR 570.203-2(b): If soliciting only one</p>
<p align="left">source, document the file to explain the lack of competition.</p>
<p align="left">The U.S. Department of Interior Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) operates a field office in Soldotna. Soldotna is</p>
<p align="left">a small Kenai Peninsula community and tourism destination with a population of 4,087 (2005). The facility is</p>
<p align="left">approximately 3.2 miles from the center of the primary Soldotna business center and has operated there since</p>
<p align="left">1997. The agency has confirmed the continuing need for this facility and that the current location meets all of</p>
<p align="left">its requirements. In light of current budget constraints, relocation and related move costs are limited.</p>
<p align="left">Further, GSAM 570.402-5 allows for negotiation with the incumbent lessor when a cost-benefit analysis shows</p>
<p align="left">that the Government cannot expect to recover relocation and duplication costs through competition. A</p>
<p align="left">succeeding lease will insure that the FWS will remain at the current location and not interrupt operations, while</p>
<p align="left">also providing for the long term need. Award to other than the current Lessor would require relocation of the</p>
<p align="left">entire requirement and would cause the agency to incur move and replication costs that would not be</p>
<p align="left">recovered through competition, as more specifically detailed below.</p>

<p align="left">This succeeding lease model provides a streamlined approach to succeeding leases where requirements have</p>
<p align="left">not changed and a stay in place solution is appropriate. Under this succeeding lease model, the space will be</p>
