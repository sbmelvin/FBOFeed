<DESC>TITLE:  NNA06CD65CG4S Government Solutions, Inc.(formerly Wackenhut Services Inc.) NASA/ARC has a requirement to extend the period of performance of Contract NNA06CD65C with G4S Government Solutions, Inc.(formerly Wackenhut Services Inc.), on a sole-source basis, pursuant to 10.U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements. The performance period will be extended for a maximum of ten (10) months (April 1, 2013-January 31, 2014) and will consist of a four-month base period (inclusive of a sixty day phase-in/phase-out period) and six one-month option periods.  A contract modification reflecting this extension and resultant increase in the estimated Cost Plus- Award Fee (CPAF) of the contract will be issued on or before March 31, 2013, the expiration date of the current fire prevention services contract. Contract NNA06CD65C, was awarded as a result of full and open competition on June 28, 2006 with an effective contract date of July 1, 2006. The contract provides fire prevention services to the NASA Ames Research Center (ARC) facilities, the Ames Research Center Campus, Ames Research Center East Side, NASA Research Park (NRP) the University Affiliated Research Center (UARC), Moffett Federal Airfield and Moffett Community Housing (Orion Park Community). These services, consisting of the emergency response, technical, and support services provided by a fire department or fire service provider include, but are not limited to, the following: control and extinguishment of hostile fire involving buildings, structures, vehicles, transportation equipment, vegetation, refuse, and miscellaneous properties; aircraft rescue fire-fighting; technical rescue; emergency medical services; hazardous material response, fire prevention and code enforcement; fire investigation; fire-rescue automatic and mutual aid; resource management; emergency apparatus/vehicle maintenance and repair; training and education; fire/life safety public education/awareness and community relations; contract management and administrative services; management of records; and emergency management/disaster preparedness. This extension is necessary to maintain the critical fire protection services until the current procurement process for the follow-on contract has been completed and a new contract awarded. Because G4S Government Solutions, Inc. provides unique expertise in meeting the fire protection requirements of the Center, no alternate source could adequately provide for the maintenance of the Centers fire prevention program during this brief extension period. Award to another source during the procurement phase of the follow-on contract would result not only in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition, but also unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agencys requirement. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Notwithstanding this stated intent, interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on February 21, 2013. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All questions MUST be in writing and should be directed to Ms. Drake not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on February 21, 2013. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. NASA Clause 1852.215-84, Ombudsman, is applicable. The Center Ombudsman for this acquisition can be found at http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/pub/pub_library/Omb.html	.

STATEMENT OF BID ITEM(S) 
BID ITEM I, GENERAL, MECHANICAL AND ELECTRICAL CONSTRUCTION AND TEMPORARY WORK: Work includes general construction, Mechanical and Electrical work including, utility systems, electrical upgrades, mechanical upgrades and installation of temporary boilers necessary removal of existing work items and construction and certain other items.   The intent of this project is to provide corrective work in steam manholes (replacing defective steam traps), underground steam lines as well as work in Buildings 1,5,6,7,8 & 66 for compliance with the ASME B31.1, AMSE Pressure Vessel Code, BPVC-2010, the Life Safety Code, and VA Standards identified in VA Design Guides and Manuals.  Manhole sump pumps and power to sump pump controls will also be corrected.  Corrective work for steam service valves, miscellaneous steam equipment, drainage and controls in the Boiler Plant is also in this scope of work.
1.	Site Steam
a.	The replacement of the steam lines serving the Plumbing Shop (Building 8) shall be the part of the underground steam site work.  The existing lines from just inside of the Power House (Building 7) to just beyond the pit in Building 8 shall be.  New valving (replacement and restoration of isolation and pressure reducing valves) inside of Building 7 to correct condensate flow as well as new valving inside of Building 8 (Isolation valves).  Increasing the size of the manhole inside of Building 7 as well as installation of a new condensate pump in Building 7 and the removal of the condensate pump in building 8.
b.	Within the existing manholes, the replacement of all steam traps, check valves, strainers and piping between the isolation valves ( and including the replacement of the isolation valves) on either side of the installed assembly.  Steam traps for steam line drip service must handle normal steady state radiation and convection heat loss condensate and also high levels of condensate and air flow when the steam line is being warmed-up.  Caution must be exercised when sizing the traps because oversized traps can "blow-through" (fail open) and lose their prime.  Caution: Fixed orifice steam traps with no operating mechanism should not be applied on steam line drip service.  VA experience is that the small diameter orifices become plugged with dirt and the trap fails closed.  This will cause build-up of condensate in the steam main and dangerous water hammer may occur.  Work within these manholes is to be considered work within confined spaces and all OHSA requirements are to be met per the VA safety guidelines.
c.	Replacement of manhole sump pumps with single pump units with alarm capability, fixed float arm control and status indication.   Replacement of sump pump controls and installation of new alarm equipment to indicate failure or high water levels in the manhole sumps.
d.	Removal of the existing venting of the piping jackets from the large manhole reliefs.  The piping jackets shall be vented to individual vents thru the top of the manhole.  Each of these individual vents shall be tagged and labeled to indicate exact service of each piping jacket vent.
e.	New steam piping from building 8 and new condensate to meet the underground feed between building 7 and 8 is to be installed.
f.	The piping from manhole #1 to the building is to be replaced as part of this project.  
2.	Building 1
a.	The existing expansion joints to be replaced.  Full scope of work requires ICRA enclosure to obtain access to the expansion joint as well as addressing the physical removal and replacement of the expansion joint.  Asbestos abatement is part of this scope as the work relates to the gasketing between flanges.
3.	Building 5
a.	The safety relief vent for this building is being relocated from the current attic location to run outside of the building and up above the roof line.
4.	Building 6
a.	The piping from manhole #1 to the building is to be replaced as part of this project.  Likewise, remedial work interior to the building at the steam service entrance needs to be re-worked and insulated accordingly.
5.	Building 7
a.	Installation of a temporary boiler and boiler bypass line to allow shutdown of the boiler in the power plant in order to service all valves and associated items.
b.	The replacement of all shutoff valves on the steam header as well as pressure reducing valves (Basement level) and relief valves (Mezzanine level).  All boiler non-return stop valves are indicated as well.
c.	Replacement of the main steam distribution service's existing pressure reducing station valves is part of this project.
d.	The piping from the boilers to the blowdown tank is to be replaced as well as the piping from the blowdown tank to the sub-cooler valve and drain.  A new blowdown tank is being indicated as well as new piping from the condensate pumps to the feedwater/deareator  tanks.  Likewise, demolition of an abandoned fire line and hose cabinet, as well as a new domestic water feed has been included.  New boiler sample tubing is also included.
e.	New trench drains as well as new a new oil separator and exterior sanitary piping.
f.	Rework of the piping and pit for steam service to building 8.  Remedial work interior to the building at the steam service to Building 8 (inside Building 7) needs to be re-worked to insure proper condensate flow and insulated accordingly.
6.	Building 8
a.	The existing underground steam and condensate lines from the Power House (Building 7) and the Plumbing Shop (Building 8) are to be replaced and both ends reworked accordingly.  
7.	Building 66
a.	New steam piping from building 8 and new condensate to meet the underground feed between building 7 and 8 is to be installed.

<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial', 'sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 8.5pt"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></span>One or more of the items under this acquisition may be subject to an Agreement on Government Procurement approved and implemented in the United States by the Trade Agreements Act of 1979.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>All offers shall be in the English language and in U.S. dollars.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>All interested suppliers may submit an offer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer may utilize on-line Reverse Auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation. During the course of the on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The solicitation will be available in FedBizOpps on its issue date of<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>2/25/13.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Small Business size standard is 1000 <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>employees.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Specifications, plans or drawings are not available.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Proposed procurement contains a<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>25 % option for increased quantities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This acquisition is for supplies for which the Government does not possess complete, unrestrictive technical data;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>therefore, the Government intends to solicit and contract with only approved sources under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Approved sources are: <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Engineered Arresting Systems (21439); Victor Balata ( 87679).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While price may be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final award decision will be based upon a combination of price, delivery, past performance and other evaluation factors as described in the solicitation.</p>

<SUBJECT>NOTICE OF INTENT TO SOLE SOURCE:  Atom Based Dimensional Metrology
<SOLNBR>NB683020-13-01390
<RESPDATE>022113
<CONTACT>Paula Wilkison, Contract Specialist, Phone 301-975-8448, Email paula.wilkison@nist.gov - Todd D Hill, Contracting Officer, Phone 301-975-8802, Email todd.hill@nist.gov
<DESC>The Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), intends to negotiate a firm fixed price purchase order, on a sole source basis, with the University of Maryland of College Park, Maryland for atom based dimensional metrology services utilizing NIST's Omicron UHV-STM system under other than full and open competition by the authority of FAR subpart 6.302-1: Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.<br />
<p><br />NIST provides technological leadership to nanotechnology manufacturing and other government agencies by developing the methods, tools, and artifacts needed for the development of nanometer scale and atomic-resolution dimensional measurement.  The focus is to assist the metrology needs of advanced nanolithography needs for nanotechnology manufacturing.  One goal is to develop techniques and standards needed to make dimensional measurements on wafers with features whose dimensions are based on atomic counting methods. The atom-based dimensional metrology project is developing methods to fabricate structures on the near atomic scale whose dimensions can be measured and traced directly to the intrinsic crystal lattice.  These samples are intended to be dimensionally stable and allow transfer to other measurement tools which can measure the artifacts with dimensions known on the sub-nanometer scale. This work requires significant expertise and understanding of the surface preparation, hydrogen termination, and patterning physics of silicon surfaces to enable repeatable sample preparation and the development of nanometer scale surface lithography, in addition to the development of atomic scale silicon surface patterning and silicon depassivation and oxidation.</p>
<p>The requirement for the development of methods and fabrication elements to conduct this work was originally competed via full and open competition in 2011.  The resultant order was awarded to the University of Maryland (SB1341-11-SE-1353).</p>
<p>As a result of the work performed under SB1341-11-SE-1353, the University of Maryland developed hardware and sample processing for the Omicron UHV scanning tunneling systems as well as STM tip preparation and analysis.  The UMD also developed a UHV high temperature silicon process that reconstructs the sample into long range atomic order with fiducial marks present.  This is an Omicron/NIST specific process developed by UMD personnel under the previous contract.  This preparation includes an extensive detailed set of chemical cleaning and preparation steps as well as specific UHV sample loading, transfer and annealing procedures using the specific hardware at NIST on the Omicron STM.  The UMD has also developed a unique STM tip preparation and analysis using field ion and field electron analysis of Tungsten tips.  This procedure involves STM tip cleaning, FIFEM processing and an extended thermal annealing process specific to the NIST UHV facility.  This includes a specific process on the NIST Omicron tip heating station to achieve atomically sharp tips.  Detailed depassivation procedures were also developed by UMD personnel.</p>
<p>To train a new contractor would require at least 6 months, even if that contractor had extensive experience in UHV STM and silicon surface preparations.  It would involve a significant investment in cost and time to complete the training necessary to enable a PhD level contractor to use the UMD developed processing methods.  The cost of this training would not be recouped through competition, and the time required for this training (estimated at six months) represents an unacceptable delay.</p>
<p>The University of Maryland is the only contractor who can provide the atom based dimensional metrology services that meet NIST's requirements.  Therefore, the University of Maryland is uniquely qualified to provide the required atom based dimensional metrology services.</p>
<p>Delivery shall be FOB Destination, Gaithersburg, MD, and be completed no later than April 30, 2014.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 541990, and the size standard is $14.0M.</p>
<p>No solicitation package will be issued.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement.  The Government will consider responses received by 3:00 p.m. (Eastern) on February 21, 2013.  Inquiries will only be accepted via email to paula.wilkison@nist.gov.  No telephone requests will be honored.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in the future.</p>

<DESC><p>Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) intends to award a Sole Source Firm-Fixed Price contract to Hamilton Sundstrand of 4400 Ruffin Road, San Diego, CA 92186-5757, for the procurement of the APS3240 APU, which consists of an Auxiliary Power Unit (APU), and an Electronic Control Box (ECB). This procurement will also cover associated production and line replaceable unit (LRU) spares in support of the E-6B Mercury Aircraft, pursuant to the authority provided in 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), as implemented in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1 "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements." Under the proposed effort, Hamilton Sundstrand will supply the United States Navy with the required APS3240 APU (government nomenclature T-62T-48LC-1) in support of the modernization of the Auxiliary Power Units in the E-6B Mercury aircraft.</p>
<p>Under the Block IA ECP (NAVAIR contract N00019-09-C-0056), the United States Navy awarded a sole source contract for the design, and development of the modification of the E-6B APU configuration. All aircraft design and modifications are based on the Hamilton Sundstrand APS3240 APU. Included in the modification was the customization of the Hamilton Sundstrand APU, which is the APU selected by the Prime contractor who is the Block IA designer and developer of the ECP. Utilization of a different APU would necessitate a new design, validation and verification which would result in a substantial duplication of cost to the Government.</p>

<DESC>The NAVSUP Fleet Logistics Center (FLC) Norfolk, Contracting Department, Philadelphia Office intends to issue Booz Allen Hamilton on an other than full and open competitive basis, a cost plus fixed fee contract for the Command, Control, Communications, and Computers/Cyber Requirements Integration and Assessments to the Joint Staff J6 for the period from 01 April 2013 through 31 March 2014.  The estimated level of effort is 44,683 man-hours. Performance of the required services requires that contractor personnel possess a current Top Secret (TS) Clearance and the contractor to possess and maintain a Top Secret (TS) facility clearance from the Defense Security Service. This is an interim action and the resultant contract will provide the requiring activity with the necessary services while the contracting office solicits and awards a contract or contracts through competitive procedures.
 Booz Allen Hamilton is currently providing the required services under task order SP0700-98-D-4002 Task Order 0415 and is the only known source that can assist in the mission to provide comprehensive identification, analysis and management of requirements and supporting architectures, integration, test and assessment of information technology and systems interoperability for Command, Control, Communications, and Computers (C4), and Cyber capabilities. This requirement also includes C4/Cyber requirements and architecture development, management of data strategies and data services, identification of joint interoperability requirements, gaps, and solutions and systems integration.  C4 and Cyber requirements are currently in sensitive stages of development and assessment.
  The Command and Control (C2) systems and operational architectures are under-going critical tests and assessments to evaluate performance and to identify and resolve interoperability issues.  Both newly developed C2 technology and architectures are in high demand by the warfighter and developer commands.  Abandoning the efforts at this point would not be a responsible option and would jeopardize the mission of the J6 Deputy Director Command and Control Integration (DD C2I) and its support to the warfighter.  Additionally, the rapid development of architectures, DoD data strategies and data services, requires continuity to ensure no delays to schedule or increase in costs for deployment. Booz Allen Hamilton is the only known contractor who has the experience, personnel, and expertise to maintain the continuity of services without disrupting the mission of the J6 DD C2I by 01 April 2013.
 The solicitation will be made available electronically, upon its release, at www.neco.navy.mil. Interested parties are solely responsible for monitoring the above mentioned website for posting of the solicitation and any amendments thereto. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement by 22 February 2013. This notice of intent is not a request for proposals. However, the Government will consider information received by 22 February 2013.

<DESC>The US EPA intends to procure on a sole source basis a set of components and subsystems that comprise weather stations from Campbell Scientific for the Office of Research and Development (ORD), National Risk Management Research Laboratory (NRMRL).  These components and subsystems must interface with existing sensor-logger inventory so as to compose a complete system for sensing of environmental data for green infrastructure projects implemented pursuant to research under the Safe and Sustainable Water Resources Program.  The components include radios, modems, sensors, connectors, and subsystems that comprise weather stations.  A list of the main items required is below:
*	5	ET Stations *	2   	900 MHz Spread Spectrum Radio Kits *	3   	900 MHz Spread Spectrum Radios (tested -25 to 50 C) *	5   	800 MHz 1dBd Omni Cellular Antennas *	6   	900 MHz 3dBd Omni Antennas *	3   	Wireless Sensor Bases 900 MHz *	30 	Wireless Soil Water Probes 900 MHz (Alk Batt w/lid) *	30 	Wireless Soil Water Probes 900 MHz (RC Batt w/Solar Panels) *	4   	Water Conductivity Probes  25 ft cable per probe *	2   	Water Conductivity Probes  -- 45 ft cable per probe *	4   	Measurement & Control Dataloggers (Tested -25 to 50 C) *	3  	Weather-Resistant 16X18 inch enclosures *	5 	12v Charging Regulators *	5	12cm Water Content Reflectometers -- Plus 25 ft cable per probe *	Various mounting kits, cables and accessories.
The nature of the acquisition requires a contractor that possesses the unique capabilities of supplying a broad range of components and subsystems to complete EPA's present gaps in existing Campbell Scientific inventory so as to assemble complete monitoring systems for green infrastructure research in various US locations.  To meet the Government's needs, the components and subsystems must be compatible with EPA's existing Campbell Scientific inventory, and the Campbell Scientific equipment used by EPA's partners at the USGS.  Since the order list is extensive, the sole source justification centers on compatibility issues among Campbell and other brand gear regardless of comparability amongst different brand's technical specifications.  In addition, utilizing equipment from the same vendor would decrease problems caused by calibrations and specifications that vary across brands.  
THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATIONS.  However, any firm that believes it is capable of meeting this EPA requirement must submit technical documentation to establish its assertion.  This documentation must be submitted to the POC within fifteen (15) days of the electronic posting of this notice.  Telephone requests will not be honored.  A determination not to compete the proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the EPA.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement or to proceed on a sole source basis.  The anticipated award date is March 18, 2013.

<DESC>Veterans Health Administration (VHA) Veterans Integrated Service Network 1 (VISN 1 New England) has a requirement for an Anesthesia Record Keeping Clinical Information System (ARK-CIS).  VISN 1 is posting a request for proposals for solutions  to the problem describe as follows:  Historical methods of capturing patient vitals in the operating and intensive care environments has relied heavily on paper flow-sheets and the manual entry of data into the computerized patient record. This current process prevents information from being available in real-time and creates inefficiencies in obtaining clinical information, in documenting patient care, and in billing and reimbursement milestones. Moreover, the use of manual flow-sheets allows the undesirable introduction of non-standardized techniques and terminology used in documenting patient-care across the VA healthcare continuum.  In conformance with a VA national initiative the contractor shall implement an Anesthesia Record Keeping (ARK) Clinical Information System (CIS) at each of the six major VA medical centers in New England. The contractor shall implement a product that is capable of capturing data from various independent medical devices and automatically integrating them into the computerized patient record through a Veterans Integrated System Technology Architecture (VistA) Data Bridge. The implementation of an Analytics Database shall allow large volumes of patient information from across the VA healthcare continuum to be available to clinicians for diagnostic and research applications.  The contractor shall implement a robust, scalable, integrated, enterprise solution which achieves measurable  efficiencies of data management in the VISN clinical environment.  The contractor's solution shall result in reductions in burden on clinicians by replacing paper templates used to document clinical data elements in the Operating Room (OR) environment; enhancement of patient safety by integrating clinical data directly into computerized records (VistA) for real-time documentation and continuous availability of patient data to clinicians; reduction of risk of errors by limiting manual processes in capturing data; improvement of accuracy of medical coding by enhancing documentation throughout revenue cycle; and standardize documentation workflow and terminology, inter alia.  The VA is contemplating the award of a five-year Indefinite Delivery Contract (IDC), firm fixed price (FFP) with contractor sustainment and support post installation.  In its offer the contractor shall propose a complete warranty, hardware, software, installation and logistical sustainment solution.  The initial task order shall be issued concurrently with award of the basic contract.

The FSC 6515.
This information is current through FAC 2005-65.
Vendors shall monitor this site for the posting of the RFP; the  RFP is available only through FBO, the Government Point of Entry (GPE).  Proposals are due thirty days (30) days after posting of the RFP.
For questions relating to this RFP send email inquiries (no phone calls) to the Contract Specialist listed.  Place "ARK-CIS RFP VA241-13-R-0188" in the subject line.

<DESC><p><strong>I. Description / Purpose:</strong></p>
<p>1. The SMC Development Planning Directorate (XR) intends to hold the general session of the Wide Field of View (WFOV) Hosted Payload (HP) Project Industry Day from 0830hrs PST to 1230hrs PST at the Gordon Conference Center, Area 2 in Building 270 on 12 March 2013. Check-in will begin at 0800hrs PST. The Industry Day will not be open to the public or press.</p>
<p>2. The purpose of this Industry Day is to provide interested organizations with an overview of the WFOV HP Project and obtain industry feedback on objectives, requirements definition and cost realism. This is an opportunity for both the Government and Industry to gather more information.</p>
<p>3. After the general session and presentations, individual sessions with interested companies will be scheduled during the remainder of a two-day period. As needed, these individual sessions will be focused on potential payloads that can contribute to primary mission objectives as documented in the Draft Technical Requirements Document (TRD). These meetings can be held at the Unclassified, DoD Classified Secret, and DOD Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) levels to accommodate the needs of the respondent. Organizations are requested to indicate the classification level requested to support their planned discussions.</p>
<p>4. The Government is seeking market research from Industry based upon the following provided information:<br /><br />a. DRAFT WFOV Hosted Payload Project TRD<br />b. DRAFT SMI OPIR Security Classification Guide<br />c. Notional Acquisition Schedule<br />d. Instructions for Classified Example of CHIRP Data<br />e. Questions to Industry for One-on-One Discussions</p>
<p>These documents listed above in paragraph 4 can be reviewed at the Bidders Library located at: https://contractors.losangeles.af.mil/Livelink/llisapi.dll. Interested organizations will be required to register your designated representative with the Government points of contact (POC) listed in Section VII to be authorized access to this site. Access to the classified example of CHIRP data must be arranged with the Government POCs listed in Section VII.</p>
<p><strong>II. Background:<br /><br /></strong>1. In December 2011, SMC/XR, in cooperation with the Infrared Space Systems Directorate (SMC/IS), issued a pre-solicitation notice (12-020) to identify qualified infra-red (IR) payload providers for a future WFOV payload procurement in support of the SMC/IS Space Modernization Initiative (SMI). Despite delays in authority to proceed, this Industry Day Notice is a continuation of that pre-solicitation notice. This procurement, currently known as WFOV HP Project, will be conducted by the SMC/XR Hosted Payload Office (HPO). It involves the design, fabrication, test, delivery and support during spacecraft integration and testing (I&amp;T), and post-launch operations of one staring Overhead Persistent Infrared (OPIR) WFOV payload. The payload is intended to be hosted on a commercial satellite. The selection and assignment for spacecraft integration and launch will be made at a future date and is not part of this acquisition.</p>
<p>2. At present, the Government is conducting market research for this procurement to determine whether the payload can be delivered within the cost and schedule targets identified. Government objectives are to deliver the payload for calibration within 30 months after Authority To Proceed (ATP) at a cost goal of $40M.</p>
<p><strong>III. Industry Day Details:<br /><br /></strong>1. The general session of the Industry Day will take place from 0830hrs PST to 1230hrs PST at the Gordon Conference Center, Area 2 in Building 270 on 12 March 2013. Check-in will begin at 0800hrs PST. Up to five (5) representatives from each contractor team will be allowed to attend. Additional representatives may be allowed if requested in advance and approved.</p>
<p>2. Industry Day Participants must be US citizens or legal residents and must have their company submit visit requests for each attendee submitted via e-mail to the government POC below NLT 1700 PST on 22 February 2013. The visit request form is included in the bidder's library.</p>

<DESC>The US Army Night Vision and Electronic Sensors Directorate, Countermine Division, Humanitarian Demining Branch, is seeking sources for building and delivering a Mine Stalker III, anti-tank (AT) landmine detection system. The Mine Stalker III system, previously developed by the Humanitarian Demining Branch, integrates a NIITEK ground penetrating radar (GPR) array with navigation and positioning sensor data onto an AT mine survivable commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) Multidrive 4x4 tractor to accurately detect and mark suspect AT mine locations in roads. The Government seeks to procure a second prototype Mine Stalker III to evaluate performance in multiple geographical locations. The intent of this market research is to identify potential sources for building and delivering a second Mine Stalker III system and associated spare parts for a humanitarian demining operational field evaluation in mined areas outside the continental United States (OCONUS). In addition to delivering a Mine Stalker III system, sources are sought with further capabilities to develop and test enhancements to the system that can minimize operator training requirements and improve the reliability, detection performance, false alarm rate, user-interface and sensor calibration routines. Responses should include a description of the offerors capability to conduct hardware and software development and testing on vehicle mounted detection systems and on the Mine Stalker III system specifically.  <br>  <br> The Government will accept responses from sources with a demonstrated ability to build an integrated system that meets the following performance criteria: 1) operate a 3.2-m wide array of the latest model NIITEK GPR antennas and associated detection and graphical user interface software, 2) process sensor data real-time with automatic target recognition algorithms that detect AT landmine targets, 3) integrate differential GPS and inertial measurement unit data to digitally map sensor path and alarm locations with centimeter level accuracy, 4) integrate an automatic braking and marking system to stop the vehicle on each detection and physically mark the suspect target locations, 5) provide in-vehicle display and secondary wireless remote display of diagnostic information of each critical subsystem and 3-D visualization of alarm data, 6) provide in-vehicle controls for the sensor mount, data and power management, 7) provide a mounting bracket with the capability to auto-level the GPR array during detection operations and stowing the GPR array during transportation, 8) integrate all systems onto a Multidrive 4x4 tractor, 9) provide a comprehensive spare parts package to support an OCONUS evaluation for a period of no less than 12 months. <br>  <br> Potential sources are also asked to describe capabilities to make enhancements to the current Mine Stalker III system. Specifically, the Government is seeking sources capable of improving the detection and false alarm performance against AT landmine threats in humanitarian demining operational environments, and capable of developing additional features for the Mine Stalker III such as remote control, routines for sensor auto calibration, integration of the system onto other commercial-off-the-shelf platforms and other hardware and software improvements to the system that will be identified during evaluation of the Mine Stalker III system in live operational environments. <br>  <br> Sources possessing the capability to produce a Mine Stalker III system that satisfy the requirements listed are invited to submit a White Paper not to exceed 10 pages in length providing a description of their system. The White Paper must include at a minimum: 1) a description of their system and validating information supporting the claims that the proposed system meets the system requirements, 2) technical specifications of their system, 3) any performance data of their system against AT mine targets, 4) estimated cost for building a system that meets the system requirements, 5) estimated schedule for delivery of the system, 6) a description of capabilities to develop enhancements to the system.

<DESC><p>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)<br />ILAB-OTLA 2013 Contract Research Program:<br />Experimental Design Strategies for Improving Labor Inspection Systems</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION OF INFORMATION REQUESTED:</p>
<p>1. Pursuant to FAR 15.201(a), Exchanges with industry before receipt of proposals, this RFI is a request for information only and does not seek submission of formal proposals. In conducting market research and acquisition planning, the USDOL seeks to obtain information from industry that identifies capabilities; to obtain feedback from industry regarding the attached draft Performance Work Statement (PWS); to obtain a rough estimate for performance of this type effort ; to obtain information regarding performance requirements, deliverables, schedules, and to other market information (e.g., contract type, commerciality, NAICS/size) that will assist in defining the requirement development of the solicitation. Responses to this Notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract</p>
<p>2. The United States Department of Labor (DOL) is conducting market research for an anticipated procurement requirement entitled "ILAB-OTLA 2013 Contract Research Program: Experimental Design Strategies for Improving Labor Inspection Systems", in support of the Bureau of International Labor Affairs (ILAB) program office. ILAB seeks research that identifies experimental designs to evaluate the impact of different labor enforcement strategies available to labor ministries (e.g., especially, labor inspection) on firm compliance with labor law and regulations. ILAB's current need is research that identifies experimental designs feasible for use in a low- to middle-income country.</p>
<p>ILAB's future implementation of a method(s) identified by this contract is subject to considerable uncertainty; including, the projected budgetary resources associated with the method(s), the availability of such resources in future years, desirability of staff versus external implementation, and the identification of appropriate host countries. Because of this uncertainty, should ILAB choose in the future to support external implementation of a proposed method, a later procurement action will be issued.</p>
<p>For more information please see the attached draft performance work statement (PWS) for this requirement. Industry feedback and/or questions regarding the draft PWS are encouraged. Comments received will assist the ILAB program office in describing the requirement and developing the final PWS.</p>
<p>3. Interested Service Providers responding to this RFI are requested to demonstrate their capability and experience by providing adequate details to address the following:</p>
<p>&bull; Demonstrate research in the area of labor inspection strategies or systems - or - the ability to partner with an expert on labor inspection strategies or systems?</p>
<p>&bull; Demonstrate experience designing an impact evaluation of public service in a low- to middle-income country - or - the ability to partner with an impact evaluation expert who has evaluated a public service in a low to middle-income country?<br /><br />&bull; Within the last three years, have you had a publication in, commitment to publish or "revise-and-resubmit" from a peer-reviewed journal? Describe.</p>
<p>&bull; Demonstrate and describe affiliation, if any, with a research institution</p>
<p>4. Describe any experience you may have coordinating research efforts with host governments in low to middle-income countries?</p>
<p>5. Please provide a reasonable rough order of magnitude (dollar estimate) for this type of research in terms of one of the following price ranges: <br />(a) Less than $25,000. <br />(b) Between $25,000 and $50,000. <br />(c) Between $50,000 and $75,000. <br />(d) Between $75,000 and $100,000. <br />(e) Between $100,000 and $150,000<br />(f) Between $150,000 and $200,000<br />(g) $200,000 or higher</p>
<p>6. Industry Invitation: Agencies are encouraged to promote early exchanges of information about future acquisitions. As such, the USDOL also intends to host one-on-one sessions with industry to exchange information regarding the acquisition strategy, including contract type, terms and conditions, feasibility of the requirement, performance requirements, deliverables/schedules; the PWS; and to address any other industry concerns or questions.</p>
<p>If you are interested in participating in this event, to be scheduled during February/March timeframe, include a cover letter with your capability statement that identifies contact information. Letters of interest in one-on-one sessions and capability statements are to be sent to the email address cited below. As only three (3) to five (5) days will be reserved for one-on-one-sessions, the USDOL reserves the right to limit the number of sessions to a reasonable number that can be accommodated within the allotted timeframe. USDOL anticipates no more than two (2) to three (3) sessions per day. Therefore, interested parties are encouraged to identify your interest in participation in this event and to provide contact information. Capability statements will be used in selecting one-one-one participants. Greater consideration will be given to selecting participants whose responses demonstrate capability and experience most related to the efforts described in the attached PWS. Contractors selected for participation will be notified by the Office of Procurement Services of the time and place for scheduled session. Sessions may take place via phone call or in-person. However, USDOL will not be responsible for travel costs.</p>
<p>7. Would you classify this type service as "commercial" or "non-commercial?" If non-commercial, please provide a short explanation.</p>
<p>8. Do you provide this service under a Federal Supply Schedule? If so, please identify the GSA contract number and applicable special item number (SIN).</p>
<p>9. Please identify the NAICS code for this service and the associated size standard.</p>
<p>10. The McNamara-O'Hara Service Contract Act (SCA) covers contracts entered into by federal and District of Columbia agencies that have as their principal purpose furnishing services in the U.S. through the use of "service employees." The definition of "service employee" includes any employee engaged in performing services on a covered contract other than a bona fide executive, administrative, or professional employee who meets the exemption criteria set forth in 29 CFR Part 541. Would employees performing services under this type requirement be covered under the SCA or be exempt as defined in 29 CFR 541?</p>

<DESC>MARKET RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY<br />NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL OR SOLICITATION
<p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), is conducting market research to support the Arkansas Regional Laboratory (ARL) requirement for a hybrid cleanup system and concentration units.</p>
<p>This sources sought notice is being issued to determine if small business manufacturers or small businesses capable of supplying a U.S. made product that satisfies our requirement of another small business manufacturer exist. The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 334516 - Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing; Small Business Size Standard is 500 employees.</p>
<p>Background: The FDA, Arkansas Regional Laboratory (ARL) requires an Automated Cleanup System and Concentration Units with post-warranty service/maintenance to facilitate the automated clean-up and concentration of dioxin, furan, PCB, and PBDE analyses in sample extracts from matrices including eggs, fish, feeds, dairy products and soil.</p>
<p>The ARL is the servicing lab for the FDA's Dioxin Program which focuses on the ultra-trace analysis of dioxins, furans, PCBs, and PBDEs. The sample extraction and cleanup for these analytes is very labor intensive and is susceptible to contamination during sample handling. ARL currently uses equipment from Fluid Management Systems for the liquid pressurized extraction and clean-up of various matrices. This request is for the purchase and installation of an additional cleanup system and concentration units to increase the sample handling capacity which will enhance productivity and minimize potential contamination by automating sample transfer and concentration steps for the clean-up. Specific requirements are as follows:</p>
<p>Automated Clean-up System</p>
<p>&bull; The system shall have the ability to simultaneously clean up (unattended after loading samples) up to six samples followed by a direct automated delivery of the cleaned sample extract to a concentration unit.</p>
<p>&bull; Sample sizes pre-extraction shall be 2 - 75 g for each matrix.</p>
<p>&bull; Clean-up solvents shall include methylene chloride, hexane, toluene, and ethyl acetate.</p>
<p>&bull; Each of the six samples shall be simultaneously cleaned via independently controlled module.</p>
<p>&bull; The automated clean-up procedure shall use various clean-up columns including AX-21 carbon, acidified silica gel, and activated alumina, with automated delivery to a concentration unit.</p>
<p>&bull; The clean-up process shall include the ability to automatically change the directional flow in order to load and elute the AX-21 carbon column using different solvents.</p>
<p>&bull; The clean-up process shall include the ability to collect multiple elution fractions off the columns, unattended.</p>
<p>&bull; Concentration shall be completed with a solvent evaporation step directly into a GC vial insert while unattended.</p>
<p>&bull; Concentration equipment shall consist of a waterless system.</p>
<p>&bull; Clean-up columns (alumina, acidified silica, basic silica, and AX-21 carbon) shall be certified to be phthalate, PCB, PBDE, and dioxin free.</p>

<p>Clinical Trials Support Unit (CTSU), a project within the Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP), Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis (DCTD), National Cancer Institute (NCI) is seeking capability statements from all eligible Small Businesses as stated above.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Background</span></strong></p>
<p>The NCI is one of the world's largest public sponsors of clinical trials in cancer, supporting a broad range of prevention, diagnostic, imaging, and treatment studies of new drugs, procedures and multi-modality approaches for oncology patients. Developmental work for new treatments (Phase 1 and 2 trials) has traditionally been carried out in a limited number of institutions while definitive studies comparing new treatments to the standard of care (Phase 3 trials) have required multi-center collaborations. The NCI, through its Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP), Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis (DCTD) and other Divisions/Programs (e.g. Division of Cancer Prevention, Cancer Centers Program), supports multiple sites and investigators in North America to collaborate in multi-center trials/studies (e.g. NCI Cooperative Groups Clinical Trials Program for treatment and radiology imaging, Specialized Programs of Research Excellence (SPORES), Community Clinical Oncology Programs (CCOPs), Minority-Based Community Clinical Oncology Programs (MB-CCOPs), Comprehensive/Clinical Cancer Centers Program, and CTEP Phase 1 and 2 Programs). These NCI multi-center programs each maintain the necessary infrastructure (e.g., scientific committees, statisticians, data managers and quality control monitors) needed to successfully perform clinical trials/studies.<br /><br />The CTSU provides a wide-variety of operational, administrative, regulatory, and logistical support services to NCI multi-center coordinating centers and participating sites. Historically these services were distributed through-out each multi-center coordinating centers. This distributed model was duplicative and inefficient. The CTSU was developed to eliminate duplicative efforts, provide central, standardized support to the NCI multi-center research programs, and improve the efficiency of multi-center trial operations.</p>
<p>The CTSU currently provides operational infrastructure support for the current NCI Cooperative Group Clinical Trials Program (<span style="text-decoration: underline;">http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/NCI/clinical-trials-cooperative-group</span>). Work done by the CTSU complements, but does not duplicate Cooperative Group activities; rather, under NCI guidance, the CTSU facilitates, in a centralized manner, the existing clinical trials activities with value-added standardized products and services. The NCI Cooperative Group Clinical Trials Program will be transitioned to a new program, entitled the NCI National Clinical Trials Network (NCTN) Program, in 2014. The CTSU will provide support for the new National Clinical Trials Network (NCTN) as well as several other NCI-supported Multi-Center Organizations (MCO).</p>
<p>This acquisition is the re-competition of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Cancer Trials Support Unit (CTSU) initiative. The initial CTSU contract (NO2-CM-97024) was awarded in 1999 to Westat, Inc. The contract (NO2-CM-62212) was re-competed in 2006 and again awarded to Westat, Inc.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Purpose and Objectives:</span></strong></p>
<p>The scope of this contract is to provide administrative, regulatory, logistical, and information technology support for the Cancer Trials Support Unit (CTSU) to gain operational efficiency for both CTSU and NCTN/MCOs, enhance proficiency, and deliver measurable business value. The Contractor shall build and maintain the operational infrastructure of the CTSU.</p>
<p>Historically, the CTSU has provided support for NCI Cooperative Group Clinical Trials Program's clinical treatment trial portfolio. The CTSU portfolio shall be expanded beyond this portfolio to take advantage of the opportunities and efficiencies for multi-center trial support. In this new award, the CTSU support activities will be broadened to the entire breadth of the clinical trial/study portfolio of the Cooperative Groups including, but not limited to, treatment, prevention, cancer control, imaging, comparative effectiveness and diagnostics which are sponsored by either the Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis or the Division of Cancer Prevention or NCI approved collaborations with those Divisions. In addition, by 03/01/2014, the NCI Cooperative Group Clinical Trials Program shall be transformed into the new NCI National Clinical Trials Network (NCTN) Program as Network Groups. The CTSU shall support the Groups prior to, during, and after their transformation to the NCTN Program. Finally the CTSU shall also provide support to other selected multi-center organizations outside of the NCTN Program including, but not limited to, the NCI Experimental Therapeutic Clinical Trials Network (ET-CTN), also known as the Early Clinical Trials Network (ECTN), supported by the Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis.</p>
<p>The goals and objectives of the CTSU initiative are:</p>
<p>-Facilitate investigator and research staff participation in selected NCI multi-center programs and their clinical trials/studies.<br />-Increase investigator and patient awareness and enrollment to cancer clinical trials/studies.<br />-Provide standardized, integrated, comprehensive support services to selected NCI multi-center programs.<br />-Identify best practices and streamline or eliminate redundant processes and procedures.<br />-Improve operational efficiency, enhance productivity and deliver products offering measurable business value to selected NCI multi-center programs.<br /><br /><br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Project Requirements</span></strong></p>
<p>The CTSU support activities are highly integrated and complex, and the multiple dependencies require tight process/system integration for project success. It is imperative the support activities are centralized to ensure improved efficiency of multi-center trial operations through improved communication, elimination of duplicative effort, and the development and use of standard systems and procedures.</p>
<p>These are the different parts to be performed under this initiative:<br /><br /><strong>Part I - Initial Transition Plan: <br /></strong>The Contractor shall ensure a smooth transition between the incumbent contract and the new award, if required. The Contractor shall transfer relevant files, records, materials, and data; transition of all activities, transition of all CTSU-Enterprise applications from the incumbent Contractor to a secure server space; ensure continuity of CTSU services and provision of key personnel.</p>
<p><strong>Part II - CTSU Core Support Services and the CTSU Enterprise of Systems :<br /></strong>The CTSU Core Support Services consists of the provision of broad-based, centralized, and fully integrated operational, administrative, regulatory, and logistical support services to all CTSU supported NCI multi-center coordinating centers and participating sites, with a specific sub-set of specialized core services for the new NCI National Clinical Trials Network (NCTN) Program. CTSU Core Support Services sections cover operational efficiency; National Clinical Trials Network (NCTN) Program and Multi-Center Organizations (MCO); NCTN/MCO and Other MCOs and selected trials; project management; institutional and individual (person) roster support; regulatory support; protocol documentation/development support; IT support, maintenance, and development; disaster recovery; maintenance and enhancement of CTSU enterprise applications; system integration; system security; help desk; and other IT requirements. Current CTSU systems involved requiring support include the CTSU website; Regulatory Support System (RSS); Oncology Patient Enrollment Network (OPEN); and Clinical Data Management System (CDMS - Medidata Rave&reg;). The specific sub-set of specialized CTSU Core Support Services, primarily for the NCTN, include NCTN compliance tracking and standards development and utilization; NCTN budget tracking; CTSU awareness, education, and training; site auditing; and site data reporting performance tracking.</p>
<p><strong>Part III - Support for Continuance and Completion of Active Trials/Study Activities:<br /></strong>The Contractor shall provide support in the continuance and completion of trial/study activities initiated under the incumbent contract. This includes Flex Basic Services, Flex Complete Services, and Site Auditing for the Endorsement Program.</p>
<p>-<em>Basic Services</em>: Flex basic services include, but are not limited to, Roster Management, Regulatory Support and CTSU website postings.</p>
<p>-<em>Complete Services</em>: Include the Basic services described above as well as comprehensive data management for selected trials.</p>
<p>-<em>Site Auditing for Endorsement Program</em>: The Contractor shall provide continued site auditing for trials and sites that qualified for the Endorsement Program that were initiated within the incumbent contract. Sites are audited at least once every 3 years (more frequently if required by CTMB). To accommodate the 3-year audit cycle CTSU provision of qualified auditors may last through the first 36 months of the period of performance of this contract.</p>
<p><br /><strong>Part IV- Development Activities<br /></strong>The Contractor shall refine, realign, and optimize CTSU procedures and systems to provide support in expanding the CTSU portfolio of NCI multi-center programs and studies beyond the Cooperative Group treatment program and develop international collaboration administrative best practices.</p>

<DESC><strong>1.</strong> <strong>Introductory.</strong> This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.
<p><strong>2.</strong> <strong>Background.</strong> The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) is one of 27 Institutes and Centers of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS). The mission of the NIEHS is to reduce the burden of human illness and disability by understanding how the environment influences the development and progression of human disease. The National Toxicology Program (NTP) is an interagency program whose mission is to evaluate agents of public health concern by developing and applying tools of modern toxicology and molecular biology. The Division of the NTP supports the program. The NTP maintains an objective, science-based approach in dealing with critical issues in toxicology and is committed to using the best science available to prioritize, design, conduct, and interpret its studies. To that end, the NTP is continually evolving to remain at the cutting edge of scientific research and to develop and apply new technologies.</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> <strong>Purpose and Objective.</strong> <strong>(A)</strong> In carrying out its mission, the NTP studies the effects of environmental agents in laboratory studies, which are performed predominantly at contract laboratories and then reviewed by the NTP. The NTP carries out a number of testing paradigms, covering high-throughput testing, in-life testing, in vitro models, and other biological systems, with the aim of generating high-quality data to support the mission of the NTP.<br />On an annual basis, NTP selects approximately 10 new chemicals for testing, has 20 to 30 subchronic studies and 30 to 40 chronic studies in different stages of testing and evaluation, and presents approximately 15 subchronic and chronic studies for public peer review. An additional 10 to 30 reproductive and developmental studies and 20 immunotoxicology studies is also peer reviewed on an annual basis.</p>
<p><strong>(B)</strong> The NTP receives data from contract laboratories, and houses these data in a Laboratory Information Management Systems (LIMS) or in local or ad hoc systems. The LIMS currently used are the hosted Provantis database and the custom legacy LIMS. The Hosted LIMS is provided by Instem LSS while the legacy LIMS was developed under contract and has two components: Toxicology Data Management System Enterprise (TDMSE), and Laboratory Data Management System (LDAS). Once the data are made public, the entire dataset (data and metadata) from the study is transferred to the Chemical Effects in Biological Systems database (CEBS) where the study data and conclusions are presented to the public and made available for download.</p>
<p><strong>(C)</strong> In addition, up to 50 high-throughput assays are performed, and up to 50 genetic toxicology studies are completed each year. The NTP also performs investigational studies using emerging technologies, with one-off designs, will perform studies to investigate other areas of toxicology and environmental health science, and has legacy data not currently housed in a relational database which must be included in a data stream to CEBS.</p>
<p><strong>(D)</strong> The NTP must manage, house, and report the data from this scientific work. The NTP requires the Contractor to perform this task. The Contractor shall be capable of (1) providing user support for the NTP for CEBS and the LIMS and for members of the public for the use of CEBS and (2) maintaining normal operating processes for NTP's use of the LIMS and CEBS.</p>
<p><strong>(E)</strong> Also, CEBS currently does not contain the complete set of functionality desired by the NTP. The Contractor shall design and incorporate new functionality into CEBS at the request of the NTP.</p>
<p><strong>4. Project Requirements. <br /></strong><br /><strong>1. (Operational Tasks) <br /></strong>Operational tasks are performed throughout the lifespan of the contract. Successful completion of these tasks requires an understanding of toxicological science in addition to strong understanding of computer science and information technology (IT).<br /><br /><strong>1.1 User Support<br />1.1.1 CEBS Support<br />Current Issue:</strong> Members of the public and of the NTP require assistance in obtaining data from CEBS.<br /><strong>Objective:</strong> The Contractor shall provide staff to assist users in routine use of CEBS.<br /><strong>Desired Outcomes:</strong> CEBS users have a point of contact for questions, common questions are captured and rendered in CEBS as a help or workflow, bugs are identified and resolved expeditiously, questions requiring direct database access are answered in a timely manner, and modifications are made to the CEBS UI to allow users to address similar questions in the future.<br /><br /><strong>1.1.2 SIFT File Creation<br />Current Issue:</strong> Users provide data in various formats for deposition into CEBS. <br /><strong>Objective:</strong> Data received by the NTP for CEBS shall be formatted for entry into CEBS.<br /><strong>Desired Outcomes:</strong> The Contractor shall support this process by converting the deposited data into a validated SIFT (Simple Investigation Formatted Text) file for loading into CEBS. The process of SIFT creation may be manual, or automated for numerous data files in a consistent format, at the discretion of the COR. Approximately 100 - 150 such files are presented in a year. <br /><br /><strong>1.1.3 CEBS Presentations at Meetings<br />Current Issue:</strong> Every year the NTP demonstrates CEBS at the Annual Meeting of the Society of Toxicology (SOT). <br /><strong>Objective:</strong> The Contractor shall provide staff to assist with the demonstration of CEBS at scientific meetings.<br /><strong>Desired Outcomes:</strong> The contractor shall supply staff knowledgeable about toxicology and the use of CEBS to attend scientific and/or technical meetings and provide a daily session during the meeting where CEBS is demonstrated to the scientists attending the meeting. One to two meetings are expected annually.<br /><br /><strong>1.1.4 User Support for the Hosted LIMS <br />Current Issue:</strong> The contractor supplying the Hosted LIMS provides user support, but does not support the needs of the NTP to have data presented in specific report formats and who need advice about protocol templates or work schedules. <br /><strong>Objective:</strong> The Contractor shall assist users in use of the Hosted LIMS for NTP users requiring special help. <br /><strong>Desired Outcomes:</strong> The staff provided will create tables for NTP users using for example the Business Objects tool supplied by Instem and attached to the Provantis database. This task requires understanding of as well as experience with Provantis itself. The Contractor shall provide assistance for NTP staff or contractors who may have questions about using the Hosted LIMS, if requested by the COR. The Contract staff will communicate closely with the COR and NTP staff to fully gather requirements and constraints for the tables and staff support.<br /><br /><strong>1.1.5 The Hosted LIMS User Support for NTP Protocol Templates<br />Current Issue:</strong> Studies are created in the Hosted LIMS from specific NTP protocol templates within the Hosted LIMS database. <br /><strong>Objective:</strong> The Contractor shall understand and advise NTP personnel about the impact of suggested changes in NTP protocol templates in the Hosted LIMS. <br /><strong>Desired Outcome:</strong> If a change is required, the Contractor shall make the change in the NTP template, and, if requested by the COR, perform testing to determine if the change functions as expected. Changes made to the Hosted LIMS database templates will follow the established GLP change control process, be thoroughly documented and coordinated with the NTP Validation Team and the Hosted LIMS database Administrator.<br /><br /><strong>1.1.6 The Hosted LIMS User Support for the Hosted LIMS System Libraries and System Security <br />Current Issue:</strong> The NTP will identify changes or additions required in the system configuration or library content of the Hosted LIMS. <br /><strong>Objective:</strong> The Contractor shall implement changes to the Hosted LIMS System Libraries and System Security, using either the NTP Change Control process or the NTP Process for Making Administrative Changes in the Hosted Database as directed by the COR.<br /><strong>Desired Outcome:</strong> Changes made to the Hosted LIMS libraries will follow the established GLP change control process, be thoroughly documented and coordinated with the NTP Validation Team and the NTP Hosted LIMS Administrator.<br /><br /><strong>1.1.7 Legacy LIMS User Support<br />Current Issue:</strong> Legacy LIMS must be maintained and supported.<br /><strong>Objective:</strong> Legacy LIMS shall be maintained, and staff shall be provided to respond to user-identified issues or account maintenance requests, security needs, changes in operating systems and other similar changes. <br /><strong>Desired Outcome:</strong> Contractor shall assign a liaison to each lab collecting NTP data using LDAS, with the responsibility to solve or capture any issues that the lab personnel encounter while using the Legacy LIMS. Liaisons are expected to be on-call and available for work on an ad hoc basis during evening and weekend hours. User-identified issues, security needs, changes in operating systems, and other similar changes will be collected in a Government-provided task management system currently Jira, and reviewed with the COR for prioritization and inclusion into a maintenance release. The Contractor shall carry out such a release as directed. It is anticipated that the NTP will end the use of LDAS to collect data from new studies after one year from the start of the contract. The Contractor shall retire TDMSE as directed; house the data in such a way that the data can be searched if need be.</p>
<p><strong>1.2 Data Management<br />1.2.1 Loading of Production CEBS<br />Current issue:</strong> The NTP constantly updates NTP data.<br /><strong>Objective:</strong> The NTP data shall be refreshed in the production CEBS database at least quarterly. <br /><strong>Desired Outcomes:</strong> Regularly, and at least quarterly, re-build one of the two production databases, validate the build, and then point the CEBS user interface to the newest database. Currently there are approximately 2500 studies in CEBS, and the number is expected to grow annually. With every update of the CEBS database, a parallel update of the CEBS bulk data download "Bundles" is also required. Each update requires debugging, post-processing and validation. A report of the number and type of studies loaded successfully, and a report of the CEBS data dictionary shall be included with each load.<br /><br /><strong>1.2.2 NTP File Management<br />Current issue:</strong> The NTP data is stored in a variety of files.<br /><strong>Objective:</strong> Create and manage an orderly file management system for NTP data files<br /><strong>Desired outcomes:</strong> The Contract shall perform an inventory of files associated with CEBS studies, and develop a central point for storing all data files. The files shall be managed using both manual and automated processes, and an inventory maintained. A report of the data file inventory shall be produced with each new load of CEBS production.<br /><br /><strong>1.2.3 Management of CEBS Bins<br />Current issue:</strong> Public access to and the administration of the CEBS private file system ("Bins") is inefficient.<br /><strong>Objective:</strong> Develop a user interface for CEBS Bins to allow users to manage their data. <br /><strong>Desired outcome:</strong> Develop a user interface with at a minimum the following features:<br />&bull; A system for authorizing users to upload or remove data files from their CEBS bin<br />&bull; A means for authorized users can create sub-bins, and can select the users authorized to view/delete/upload data in these bins from the list of authorized users in CEBS. <br />&bull; A means for an authorized user to upload individual files or directories.<br /><br /><strong>1.2.4 CEBS Administrative Page<br />Current Issue:</strong> Maintenance of the CEBS data dictionary is a manual process<br /><strong>Objective:</strong> Develop a tool to permit CEBS curators to review and update the CEBS databases<br /><strong>Desired Outcome:</strong> A tool for adding terms to the CEBS data dictionary shall be created. Additionally a process for term review shall be created; this process shall include the COR and members of the NTP staff as directed by the COR. Generate SOPs for adding terms to the dictionary. On a regular basis, or at least bi-annually, survey the dictionary to identify incorrect or redundant terms.</p>
<p><strong>1.3 Validation<br />1.3.1 Validation of Code Changes<br />Current Issue:</strong> Code changes can have unintended consequences or unwarranted assumptions.<br /><strong>Objective:</strong> Code shall be tested prior to release.<br /><strong>Desired Outcome:</strong> With every code change in either CEBS or TDMSE/LDAS, prior to release of the code, the Contractor shall demonstrate that the changes have not impacted the validity of the data in CEBS or the presentation of data to the CEBS user. The process of validating code shall be converted to an automated protocol where possible.<br /><br /><strong>1.3.2 Validation of Data Streams<br />Current Issue:</strong> Data streams must be validated to ensure that no data are dropped or coded incorrectly.<br /><strong>Objective:</strong> The data transfer process shall be validated as part of developing code to handle the data stream for every new data stream coming to CEBS or to the PWG module.<br /><strong>Desired Outcome:</strong> Each data stream for each load will be tested for complete data transfer to ensure that no new data were added to the input form and that all data are correctly captured in CEBS. When possible, the validation should be performed using automated methods and incorporated into routine testing at each loading.<br /><br /><strong>1.3.3 Validation of the CEBS Database Functioning<br />Current Issue:</strong> The CEBS database is non-responsive at erratic times.<br /><strong>Objective:</strong> Contractor shall monitor CEBS performance on an automated basis. <br /><strong>Desired Outcomes: </strong>The Contractor shall have a suite of tools which verifies the response and user experience of CEBS and establish automated methods to carry out CEBS validation. This includes a system to monitor CEBS system availability and response time in real time, and to verify the accuracy and completeness of data in CEBS in user interface search pages. The Contractor shall maintain logs from such methods and summarize weekly for the COR.<br /><br /><strong>1.3.4 Validation of Changes to the Hosted LIMS<br />Current Issue:</strong> The hosted database is housed in a GLP validated environment, meaning that it is in compliance with the guidance from the US Food and Drug Agency (FDA) for Good Laboratory Practice as outlined in 21 CRF Parts 11 and 58, and from the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 40 CFR Parts 160 and 792. <br /><strong>Objective:</strong> When changes are needed in the templates, in security settings, roles or endpoints, when a new release or update of the Hosted LIMS is received, or any other change is required in the Hosted LIMS, the Contractor shall validate these changes as directed by the NTP Validation Team, the NTP Hosted LIMS Administrator, in coordination with the COR.<br /><strong>Desired Outcome:</strong> Contractor shall follow the NTP GLP Validation Change Control Process or, when appropriate, following the NTP Administrative Change process. Additionally, new statistical methods in the Hosted LIMS must be validated as they are added to the Hosted LIMS by Instem. The Contractor shall verify that the method returns the expected value for a particular set of test data. This verification shall conform to the NTP Change Control process. The COR shall direct all changes made to the Hosted LIMS. <br /><br /><strong>1.4 Work Environment<br />The NTP is a responsive government agency which acts in the public interest. As such, it is likely that changing NTP priorities will impact the priority and sequence of tasks. It is likely that the NTP will add additional tasks not specifically listed here, but which are within scope of the Contract. The Contractor is expected to be accommodating to changes of this nature, and to work with the COR to prioritize and incorporate tasks.<br /><br />1.4.1 Regulatory Compliance<br />Current issue:</strong> The NTP is part of the NIEHS computer infrastructure, and subject to regulations related to computer and infrastructure security and compliance with federal regulations such as Section 508 of the Americans with Disabilities Act. The NTP is also subject to records management regulations.<br /><strong>Objective:</strong> The Contractor is expected to be compliant with NIEHS, NIH and HHS regulations. <br /><strong>Desired Objectives:</strong> The Contractor shall be compliant with NIEHS, NIH and HHS regulations. These include but are not limited to Section 508, security and records management. The Contractor shall perform all work in compliance with regulations and document this compliance with an annual security and 508 compliance reports, and responsiveness to interim security requirements which may arise.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall maintain files in accordance with the appropriate current National Archives and Record Administration (NARA), and General Records Schedule (36 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 122014 and 44 U.S.C. 3301). All contractor files, records, and documents maintained in the performance of the resultant contract are Government Property and the Contractor shall return them upon completions or termination of the work. However, internal proprietary contractor business files are not Government property.</p>
<p><strong>1.4.2 Collaboration with Government Staff and Other Contractors<br />Current issue:</strong> The NTP details government staff to work on parts of the overall CEBS and the Hosted LIMS projects, in parallel with the Contractor. The Computer Technology Branch (CTB) details staff and contractors to work on CEBS support. Instem details staff to work on the Provantis database. This work environment requires close communication among these groups in order to accomplish these separate tasks in an efficient manner. <br /><strong>Objective:</strong> NTP staff and Contractor staff working on CEBS and the Hosted LIMS shall communicate regularly and transparently about the technical details of work relating to CEBS and the Hosted and legacy LIMS. Contractor staff shall communicate with CTB and other components of NIEHS, Instem and their delegates, as needed and in coordination with the COR. <br /><strong>Desired Outcomes:</strong> A 10 minute response time from Contractor staff during normal business hours (9am to 6pm, eastern local standard time). Weekly meetings to ensure that the Government and Contractor teams work is coordinated, not-overlapping, and separated by function. It is expected that some members of contractor staff shall be stationed at the NTP facility. The Contractor shall interface with other contractors and federal employees as necessary to perform daily operations.<br /><br /><strong>1.4.3 Documentation and Version Control<br />Current issue:</strong> Contractor using government tools to manage work.<br /><strong>Objective:</strong> Contractor shall use government supplied tools to manage work tickets, version control and non-end user documentation.<br /><strong>Desired Outcome:</strong> The Contractor staff shall use government-supplied tools for work tickets, version control and non-end user documentation. Currently, these are Jira, Confluence, and Subversion.<br /><br /><strong>1.4.4 Knowledge Transfer<br />Current issue:</strong> The NTP and NIEHS provide training and other opportunities for knowledge transfer which permit Contractor staff to more properly fulfill their tasks.<br /><strong>Objective:</strong> Contractor staff shall participate in training and local seminars at the discretion of the COR at their own expense.<br /><strong>Desired Outcome:</strong> Contract staff shall participate in opportunities for learning provided by the NIEHS and NTP or other local ICs and companies. Typically, these have no costs associated with them. These are provided so that the Contract staff may perform their tasks with more efficiency and understanding.</p>
<p><strong>1.5 IT Support.<br />1.5.1 Inventory<br />Current Issue:</strong> The LDAS in-life and administrative workstations in contractors' labs must function well while they are in use for work under NTP contracts. The Government requires an inventory of Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) and Contractor Acquired Purchases (CAP).<br /><strong>Objective:</strong> Maintain and support the inventory associated with the contract.<br /><strong>Desired Outcome:</strong> Maintain LDAS units in labs in good working order. Maintain an inventory of parts to support LDAS workstations. Collect or abandon-in-place LDAS in-life and admin workstations, and dispose of these once all in-life work using LDAS has ceased or the Contractor Laboratory no longer has need for them. <br /><br /><strong>1.5.2 Security<br />Current Issue:</strong> There are rare instances of security incidents involving the systems managed under this contract.<br /><strong>Objective:</strong> All security incidents will be identified rapidly, communicated to the NTP, and resolved efficiently in accordance with the contract.<br /><strong>Desired Outcome:</strong> The Contractor shall provide immediate notification of any security incident, followed by a report within 48 hours of the remediation. Additionally, the Contractor shall provide weekly reports of failed access to CEBS private data and all LIMS, and weekly summaries of log files.<br /><br /><strong>1.5.3 Hardware/Software Support<br />Current Issue:</strong> Contractor staff requires good capacity workstations and servers, high-speed access to the internet in order to access the NIEHS computational facility, and up-to-date software.<br /><strong>Objective:</strong> The Contractor shall provide all necessary services, hardware and software licenses for the contract, and training in necessary systems at no cost to the Government. <br /><strong>Desired Outcome:</strong> The Contractor staff shall have the necessary support to be able to work efficiently. The Government recommends the use of COTS products where possible, to avoid unnecessary expense involved in developing and supporting software, however, the CEBS database is currently so unique that no commercial analog can be identified.<br /><br /><strong>1.5.4 The Hosted LIMS Exports<br />Current issue:</strong> The LIMS supplier provides a copy of the Hosted LIMS database on a weekly basis. <br /><strong>Objective:</strong> The Contractor shall receive the copy of the Hosted LIMS database export, verify that it is accurate and complete, and store it safely at the NIEHS.<br /><strong>Desired Outcome:</strong> The NTP shall have a current copy of the Hosted LIMS data available to ensure data continuity.<br /><br /><strong>1.5.5 Use of the Internet Cloud<br />Current issue:</strong> Development options are wider if some development work is performed on the cloud.<br /><strong>Objective:</strong> Establish a cloud instance of CEBS which contains data of size and complexity equivalent to production CEBS but which is not actual NIH data. <br /><strong>Desired Outcome:</strong> Use this to prototype different options for warehouse architecture, queries, bioinformatics tools, Tox21 data presentation, and other tasks for which the NIEHS network is less well suited than the internet cloud.</p>
<p><strong>1.5.6 Technology Assessment and Refreshment<br />Current Issue:</strong> IT technology and NTP requirements develop rapidly, making new tools available and current technologies obsolete.<br /><strong>Objective:</strong> Collect suggestions from the NTP and from IT professionals and incorporate into proposals for updates and improvements to CEBS. Implement these proposals as directed.<br /><strong>Desired Outcome:</strong> Capture user needs, and then assist COR in evaluating suggested improvements/refreshments. Contractor shall ensure that Contractor staff remains current with IT technology through reading, communication with other IT professionals, and through attendance at technical meetings. As requested by the COR, develop proposals to incorporate new functionality and/or new technology into CEBS. These proposals will be incorporated into the tasks in the next section of this document.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>2 (Development Tasks)<br />In addition to operational tasks done on a continuing basis throughout the lifespan of the contract, the NTP requires that the following tasks be completed, starting at the time of contract award. The COR shall work with the Contractor to fully define the requirements and assumptions for each task, and the priority of tasks with in this list. These tasks are performed in support of the NTP mission and rely on strong science as well as strong IT understanding. It is possible that the order of tasks, and the exact requirements of these various tasks, will vary as the priorities of the NTP are changed. The COR shall work with the Contractor to accommodate these changes.<br /><br />2.1 New Data Types<br />Current issue:</strong> New data types, new technologies, and new study designs are used by the NTP in support of the NTP mission.<br /><strong>Objective:</strong> As new data types and study designs are received, it is necessary to model these for incorporation into the CEBS and for proper display in the CEBS user interface and then incorporate them into CEBS. <br /><strong>Desired Outcome:</strong> The new data shall be added to the CEBS database using the SIFT (Simple Investigation Formatted Text) file format and the CEBS loader. This process requires thoughtful discussion by the Contractor with the COR and members of NTP staff prior to incorporation. The CEBS database may need to be changed by the addition of a new table or field to accommodate such requests. New presentation of the data shall be added to CEBS user interface in addition to the standard CEBS view of the data. The NTP anticipates changes needed to display study phases, generations, and results of data transformations, results of assay panels, data from new NTP legacy study types, and additional data which will be encountered over the course of the contract. Successful completion of these tasks requires an understanding of the various data found in different NTP studies, and how these same data are captured and represented in CEBS, in addition to a strong background in IT. <br /><br /><strong>2.2 Data Pipelines<br />Current Issue:</strong> Current data streams to CEBS may be error-prone, and do not encompass all NTP data.<br /><strong>Objective:</strong> Ensure that all NTP data flows into CEBS in an accurate and complete manner.<br /><strong>Desired Outcomes:</strong> Current methods shall be validated, NTP legacy data not currently in CEBS, which at a minimum will include data from ADME (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion), TK (Toxicokinetic) studies, Immunotoxicology and historical comet studies, and clinical chemistry and reproductive data stored in a legacy relational database, shall be moved to CEBS. Methods to capture data from NTP contract labs shall be established and validated. Data from legacy database, contract labs, and the Hosted LIMS database shall be linked to the corresponding animal ID.<br /><br /><strong>2.3 Computations<br />Current Issues:</strong> The computations in CEBS do not encompass all that are needed by the NTP. Instem will incorporate new statistical methods into the Hosted LIMS database suite which must be validated.<br /><strong>Objective:</strong> Add and validate statistical and computational methods to CEBS user interface and backend analysis server in consultation with COR. <br /><strong>Desired Outcomes:</strong> This task is to incorporate and validate existing software in the public domain rather than to develop new statistical methods, however strong understanding of the CEBS database schema and of statistical and visual data mining methods is required for successful completion of this task. Software to incorporate include at a minimum (1) the EPA's Benchmark Dose Software (BMDS) software, (2) the functionality of the Genetic Alterations in Cancer user interface, (3) the signature calling algorithm from Drug Matrix, (4) visual methods for viewing data in CEBS using a software package such as the Spotfire package from TIBCO, (5) supervised statistical analyses such as ANOVA or trend tests, (6) genome-wide association tools such as EMMA and QTLRel. Provide CEBS workflows restricting the user to the correct method for each data type.</p>
<p><strong>2.4 CEBS features<br />Current issues:</strong> CEBS does not contain all the features required by the NTP.<br /><strong>Objective:</strong> Incorporate new features identified by the NTP into the CEBS user interface and database.<br /><strong>Desired Outcomes:</strong> The features to be added will be described by the NTP; examples include the following: <br />&bull; CEBS shall have a historical control database for all NTP study types including appropriate meta-data. <br />&bull; NTP conclusions shall be incorporated into the CEBS database where possible, and made available to the user for searching. <br />&bull; After discussion with NTP staff about methods to generalize; add new workflow to CEBS to allow users to carry out common queries. <br />&bull; A CEBS view shall exist for each of the NTP Search pages (see http://ntp-apps.niehs.nih.gov/ntp_tox/index.cfm). Ensure that all data included on NTP Search pages are also displayed by CEBS. <br />&bull; Transfer all NTP search page functionality to CEBS. This will include moving the statistical methods including trend tests and poly-k test run on data from CEBS. It is possible that the NTP will augment the current statistical tests with others; if this is the case these new tests shall also be included.<br />&bull; Automate the transfer of data from the static Sites and Associations workflow currently in CEBS to include all studies in CEBS.<br />&bull; Develop methodology to capture, manage and report data from literature curation derived by NTP and/or from external scientists<br />&bull; Permit the user to enter in CEBS a list of test articles or conclusions to retrieve results, rather than restricting the query input to one item. Validate the query input terms against terms in CEBS prior to executing the query. Build a new workflow in the CEBS user interface to support this.<br />&bull; Develop a secure method for expert NTP staff to search all of the data in CEBS.<br />The Contractor shall deliver a document outlining the requirements and technical approach and gain approval from the COR before initiating work. <br /><br /><strong>2.5 CEBS Ontology<br />Current issue:</strong> The CEBS Ontology is not complete.<br /><strong>Objective:</strong> Create a CEBS Ontology that can be used to draw conclusions and reason about NTP studies.<br /><strong>Desired Outcome:</strong> Complete creation of the CEBS SIFT Ontology by ensuring that the terms used in CEBS to describe neoplastic, non-neoplastic, clinical pathology endpoints and organs are mapped to existing external ontologies, and that the data needed to support each study conclusion is expressed as an RDF triple. Leverage the CEBS ontology to draw conclusions about CEBS data using the semantic web and logical reasoning, and integrate this data stream into CEBS. Identify to the user which conclusions are computationally derived. Develop tools to carry out natural language processing (NLP) to derive conclusion data from NTP Technical Reports provided in electronically readable format and deposit in CEBS. Add toxicological knowledge to CEBS by surveying the literature as directed by the COR. Ensure that the terminology used in the Hosted LIMS database is aligned with current requirements defined by the COR and the Provantis Steering Team. Ensure that the vocabulary used in CEBS is aligned with current NTP requirements as defined by COR and the NTP ABC (Advisory Board for CEBS).<br /><br /><strong>2.6 Bioinformatics<br />Current issue:</strong> CEBS does not leverage bioinformatics knowledge in delivering information to users.<br /><strong>Objective:</strong> Bioinformatics annotation and tools will be incorporated into CEBS.<br /><strong>Desired Outcomes:</strong> Add bioinformatics capability to CEBS - align sequence IDs among transcriptomics platforms and across species. Add tools to link genes to the relevant pathway and function described in the Gene Ontology. Add tools for users to identify gene signature expression changes (signature), and to determine if the associated changes in annotated pathways and sets show significant changes in a particular gene signature. Incorporate these results in the CBS user interface. Add gene-centric queries to the user interface - permit the user to load or compute a gene signature and then to identify test articles related to the signature. Implement clustering or other unsupervised methods to permit users to combine high capacity data such as high-throughput or transcriptomics data with phenotype data such as histopathology findings for analysis. Use software packages such as Spotfire or Bioconductor for this task. Add network analysis/connectivity analysis capability to the CEBS UI, using tools such as those in the public domain.<br /><br /><strong>2.7 Warehouse<br />Current issue:</strong> CEBS is currently based on a relational database design.<br /><strong>Objective:</strong> Build a data warehouse or appropriate system linked to CEBS to permit users to draw conclusions and find relationships across studies and data domains while still being able to drill down to access the underlying individual animal data.<br /><strong>Desired Outcomes:</strong> Prototype and develop CEBS warehouse to capture/compute NTP conclusions and link to supporting data. Ensure that the technology selected supports real-time use by standard users. <br /><br />Assess the technology used to build the CEBS user interface and back-end code. If this technology requires updating to leverage new technology and to more smoothly interface with the CEBS warehouse user interface, then develop a plan for this in collaboration with NTP staff and the COR. Put this plan into place as directed by the COR. Add data mining tools to identify correlations in responses seen in CEBS and then augment a search by suggesting additional terms (e.g. if a user enters a list of test articles into CEBS, and the CEBS data mining routine has identified a test article with similar (R&gt;.8) result, return this new test article and determine if the user would like to include / see results for this test article).</p>
<p>Develop and test a user interface to the CEBS Warehouse. Permit the users to search conclusions at the Study, Trial, Group, and Subject or Assay Input/organ level, Gene, across studies and data domains. Permit search of Test Article by use and class.<br /><br /><strong>2.8 Link-out<br />Current issue:</strong> CEBS should be a resource to bring users to other external databases.<br /><strong>Objective:</strong> CEBS users can be directed to other data resources relating to environmental health science from the CEBS user interface.<br /><strong>Desired Outcome:</strong> Align CEBS with external data resources relating to environmental health science. Develop an API for CEBS to permit it to communicate with other databases containing data relevant to the environmental health sciences at the NIEHS and other ICs. Develop tools to allow the user to navigate from CEBS to government databases of environmental health sciences data and to other public databases to access relevant data. External databases may include CTD, PubChem, ToxNet, AcTOR, DSSTox, SNP databases, PubMed, GEO. Leverage data in PubChem to support structure-based queries via the CEBS user interface.</p>
<p><strong>2.9 Use of Cloud for Production CEBS [Option]<br /></strong>Option: To be exercised at the government's choosing, with at least 6 months' notice.<br /><strong>Current issue:</strong> CEBS runs on the NIEHS network. It is possible that during the course of this contract the decision will be taken at the NIEHS to use the internet cloud to house production CEBS. <br /><strong>Objective:</strong> Establish a cloud instance of production CEBS which complies with NIEHS/NIH regulations. <br /><strong>Desired Outcome:</strong> If this were to become a possibility, the Contractor would provide support to prototype and install production CEBS in the cloud, monitor performance and cost, and if a decision were taken to support such an installation for CEBS, provide ongoing system administration, security, and patch management for CEBS cloud installation, with weekly reports and summaries of log files provided for the COR.</p>

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION<br />For<br />OFFICE OF WORKERS' COMPENSATION PROGRAMS' (OWCP)<br />WORKERS' COMPENSATION MEDICAL BILL PROCESSING (WCMBP) SOLUTION
<p>The intent of this notice is for informational and planning purposes only and does not constitute a formal Request for Quotes (RFQ), Request for Proposal (RFP), or Invitation for Bid (IFB). This Request For Information (RFI) is not to be construed as a commitment by the U.S. Federal Government (Government). If a formal solicitation is generated at a later date, a solicitation notice will be published through the Government Point of Entry at www.fedbizopps.gov. The Government does not intend to pay for any information provided under this notice. The information submitted by Respondents will not be returned. Respondents are not to provide any information that is considered proprietary, trade secrets, privileged, or confidential as part of the RFI responses. The Government is not obligated to notify respondents of the results of this RFI. Hard copies of this RFI will not be issued.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this request is 518210. The small business size is $7 million.</p>
<p>Introduction<br />The U.S. Department of Labor's (DOL) OWCP administers workers' compensation medical bill processing programs that mitigate the impact of work-related injury for certain workers and their families.</p>
<p>OWCP is seeking a single Contractor to build and operate a centralized WCMBP solution, also referred to as Central Bill Process (CBP), for three OWCP programs: the Division of Federal Employees' Compensation (DFEC), the Division of Coal Mine Workers' Compensation (DCMWC) and the Division of Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation (DEEOIC). OWCP's medical bill processing function is currently provided as an outsourced service. The Government does not own an information system that can be transferred to a follow-on Contractor. Only historical data will be transferred.</p>
<p>This centralized solution will include the processes associated with receipt of the medical bills and attachments, review of medical bills and attachments against program-specific authorizations, handling of inquiries related to medical services from claimants and providers, and utilization of business rules established by each Program for the adjudication and pricing of medical bills. Specifically, the integrated system will support the following capabilities:</p>
<p>&bull; Receipt and accounting for medical bills, attachments and other documents, in both hardcopy and electronic formats<br />&bull; Scanning and data entry of bills, attachments and other documents received.<br />&bull; Processing of bills to payment or denial (the Contractor will not make benefit payments, but will transfer payment files to Treasury for certification and payment)<br />&bull; Processing of requests for adjustment, authorization of services, suspense resolution, and appeals processing<br />&bull; Processing and responding to submitted correspondence received from medical providers and claimants, when applicable, and storing the responses to the correspondence in an imaging<br />system from which the Government can retrieve for review<br />&bull; Enrolling new providers and managing information about existing providers<br />&bull; Providing claimant and provider support via a call center and self-service applications (such as user access portals and IVR)<br />&bull; Processing Point of Sale (POS) pharmacy bills<br />&bull; Providing secure on-line access, available to authorized users, to view images of bills, correspondence, and other documents.</p>
<p>Uniqueness of the OWCP's WCMBP OWCP authorizes payments for the medical conditions accepted as being compensable by the OWCP Program under which the claim is filed. Each of the three OWCP Programs provides medical benefits only when the medical care is related to a valid injury/illness claim (case), the medical condition(s) treated are accepted for payment by OWCP Program government claims examiners (CE), and the treatment occurs within time period(s) of eligibility covered by legislative mandates. Each of the OWCP Programs has a unique set of business processes and functional flows that the WCMBP solution must support.</p>
<p>The Division of Federal Employees Compensation (DFEC) is the largest program. It accounts for 90% (approximately 4.5 million bills per year) of all medical bills received by OWCP. DFEC has millions of claimants and hundreds of thousands of enrolled providers. Claimant eligibility records for DFEC are maintained by the Government in their case management system (IFECs) and will be provided as input to the WCMBP for bill processing. For each claimant, an eligibility record will be established within WCMBP for each unique case number provided on the eligibility file received from DOL. A claimant can have multiple cases --a DFEC claimant having multiple injuries will have an eligibility record established within WCMBP for each unique case. Eligibility records are associated with claimants by case number, date of injury and date of birth. DFEC does not associate eligibility records to claimants by SSN. The Contractor shall establish an electronic interface between WCMBP and IFECs to receive DFEC claimant eligibility records and send back appropriate responses. Eligibility records loaded into WCMBP will be made available throughout the system for its respective functions.</p>
<p>The Division of Energy Employees Occupational Injury Compensation (DEEOIC) accounts for about 9% of all medical bills received by OWCP. Claimant eligibility records for DEEOIC are maintained by the Government in their case management system (DEEOIC ECS) and will be provided to the WCMBP for bill<br />processing. For each claimant, an eligibility record will be established within WCMBP using claimant's SSN as a unique identifier. Each claimant has one case. DOL will send a complete set of eligibility records per accepted condition when an accepted condition is added to the claimant's record. Contractor shall develop an electronic interface between WCMBP and DEEOIC ECS to receive DEEOIC claimant eligibility records and send back appropriate responses. Eligibility records loaded into WCMBP will be made available throughout the system for its respective functions.</p>
<p>The Division of Coal Mine Workers' Compensation (DCMWC) is the smallest program and accounts for 1% of all medical bills received by OWCP. Claimant eligibility records for DCMWC are maintained by the Government in their case management system (Automated Support Package or ASP) and will be sent to<br />the WCMBP for bill processing. For each claimant, an eligibility record will be established within WCMBP using the claimant's SSN as the unique identifier. Each claimant has one case. Contractor shall establish an electronic interface between the WCMBP and the DCMWC Automated Support Package (ASP) to receive DCMWC claimant eligibility records and send back appropriate responses. Eligibility records loaded into WCMBP will be made available throughout the system for its respective functions.</p>
<p>The concept of an "accepted condition" is unique to DOL's WCMBP. This approach stipulates that claimants are entitled to coverage only by virtue of being accepted by the Government as having a specific work-related illness or injury. The accepted condition(s) is the only condition(s) for which medical bills can be paid. The Government will provide the Contractor with a daily eligibility data file containing claimant eligibility - information that the Contractor will use to process medical bills. Payments are authorized based on the medical conditions (ICD-9/10 codes) accepted as being compensable by the OWCP program under which the claim is filed. This is accomplished by applying OWCP's authorization logic (organized in "treatment suites") to the billing information.</p>
<p>The accepted condition(s) on a claim for the DFEC Program is the only condition(s) in which services are payable for that unique case number. Cases under the DFEC program may involve more than one accepted condition and claimants may have more than one case open and active with unique conditions accepted for medical treatment.</p>
<p>The accepted condition(s) on claim for the DEEOIC Program are the only conditions for which services are payable for a claimant using the claimant's Social Security Number (SSN) as the unique identifier. Accepted cases under this program may include up to 99 accepted conditions.<br /><br />There is only one accepted condition on a claim for the DCMWC Program for which services are payable for claimants using the claimant's SSN as the unique identifier.</p>
<p>The Claims Examiners (CEs) for each Program determine the accepted conditions and authorize certain medical treatments. Data from the WCMBP keep the CEs informed of the nature and quantity of treatment for a given accepted condition and case, and the WCMBP forwards requests for treatment requiring prior authorization by the CE.</p>
<p>OWCP medical bill processing assumes the use of industry standard medical bill processing techniques including, but not limited to: validity edits, consistency edits, correct coding initiative (CCI), duplicate checking, service limitations, application of OWCP fee schedules, and financial accounting, auditing, and reporting.</p>
<p>OWCP medical bill processing volumes require a high degree of automation of the adjudication process and require the Contractor to support an interface to the OWCP-owned Treatment Suites.</p>
<p>Treatment Suites<br />The OWCP uses a set of business rules and decisions, which are logically grouped into "Treatment Suites" to automate certain WCMBP functions. Treatment Suites processing is an automated process for determining if the services associated with a bill are authorized for the accepted condition. The Treatment Suite concept provides for the consistent application of OWCP medical policy across Programs. However, its design is sufficiently flexible to support the application of each Program's individual standards and guidelines. Importantly, it minimizes the need for the manual review of bills to determine whether the treatment is related to the accepted condition prior to payment.</p>
<p>Treatment Suites contain a set of diagnosis-driven algorithms that determine authorization requirements and the procedures, drugs, hospitalization, DME, and all other services that are payable for accepted condition(s). Treatment Suites consist of a diagnosis or group of related diagnoses (expressed as International Classification of Disease (ICD)-9/10CM codes) linked to the medical procedures, medications, and other services used in its (their) treatment. Services are identified in terms of Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes, Healthcare Common Procedural Coding System (HCPCS) codes, Diagnosis Related Group (DRG) codes, Therapeutic Class (TC) codes, National Drug Codes (NDC), Generic Code Nomenclature (GCN), and other nomenclatures. Common complications are part of the treatment suites and are considered in decision making. OWCP-defined prior authorization requirements for medical procedures are also embedded in the Treatment Suites. Treatment Suites processing includes Government medical benefits policies, clinical guidelines, and medical care ("diagnosis to treatment") management logic. All incoming medical bills are compared to the Treatment Suites of the accepted conditions applicable to a specific case. Bills with services included in the Treatment Suites for the accepted conditions or complications continue processing, while services that are billed but not found in the pertinent treatment suites logic for the accepted conditions are denied or suspended for manual resolution.</p>
<p>The Treatment Suites algorithms are contained in reference files and are updated by means of a management toolset (Treatment Suites Builder) provided to the Contractor as GFI. The Contractor will host the Treatment Suites tool, which includes the database. The current version of the treatment<br />suites is a java-based tool with a DB2 database.</p>
<p>WCMBP Program Goals<br />The goal of the WCMBP program is to acquire a standards-based bill processing system and processes that implement the following:</p>
<p>* Improved mailroom, imaging, and data entry throughput, accuracy, and efficiency <br />* Ensure a smooth and timely transition from the incumbent service provider <br />* Ensure efficient, accurate and timely processing of medical and pharmacy bills<br />* Ensure timely and correctly processed authorizations for covered benefits.<br />* Provide accurate and timely responses to customer inquiries and requests.<br />* Implement advanced medical bill processing technologies and processes<br />* Develop robust fraud and abuse and error detection/protection processes<br />* Use of industry-standard hosting and programming techniques to support portability among platforms<br />* Implement bill processing and auxiliary functionality in a modular manner that allows the DOL to select components that could be Government-owned versus components that are better suited for outsourcing<br />* Implement robust change and configuration management process<br />* Establish a framework for continuous improvement.</p>

<p>WCMBP Major Functional Requirement Groups<br />The Sections below present high level descriptions of the functional elements of the WCMBP system. These elements are grouped into three major functional groups for ease of organization. This section presents overview information. For more information, please refer to the section in the attached draft PWS and six draft Requirements Specification Documents (RSD) documents. Please note that only six draft RSDs have been provided as examples of the level of detail available in the set of Government-Furnished RSDs. Also, those requirements identified as (New) in the draft PWS will not have corresponding references in the draft RSDs.</p>
<p>Group 1 - Inputs and Outputs<br />Input and Outputs Group contains all functional elements associated with accepting bills, transitioning physical artifacts into electronic format and preparing correspondence for mailing.<br /><br />Mailroom (PWS section 5)<br /><br />The mailroom will accept mail from USPS and other mail delivery services for all three OWCP Programs and prepares it for further processing. The mailroom will perform document preparation that encompasses all mailroom, imaging, and data capture services required in preparation for bill processing to include: sorting, imaging, indexing, tracking, return to originator, and warehousing. The Contractor shall securely store and dispose of all PII/PHI hardcopy documents in accordance with the requirements established for each Program. In addition, the mailroom is responsible for preparing mail for delivery to the providers and claimants. To meet the minimum requirement, the Contractor shall establish and operate the mailroom facilities and systems of sufficient size to meet the estimated volume of mail anticipated by this RFI.<br /><br />DFEC Document Imaging (PWS section 6)<br /><br />The Contractor shall establish and operate infrastructure and system to scan and index all DFEC documents (medical bills, attachments, and correspondence, etc.) received by the mailroom in accordance with the rules established by DFEC for particular form/document types and categories (more<br />complete description is provided in PWS Section 6). Indexes and images of DFEC documents are transmitted to DFEC via IFECS daily.<br /><br />Claimant Bill Development (PWS section 7)<br /><br />The Contractor shall implement a process to receive and review each claimant-submitted bill to determine if sufficient information is provided on the bill and attachments to ensure successful processing. If insufficient information is provided on the claimant-submitted bill itself, the Contractor shall review the submitted attachments to determine if required information is included there. If the required information is available, the Contractor shall enter the missing information into the WCMBP via key data entry functionality and process the bill through normal bill processing operations. Claimant submitted bills with insufficient information will be returned to either the claimant or the appropriate Program District Office.<br /><br />Bill Scan/Data Entry (PWS section 8)<br /><br />The Contractor shall determine if bills received have been submitted on a Government-approved form and if so, identify the bill type for each Program. The Contractor shall develop a process of extracting data elements to produce medical bill database records. The Contractor shall capture all required data<br />elements accurately and completely (using automated methods to the extent possible to minimize cost).&nbsp; The Contractor shall correlate each bill with a valid case number (for DFEC) and/or SSN (for DEEOIC and DCMWC) obtained from CBP Claimant Eligibility files. The Contractor shall ensure that Government approved validation criteria are applied to specified fields at the time of input, as part of the data entry process, and shall document all instances in which fields do not satisfy Government validation criteria.<br /><br />RTP/RTC/RTD (PWS section 12)<br /><br />The Return-to-Provider (RTP) and Return-to-Claimant (RTC) processes are associated with sending bills or other materials rejected by the medical bill processing solution to the original submitters. The Return-to-District Office (RTD) process forwards mail that was incorrectly sent to the mailroom as well as bills, forms, and correspondence that the image processing system can't process to the appropriate Program District Office as determined by the business rules associated with this Section.&nbsp;<br /><br />When bill does not meet Government requirements for processing, the Contractor shall return the bill to the provider, claimant or Program District Office within 5 workdays of receipt, with a letter that lists all specific deficiencies. The Contractor shall store images of all RTP/RTC letters and/or RTD checklists when the letter/checklist is created. These electronically stored documents must be in a format that is accessible to authorized staff, at any time.<br /><br />Group 2 - Core<br />The following functions have been selected for Group 2 because they are highly specialized to OWCP and the functionality and inter-dependencies may be tightly coupled. Additionally, the Government estimates that these functions may require a high degree of customization.<br /><br />Bill Processing (PWS section 9)<br /><br />Bill processing includes the processes associated with reviewing medical bills against the established treatment and eligibility criteria established by each of the OWCP programs. The payment acceptance criteria are the input to the Bill Processing function. To successfully support the Bill Processing function,<br />the Contractor shall:<br />* develop workflow and systems to automate the process of bill adjudication utilizing Programspecific rules and criteria<br /><br />* generate outputs contingent on adjudication results-payment files, suspended bills for manual resolution, or denied bills/bill lines<br /><br />Edits &amp; Audits (PWS section 13)<br /><br />The Edit and Audit process involves a series of algorithms (edits and audits) which act as prepayment controls to implement Government policies. The result of the Edit and Audit process is the denial of payments or suspension for manual review when bill data are in conflict with Government policy. Edits are performed on the information within a single bill, while audits additionally compare the current bill data to information in history or other files such as the Authorization File, and/or other bills in process in the same cycle.<br /><br />Although most edits and audits are similar in concept across the three Programs, the specific algorithms and the pay/deny/suspend decisions may vary for each program. <br /><br />Contractor shall implement the Edits and Audits process flow as described in the PWS, maintain its logic throughout its lifecycle and process all bills against this logic. The Contractor shall implement a set of edits and audits that may be customized by OWCP Program with regard to the edit/audit rules, EOB, and<br />bill disposition.<br /><br />Authorizations (PWS section 16)<br /><br />The Government requires that medical services paid on behalf of claimants be medically related to accepted conditions for which compensation can be paid. To meet this criterion, OWCP programs use program-specific authorization processes that require different levels of authorization for services.<br /><br />The Contractor shall implement the Authorization process flows as described in the PWS, maintain its logic throughout its lifecycle and process all bills against this logic. The Contractor shall accept and process authorizations received according to the Program rules and accurately associate the<br />authorization with a valid case or claimant identification number. <br /><br />Treatment Suites (PWS section 17)<br /><br />The Contractor shall implement the Treatment Suites process flow as described in the draft PWS, maintain its logic throughout its lifecycle and process all bills against this logic as an integrated component of the medical bill processing solution. The Contractor shall host and maintain (in the Contractor's environment) the OWCP-owned Treatment Suites Builder and Viewer tools (GFI)<br /><br />Bill Pricing (PWS section 18)<br /><br />Bill Pricing processes use Government-approved fee schedules to calculate allowed fees. Allowed fees are derived from adjusted Metro Statistical Area (MSA) data and are used to price procedures based on national and industry standards. The Contractor shall develop a unique bill pricing logic and process for each OWCP program (DFEC, DEEOIC, DCMWC). The Contractor shall also implement the capability to override a fee schedule based on provider-specific data. The Contractor shall implement the Bill Pricing process flow as described in the draft PWS, maintain its logic throughout its lifecycle and process all bills against this logic.<br /><br />Pharmacy (PWS section 19)<br /><br />The Contractor shall develop a pharmacy process that uses a point-of-sale (POS) prescription drug bill processing methodology, including prospective drug service limitations, the application of programspecific Treatment Suites for bills submitted directly from a pharmacy, and Program specific bill pricing logic. The Contractor shall process paper bills submitted by claimants and pharmacies as well as electronic bills. The Pharmacy processes shall apply to all OWCP programs (DFEC, DEEOIC, and DCMWC).<br /><br />Bill Resolution (PWS section 20)<br /><br />Bill Resolution process refers to the manual review and decision-making required to resolve edits that occur between the identification of bills (or lines) that cannot be processed electronically and the reprocessing of bills to completion.<br /><br />The Contractor shall implement a Bill Resolution process that suspends bills for manual review as instructed by the Government. The Contractor's bill resolution process shall: allow authorized Government personnel to view suspended bills and their attachments; route certain suspended bills to<br />authorized Government personnel for them to make bill resolution decisions; automatically apply fee schedules to bills that are re-processed after suspension and manual resolution; manually price certain bills during the bill resolution process based on Government input; and apply unique Bill Resolution rules based on bill types and provider types.<br /><br />Payment Files Process (PWS section 21)<br /><br />Payment processing provides continuous accountability and control of all bills in the medical bill process. In order for the Government to track the number of bills entered into payment processing, categorized by bill type, the Contractor shall:<br /><br />* Produce reports to ensure bill counts are balanced during each cycle.<br /><br />* Ensure that total bill counts and dollar amounts, processed during a payment cycle, are documented at the end of the payment cycle, and include provider negative balances for all three OWCP programs.<br /><br />* Produces a final payment summary report that balances the preliminary payment and final payment information to help maintain integrity throughout the payment process.<br /><br />The payment cycle is defined as the period beginning 12:00am Saturday through 11:59 pm Friday. Payment cycles are scheduled to run once a week for each program. The Contractor shall transmit payment and EFT files to the Government on a schedule determined by the Government. Additionally, the Contractor shall generate and distribute remittance vouchers (RVs) to the appropriate recipients. The US Treasury Department is responsible for check production, check mailing, and EFT processing for each program. Therefore RVs are mailed separately from checks.<br /><br />The Contractor shall maintain records generated during bill payment processing and document all payments paid to all providers during any tax year. The Contractor shall prepare MISC-1099 forms for all eligible providers per IRS regulations. <br /><br />Provider Enrollment &amp; Management (PWS section 15)<br /><br />The goal of Provider Enrollment and Management is to reimburse only qualified providers that comply with Government program rules and regulations for services rendered to eligible recipients. The Contractor shall develop and implement all Government-approved Provider Enrollment and Management processes including, but not limited to:<br /><br />* Accepting hardcopy provider enrollment forms.<br /><br />* Accepting electronic provider enrollment forms.<br /><br />* Providing the capability for providers to perform the enrollment process electronically.<br /><br />* Providing the capability to handle new and/or different provider types, modify criteria for defining provider classes, develop, and modify processes required for provider enrollment, develop and modify provider enrollment workflows.<br /><br />* Placing providers in an "on-review" status based on Government-provided criteria (e.g., specific services, specific claimants, dates of service, etc.).<br /><br />* Activating and deactivating providers based on Government-provided criteria.<br /><br />* Processing Government-supplied information (e.g., the HHS Excluded Provider File and Internal Revenue Service [IRS] levy file).<br /><br />*&nbsp;Ensuring that enrollment processes operate in accordance with Government instructions.<br /><br />* Maintaining payment histories and outputting IRS 1099 forms<br /><br />This process shall include all functions necessary to enroll new and maintain current information about existing providers. In addition, this process shall maintain user portal accessibility for all providers. The Contractor shall implement all workflows and requirements listed in the draft PWS section.<br /><br />Claimant Eligibility (PWS section 14) <br /><br />The Claimant Eligibility function utilizes eligibility information from the Government to determine whether medical bills are eligible for payment based on the claimant's accepted condition(s). WCMBP differs from other bill processing operations, because it uses the concept of accepted condition.<br />Specifically, claimants are entitled to coverage by virtue of being accepted by the Government as having a specific work-related illness or injury. The accepted condition(s) is the only condition(s) for which services can be reimbursed. In the WCMBP, the Government provides data containing claimant<br />eligibility information that the Contractor uses to process bills.<br /><br />Contractor shall accept claimant eligibility information from each DOL Program, process the eligibility records in accordance with the Program business rules, ensure validity of input claimant eligibility files, and use eligibility files to process bills.<br /><br />Third Party Liability (PWS section 10)<br /><br />The WCMBP incorporates the concept of "Third Party Liability", which is a process of reviewing bills in order to determine whether a party other than the Government is responsible for payment and the processing required by each Program. Each OWCP Program uses specific criteria to identify whether a claimant's medical bills are third party liabilities and the subsequent medical bill and accounting processes that result from that determination. The contractor shall implement third party liability logic into the overall bill processing process, in accordance with Program-specific rules.<br /><br />Prompt Payment Bill Processing (PWS section 11)<br /><br />Certain services mandated by the Government are considered subject to the Prompt Payment Act (PPA).&nbsp; The Prompt Payment Bill Processing identifies bills that qualify under the Prompt Payment Act (PPA) and processes them according to Program-specific regulations, to include payment of interest on bills that are paid outside of the required timelines. The Contractor shall design, develop, and implement a PPA process, reviewed and approved by the Government that shall include, but is not limited to:<br /><br />* Providing accurate identification of all PPA bills.<br /><br />* Implementing workflow management that ensures compliance with the PPA rules and procedures.<br /><br />* Establishing electronic capabilities that can be used by authorized providers to submit bills and reports in electronic format.<br /><br />* Implementing the Government fee schedules for the payment of these services.<br /><br />Fee Schedule Appeals (PWS section 22)<br /><br />The Fee Schedule Appeals process applies to all three OWCP programs. Upon receiving a fee appeal request, the Contractor shall determine and communicate to the Government within one (1) business day of receipt if the fee appeal request meets at least one (1) of the Government's three (3)criteria. These criteria are:<br /><br />* The actual procedure performed was coded with an incorrect code.<br /><br />* The presence of a severe or concomitant medical condition made treatment especially difficult.<br /><br />* The provider possesses an "unusual qualification" (however, Board Certification in a specialty is not sufficient to justify "unusual qualification").<br /><br />Adjustment Processing (PWS section 23)<br /><br />The Contractor shall implement the ability to perform Program-specific adjustment, void and credit transactions for previously paid and/or denied bills. The Contractor shall provide the capability to perform Program-specific history-only adjustments, void and credit transactions in response to billing<br />errors.<br /><br />The Contractor shall make available methods and tables necessary to edit and process bills including, but not limited to: approve, adjust, re-price, suspend, or deny bills based on any criteria in the bill, provider files, claimant files, or reference files; allow any rule to be applied to the bill header area or bill<br />detail line level; and, transmit the adjustment/recoupment file to the Government.<br /><br />Location Independent Electronic Access Portal (PWS section 27.4)<br /><br />The Location Independent Electronic Access Portal (User Portal) provides secure means for authorized users (providers, claimants, government) to access bill processing-related information. The Contractor shall provide electronic access to CBP information in compliance with Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act, as amended. The Contractor shall provide electronic enrollment functionality for providers and shall make recommendations to the Government on the use of electronic signatures in the implementation of this functionality. The Contractor shall implement, host and manage a system<br />capable of meeting requirements contained in the Location Independent Electronic Access section of the PWS.<br /><br />Group 3 - Support<br />Management Reporting (PWS section 25)<br /><br />The Contractor shall develop standard and ad-hoc operational and performance reports (Section 25) to be available as scheduled and on-demand as requested by the Government. The Contractor shall provide the capability to report information covering system monitoring, program analysis, service<br />utilization analysis, management queries, and bill processing performance. <br /><br />The Contractor shall ensure that federal and contract staff are able to access only that report information for which they are approved (e.g., a user from one program or District Office should not be able to access report data from another program or District Office).The Contractor shall develop the means of customizing, producing and distributing reports as specified in the Management Reporting section of the PWS. The Contractor shall implement all workflows and requirements listed in the draft PWS section.<br /><br />Change Management (PWS section 26)<br /><br />The Contractor develops and implements Change Management processes that track the status of all changes to the WCMBP from their initiation, through approval process to eventual implementation or disposition.<br /><br />During the Operations phase, the Contractor shall enhance WCMBP, using an allocation of 10,000 labor hours per operations year, based on approved Government requests. Enhancements are defined as changes to add new functionality or to change existing requirement functionality. In years where<br />operational processing is not performed for the full year, the Contractor shall pro-rate the 10,000 hours by month. Corrections to defects will not use labor hours from this pool. The Contractor shall provide an audit trail capability that records every CR implementation with date, time, and operator performing<br />the implementation.<br /><br />In addition, the Contractor shall implement a test and release system and methodology that will be used to ensure that requested changes do not negatively impact the operational system and that they produce expected results. The Contractor shall provide isolated environments that exactly replicate the Production processing environment and functionality, to be used to develop, test, and train for the changes made to the CBP. <br /><br />Call Center (PWS section 27.3)<br /><br />The Contractor shall provide a call center facility, process, and staff to receive and handle claimant and provider calls. The Contractor shall maintain Call Center operating hours of 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. ET, Monday through Friday, unless otherwise specified by the Government. The Contractor shall ensure that the current phone numbers, transitioned from the current Contractor or provided by the Government, are properly integrated into the Contractor's CBP solution. The Contractor shall hire and maintain staff that are acquainted with medical terminology and the intricacies of OWCP Programs' requirements. This facility has to be able to support call volumes as described in this RFI. The call center facility must be located in the lower 48 contiguous States (CONUS) to allow DOL to perform site visits on as-needed basis.<br /><br />IVR (PWS section 27.5)<br /><br />Contractor shall implement and operate an interactive voice response (IVR)-based system to meet requirements contained in section 27.5 of the PWS. The Contractor shall establish and maintain a tollfree number for the IVR with sufficient capacity to satisfy Government-specified IVR performance metrics. The Contractor shall make the IVR available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, except during normally-scheduled system maintenance during non-peak hours, as approved by the Government.<br /><br />Fraud and Abuse Detection (PWS section 24)<br /><br />The Fraud and Abuse Detection (FAD) function is responsible for monitoring bill processing with the intent of detecting suspected cases of fraud and abuse. This function also is used to report and track these suspected cases and to provide the Government with the capabilities required to prevent fraud<br />and abuse cases. The Contractor shall maintain and operate a FAD function that includes, but is not limited to, the following capabilities:<br /><br />* Produce reports and charts as approved by the Government.<br /><br />* Run fraud studies when requested by the Government.<br /><br />* Provide the functionality for unrestricted aggregations of data elements.<br /><br />* Provide the functionality for fraud studies to be initiated by the Government or the Contractor staff including the ability to save the results.<br /><br />Information Requested<br />Responses to this RFI should demonstrate the firm's capability to perform the work described in the attached PWS. To ensure uniformity among responses, DOL requests that the Contractor organize their responses in the following manner:<br /><br />1. Provide company name, address, point of contact, email address and&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; telephone number. Respondents should also indicate business size and&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Socioeconomic Category (HUBZone, 8(a) small business, Service Disable&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Veteran-Owned small business, Small Business, Large Business, or <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; womenowned small business).

<p>2.0 BACKGROUND</p>
<p>TRICARE is the health care program serving active duty service members, National Guard and Reserve members, retirees, their families, survivors and certain former spouses worldwide. As a major component of the Military Health System (MHS), TRICARE supplements the health care resources of the uniformed services Military Treatment Facilities (MTF) with networks of civilian health care professionals, institutions, pharmacies and durable medical equipment suppliers to provide access to high-quality health care services while maintaining the capability to support military operations.<br />The OCFO supports the OASD (HA)/TMA and the Military Health Services in applying the principles of DOD financial management by developing and implementing policies, procedures, programs, and technical standards necessary to support the delivery of high quality, cost effective health care services across the operational continuum.<br />Approximately 28% of the 9.6 million MHS beneficiaries have self-reported they have OHI. The current process of identifying MHS beneficiaries with OHI relies on MHS staff to query beneficiaries to identify whether or not they have OHI. If yes, then the beneficiary is asked to complete an OHI Collection Form detailing the associated policy information. This information is stored in a DOD master database for use in revenue recovery actions. Beneficiaries are asked at every MTF encounter to report their availability to OHI in an effort to maintain the most recent and reliable data. MTFs provide beneficiaries with information to understand that the cost of their OHI will not increase as a result of the MHS recovering the cost of their healthcare but there may still be reluctance on the part of some beneficiaries to disclose their access to OHI. The revenue recovery actions are then processed by the MTFs based on care delivered in the MTF. The current process results in MTF claims of approximately $381M per year. MTF collections are less than $200M per year with approximately 30% of denied claims characterized as acceptable.</p>
<p><br />3.0 DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>The Military Health System (MHS) Office of the Chief Financial Officer (OCFO) is seeking industry solutions that can enable the reporting, discovery verification and ongoing monitoring of health insurance coverage of a certain population for the purposes of revenue recovery and expense allocation.</p>
<p>This request for information is in support of a market/industry survey to gain input from the commercial sector on: <br />- Industry standards for rates and percentages of medical payment collections<br />- Examples of commercially utilized enhanced recovery practices; <br />- Recommendations on alternatives to the current MHS business process for the identification of beneficiaries with Other Health Insurance (OHI) coverage and the accuracy of our beneficiary OHI file<br />- Recommendations on alternative methods to track and maintain real-time data integrity for payment assignment<br />- Possible products/services employed to facilitate and improve revenue recovery<br />- Availability of subscription services or other databases to determine existence of OHI. <br />Responses to the RFI will be used to identify commercial capabilities capable of optimizing the MHS OHI identification and recording process to achieve industry standards in revenue recovery. Respondents' comments may be used in creating the Performance Work Statement.<br />When replying to the RFI please provide information and understanding based on your knowledge of the marketplace and explicit company experience. If you have any specific products identified please provide a summary of product capabilities and/or a web link that already has this summary.</p>
<p>Responses are due to this RFI by 5:00 PM on March 8, 2013. See Section 4.0 for further information.</p>
<p>4.0 CONTACT INFORMATION</p>

<DESC>The Savannah District Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the construction community addressing the potential use of Project Labor Agreements (PLAs) for large scale construction contracts (exceeding $25 million) within the Savannah District Design/Construction Boundaries http://www.sas.usace.army.mil/districtboundaries.html). Some of the factors that may be considered regarding their use are:
<p>(1) The project will require multiple construction contractors and/or subcontractors employing workers in multiple crafts or trades.</p>
<p>(2) There is a shortage of skilled labor in the region in which the construction project will be sited.</p>
<p>(3) Completion of the project will require an extended period of time.</p>
<p>(4) Project labor agreements have been used on comparable projects undertaken by Federal, State, municipal, or private entities in the geographic area of the project.</p>
<p>(5) A project labor agreement will promote the agency's long term program interests, such as facilitating the training of a skilled workforce to meet the agency's future construction needs. PLA is defined as a pre-hire collective bargaining agreement with one or more labor organizations that establishes the terms and conditions of employment for a specific construction project and is an agreement described in 29 U.S.C. 158(f).</p>
<p>Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Policy states: Project Labor Agreement (PLA) is a tool that agencies may use to promote economy and efficiency in Federal procurement. Pursuant to Executive Order 13502, agencies are encouraged to consider requiring the use of project labor agreements in connection with large-scale construction projects. An agency may, if appropriate, require that every contractor and subcontractor engaged in construction on the project agree, for that project, to negotiate or<br />become a party to a project labor agreement with one or more labor organizations if the agency decides that the use of project labor agreements will (1) advance the Federal Government's interest in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement, producing labor-management stability, and ensuring<br />compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other matters; and (2) be consistent with law. Reference: Provision: FAR 52.222-33 Notice of Requirement for Project Labor Agreement, Clause: FAR 52.222-34 Project Labor<br />Agreement.</p>
<p>The construction community is invited to comment on the use of PLAs. Of particular interest to the Government are responses to the following questions:</p>
<p>(1) Should PLAs be executed on selected large dollar contracts within the Savannah District Design/Construction Boundaries (http://www.sas.usace.army.mil/districtboundaries.html)? <br />(2) Are there concerns by prime contractors on the availability of skilled construction labor?</p>
<p>(3) Would a PLA benefit a project which contains a unique and compelling mission-critical schedule?</p>
<p>(4) Have there been any Project labor agreements used on comparable projects undertaken by Federal, State, municipal, or private entities in the geographic area?</p>
<p>(5) Would a project labor agreement promote Savannah District's long term program interests, such as facilitating the training of a skilled workforce to meet the agency's future construction needs?</p>
<p>(6) What other factors should the Corps consider before deciding to include PLA provisions in a U.S. Army Corps of Engineer, Savannah District contract?</p>
<p>Responses shall be submitted via email to CESASCTSAS@usace.army.mil no later than 3 p.m. (EST) on&nbsp;08 March 2013. This is NOT a Request for Proposal and does not constitute any commitment by the Government. Responses to this labor market survey will be used by the Government to make appropriate acquisition decisions. All interested sources must respond to future solicitation announcements separately from responses to this survey.</p>

Parties must also demonstrate the capability of accessing the ship's MPCMS/CTES from a remote shore site and extracting data from MPCMS/CTES databases for analysis and troubleshooting. In the absence of responses from firms that believe they have the capability to perform this requirement, the Coast Guard intends to negotiate with GE Energy for the work described pursuant to FAR 6.302-1(b)(1). No cost or pricing data is required. All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, which will be considered by the agency. <br /><br />Please send via e-mail to Contract Specialist, Amy Kelm, at Amy.A.Kelm@uscg.mil.

The proposed Statement of Work is as follows:



STATEMENT OF WORK

1.	The contractor's pharmacies will fill and dispense original prescriptions that are written by VA physicians assigned to designate VA Community Based Outpatient Clinic (CBOCs) under the auspices of the VA Medical Center or under the Medical Center itself.

2.	The majority of CBOC operating hours are normally 8:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., Monday-Friday, excluding federal holidays. Occasional Saturday hours may exist. However, there are CBOC's that have other than normal operating hours.  There is also the possibility that CBOC's with normal operating hours will expand their services to include other than normal operating hours.  Therefore, while most prescriptions will be processed during CBOC hours, the contractor will have an emergent enrollment process to assist patients, VA staff and contract pharmacies that are 24 hours per day, 7 days per week, and 365 days per year.


3.	Prescriptions filled will be in written form provided by the CBOC VA providers. VA Form 10-2577F, Security Prescription Form. Prescriptions may also be faxed or telephoned into the pharmacies at the discretion of each VA Medical Center.


4.	Prescriptions will be filled and dispensed only for medications listed in the Formulary "Drug List" as authorized by the designated VAMC. Each VA Medical Center will be responsible to create and maintain their Formulary Drug List. The Formulary Drug List will be e-mailed to the contractor at the beginning of the Services period and at each update by the Chief, Pharmacy, or his/her designee. There shall be a mechanism in place provided by the contractor to provide real-time messaging and hard edits to the pharmacies in order to limit dispensed medication to the specified "drug list" and to prevent non-formulary or prior authorization drugs from being dispensed.   In addition, there must be a mechanism in place to correctly update the formulary "drug list" as needed. 

5.	Prescriptions shall be filled and limited to a maximum of ten (10) days excluding anti-infectives, which shall be limited to a maximum of fourteen (14) day supply. Each VA Medical Center may independently choose a shorter day limit if so desired. There shall be a mechanism in place, provided by the contractor, to provide real-time messaging and hard edits to the pharmacies in order to adhere to such restrictions.

6.	No refills will be authorized.  The contractor shall fill NEW PRESCRIPTIONS ONLY!

7.	Reimbursements shall be determined by the Average Wholesale Price (AWP) discounted by the applicable percentage plus the applicable dispensing fee.  The total price charged to the VA SHALL NOT EXCEED THAT CHARGED TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC AND SHALL NOT EXCEED THE PRICE CHARGED BY THE CONTRACTOR'S LOWEST THIRD PARTY REIMBURSEMENT PLAN.

8.	Prescriptions filled under this contract shall be generic drugs ONLY.  Prescriptions shall be filled with generic drugs to the extent permitted by law and the least expensive drug product the pharmacy has in stock shall be dispensed.  All generic products used must be AL rated per the Orange Book. All generic products used must be in compliance with Federal and State requirements. Brand name drugs will only be reimbursed if NO GENERIC FORM OF THE DRUG EXISTS IN THE MARKETPLACE.  There must be a mechanism in place, provided by the contractor, to provide real-time messaging and edits to the pharmacies in order to adhere to these specifications. 

9.	VA beneficiaries will pick up their own prescriptions at the dispensing pharmacy.  No prescriptions are to be mailed. No prescriptions are to be delivered.

10.	The VA Medical Center (or designated VAMC) may randomly audit all prescription fills.  VAMC shall have free access during regular business hours, and upon reasonable notice, to such books records, invoices, and prescription files as deemed necessary to verify claim information, prescription volume, and the usual and customary charges to the general public for covered prescriptions.  The contractor shall make all VA prescription records and invoices available at the time of the audit.

11.	Contract pharmacies shall maintain a log of VA prescriptions filled and have the patient sign next to each prescription number for each prescription received. A copy of the log shall be maintained at the contract pharmacy and be readily accessible for random VA audit.

12.	All prescriptions shall have proper auxiliary labels attached and appropriate counseling and drug interaction sheets provided.  The VA does not consider the mere signing of a prescription log appropriate counseling. The counseling rate of VA patients should closely resemble the counseling rate of the VA Medical Center.

13.	Average Wholesale Price (AWP) will be based n the current Pharmacy Fundamental Reference REDBOOK and REDBOOK updates published by the Medical Economics Data, Inc.  Contractor shall be required to provide the CBOC with a current copy of the REDBOOK and updates throughout the contract term. If a contractor offers to use any other means of providing pricing, they shall provide appropriate documentation similar to that of the REDBOOK AND ITS UPDATES.  Award of a contract will not be made to any offeror who does not provide sufficient evidence to substantiate the fairness/reasonableness of their pricing.  

14.	The contractor and his/her contract pharmacies shall keep all information concerning VA beneficiaries confidential and shall not release or disclose information to any person, except as authorized in writing and according to all applicable laws.  The Privacy Act of 1974, Public Law 93-579, December 31, 1974 (USC 552a) applies to this procurement.

17.	The Government reserves the right to fill any prescription covered under this contract through the use of its own resources and/or staff.

The Air Force's system is now managed under the Air Force - Integrated Personnel and Pay System (AF-IPPS) program and is not anticipated to deploy until at least 2017.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The subject $70M J&amp;A will provide ceiling to continue the existing PSDT-SP contract scope, to include the HR System Sustainment through the remaining contract period of performance of March 2016. To preclude the need for a follow-on PSDT-SP acquisition at the end of the contract period of performance in March 2016 the PSDT-SP work will be incrementally transitioned off of the PSDT contract over the next three years, starting with the larger efforts in FY13.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span></p>

<DESC><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Request for Information (RFI) #1<br /><br />for the CPSD Crypto IDIQ Acquisition</strong></p>
<p>1. This Request for Information (RFI) is issued in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.215-3 (Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes - Oct 1997) and is published to obtain information for use by the Air Force Lifecycle Management Center (AFLCMC), Cryptologic Systems Division (CPSD), Joint Base San Antonio - Lackland, Texas, for market research and planning purposes only.</p>
<p>2. This RFI is NOT a Request for Proposal, Invitation for Bid, or an announcement of a solicitation; it is only intended for information or planning purposes. There is no bid package or solicitation document associated with this announcement. Response to this RFI is strictly voluntary and will not affect any potential offeror's ability to submit an offer if a solicitation is released. Any requests for a solicitation package will be disregarded. The government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or otherwise pay for the information solicited. No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the government will arise as a result of preparing submissions in response to this RFI and the government's use of such information. Submittals will not be returned to the sender. Respondents to this RFI may be requested to provide additional information/details based on their initial submittals.</p>
<p>3. AFLCMC/HNC is contemplating awarding multiple Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity contracts for cryptographic acquisition programs. This work would include Materiel Solution Analysis, Technology Development, Engineering and Manufacturing Development, and Low-Rate Initial Production task orders. This would encompass analysis, development and limited production of air, ground, and space cryptographic devices, end cryptographic units, and embeddable solutions. We are contemplating an ordering period of six years with a period of performance of ten years starting in FY15.</p>
<p>4. Please provide answers to the following questions which will help us in determining our acquisition strategy:</p>
<p>a. If interested in competing for this requirement, would you be proposing as&nbsp;a&nbsp;Prime Contractor or Subcontractor? Are you a Small Business? If so, what is your small business status, e.g., 8(a), Small Disadvantaged Business, etc? Would your company partner with other companies?</p>
<p>b. Do you have experience in development and/or production of cryptologic devices? Please briefly describe your experience.</p>
<p>c. Describe what recent experience you have in developing certified encryption products, NSA Type 1 CCI, and / or NSA Type 1 Secret and Below (non-CCI/CHVP), or FIPS-140-2 Level 3 or 4?</p>
<p>d. What is your recent experience with developing embeddable solutions? Experience developing airborne, terrestrial, or space systems? Experience developing low SWaP encryption devices, e.g., &lt; 5X5X1.5 cm; &lt;100g; &lt;100mW @ 1Mbps?</p>
<p>e. What recent experience do you have in producing encryption devices?</p>
<p>f. What risks or concerns do you see with this acquisition and what are your suggested mitigation strategies?</p>
<p>g. We are considering using the source selection technique called Low Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA). From your perspective, what are the pros and cons of an LPTA source selection related to a multiple award IDIQ Contract for this effort?</p>
<p>h. What criteria do you believe to be appropriate to this potential source selection? What are the most critical criteria that would distinguish one company's capabilities from another?</p>
<p>i. Do you have any questions, comments, or suggestions that you would like to share with us?</p>
<p>5. Respondents to this RFI are advised that proprietary, confidential, or privileged commercial data submitted as part of your response may be released to the following non-Government advisors supporting the Government in this acquisition:</p>
<p>PE Systems, Inc.<br />Jacobs Technology, Inc.<br />P3I, Inc.<br />Innove, LLC<br />MITRE Corp</p>

Specify the name of the advisor, specific basis of the objection, and the specific portions that the respondent objects to disclosure to the non-Government advisor. The Government shall not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for any improperly identified proprietary information. Respondents are responsible for protecting proprietary information at the appropriate classification level. Proprietary information will be safeguarded in accordance with the applicable Government regulations.</p>

<DESC>1. DESCRIPTION: <br>  <br> The Army Contracting Command - Rock Island (ACC-RI), in coordination with the Project Director Computer Hardware, Enterprise Software and Solutions (PD CHESS) is issuing this  Request for Information (RFI) to obtain information from industry regarding the ability to provide IT services on behalf of the Department of the Army. The estimated value of services within the scope of this RFI is $11B to $15B over a 5 year period of performance. <br>  <br> 2. PURPOSE: <br>  <br> The intent of this RFI is to obtain information regarding the ability to provide IT services for a follow-on IT service contract to replace ITES-2S, on behalf of the Department of the Army. The US Army is seeking the following: <br>  <br>   Information regarding industry interest and capabilities in participation in the concept described below, and  <br>   Specific feedback and comments from industry regarding the grouping of the IT Services task areas in accordance with the attached questionnaire.   <br>  <br> This is a Request for Information only. This RFI is being conducted pursuant to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) subpart 15.201(e). No contract will be awarded from this announcement and no reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information submitted in response to this RFI. As such, this RFI is issued solely for informational and planning purposes and does not constitute any obligation on the part of the US Army. <br>  <br> Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP or solicitation, should one be issued. All submissions become US Army property and will not be returned. All information received in response to this notice that is marked 'Proprietary' will be handled accordingly. <br>  <br> 3. PROGRAM BACKGROUND: <br>  <br> The ITES-2S scope includes a full range of services and solutions necessary for the Army to satisfy its support of the Army enterprise infrastructure and infostructure goals with Information Technology (IT) services worldwide.  The scope includes the Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Information Management (C4IM) requirements as defined in Army Regulation 25-1 (AR 25-1).  ITES-2S are services-based solutions under which contractors may be required to provide a full range of IT equipment.  Therefore, end-to-end solutions to satisfy worldwide development, deployment, operation, maintenance, and sustainment requirements are included.  Additionally included is support to analyze requirements, develop and implement recommended solutions, and operate and maintain legacy systems, and equipment (The current ITES-2S Labor Categories are listed in Attachment 2).  It is the intention of the Government to establish a scope that is broad, sufficiently flexible to satisfy requirements that may change over the period of performance, and fully comprehensive so as to embrace the full complement of services that relate to IT.  The U.S. Army, Department of Defense, or any other Federal Agencies are authorized to fulfill requirements under ITES-2S. <br> The Government has the requirement to provide IT services, as a follow-on to ITES-2S, to both the Army warfighter and civilians supporting the Army business operations, along with mission partners in modernizing and maintaining LandWarNet.  LandWarNet links the Army's forces around the world and provides on-the-move capability to maneuver forces while pushing access down to the lowest tactical level and from that foxhole back to their home station. <br> Because of the depth and breadth of the services required to satisfy the IT requirement, the Government seeks information and advice on how to provide these services in a manner that will result in best value, for example, appropriately qualified personnel at a cost that provides value to both the Government and the customer and in a manner that is flexible to the vendor, e.g., multiple contracts that are narrower in scope. <br> This is an RFI looking for innovative solutions in providing IT service contracts that will enhance the Army customer's (and possibly other DoD and federal agencies) ability to support their IT requirements.  The Government is looking for a way of purchasing services that could break out the services into different suites or catalogs in accordance with the new DoD Services taxonomy. <br> 4. TARGET AUDIENCE: <br>  <br> All sources, with the capability as described herein, are requested and encouraged to respond to this RFI. <br>  <br> 5. GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS: <br>  <br> In an effort to gather information in a manner which can be analyzed, the US Army is requesting responses in three separate Sections (1) General Information; (2) Capability Questionnaire; and (3) General Feedback and Comments regarding the proposed concept and software products indicated (optional). <br>  <br> Instructions for Section 1: General Information <br>  <br> In order for a company's responses to Section 2 and Section 3 to be considered for the Government's analysis, the completion of Section 1, General Information, must be provided. <br>  <br> Instructions for Section 2: Questionnaire <br>  <br> The government is seeking comments from industry regarding the overall concept of the proposed ITES 3S contract.

<DESC>The purpose of this notice is to announce the government's intent to award a Task Order for conference space and related services and lodging to accommodate a large number of participants. Each year, the U.S. Department of Education's Office of Federal Student Aid (FSA) hosts an annual training symposium for approximately 6,000 institutions of higher education participating in the federal student aid programs. These schools are responsible for annually disbursing approximately $150 billion in annual federal student aid awards to approximately 15 million students attending their institutions. Ensuring these financial aid professionals understand student aid policy, programs and procedures is critical to ensuring students have the aid they need to pursue a postsecondary education and to preventing waste, fraud and abuse of taxpayer funds. FSA's conference employs Department personnel to train conference attendees, i.e. school financial aid professionals responsible for offering the federal student aid programs on their campuses. This training is part of our school oversight responsibility and increases the integrity of the federal student aid programs while ensuring appropriate stewardship of taxpayer resources. It is anticipated that between 6,000 - 6,500 attendees from the 6,000 institutions, will attend the conference. There are general sessions each morning followed by approximately 12 concurrent breakouts and up to three optional hands-on sessions.  A PC Lab and Cyber Caf&eacute; email stations are also offered to attendees for 4 full days.  Pre- and post conference planning activities such as a Q&amp;A Pre-Conference Meeting and focus groups are anticipated.
<p>Please note, FSA negotiated a contract with ASK Associates, Inc., (ASK) a small Veteran Owned business, to provide site selection and related acquisition support for this requirement. The contract was awarded under ASK Associates' GSA Federal Supply Schedule contract (GS-23F-066J) and a Department of Education Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA).  Quotes are requested from entities that either own or operate the facilities being offered.  Proposals from resellers will not be considered. <strong> ASK Associates is currently identifying space to hold the conference. Locations under Consideration: Central and Western US.  ASK Associates is currently identifying space to conduct the conference, therefore interested parties shall contact ASK Associates, at bwalmsley@askusa.com.</strong></p>

<SUBJECT>Request for Information (RFI)  Autonomous Outdoor Chemical Sensing Technology
<SOLNBR>IARPA-RFI-13-01
<RESPDATE>031513
<ARCHDATE>04162013
<CONTACT>Dr. Edward Baranoski, Office Director, Email dni-iarpa-rfi-13-01@ugov.gov
<DESC>Synopsis<br />This request for information (RFI) is intended to provide information relevant to a possible future IARPA investment (such as a program or grand challenge). Respondents are invited to provide comments on the content of this announcement to include suggestions for improving the scope of a possible solicitation to ensure that every effort is made to adequately address the scientific and technical challenges described below. Responses to this request may be used to support development of, and subsequently be incorporated within, a future IARPA solicitation and therefore must be available for unrestricted public distribution. Neither proprietary nor classified concepts or information should be included in the responses. The following sections of this announcement contain details of the scope of technical efforts of interest, along with instructions for the submission of responses.
<p><br />Background and Scope<br />Commercial chemical sensors must make trades between selectivity, sensitivity, portability, and response time because of limitations in the underlying detection technologies. Over the past decade advancements have been made both in fundamental research and device integration that have improved the capability for chemical analysis in the field environment (i.e., outside of chemistry laboratory). For this RFI, we are specifically interested in advances in detection technologies, both passive and active, that may enable a new generation of chemical sensors suitable for unattended outdoor use. Examples of technologies at various stages of maturity include: nanowire arrays, functional polymeric materials, cantilever arrays, self-assembled molecular switches, functionalized graphene, quantum dots, enzyme-based assays, miniaturized mass spectrometers, and many others.</p>
<p>This RFI seeks to assess the breadth of potential technologies in two regions of the field-deployable chemical sensor trade space:<br />1. The first modality of interest is a chemical sensing technology that provides high sensitivity and high specificity for a small, targeted group of chemicals (4 to 5 target analytes) with very low false positive rates and false negative rates relative to very similar groups of chemicals. Technology in this category should be capable of identifying the target signature(s), such as organophosphates or toxic industrial chemicals, within complex mixtures in near real-time.<br />2. The second modality of interest is a group of candidate technologies that would be capable of detecting broad groups or classes of chemicals related to the target signatures, such as organophosphates, precursors, and industrial-scale reagents, with<br />moderate to high sensitivity and low to moderate false positive rates in a highly compact footprint. The requirement for dealing with mixtures and providing near real-time results also applies.<br />In both of these areas, portability, power consumption, durability, and sensor lifetime remain primary concerns, and thus size, weight, power, and long-term reliability must be considered when evaluating how each technology would integrate into a fieldable device. The proposed technologies should enable development of a device that retains its analytical precision over its lifetime does not require physical interaction with the senor for recalibration, has minimal instrument drift, and can be deployed for at least one year.</p>
<p>This RFI invites interested parties to respond with ideas, approaches, and /or examples of data - to include negative findings or failures to replicate results - that can address the following questions;<br />1. How might the proposed technology create disruptive change to the capabilities of current field-deployable chemical sensors?<br />2. In what areas of the chemical sensor trade space (e.g., sensitivity, selectivity, portability, response time, power, etc.) would the proposed technology have the greatest impact?<br />3. What fundamental challenges (or limitations) must be overcome for the proposed technology to create a disruptive improvement in field-deployable chemical sensor technology?<br />4. What environmental factors (e.g., rain, humidity, dust, oxidation, temperature change, chemical background, etc.) pose the greatest challenge to the proposed sensor technology? How are these factors being addressed by these new technologies?<br />5. What additional technology developments will be required to integrate the proposed technology into a field-ready system?<br />6. Aside from improving individual detection technologies, what other development areas could address some of the challenges for field chemical sensing? Combining multiple sensor motifs: Separation technology? Data processing algorithms? Other ideas?</p>
<p>Instructions to Respondents<br />IARPA solicits respondents to submit ideas related to this topic for use by the Government in formulating a potential program. IARPA requests that submissions to this RFI briefly and clearly describe the potential approach or concept, outline critical technical issues, and comment on the expected performance, robustness, and estimated cost of the proposed approach. This announcement contains all of the information required to submit a response. No additional forms, kits, or other materials are needed.</p>
<p>IARPA appreciates responses from all capable and qualified sources from within and outside the U.S. Because IARPA is interested in an integrated approach, responses from teams with complementary areas of expertise are encouraged. Responses have the following formatting requirements:<br />1. A one page coversheet that identifies the title, organization(s), respondent's technical and administrative points of contact - including names, addresses, phone and fax numbers, and email addresses of all co-authors, and clearly indicating its association with IARPA-RFI-13-01;<br />2. A substantive, focused, one-half page executive summary;<br />3. A description (limited to 5 pages in minimum 12 point Times New Roman font, appropriate for single-sided, single-spaced 8.5 by 11 inch paper, with 1-inch margins) of the technical challenges and suggested approach(es);<br />4. A list of citations (any significant claims or reports of success must be accompanied by citations, and reference material MUST be attached);<br />5. Optionally, a single overview briefing chart graphically depicting key ideas.</p>
<p>Submission Instructions to Respondents<br />Responses to this RFI are due no later than 4:00 pm Eastern on March 15, 2013.

<DESC>The Naval Supply Systems Command Fleet Logistics Center, Pearl Harbor (NAVSUP FLCPH), on behalf of Naval Computer and Telecommunications Area Master Station Pacific (NCTAMS PAC), plan to issue contract modifications to extend the current contract N00604-12-C-3035 for Operations and Maintenance of Navy communication, electronic, and computer systems at various locations on Oahu for up to a maximum period of two months on the basis of other than full and open competition. Sole source modifications are consistent with the terms identified within this announcement upon the basis of the authority provided in 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) and implemented by FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements.
 This notice is being posted because the option, under FAR 52.217-8, was not previously evaluated as part of initial contract award. The extension will be at the current rates specified in the current contract, as allowed by FAR 52.217-8, and will extend performance for a period not to exceed two months, beginning on 1 January 2013. This option extension will further allow for evaluation and award of the competitive follow-on procurement. The incumbent contractor is the only responsible offeror for this option as the Government would experience unacceptable delays in fulfilling agency requirements if extensions are not executed before the contract expiration date.  

This notice is not a request for proposals.
 No phone inquiries will be entertained. All responses shall be made in writing by email or U.S. mail, to the attention of Julie Nguyen-Livic using the contact information provided in this synopsis.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training, and Instrumentation (PEO STRI) is contemplating a new multiple award Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) Contract for a wide range of training tasks and services to support the Warfighter Outside the Contiguous United States (OCONUS) and Continental United States (CONUS) locations.

These demands and requests to PEO STRI for this instructional training across a varied customer base have driven the PEO to contemplate award of a multiple award contract dedicated to satisfying these customer/Warfighter services. The addition of PEO STRI's new training services contract will give the Army and our other Support Mission Customers a broader performance based service scope and increased efficiencies through competition. <br>  <br> A revised Draft Performance Work Statement (PWS) is provided with this announcement to industry as a read ahead.

<DESC>The United States Geological Survey, Reston Acquisition Branch located in Reston, VA with Field Office in Saint Petersburg, FL intends to make a non-competitive award to the University of Florida located in Gainesville, FL  for a collaboration effort to develop a modeling approach to forecast beach vulnerability to storms and sea level rise in National Parks. The Coastal Geomorphology Lab at University of Florida has conducted coastal change analyses for settings similar to those in this task. The acquisition of its services for this study and the implementation of an existing USGS model famework will greatly promote consistency among studies.  Because the model was developed by USGS researchers, it is not something that is commercially offered, nor are other research groups utilizing it. Existing USGS datasets and a model framework will be incorporated into a Bayesian network and a variety of scenario-based analyses will be performed to evaluate model performance and output change predictions at different time scales. The Government intends to award this requirement noncompetitively in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements. Other interested concerns having the ability to furnish this service shall submit a capabilities statement to the Contracting Officer no later than the closing date of this announcement. All submissions will be evaluated to determine if competitive opportunities exist. If no competitive opportunities exist, request for quotation (RFQ) G13PS00173 will be made available to PRIME through the Government-wide Point of Entry (GPE) on or about February 13, 2013 IAW FAR 5.102(a)(1).

<p>FAR 52-212-1 Instructions to Offerors is incorporated by reference.</p>
<p>FAR 52-212-1 Instructions to Offerors - Addendum</p>
<p>INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS</p>
<p>I. PROPOSAL PREPARATION INSTRUCTIONS</p>
<p>A. To assure timely and equitable evaluation of proposals, offerors must follow the instructions contained herein. Offerors are required to meet all requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications and Performance Work Statement requirements. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being ineligible for award. Offerors must clearly identify any exception to the solicitation terms and conditions and provide complete accompanying rationale. A proposal shall consist of two (2) separate parts; Volume I - Price Proposal and Volume II - Past Performance Information. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Emailed proposals are preferred</span>. Offerors are cautioned to follow the detailed instructions fully and carefully, as the Government intends to make an award without discussions.</p>
<p>In proposal volumes, follow the quantity and page limits as follows:</p>
<p>Volume I - Price Proposal (Bid Schedule) No page limit<br /><br />Volume II - Past Performance Proposal 10 pages (*)</p>
<p>NOTES:</p>
<p>* If the offeror is utilizing significant subcontractors, a total of ten (10) additional pages are authorized for all subcontractors past performance information. Past performance regarding predecessor companies, key personnel who have relevant experience, or sub-contractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement will NOT be rated as highly as past performance information for the principal offeror.</p>
<p>Proposals will be checked to determine the number of pages and compliance with proposal instructions. Those pages in excess of the limit will be removed from the back of Volume II and returned by the Procuring Contracting Officer (PCO) to ensure they are not evaluated. The Government will not keep any pages in excess of the limit.</p>
<p>B. The contracting officer has determined there is a high probability of adequate price competition in this acquisition. Upon examination of the initial offers, the contracting officer will review this determination and if, in the contracting officer's opinion, adequate price competition exists, no additional cost information will be requested and certification under FAR 15.406-2 will not be required. However, if at any time during this competition the contracting officer determines that adequate price competition no longer exists, offerors may be required to submit information to the extent necessary for the contracting officer to determine the reasonableness and affordability of the price. In accordance with FAR 15.403-1(b) and 15.403-3(a), data other than cost or pricing data may be required to support price reasonableness and realism. Data shall be provided in accordance with FAR 15.403-5. If, after receipt of proposals, the CO determines that there is insufficient information available to determine price reasonableness and none of the exceptions in FAR 15.403-1 apply, the Offeror shall be required to submit certified cost or pricing data. Should adequate price competition not exist after receipt of proposals, the provisions of FAR Part 15.403-4 shall apply, and the Offeror will be asked to provide certification of cost or pricing data?</p>
<p>C. Specific Instructions:</p>
<p>1. Volume I - PRICE PROPOSAL</p>
<p>(a) Insert proposed prices on the bid schedule (Attachment 2) for the base period, the one (1) option period, and a combined total price of the base period and option period . A breakout of the estimated workload data for Oil/Water Separators, Grease Traps and Lift Stations can be found in Appendix A of the attached Performance Work Statement (Attachment 1).</p>
<p>(b) Period for acceptance of offers. The offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm until 1 April 2013.</p>
<p>2. Volume II - PAST PERFORMANCE PROPOSAL</p>
<p>The Government will evaluate the quality and extent of offeror's performances deemed recent and relevant to the requirements of this RFP. Only information for same or similar type contracts is desired. Provide any information currently available (i.e. descriptive language, letters, metrics, customer surveys, independent surveys, etc.) which demonstrates customer satisfaction with overall job performance and quality of completed projects for same or similar type contracts completed in the last three years. In addition, explain corrective actions taken in the past, if any, for substandard performance and any current performance problems such as extended performance periods, numerous warranty calls, etc. Provide comments regarding any known performance deemed unacceptable to the customer, or not in accordance with the contract terms and conditions. If applicable, provide a letter from all subcontractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement, consenting to the release of their past performance information to the prime contractor. Past performance regarding predecessor companies, key personnel who have recent and relevant experience, or sub-contractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement will NOT be rated as highly as past performance information for the principal offeror.</p>
<p>D. RECENT AND RELEVANT INFORMATION For the purpose of this solicitation, Recent and Relevant Past Performance is defined as:</p>
<p>1. RECENT - Ongoing contracts with a performance history, and contracts completed within three (3) years from the issue date of this Combined Synopsis/Solicitation posting.</p>
<p>2. RELEVANT -Performance of work which is the same or similar in scope, trade, and complexity, as described in the combined synopsis/solicitation, including contract type, contract environment, subcontractor interaction, and price. The Government may also use other information available to it that is determined relevant to this effort, such as, but not limited to, the Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS).</p>
<p>Teaming Arrangement or Joint Venture: If the offeror intends to fulfill the requirements of this solicitation in a teaming arrangement or joint venture, the offeror must provide complete information as to the arrangement, including a list of any relevant and recent past/present performance information on previous teaming arrangements or joint ventures with the same teaming or joint venture partner. If this is a first time joint effort, each party to the arrangement must provide a list of past and present contracts.</p>
<p>Subcontractor Consent: Past performance information pertaining to a subcontractor cannot be disclosed to the prime offeror without the subcontractor's consent. Provide with the proposal a letter from all subcontractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement, consenting to the release of their past performance information to the prime contractor.</p>
<p>RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN, INSTRUCTIONS AND EVALUATION</p>
<p>Your attention is directed to the functional relationship between Instructions to offers and Evaluation of Offers. Instructions provide information for the purpose of organizing the proposal and are not intended to be all-inclusive. Evaluation of Offers describes evaluation factors for award, to include the evaluation procedures for responsiveness to the combined synopsis/solicitation, ranking of the Price proposal and the assessment of Past Performance information. PROPOSALS THAT DO NOT CONTAIN THE INFORMATION REQUESTED BY THIS PROVISION RISK REJECTION.</p>
<p>3. Any limitation on the number of proposal pages. Pages exceeding the page limitations set forth in this Clause will not be read or evaluated, and will be removed from the proposal (in a manner previously described in paragraph A of this contract clause).</p>
<p>4. Format for all proposal Volumes shall be as follows:</p>

<p>(c) Page Definition. A page is defined as one face of a sheet of paper containing information.</p>
<p>(d) Page Numbering. Pages in each volume must be numbered sequentially and consecutively. The cover page, table of contents, list(s) of tables and drawings, and blank pages are excluded from the page count.</p>
<p>E. Deviations. Deviations from these instructions will be reviewed by the Contracting Officer to ensure that no contractor receives a competitive advantage. Deviations resulting in a competitive advantage for an offeror will result in the proposal being determined noncompliant with the RFP requirements. Offerors unconditionally assume the risk that a clear quantitative deviation will be deemed qualitatively advantageous to the offeror and determined noncompliant with the RFP.</p>
<p>F. Disposition of Unsuccessful Proposals. In accordance with FAR Subpart 4.8 (Government Contract Files), the Government will retain one copy of all unsuccessful proposals. Unless the offeror requires otherwise, the Government will destroy extra copies of unsuccessful proposals.</p>

<p>&nbsp;52.212-2 - Evaluation - Commercial Items - Addendum</p>
<p>EVALUATION OF PROPOSALS</p>
<p>I. BASIS FOR CONTRACT AWARD</p>
<p>A. This is a competitive Best Value acquisition using the Tradeoff Process, without technical proposals, with Past Performance being approximately equal to Price. This procurement will be conducted as a Total Small Business Set-Aside for small business concerns eligible under the small business program. The Government will award a contract resulting from the solicitation to the acceptable, responsible Small Business offeror whose proposal conforming to this solicitation offers the Best Value to the Government, with Past Performance being approximately equal to Price. Evaluation criteria are the same for all competing offerors.</p>
<p>B. Offerors shall propose on all items. Any offer that fails to cite a price for each item or fails to make an entry that indicates service will be provided at no charge may be rejected as nonconforming to this solicitation.</p>
<p>C. Only Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP) offers will be evaluated. An offer using a sliding price scale or subject to escalation based on any contingency will not be accepted.</p>
<p>D. The evaluation process will proceed as follows:</p>
<p>1. Price: Initially, offers will be ranked according to Total Evaluated Price (TEP). The price evaluation will be made on the basis of the total price of all line items including the corresponding CLINs under Options. An offeror must therefore propose on all line items including the options. Price will be evaluated for reasonableness based on prices submitted from competitive proposals, current market conditions, and comparison to the Government estimate. Prices will also be evaluated to determine if they are materially unbalanced. Materially unbalanced prices risk rejection.</p>
<p>2. Past Performance: Using the information provided in the Past Performance Reference Information (Volume II), Past Performance Proposal and other available information, the contracting officer shall seek recent and relevant performance information on all offerors based on the past efforts provided by the offeror and data independently obtained from other government and commercial sources.<br /><br />(a) Recent and Relevant Information: For the purpose of this combined synopsis/solicitation, Recent and Relevant Past Performance is defined as:</p>
<p>(1) Recent - Ongoing contracts with a performance history and contracts completed within three (3) years from the issue date of this solicitation.</p>
<p>(2) Relevant - Performance of work efforts involving Oil/Water, Grease Traps and Lift Stations services and management that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation and performance work statement.</p>
<p>(b) The Government reserves the right to seek information on higher priced offerors if none of the lower priced offerors receive a Substantial Confidence performance confidence assessment. The purpose of the past performance evaluation is to allow the government to assess the offeror's ability to perform the effort described in this RFP, based on the offeror's demonstrated past performance. The Government will conduct a performance confidence assessment based upon past performance of the offerors as it relates to the probability of successfully performing the solicitation requirements. This evaluation will include the contractor's record of: (A) conforming to the Performance Work Statement and contract requirements, (B) management of work, (C) reasonable, cooperative behavior, performance and commitment to customer satisfaction and (D) quality control. This assessment represents the government evaluation team's judgment of the probability of an offeror successfully accomplishing the proposed effort, based upon the offeror's demonstrated past performance. The rating may be determined initially or as a result of discussions. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of Substantial Confidence, Satisfactory Confidence, Limited Confidence, No Confidence, or Unknown Confidence.</p>
<p>(c) Offerors with no relevant past or present performance history or the offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned shall receive the rating "Unknown Confidence," meaning the rating is treated neither favorably nor unfavorably. Definitions for Performance Confidence Assessments and Relevancy are as defined below:</p>
<p>Performance Confidence Assessments</p>
<p>Substantial Confidence - Based on the offeror's recent/relevant performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>Satisfactory Confidence - Based on the offeror's recent/relevant performance record, The Government has a reasonable expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />Limited Confidence - Based on the offeror's recent/relevant performance record, The Government has a low expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>No Confidence - Based on the offeror's recent/relevant performance record, The Government has no expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>Unknown Confidence (Neutral) - No recent/relevant performance record is available or the offeror's performance record is so sparse that no meaningful confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned.</p>
<p>Past Performance Relevancy Ratings Definitions</p>
<p>Very Relevant - Present/past performance effort involved essentially the same scope and magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.<br /><br />Relevant - Present/past performance effort involved similar scope and magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.</p>
<p>Somewhat Relevant - Present/past performance effort involved some of the scope and magnitude of effort and complexities than this solicitation requires.</p>
<p>Not Relevant - Present/past performance effort involved little or none of the scope and magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.</p>
<p>(d) In evaluating past performance, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this RFP.</p>
<p>E. Best Value Determination: Offerors will be initially ranked from lowest Total Evaluated Price (TEP) to the highest TEP.</p>
<p>1. If the lowest TEP is determined to be reasonable, and is judged to have an overall Substantial confidence performance rating, that offer represents the Best Value for the Government and the evaluation process stops at this point. Award will be made to that offeror without further consideration of any other offers.</p>
<p>2. IF THE LOWEST TEP OFFER IS NOT JUDGED TO HAVE AN OVERALL SUBSTAINIAL CONFIDENCE PEFORMANCE RATING THE EVALUATION WILL CONTINUE AS FOLLOWS:</p>
<p>(a) If the lowest TEP acceptable offer is reasonable, but does not have a confidence rating of Substantial Confidence, the next lowest TEP, acceptable offer will be evaluated and the process will continue until an offeror whose price is reasonable receives a confidence rating of Substantial Confidence overall for past performance.</p>
<p>(b) The Source Selection Authority shall then make an integrated assessment Best Value award decision by determining if the Best Value to the Government is to pay a higher cost for a higher past performance assessment rating. The Government reserves the following rights:</p>
<p>(1) To award a contract to the lowest TEP offeror who has Substantial Confidence Rating;<br />(2) To award to higher TEP offeror who has Substantial Confidence Rating;<br />(3) To award a contract to the lowest TEP offeror who has at least a Satisfactory Confidence Rating.</p>
<p>3. Offerors are cautioned to submit sufficient information and in the format specified in FAR 52.212-1. Offeror's may be asked to clarify certain aspects of their proposal (for example, the relevance of present and past performance information) or respond to adverse present/past performance information to which the offeror has not previously had an opportunity to respond. Adverse past performance is defined as past performance information that supports a less than satisfactory rating on any evaluation element or any unfavorable comments received from sources without a formal rating system. Communication conducted to resolve minor or clerical errors will not constitute discussions and the contracting officer reserves the right to award a contract without the opportunity for proposal revision.</p>
<p>4. The Government intends to award a contract without discussions with respective offerors. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if deemed in its best interest.</p>
<p>5. Rejection of Unrealistic Offers: The Government may reject any proposal that is assessed to be unrealistic in terms of contract requirements, including contract terms and conditions, or unrealistically high or low in cost, such that the proposal is deemed to reflect lack of competence or failure to comprehend the scope of the requirement. Proposals that are unrealistic in terms of price may be rejected at any time during the evaluation process. Proposals are intended to be evaluated, and award made, without discussions with the offerors (other than minor clarification[s]), unless discussions are determined to be necessary. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary. Offerors may be required to participate in telephone discussions or in face-to-face oral discussions at the Operational Contracting Division, 308 West "D" Avenue, Suite 130, Bldg 260, Eglin AFB FL. Offerors are cautioned to follow the detailed instructions fully and carefully, as the Government reserves the right to make an award based on initial offers received, without discussion of such offers. The offeror's initial proposal should reflect their best effort.</p>

<SUBJECT>Evaluation of the Host-Targeted Bait Box, Select Tick Control System (TCR) to Reduce the Entomological Risk of Lyme Disease in a Lyme Endemic Area of North Central New Jersey
<SOLNBR>00HCVLJC-2013-55757
<RESPDATE>022113
<CONTACT>Tamera D. Murphy, Phone (770) 488-2612, Fax (770) 488-2044, Email tdm1@cdc.gov
<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, NCEZID Division of Vector Disease, 3156 Rampart Road M/S P-02, Fort Collins, Colorado, 80521-3003, hereby announces its intent to issue a sole source firm fixed price purchase order&nbsp;in accordance with FAR 6.302-1 to TERRY L. SCHULZE, PHD, INC., 9 Evergreen Court, Perrineville, New Jersey, 08535-1112 for the evaluation of the host-targeted bait box,&nbsp;and SELECT Tick Control System (TCS)&reg;&nbsp;to reduce the Entomological Risk of Lyme Disease in a Lyme Endemic Area of North Central New Jersey.<br />
<p>The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of modified Select TCS bait boxes containing the acaricide fipronil and the Connecticut Tick Control protective shroud device. The study will be conducted according to current product labeling and will determine the ability of these boxes as a stand-alone method of intervention to: 1) reduce tick infestation rates on small mammal reservoirs (Peromyscus leucopus, Tamias striatus, Microtus pennsylvanicus, and Blarina brevicauda), 2) reduce questing Ixodes scapularis tick populations, and 3) ability of host-targeted bait boxes to reduce infection rates in small mammal reservoirs as well as questing tick populations for both Borrelia burgdorferi (Bb) and Anaplasma phagocytophilum (Ap).</p>
<p>The vendor shall furnish all labor, materials and equipment necessary to evaluate the efficacy of Select TCS bait boxes. This will include but is not limited to all necessary equipment to perform rodent reservoir and questing tick evaluations. The vendor will need to have access to suitable tick/rodent/Lyme disease habitat with a minimum of 0.1 tick/m2 and adequate species of Peromyscus leucopus, Tamias striatus, Microtus pennsylvanicus , and Blarina brevicauda.</p>
<p>The vendor shall furnish all labor, materials, processing equipment, live mammalian traps (Sherman and Tomahawk), bait boxes, and equipment necessary to evaluate the efficacy of doxycycline impregnated rodent bait to reduce infected rodent reservoirs and infected questing ticks in residential areas. The vendor will identify suitable test sites for the study, conduct monthly pre- and post-treatment flagging and trapping of animals during the nymphal and larval activity periods of I. scapularis to determine the ability of these host-targeted technologies to reduce infected reservoirs, reduce the risk of tick-borne diseases, and evaluate host-targeted deployment strategies, and assist with obtaining all isolates for evaluation by PCR and culture. Vendor will provide monthly reports and perform statistical analysis. All data will be sent to CDC/NCEZID/DVBD, Fort Collins, CO.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The vendor shall locate, measure, and stake a total of 10 1-3 ha residential properties (&gt; 60% wooded) in Millstone Township, Monmouth County, New Jersey and at least 2 untreated control areas on Naval Weapons Station Earle, Colts Neck, NJ. The intervention and untreated areas must contain &gt; 0.1 tick/m2. Preliminary trapping surveys must be conducted on each property and show abundant populations of ticks and small mammal hosts. The study will evaluate Select TCS which is a 19.05 cm x 13.97 cm x 6.35 cm child-resistant plastic box containing a non-toxic monitoring bait and a fipronil-treated felt wick assembly (0.7% AI, 3 ml total volume). After entering the box, the small mammals travel down the central corridor and are passively treated as they contact the wick while attempting to access the bait chambers. A single treatment is effective in killing ticks on small mammals for &gt; 52 d.</p>
<p>All Select TCS bait boxes need to have the following modification done. A 2-piece, tightly fitting protective cover constructed of 0.032 gauge galvanized steel will need to be installed over each box. The top and bottom sections of the clam-shell cover and bait box will be secured together at 2 opposite corners by means of 20.3 cm cable ties. The protected shroud is a proprietary device of Connecticut Tick Control Services, LLC (Norwalk, CT 06854). Bait boxes will be deployed on treatment areas according to product label and in accordance with suitable small mammal habitat and pre-treatment trapping. Approximate description of deployment: bait boxes should be deployed along 2 concentric rings, with the first located within the forest at &plusmn; 10 m from the lawn edge with a &plusmn; 25-m interval between individual boxes. Wherever possible, boxes should be placed in proximity to likely small mammal foraging or nesting sites. Because the combined weight of the bait box and protective covering exceeded 1200 g and are judged too heavy to be easily displaced by nuisance wildlife, the boxes should not need tethered.</p>
<p>Pretreatment tick collections, flagging, and animal trapping will need to be completed in all areas by May 25, 2012. These sites will be sampled 2 times at weekly intervals to determine tick density, rodent density, rodent infestation rate, rodent infection rates, and tick infection rates prior to setting out bait boxes. Small mammals will be trapped using Sherman and Tomahawk live traps. All captures will be processed for materials and analyzed as follows: anesthetized, ear biopsied, bled by cheek punch, physical measurements recorded, ectoparisites removed and placed in ETOH, ear-tagged, and released at the capture site. Ear biopsies will be surface sterilized and cultured in BSK-H media for detection of live spirochetes by dark-field microscopy. Tick pools collected from rodents will be screened for infection by PCR. Both sites will be flagged for questing nymphal ticks. Ticks will be individually screened by PCR for infection with Bb. (Secondary future analysis will include PCR for Ap). Both areas will be flagged for questing ticks. Collected ticks will be recorded and analyzed by PCR.</p>
<p>Bait boxes will need to be visited weekly during the first 4 weeks of the nymphal and larval season deployments and weighed in the field using a portable balance. Any change in box orientation or damage to boxes, including the acaricide wicks, should be noted for later replacement or repair. All efficacy data will be recorded for each time point and data will be analyzed, statistical analysis performed, and written report provided to CDC. All laboratory and field work should be performed under "Good Laboratory Practices" (GLP) guidelines as set forth by FDA and EPA. Animal work will need to be performed under an approved IACUC protocol on file at CDC, DVBD, BDB.</p>
<p>The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) as cited in FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), "Only one source [is] reasonably available". TERRY L. SCHULZE, PHD, INC., is the only source that is able to furnish all labor, materials and equipment necessary to determine the efficacy of these host-targeted methods in a field setting and in close enough proximity to conduct the study at weekly intervals and evaluate data using statistical analysis including the Henderson method for comparing efficacy of treated vs. control plots. TERRY L. SCHULZE, PHD, INC. is located approximately 1-6 miles from each study site, a licensed pest control operator within the study areas, and is the only Lyme disease field expert that has the experience and ability to fulfill all of the contract requirements.<br />Responsible sources that believe they possess the expertise and capabilities identified above are encouraged to submit to the Contracting Officer within 15days from the posting date of this notice, their written capabilities statement, proposal or quotation which shall be considered by the agency. Please forward the capability statement and/or pricing information to Tamera Murphy, Purchasing Agent&nbsp;at the following email address <a href="mailto:tmurphy@cdc.gov">tmurphy@cdc.gov</a>.<br />All vendors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) prior to an award of a federal contract. The website is as follows&nbsp;<a href="http://www.sam.gov">www.sam.gov</a>.<br />The Government will review any/all capabilities statements and pricing information submitted and determine if other qualified sources do exist that could provide this requirement. Information received in response to this announcement will be used solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement for these services in the future.<br />&nbsp;</p>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>

<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only.

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks.

<p>This solicitation is issued as Request for Proposal (RFP) Number SB1341-13-RP-0040. The RFP incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-65, effective January 29, 2013.</p>

<p>The due date for receipt of offeror's proposal is 2:00 p.m. Eastern Time, Thursday, February 21, 2013. Vendor proposal shall be sent by email to the attention of Jemal Williams at jemal.williams@nist.gov.</p>

<p>Note: This is not a solicitation for third party or event planning services. Teaming/ subcontracting arrangements with hotels will be considered non-responsive.</p>
<p>1.0: Background</p>
<p>The mission of the United States Department of Commerce (DOC), International Trade Administration (ITA) is to promote world trade and strengthen the international trade and investment position of the United States. The United States and Foreign Commercial Service (USFCS) is one of four programmatic units within the International Trade Administration. The "Commercial Service" promotes United States exports, particularly those of small-and medium-sized enterprises, and protects United States commercial interests abroad. USFCS is a corps of more than 1,800 American and foreign employees dedicated to helping American companies expand sales in overseas markets through an integrated network. We operate more than 100 Export Assistance Centers (EACs) throughout the United States and 150 offices in more than 75 countries.</p>
<p>1.1: Objective</p>
<p>The USFCS has an immediate requirement to obtain a location to host and provide accommodations for the administration of the 2013 Commercial Service Assessment exam. The 2013 Commercial Service Assessment Exam will commence on April 15, 2013 and end on April 26, 2013. In the event of unforeseen circumstances in the planning of the 2013 Commercial Service Assessment Exam and the award of a contract, USFCS will require possible Contingency Dates of 3/31/13 through 4/13/13 or 4/28/13 through 5/11/13, two weeks prior to or two week after the anticipated dates of April 15, 2013 through April 26, 2013. It is essential for USFCS to have a dedicated 12-day block of time beginning on Monday.</p>
<p>Projects under this statement of work will contribute to Commercial Service workforce development and productivity by providing a facility to assess candidates at the FP-04 Class level (GS-12 equivalent). The Commercial Service Assessment will target a worldwide population (i.e., Federal employees and candidates from the private sector). Successful candidates will be eligible to receive job offers as Foreign Service Officers with the Commercial Service.</p>
<p>The Government has specific requirements for the facility we select. One major consideration is the location of the Assessment testing rooms. It is imperative that all testing rooms are located along the same hallway, on the same floor of the facility. These reasons include:</p>
<p>Test Security - To ensure only those authorized have access to test materials</p>
<p>Candidate Movement - To facilitate a seamless process for the candidates</p>
<p>Staff Reduction - To reduce additional staff needed to monitor candidates</p>
<p>2.0: Scope</p>
<p>The Government typically conducts the Assessment exam approximately every two years to maintain staffing levels within the Foreign Commercial Service. This exam is of vital importance to the mission of the Commercial Service. It is through this process that prospective new Foreign Service Officers are screened and selected. The success or failure of the Commercial Service Assessment as a screening and selection device affects the quality of the overall human capital of the Commercial Service well into the future. Traditionally, the Government has used hotels as they provided both lodging and testing rooms in one facility. Sleeping rooms are converted to testing rooms by removing the furniture and adding a table and chairs in order to provide the appropriate size and privacy for those taking and administering the examination.</p>
<p>3.0: Specific Requirements</p>
<p>The Offeror shall provide rooms in one facility to minimize transportation difficulties. The Offeror shall provide services in the following areas:</p>
<p>Only facilities that can provide lodging for all attendees in one location, in close<br />proximity to workshop/meeting rooms, will be considered.</p>
<p>3.1 The Government requires a block of Twenty-two (22) Lodging rooms (single/double occupancy) for assessors, the assessment facilitator and staff for fourteen consecutive days (04/14/2013 to 04/27/2013). Lodging rates shall be at or below the Government per diem rate. Rooms and incidentals will be paid for by individual attendees. DOC/NIST/ITA will not guarantee or fund any sleeping rooms via purchase order. All reservations will be self-made and attendees must adhere to the hotel's stated cut-off date for registration. This purchase order will not purchase any sleeping rooms, nor is a minimum number of sleeping rooms guaranteed.</p>
<p>DOC/NIST/ITA requests a conference code be provided following award to help with registration/workshop attendee tracking.</p>
<p>3.2: Hotel must be within walking distance to a Metro station to facilitate ease of movement between the facility, Department of Commerce headquarters and area airports and to assist candidates who participate in the assessment exam. In the absence of close Metro proximity, The Government will consider proposals from facilities with dedicated shuttle service to and from the airport. Amenities, such as restaurants, cleaners, shopping centers, etc., must be a short distance from the facility for assessors who will work 10-12 hour days for two weeks. Alternately, a dedicated and reliable hotel shuttle to and from such amenities must be provided.</p>
<p>Geographic Consideration: The facility must be located within five (5) miles of either the Ronald Reagan Washington International Airport and/or the Washington Dulles International Airport OR within &frac12; mile of a Washington DC area metro station. Free airport shuttle shall be provided.</p>

The Offeror shall organize the tables and chairs in a U-Shape configuration. Audio-visual equipment (projector, screen and internet connection) must be available for assessor training.</p>
<p>3.4: Sixteen (16) Individual testing process rooms, located along the same hallway, on the same floor of the facility, required from 12:00 pm on April 17, 2013 through 11:59 pm on April 26, 2013.</p>

Water pitchers are not required on Sunday, April 21, 2013. All testing rooms must be cleaned at the end of testing day (after 5:00pm). Testing rooms cannot be cleaned during the day due to the disruption to candidates during testing. No testing will occur on Sunday, April 21, 2013; therefore, the testing rooms do not need to be cleaned. Three extra room keys (or two master keys for block of rooms) are required for all testing rooms for Assessment exam staff to prepare rooms before each test day. Additionally the Government requires one additional key (not master) for each individual testing room.</p>

This announcement constitutes the only Request for Quote (RFQ). Written quotes are being requested. A hardcopy written RFQ will not be issued. The office of National Marine Fisheries Santa Cruz Tiburon Laboratory located in Santa Cruz, CA has a requirement for quantity of 750 each acoustic programmable acoustic tags for tracking salmon in San Francisco, Delta. The transmitters must meet the following specifications:<br /><br />o Transmitter must have capability to be user configurable in the field using a portable laptop PC connected to a vendor supplied tag controller/activator. Re-programming parameters must include: Tag code value (4 digit hexadecimal number) and PRI (Pulse Rate Interval) between 2 and 60 seconds.<br /><br />o The following values must be able to be displayed and verified (but not necessarily changed) in the field using the vendor supplied portable tag controller/activator in stand-alone configuration: (1) Tag code value (4 digit hexadecimal number), (2) CRC value (cyclic redundancy check), (3) PRI Measured (pulse rate interval, in seconds with 1000th of a second precision) and (4) Estimated tag frequency (in kHz).<br /><br />o Run time guarantee of 70% of expected life. Expected life is a function of pulse rate interval (PRI) and must be stated in the bid for PRI of 1, 2, 3, 5, and 10 seconds. Example if transmitters expected life is 38 days with PRI at 5 seconds then warranty life is 26.6 days (70% of 38 days). A tag fail would be defined as a tag not meeting the 70% of expected life. <br /><br />o 5% of transmitters will be randomly selected and monitored to determine actual run time. If premature failure is observed, percent failed from 5% subsample shall be scaled up to total purchased and warranty claim shall be based on this number.<br /><br />o JSATS compatible - binary phase shift keyed code pulse operating on frequency of 416.7 kHz +/- 0.5%.

STATISTICAL REPORTING (PPIRS-SR) IN PAST PERFORMANCE EVALUATION (1)   The offeror?s past performance shall be evaluated in accordance with FAR 13.106-2 or 15.305(a)(2), as applicable.  This procurement is subject to Past Performance Information Retrieval System ? Statistical Reporting (PPIRS-SR), authorized by the Department of Defense for use by participating activities during the acquisition of supplies and services.  
(2)   The purpose of the PPIRS-SR is to provide contracting personnel with quantifiable past performance information regarding delivery and quality, as collected from existing DoD reporting systems.  PPIRS-SR uses the past performance data collected to classify each supplier?s performance by Federal Supply Class(es) or Service Code(s).
(3)   Quality:  The method used in PPIRS-SR to classify the quality of a supplier?s past performance is a comparison of quality records among all suppliers who have provided goods or services to the Federal Government which are categorized in the same Federal Supply Class or Service Class (FSC).  Based on the comparison among suppliers in a specific FSC group, suppliers are classified by PPIRS-SR into a color rating that represents the supplier?s overall quality performance for that specific Federal Supply Class or Service Class.  The following is a summarization of the PPIRS-SR classification colors:
1.  Dark Blue:Top 5% of suppliers in FSC group* 2.  Purple:Next 10% of suppliers in FSC group* 3.  Green:Next 70% of suppliers in FSC group* 4.  Yellow:Next 10% of suppliers in FSC group* 5.  Red:Bottom 5% of suppliers in FSC group*
* If all supplier performance ratings for an entire FSC group are equal, all suppliers in that group will be classified Green.
(4)   Delivery:  Supplier delivery past performance is classified in PPIRS-SR by the supplier?s percentage of on time deliveries.  On time deliveries are calculated using the number of line items delivered and a weighting factor which reflects the length of time a delivery was overdue.
(5)   PPIRS-SR classifications are established monthly for each supplier and can be reviewed at http://www.ppirs.gov/.  Suppliers are granted access to PPIRS-SR for their own classifications.  Offerors are encouraged to review their own classifications as well as the PPIRS-SR reporting procedures and methodology detailed in the PPIRS-SR Procedures Manual and the PPIRS-SR User Guide available at http://www.ppirs.gov.  The method to challenge a rating is also found on the identified website.
(6)   Suppliers with no history in PPIRS-SR will be considered to have a neutral PPIRS-SR rating. <BR> <BR>Due to the interrelationship of supplies and/or services to be provided hereunder, the Government reserves the right to make a single award to the offeror whose offer is considered in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered.  Therefore, offerors proposing less than the entire effort specified herein may be determined to be unacceptable. <BR> <BR>1)   Award under this procurement will be made to the technically acceptable quote/offer which is most advantageous to the Government, price and past performance considered.
2)   Technically Acceptable - In order to be determined technically acceptable, offers must meet or exceed the specifications, delivery requirements, and other terms and conditions in the solicitation and any subsequent amendments.  If applicable, offers must also meet the requirements of FAR 52.211-6 Brand Name or Equal.   The offer must be determined to be technically acceptable before further consideration.
3)   Price - Evaluation of price will include the following:
(  )Single Award evaluation per the paragraph entitled "Single Award for All Items". (  )Split Award evaluation per the paragraph entitled ?Evaluation of Offers for Split Awards?. (  )Transportation costs per FAR 52.247-__@@___. (  )Evaluation of Options per FAR 52.217-__@@__.
4)   Past Performance - Evaluation of past performance will be based on information obtained from PPIRS-SR as well as any other sources which may have relevant information.  A quote/offer with a low PPIRS-SR rating (red or yellow for quality and/or less than a 70 weighted delivery score) may not represent the most advantageous quote/offer to the Government. <BR> <BR>F.O.B.

This authority is cited and justification made based on the determination that the Government's minimum needs can best be satisfied by services available in this location. The nursing facility shall ensure that care meets the health needs and promotes the maximum well being of VA patients. Nursing home care will be furnished to ensure the total medical, nursing, and psychosocial needs of VA beneficiaries.  Physician visits, laboratory, x-ray, and other special services for VA patients will be at the same frequency as that provided to other patients at the nursing home receiving the same or comparable level of care.

STATEMENT OF WORK:  
1. The nursing home shall ensure that care meets the health needs and promotes the maximum well being of VA patients.  Nursing home care will be furnished to ensure the total medical, nursing, and psychosocial needs of VA Beneficiaries.  Physician visits, laboratory, x-ray, and other special services for VA patients will be at the same frequency as that provided to other patients at the nursing home receiving the same or comparable level of care.  In addition, the care provided will include room, meals, nursing care, and other services or supplies commensurate with the VA authorized level of care, without extra charge.  The per diem rate(s) will include the cost of medical care, oral medications, laboratory, x-ray, and other special services authorized by VA, unless otherwise specifically accepted.
2.  Full attention shall be given to motivating and educating patients to achieve and maintain independence in the activities of daily living.  Every effort shall be made to keep patients ambulatory and to achieve an optimal level of self-care.
3.  Absences of the patient from the nursing home in excess of 48 hours will not be reimbursable.
4.  Patients, who begin to require more than the level of care authorized by VA, will be readmitted to an appropriate VA facility, as determined and authorized by VA.  When such admission is not feasible because of the nature of the emergency, it is agreed that hospitalization in a non-Federal facility may be accomplished provided VA authorization is obtained.  VA authorization must be obtained within 72 hours of admission of the patient to a non-Federal facility.  If hospitalization of a non-emergency nature is required, it is agreed that readmission to a VA Medical Center will be accomplished as soon as the patient's condition is sufficiently stabilized to permit admission to VA.
5.  In the event a VA beneficiary receiving nursing home care under this contract dies, the nursing home will promptly notify the VA facility authorizing admission and immediately assemble, inventory, and safeguard the patient's personal effects.  The funds, deposits, and effects left by the VA patients upon the premises of the nursing home shall be delivered by the nursing home to the person or persons entitled thereto under the laws currently governing the nursing home for making disposition of funds and effects left by patients, unless the beneficiary died without leaving a will, heirs, or next of kin capable of inheriting.  When disposition has been made, the itemized inventory with annotation as to the disposition of the funds and effects will be immediately forwarded to the VA facility authorizing admission.  Should a deceased patient leave no will, heirs, or next of kin, his/her personal property and funds wherever located vests in and becomes the property of the United States in trust.  In these cases the nursing home will forward an inventory of any such property and funds in its possession to the VA facility authorizing admission and will hold them (except articles of clothing necessary for proper burial) under safeguard until instructions are received from VA concerning disposition.
6.  The nursing home shall not maintain nor provide dual or segregated patient facilities, which are segregated on the basis of race, creed, color, or national origin.  The nursing home shall neither require such segregated use by written or oral policies nor tolerate such use by local custom.  The term facilities shall include but not be limited to rooms, wards, sections, eating areas, drinking fountains, entrances, and other like areas.  It is agreed that VA will have the right to inspection of the nursing home and all appurtenances by authorized VA representative(s) to ensure that acceptable standards are maintained and that the necessary care to maintain the well being of the patient is rendered.
7.  Veterans receiving care under this agreement, who begin to require acute hospital care, will be readmitted to an appropriate VA facility, as determined and authorized by the VA.   When such admission is not feasible because of the nature of the emergency, it is agreed that hospitalization in a non-Federal facility may be accomplished provided VA authorization is obtained.  VA authorization must be obtained as soon as possible and not to exceed 72 hours of admission to the non-Federal facility.  If hospitalization of a non-emergency nature is required, it is agreed that readmission to a VA facility will be accomplished as soon as the patient's condition is sufficiently stabilized to permit admission to VA.
8.  If a veteran is re-hospitalized from the nursing home, the nursing home and VA facility will arrange to hold a bed in reserve, when such a decision is in the best interest of the patient and the VA.  The number of covered bed hold days will be determined by VA on a case-by-case basis, but will not exceed the number of bed hold days allowed by state Medicaid regulations.  Payment will follow state Medicaid regulations.  The VA facility will include payment for these "bed hold" days only when the conditions above are met.
9.  The VA facility will approve leave days (days away from the nursing home) for long-term placements.  The leave must be part of a therapeutic plan and approved by VA.  Leave days at VA expense are limited to 6 days per calendar year.  Payment will follow state Medicaid regulations.  Exceptions may be approved by the VA facility director or designee.
10.  Patients receiving care under this contract, who begin to require more than the level of care authorized by VA, will be readmitted to an appropriate VA facility, as determined and authorized by VA.   When such admission is not feasible because of the nature of the emergency, it is agreed that hospitalization in a non Federal facility may be accomplished provided VA authorization is obtained.  VA authorization must be obtained within 72 hours of admission of the patient to a non Federal facility.  If hospitalization of a non emergency nature is required, it is agreed that readmission to a VA Medical Center will be accomplished as soon as the patient's condition is sufficiently stabilized to permit admission to VA.
11.  It is agreed that VA will have the right to on-site reviews of the nursing home and all appurtenances by authorized VA representative(s) to ensure that acceptable standards are maintained and that the necessary care to maintain the well-being of the patient is rendered.
12.  The nursing home shall provide all services specified herein, regardless of the race, color, religion, sex or national origin of the person for whom such services are ordered.  In addition, the nursing home warrants that subcontracting will not be resorted to as a means of circumventing this provision.
13.  It is agreed that duly authorized representatives of VA will provide follow-up supervision visits to veterans placed to assure the continuity of care and to assist in the veteran's transition back into the community.  It is understood that these visits do not substitute nor relieve the nursing home in any way of the responsibility for the daily care and medical treatment of the veteran.
14.  All medical records concerning the veteran's care in the nursing home will be readily accessible to VA.  Upon discharge or death of the patient, medical records will be retained by the nursing home for a period of at least three years following termination of care.  Patient records will be maintained in conformance with the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a).

16.  The contract for the affected patient will terminate whenever a VA patient is rehospitalized for fifteen (15) calendar days or more, whether in a VA or in a non-Federal facility.  A new authorization agreement and contract will be considered at the time the patient returns.
17.  The level of care classification and associated per diem rate will remain in effect for each placement until and unless one of the following events takes place: (a) The recipient is discharged and subsequently qualifies for a new admission assessment, (b)The nursing home's Minimum Data Set (MDS) assessment will be completed at customary times during a patient's stay, dependent on projection for short term or long term residence, and adhering to the most current MDS frequency guidelines from Medicare MDS or BRA or MPAF.  The applicable per diem rate will continue until the next assessment. In addition, assessment will be made eight (8) days after the completion of an episode of authorized rehabilitation therapy, after a rehospitalization, after a significant change in status and at VA's request.  Classification changes will be approved by VA. VA staff will audit approximately 20% of the MDS assessments.  Based on these findings, VA retains the right to remove the automatic applicability of the nursing home generated MDS assessment for payment purposes, and (c) Therapy Requirements - All therapy provided under this contract will be individual therapy, rather than group therapy, unless otherwise ordered by the authorizing VA facility.  NOTE: Prior to starting a therapy program, facility must obtain VA pre-authorization.

VA will make payment for the day a recipient enters the facility but not the day the recipient leaves a facility unless entrance and departure are on the same day, then payment will be made for one day, (4) LIFE SAFETY CODE CLAUSE:  The administrator of your facility is required to notify the VA Contracting Officer at least 3 days prior to any planned facility changes that could impact the Life Safety Code and other safety features of the facility, which were in existence at the time this contract was issued.

<DESC><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation number HSCG38-13-Q-200042 is issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ). This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-65. The applicable North American Industry Classification Standard Code is 336413. The small business size standard is 1,000 employees. The US Coast Guard Aviation Logistics Center intends to award a firm fixed price purchase order for the purchase of the following parts used on the Short Range Recovery (SRR) aircraft:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />It is anticipated that a non-competitive order shall be awarded on a sole source basis to American Eurocopter Corporation as a result of this synopsis/solicitation. All parts must have clear traceability to the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), Eurocopter France. Traceability means a clear, complete, documented, and auditable paper trail which traces each step from an OEM or distributor to its current location.<br />It is the Government's belief that American Eurocopter Corporation is the only source able to obtain the required technical and engineering data, and genuine OEM parts, required to successfully provide these items. Concerns having the expertise and required capabilities to provide these items are invited to submit offers in accordance with the requirements stipulated in this solicitation. No alternate part numbers will be accepted. The Government will award a purchase order resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government.</p>
<p>Best Value to the Government is always the goal, but without jeopardizing quality or safety of flight. Parts must be approved in accordance with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) guidelines to ensure safety of SRR aircrew.</p>
<p>Only the use of airworthy commercial specifications or standard military specifications/military standard parts will be utilized and approved from this solicitation. Newly manufactured commercial items will only be procured from sources able to provide a certificate of airworthiness, FAA 8130 (preferred) or equivalent EASA Certification, a certificate of conformance and traceability to the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM). The Federal Aviation Regulation, Part 21, outlines certification procedures. Drawings and specifications are not available and cannot be furnished by the Government.</p>
<p>Packaging, packing and preservation shall be in accordance with best commercial practices to enable shipment to destination and transshipment to Coast Guard units without repackaging or incurring damage during shipment and handling. Items shall be individually packaged and labeled. Labeling shall include the appropriate national Stock number, Part Number, Nomenclature, quantity, Delivery Order Number and Line Item number. Labeling data shall be attached to the outside of the shipping container. Bar coding is not required.</p>

<p>52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Items (FEB 2012) with the following included by Addendum:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />Evaluation - Commercial Items <br />Quotes will be evaluated and purchase order issued to the lowest priced technically acceptable. <br />Technically Acceptable: Quotes must be for new manufactured commercial items from sources able to provide a certificate of airworthiness, FAA 8130 (preferred) or equivalent EASA Certification, a certificate of conformance and traceability to the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM).

The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.<br />(1) Certain Stock Disregarded.

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />FAX: 202.475.3904 <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.      <br>        <br>    The solicitation number is W911QY-13-R-0022 and is issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP), unless otherwise indicated herein.  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular FAC 2005-62, effective December 20, 2012.  This will be a full and open competition to provide a Joint Service Equipment Wipe (JSEW) that will be used to decontaminate sensitive equipment (such as weapons system optics and electronics) and non-sensitive equipment under NAICS code 325998 -- All Other Miscellaneous Chemical Product and Preparation Manufacturing.     <br>        <br>    The small business size standard is 500 employees. Multiple awards are anticipated.  The number of awards will be dependent upon the number of Offerors with qualifying products and available funds.  Any contract awarded as a result of this solicitation will be a Firm Fixed Price Contract awarded using Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR 12.  The Government anticipates awarding approximately three (3) contracts under this solicitation, but reserves the right to award, more or less than three awards, a single award, or no awards, if in the best interest of the Government. Funds are not presently available for this acquisition. No contract award will be made until appropriated funds are made available. Contract award(s) resulting from this solicitation are subject to availability of funds.      <br>        <br>    The Attachments listed in this solicitation may be downloaded from the ASFI website: https://acquisition.army.mil/asfi.  The Government intends to award a contract(s) WITHOUT DISCUSSIONS with Offerors, but reserves the right to conduct discussions if determined to be necessary in the best interests of the Government.  Therefore, the offeror's initial proposal should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint.    <br>        <br>    DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENT:    <br>        <br>    This solicitation is for the provision of all labor and expertise necessary to provide a Joint Service Equipment Wipe (JSEW) in accordance with the requirements of this solicitation.  The JSEW concept represents an individual product or kit intended to decontaminate sensitive and non-sensitive equipment, which can be easily carried by the warfighter during decontamination operations and/or while conducting missions that may require decontamination to be performed. The following product characteristics are desired:     <br>        <br>    - Commercial products with the ability to decrease the level of gross chemical agent contamination from 10 g/m2 to  1 g/m2 in support of thorough decontamination on sensitive and non-sensitive equipment.     <br>    - Commercial products that can be applied directly to equipment surfaces and capable of removing gross contamination within five minutes following application.     <br>    - Commercial products that are available in durable packaging that can be easily opened by a Warfighter wearing Mission-Oriented Protective Posture (MOPP) 4.     <br>    - Products that are non-hazardous, non-flammable and inherently safe, minimizing hazards to both personnel and the environment, and that do not produce uncontrollable residual hazards during the decontamination process.     <br>    - Products that do not cause material/equipment degradation when used to decontaminate sensitive and non-sensitive equipment.     <br>    - Products that do not cause false positives/negatives for fielded tactical detectors.     <br>    - Products that do not degrade military relevant Individual Protection Equipment (IPE) or the effectiveness or ability of fielded decontamination products.    <br>        <br>    Each JSEW, in its designed configuration of components, must perform the functions necessary for successful completion of the JSEW mission, meet all of the physical characteristic requirements in the Draft Performance Specification (PSPEC) (Attachment 1) and decontaminate traditional and non-traditional chemical agents on sensitive and non-sensitive equipment to the efficacy levels specified in the PSPEC. The unit of measure in this solicitation is each (EA). The Offeror is to consider  quote mark one each quote mark  as all of the necessary components, packaged together as one item or kit, necessary to decontaminate sensitive or non-sensitive equipment as specified in the PSPEC.      <br>        <br>    To access the full Solicitation W911QY-13-R-0022 and its attachments, click on the Solicitation Documents/Attachments link on this page.

<DESC><p>The Defense Logistics Agency Energy (DLA Energy) has posted additional documents to the Technical Library for both Grand Forks AFB and Cavalier AFS under solicitation, SPE600-13-R-0801. The documents can be found&nbsp;in the secure folder PR# SPE600-13-9541.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>PLEASE NOTE: To access the secured documents on the FBO website, all vendors must be registered in Central Contractor Registration (CCR) first and foremost. If you are not registered in CCR, you will need to register in SAM. The System for Award Management (SAM) is a Federal Government owned and operated free web site that consolidates the capabilities found in the old CCR/Federal Agency Registry (FedReg), the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA), and the Excluded Parties List System (EPLS) websites. All records from CCR/FedReg, ORCA, and EPLS, active or expired, were moved to the SAM website. If you have a registered account in CCR, you can utilize your CCR user name and password in SAM, but only after creating a SAM account.

The determination as to the granting of such status will be made by the appropriate commander upon application of the contractor. The presence of such technical representative will be subject to all U.S. Forces regulations, instructions, and directives pertaining to civilian component personnel with the country. The following privileges shall be extended in accordance with current U.S. Department of Defense Directives, Military Base Interservice Support Agreements, and the SOFA of 19 January 1960 (as amended) between the United States of America and the Government of Japan.<br />(1) Entry into and exit from Japan as "exempt personnel."<br />(2) Duty free import-export into and from Japan.<br />(3) U.S. customs exemptions under PL 89-436.<br />(4) U.S. customs exemptions under the Tariff Act of 1930.<br /><br />I did not see the above information in the updated PWS for this position.

The Contracting Officer is the only person authorized to make or approve any changes in any of the requirements of this contract, and, notwithstanding any provisions contained elsewhere in this contract, the said authority remains solely in the Contracting Officer. In the event the contractor makes any changes at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract terms and conditions, including price. <BR> <BR>Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) (APR 2010) (a) ___________ is hereby designated as the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR).

The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors: (1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and (2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract. (b) Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as ?contractor?) in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venturer, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both. (c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest. <BR> <BR>(d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract.

The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507?1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk. (g) Waiver.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>COMMANDANT (CG-9131) <br />U S COAST GUARD <br />OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM FOR AGENCY PROTESTS <br />2100 2ND ST SW STOP 7112 <br />WASHINGTON DC 20593-7112</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<DESC>Noninvasive Patient Warming and Cooling Device (NIPWC)<br />Request for Information (RFI): #WNUK-13-003
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>RFI DEADLINE EXTENSION</strong><br /></span><br /><strong>The RFI response deadline is being extended in order to allow the&nbsp;Government time to respond to questions submitted. There will be an additional seven (7) days also given to allow respondents adequate time to&nbsp;edit/modify their responses.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;</strong><br />General Introduction:</p>
<p>1. The Air Force Life Cycle Management Center (AFLCMC) Human Systems Division (AFLCMC/WNU) is conducting market research to identify, as potential sources, companies that may possess the expertise, capabilities, and experience to respond to the requirements listed in this document. AFLCMC is issuing this Request for Information (RFI) to explore cost effective options to provide this capability. This is an RFI only in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 52.215-3 - Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes (Oct 1997). This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes. It does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. This RFI does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever.</p>
<p>2. AFLCMC is not at this time seeking proposals, and will not accept unsolicited proposals. Responders are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative cost incurred in response to this RFI. Please be advised that all submissions become Government property and will not be returned. All costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the responding party's expense.</p>
<p>3. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any is issued. Small Businesses are encouraged to provide responses to this RFI in order to assist AFLCMC in determining potential levels of competition available in the industry, as well as helping to establish a basis for developing any subsequent potential subcontract plan goal percentages.</p>
<p>4. In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the U.S. Government to form a binding contract. It is the responsibility of the interested parties to monitor the FedBizOpps site for additional information pertaining to this RFI.</p>
<p>5. Responders are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this inquiry. This announcement is not to be construed as a formal solicitation. It does not commit the government to reply to the information received, or to later publish a solicitation, or to award a contract based on this information.</p>
<p>Purpose:</p>
<p>Gather information from industry to gauge the market place, state of technology, and availability of a Noninvasive Patient Warming and Cooling Device (NIPWC). Specifically, gather information in regards to devices current available in the marketplace and to ascertain what could be developed in 12 months using already-existing commercial products.</p>
<p>NIPWC Requirements:</p>
<p>The requirements are outlined in Attachment 1 to this RFI. This document should be completed to show the Government which specifications can and cannot be met.</p>
<p>Questions:</p>
<p>Responses from U.S. and non-U.S. firms will be accepted to this NIPWC RFI. Responses to questions from interested parties will be promptly answered and posted on this FedBizOps (FBO) website, unless some release of proprietary information is involved or the answer addresses a question specific to a Company or that Company's response. Post submittal, one-on-one information sessions with respondents are not contemplated; however, they may be offered to responders to clarify the government's understanding of their submittal, the capability ramifications, or to discuss their business approach. Information feedback sessions may be offered to respondents after the RFI assessments are completed.</p>

<p>Kent Anderson, Contract Negotiator<br />kent.anderson@wpafb.af.mil</p>

The equipment to be installed will be provided by the U.S. Government, and will include four (4) five (5) KW wind turbines, eighty four (84) Solar World solar panels (240 watts each), two (2) Sunny Island inverters, twenty-four (24) two (2)volt batteries, combiner boxes, fuse boxes, wiring The Contractor shall furnish all labor, transportation, equipment, materials, and any other  items necessary to design, construct, and install wind turbine foundations, solar panel ground mounted racks, wiring, and the government-provided equipment so the system is fully operational upon completion of the installation.  <br>    <br>  Place of Performance:  Installation will occur at Punta Coco Military Post, located on the southern tip of Isla Del Rey in the Gulf of Panama.  Punta Coco is considered to be a remote area with very limited access and resources.  Access to Punta Coco is possible only by airplane or boat/barge.  <br>    <br>  Magnitude:  The estimated construction cost for this project is between $25,000 and $100,000 U.S. Dollars  <br>    <br>  Obtaining the solicitation:  The solicitation will be available on the FedBizOps website at http:www.fbo.gov on or about 29 January 2013.  All notifications of changes to the solicitation will be made through the internet only.  It is the Contractor's responsibility to check for any posted changes. Registration in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) through the U.S. Government's System for Award Management (SAM) is required of Contractor that will receive award.  <br>    <br>  Site Visit:  An organized pre-proposal site visit is scheduled for 5 and 6 March 2013.  Site inspection in Punta Coco will occur on 5 March, and a site visit to the storage facility in Panama City to inspect the government-furnished equipment will occur on 6 March.  It is the Government's intention to charter one plane with limited seating from Panama City to Punta Coco on 5 March, on which prospective contractor representatives may travel on a first-come, first-served basis at a pro-rated cost.  Prospective contractor representatives will be responsible for paying their transportation costs for travel to Punta Coco, whether they reserve on the Government's charter or arrange their own transportation.  The pro-rated price will depend on actual number of passengers on the charter aircraft, but it is expected to range from $200 to $450 per person.

<p>All responsible sources may submit an offer/quote which shall be considered.<br />Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. The solicitation will be available in FedBizOpps on its issue date of 2/15/13. The Small Business size standard is 500 employees. Specifications, plans or drawings are not available. Proposed procurement contains a 50% option for increased quantities. This acquisition is for supplies for which the Government does not possess complete, unrestrictive technical data; therefore, the Government intends to solicit and contract with only approved sources under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1). Approved sources are: ITT Corporation (73760). While price may be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final award decision will be based upon a combination of price, delivery, past performance and other evaluation factors as described in the solicitation.</p>

<p>Reverse Auction: The Contracting Officer may utilize on-line Reverse Auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation. During the course of the on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307.</p>

<DESC>The Naval Supply Systems Command Fleet Logistics Center, Pearl Harbor (NAVSUP FLCPH), on behalf of Naval Computer and Telecommunications Area Master Station Pacific (NCTAMS PAC), plan to issue contract modifications to extend the current contract N00604-12-C-3035 for Operations and Maintenance of Navy communication, electronic, and computer systems at various locations on Oahu for up to a maximum period of six months on the basis of other than full and open competition. Sole source modifications are consistent with the terms identified within this announcement upon the basis of the authority provided in 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) and implemented by FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements.
 This notice is being posted because the option, under FAR 52.217-8, was not previously evaluated as part of initial contract award. The extension will be at the current rates specified in the current contract, as allowed by FAR 52.217-8, and will extend performance for a period not to exceed six months, beginning on 1 January 2013. This option extension will further allow for evaluation and award of the competitive follow-on procurement. The incumbent contractor is the only responsible offeror for this option as the Government would experience unacceptable delays in fulfilling agency requirements if extensions are not executed before the contract expiration date.  
This notice is not a request for proposals.
 No phone inquiries will be entertained. All responses shall be made in writing by email or U.S. mail, to the attention of Julie Nguyen-Livic using the contact information provided in this synopsis.

<DESC>Department of the Interior's (DOI) Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSM) has modified its firm-fixed price task/delivery order S11PC00011 awarded to Industrial Economics Inc. (IEc) under FSS GS-10F-0224J to incorporate subtasks totalling $784717.86 which supplement the existing award through the infusion of additional qualitative assessment processes, development of three additional engineering assessments of regulatory alternatives, preparation of a cost-benefit analysis of alternatives, modeling and forecast revisions and additions, and revision of impact statements.  This acquisition was conducted under the statutory authority of FAR 8.405-6(a)(1)(i)(B) Only one source is capable of providing the supplies or services required at the level of quality required because the supplies or services are unique or highly specialized.  IEc prepared the logistical model for currently contracted services, and was determined to be the only source that could meet all of DOI's requirements for supplemental analysis, assessments, and revisions.  These subtasks are a logical expansion of IEc's current contract, and the Government was not expected to recover the substantial duplication of cost it would have incurred through competition.  Performance is scheduled to begin February 2013.

<ARCHDATE>03062013
<DESC>This notice is to announce the revision of the contract maximum amount on the Mid-Endurance Unmanned Aircraft System (MEUAS), and to extend a previously awarded contract on a sole source basis. This Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity contract H92222-09-D-0015 was competed and awarded to The Boeing Company on 28 April 2009.
<p>Under the initial contract award, the contract maximum for the five year period was $250,000,000 with anticipated performance through 27 April 2014. During contract operations, new requirements were validated for additional unmanned aircraft system (UAS) intelligence gathering, target surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) services using the MEUAS contract. With these additional requirements it became apparent the existing ceiling would be reached prior to the end of the five year contract ordering period. Program efforts were initiated in October 2010 to establish the competitive follow-on MEUAS II contract. A Justification and Approval (J&amp;A) document was approved on 10 June 2011 to increase the existing contract ceiling by $50,000,000 for a revised contract maximum of $300,000,000. This allowed for the continuation of mission essential operations during the source selection process of the MEUAS II follow-on requirement. A second J&amp;A was approved and issued on 16 July 2012. This action increased the contract maximum by $35,000,000 for a revised contract maximum of $335,000,000. This was to assure continuous operational capability during the transition from the MEUAS contract to the MEUAS II contract.</p>
<p>This proposed contract action will increase the dollar ceiling of the MEUAS contract (H92222-09-D-0015) by $10,000,000 for a revised contract maximum of $345,000,000.</p>
<p>The proposed contract action is for services the Government issued utilizing the authority of FAR 6.302-2, Unusual and Compelling Urgency. This notice of intent is NOT a request for competitive proposals. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>

<p>Due to unforeseen circumstances beyond the Government's control, there is an immediate requirement to mitigate a critical ISR services gap. This proposed contract action is to ensure continued operational capability.</p>
<p>The proposed contract action is for supplies or services the Government intends to issue under FAR 6.302-2, Unusual and Compelling Urgency. All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency. This notice of intent is NOT a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within 45 days after date of publication of this notice will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. Instead, the policies contained in Part 15, Contracting by Negotiation, will be used.</p>
