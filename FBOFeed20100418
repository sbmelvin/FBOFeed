STATEMENT OF WORK:

A.  BACKGROUND: 
The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) has been a key partner with the Government of Bangladesh over the past 30 years in all major development sectors.  Currently, USAID/Bangladesh’s development portfolio includes programs in Health, Education, Democracy and Governance, Food Security and Food Aid, Private Enterprise, Environment, Infrastructure, and Disaster Mitigation, Response and Reconstruction.  

The USAID/Bangladesh Office of Democracy and Governance (DG) manage an expanding portfolio of democratic governance programs that:

•	Strengthen the Parliament as an open, effective and accountable body of governance;
•	Facilitate the development of internally democratic and responsive political parties, as well as improve the electoral process; 
•	Help develop strong elected local governments with sufficient resources and authority to provide basic services and engage local communities in public policy; 
•	Promote accountability and transparency in the public sector; 
•	Improve safeguards for the protection of human rights, especially in the areas of trafficking in persons and violence against women;  
•	Engage leaders of influence in promoting democratic values and local development.
 
The Senior Program Coordination Advisor will provide expert advice to DG project teams on monitoring, evaluation, reporting and coordination of democracy and governance activities.  S/he will lead monitoring and coordination of political governance activities currently managed by DG, which include programs in legislative strengthening, political party reform, electoral assistance and public participation.  

The initial performance period will be two years.  Based on the programmatic results achieved and possible required programmatic follow-up, an extension of this Contract will be considered based on availability of funds and satisfactory performance.  Women and minorities are encouraged to apply.

B.  BASIC FUNCTION OF POSITION:

This position is located in the DG Office of the USAID Mission in Dhaka, Bangladesh.  The position is supervised by the Senior Governance Advisor and reports directly to this person. 

The Senior Program Coordination Advisor plays a key role in DG efforts to harmonize and align aid delivery in promoting democratic development and good governance.  S/he provides expert advice and analysis on all matters pertaining to activity coordination to achieve synergetic results, streamlining of project implementation, communication and information sharing across projects, progress monitoring and impact evaluation, tracking of crosscutting development themes, and result-based reporting.  The Senior Program Coordination Advisor’s primary responsibility is to ensure effective coordination and monitoring of USAID’s projects under the Strengthening Political Governance Activity (SPG).  S/he also works closely with the SPG team to ensure effective coordination with other donor projects, especially those funded under the Strengthening Political Participation (SPP) program of the British Department for International Development (DFID).  

The Senior Program Coordination Advisor is responsible for developing synergetic linkages in the area of political governance programming and implementation.  This consists primarily of a cluster of programs – some of which are implemented in partnership with DFID – that are designed as an integrated strategy to support the Parliament, political parties, the election commission and civil society.  The goal of the strategy is to strengthen key democratic institutions and practices, promote a governance regime that is responsive to the development needs and aspirations of the Bangladeshi public, and increase citizen participation in public policy.  The Senior Program Coordination Advisor ensures that parts of that strategy are optimized to work together to achieve the goal stated above.  S/he maps out related USAID and DFID activities, surveys implementation timelines and intervention areas, and liaises with program managers and project implementers to ensure ongoing coordination and information sharing.

The Senior Program Coordination Advisor coordinates monitoring, reporting, and evaluation activities of USAID political governance programs.  S/he will ensure that appropriate mechanisms are in place to measure program effectiveness and develop and/or employ efficient methods for empirical data-gathering, analysis, and reporting.  S/he ensures that project/activity information systems accurately monitor, evaluate, and report on the progress and impact of development programs.  S/he assists in setting appropriate performance targets in accordance with stated project objectives and strategy goals, develops impact indicators, and work collaboratively with project officers and implementing partners to track progress.  S/he studies implementing partner periodic reports, performs analytical tasks and drafts progress reports.

The Senior Program Coordination Advisor may serve as an alternate Agreement Officer's Technical Representative (AOTR) for one or more political governance projects.  S/he could also potentially serve as AOTR and will receive appropriate training for that purpose.
