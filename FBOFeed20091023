The sole source contractor is Scientific Applications International Corporation (SAIC), US Highway 231, Bloomfield, IN 47424.  This procurement is for non-personal professional engineering, technical and management support services in the areas of engineering and technical support services, scientific/engineering analysis and studies, test and evaluation, technical data support, field engineering, integrated logistics support, configuration management, management support services, and data management support. This effort is in support of the Joint Technology Assessment Activity (JTAA), a component of the Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWC), Crane Division, Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA). The effort will require procurement of some ancillary items in support of the services required estimated at $500,000.00.  The total not to exceed amount for the services is $9,000,000.
The mission of the JTAA is to provide Combatant Commanders, Service Leaders, Program Managers and User-Sponsors with operationally relevant and timely test and assessment findings and transition-to-acquisition decision support information to field emerging, transformational, and dual-use technologies and capabilities in a responsive and cost effective manner.  A large part of the JTAAs project portfolio supports the Deputy Undersecretary of Defense, Advanced Systems and Concepts (DUSD/AS&C).   Through a Memorandum of Understanding with the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane DUSD/AS&C recognized the JTAA as a premier provider of non-traditional assessment expertise and technology transition capability supporting the Office of the Secretary of Defense (Advanced Systems & Concepts), the Unified Combatant Commands (CoComs), Defense Agencies, and the Uniformed Services.  Currently, the JTAA is providing Non-Traditional Assessment support on CoCom-sponsored Joint Capability Technology Demonstrations in US Northern Command, US European Command, US Southern Command, US Special Operations Command, and US Joint Forces Command.  Additionally, there are on-going activities in support of the Joint Non-Lethal Weapons Directorate, Department of Homeland Security, the Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Organization, the US Air Force and US Army Special Operations (various offices), and the Air Force Research Laboratory.  
NSWC Crane's Joint Technology Assessment Activity in all aspects of Non-Traditional Assessment (NTA) of emerging technologies.  Specifically this technical assistance included: Requirements analysis; mission assessment; concept of operations development; assessment planning and execution; DOTMLPF (doctrine, organization, training, material, leadership & education, facilities) assessment; and transition support.   The JTAA is directly supporting four COCOMS in the role of independent test activity in four Joint Capability Technology Demonstrations in which SAIC is providing direct contract support to the following efforts:
.	USSOCOM:  The Special Operations Forces Long Endurance Demonstrator (SLED) Advanced Concept Technology Demonstration (ACTD) is in an Extended Use Evaluation.  The SLED ACTD uses the A-160 Hummingbird unmanned aerial vehicle to demonstrate a vertical take off and landing (VTOL) capable of flying long range that can employ a wide variety of adaptable Special Operation Forces payloads at various altitudes.
.	USJFCOM:  The Full Immersive Training Environment (FITE) JCTD is focused on demonstrating a simulation environment for close combat tasks in a realistic fully immersive training environment that creates and reinforces complex (tactical and human dimension) decision making skills.
.	USSOUTHCOM:  The Trans-national Information Sharing Cooperation (TISC) JCTD will demonstrate effective, non-classified information exchange, support planning and situational awareness, and analytical and collaborative environmental tools among the following extended partners: United States (US) departments and agencies, foreign government and security forces, international organizations, non-governmental organizations (NGO), and members of the private sector involved in stability operations.
.	USNORTHCOM:  The Smart Threads Integrated Radiological Sensors (STIRS) JCTD is entering the final stages of execution.  The STIRS JCTD will demonstrate and evaluate the military utility of advanced radiological and nuclear (R/N) detection and identification capabilities and tactics, techniques and procedures.  This includes near-real-time standoff detection and identification technology for manned and unmanned wide area search platforms, and inconspicuous detection and identification capabilities.

<DESC>In accordance with FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, and FAR Part 12 Commercial Items, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) intends to purchase an Expert Particle Analysis System under a fixed priced effort for the National Exposure Research Laboratory in Research Triangle Park, NC, on a sole source basis.
This system will be used for the quantitative analysis of air particulate samples in support of air pollution research, source apportionment, and human exposure programs.  A.  MINIMUM GENERAL SPECIFICATIONS:  
The Expert Particle Analysis System comprises a high-resolution field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) coupled with a state-of ?the-art energy-dispersive xray spectrometer (EDS) and advanced software and analytical tools customized for the EPA to facilitate manual and computer controlled SEM (CCSEM) data acquisition and data analysis of environmental samples.  The EPAS system will provide size, shape, images, and elemental composition for particles ranging in size from millimeters down to tens of nanometers.  Data obtained from the EPAS will be applied in source apportionment studies, ambient air monitoring, human exposure and health effects research, nanomaterials research, and other environmental studies.
INSTRUMENT PLATFORM:
Type -The SEM must be a Field-Emission SEM
Resolution - Better than 2 nm resolution in high resolution mode 
Stage - 5 axis semi-compucentric stage, with motorized x, y motions of at least 80 mm x 60 mm, with x and y axis stage movement tolerance of +/- 0.25 microns, and with position repeatability at +/- 1 micron
EDS system - Vibration free, maintenance free, Peltier-cooled 30mm2 silicon drift detector (SDD), Energy resolution <133eV (Mn Ka, 0 ? 100,000 cps)
Sample Capacity - Ability to load at least 20, ? inch sample stubs into the chamber at one time.
SOFTWARE FOR AUTOMATED DATA COLLECTION
CCSEM Templates - Automated acquisition procedures provided for:  1. Particle size only analysis, 2. Particle size and elemental chemistry analysis by EDS, 3. Particle size, elemental chemistry, and microimage analysis.
Microimaging in Automated Mode ? Ability to collect microimages with enhanced pixel resolution (as opposed to electronic zoom at fixed pixel resolution) of individual particles in automated analysis mode with choice of backscattered electron (BE) signal or secondary electron (SE) signal.
DATA PROCESSING AND INTERPRETATION
Software Compatibilty - Data must be compatible with RJLG Expert Particle Analysis software.
Data Processing Features - Standard methods and criteria for calculation of particle attributes, such as ASTM 1877 and standardless spectrum quantification.  Ability to define, via expressions and light scripting, custom-derived particle attributes from data elements available in standard methods.  Ability to create multiple particle data sets through parameterized methods, (i.e. varing sets of chemical elements in the quantifications and classifications) without having to re-acquire the data.  
Ability to calculate ambient particle mass and elemental concentrations (ug/m3) for passive aerosol samples based on individual particle data using demonstrated procedures.  Ability to compensate for EDS background from sample substrate, e.g., carbon stripping, while accounting for particle size.  Ability to create Ad-Hoc Data Summarizations.  Ability to create analysis project templates, and reuse settings which include particle attribute calculations, custom attributes classification methods and summaries.
Additional Specifications General Requirements
Warranties:  One year warranty on all components of the EPAS.Software: EPAS software updates at no charge for up to one year after contract award.Training: The Contractor shall provide on-site training for (1) the FE-SEM instrument, (2) the EDS system, and (3) advanced applications.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) intends to issue a competitive solicitation to design and produce a Shallow Water Combat Submersible (SWCS) as a replacement for the SEAL Delivery Vehicle (SDV)&nbsp;that is used for clandestine launch and recovery from DDS (Dry Deck Shelter)-equipped submarines. <br /><br />The $530M (estimated) nine-year IDIQ contract will include design, development, production and sustainment of a SWCS system and supporting equipment located at the SDV Team ONE homeport of Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. <br /><br />SWCS is an ACAT III Program&nbsp;that achieved Milestone A in August of 2008 and is scheduled for Milestone B in the 3rd Quarter of Fiscal Year 10. The SWCS system will include an upgraded hull&nbsp;that may be up to 12 inches longer and up to 6 inches wider than the MK 8 Mod 1 SDV. SWCS will require development of an Integrated Bridge System (IBS) with a commercial-off-the shelf (COTS) open architecture, a power and signal distribution system capable of integrating various electronic systems and sensors, and the capability to display operational data to the vehicle pilot and navigator. <br /><br />This contract action will be a full and open competition. Multiple awards through early development may be made. A draft RFP (DRFP) will be issued and comments solicited from industry approximately 20 November 2009. Included in that process will be an <strong>Industry Day planned for 10-11 December 2009 at the Naval Amphibious Base Little Creek in Norfolk, VA</strong>. The current SEAL Delivery Vehicle (SDV) and all ancillary equipment will be made available then for interested competitors to view and a question and answer session held. DRFP comments will be considered for incorporation into the final RFP. <br /><br />The Government intends to award up to three IDIQ contracts to successful bidders. The first task order under the IDIQ is intended to produce an Engineering Development Model (EDM) with limited capability for Government testing. A down select will be conducted (if there are multiple IDIQ awardees), after which one successful awardee will design and produce a production-representative system. Upon successful Government testing of the production-representative system, the successful awardee may produce up to 50 systems and provide the associated contractor logistics support. The source selection will be based on a best value determination. <br /><br />If your firm is interested in this procurement, please send an expression of interest by 15 November 2009 to the Contracting Officer at USSOCOM, Ms. Tammy Bair (813) 826-6957 or at e-mail address: tammy.bair@socom.mil. USSOCOM will consider sponsoring up to five companies who intend to serve as the prime for this opportunity for a facilities clearance. <strong>Request for consideration must be made by 5 November 2009. </strong>This expression of interest should contain a single point-of-contact and include mailing address, telephone number, facsimile number, and e-mail address for said point-of-contact. Only one point-of-contact per company is requested. <br /><br />U.S. and non-U.S. firms with appropriate Export Control status are permitted to respond to this RFP. Offerors must currently have a valid Secret Facility Clearance (FCL) with Safeguarding up to Secret approved through the Defense Security Service in order to receive the data package that will be available at the time of solicitation.<br /><br />An RFI for this acquisition was previously released under solicitation number <br />H92222-09-R-0032.<br />

<DESC>This is a request for information only.The VA Healthcare Network Office, located at 113 Holland Ave., Albany NY 12208, requests information from interested vendors for a Real Property Lease Agreement for approximately 32,000 available gross sq. ft.; activation capable within eighteen (18) months of site selection for the Simulation Learning Enhancement and Advanced Research Network (SimLEARN) within ten miles of the VA. The provider must also offer VA temporary lease space not less than 3800 square feet available immediately and able to be used until full space construction completed. The leased space must include at least 50-75 parking spaces for VA staff/Government vehicles.The ten-mile geographic radius will be measured directly, independent of landscape (i.e., "as the crow flies").  The radius will be strictly enforced and the VA will not accept or consider offers from beyond its boundaries.If pursued, a lease agreement would be for a five-year base term with one five-year option to be exercised by the unilateral action of the VA. The VA is willing to consider a standard fit-out ready stand-alone building or suite with active utility connections that can be modified to meet the general needs and floor plan of SimLEARN (i.e., a "warm, lit shell").  This structure may be existing, or constructed as a build-to-suit project.  The VA would be the sole occupant of this space once fit-out appropriately for its use.  The VA would anticipate amortizing the cost of any fit-out/construction into the monthly rental payments to be made to the lessor across the five-year base term of the lease.If pursued, a beneficial occupancy date, with the space fully modified and prepared for the VA's use, is required no later than 18 months after site selection.  Evaluation will likely take into account whether the offered space could be made ready for VA use prior to that date.  Interested parties are required to send an email to William.Olesiuk@VA.gov.  This email must be received no later than October 28, 2009.  The email must include a point of contact name, telephone number, email address, the physical address of the property, the available square footage, asking price (if available), space type, and a general overview of the building's age, condition, prior/current use, and available utilities.All correspondence regarding this request for information must be conducted exclusively with the Contracting Officer and/or a designee thereof.  The approved designee for this procurement is Mr. William Olesiuk, Contract Specialist, who is available at 716-862-6004 or William.Olesiuk@VA.gov for questions.

<DESC>We currently have a requirement and our customer is still developing the PWS.  We know part of what is needed is for the existing tapes (~1600) to be transferred to an electronic vault, 3 years of technical support and warranty.  This is the third phase of this project.<BR><BR>The first phase consisted of Dell computers, EMC storage devices, and Symantec Enterprise Vault software to restore and index all emails and associated attachments that have been generated through 2008. <BR><BR>The second phase is with Carahsoft/Symantec to install a Production Enterprise Vault that eliminates the need to save magnetic tapes indefinitely.  The Production Enterprise Vault equipment and implementation is also a Symantec solution which shall be integrated to the three existing JTF-GTMO network environments -- Non-Secure Internet Protocol Network (NIPRNET), Secure Internet Protocol Network (SIPRNET), and Joint Worldwide Intelligence Communication System (JWICS).  This portion is still ongoing.<BR><BR>The final phase which we are inquiring about shall fully integrate the EDS (Historical and Production vault).  This phase shall migrate into the EDS the data created between the end of the historical vault implementation and the implementation of the production vault.  Data is defined as all files regardless of format.  The number of tapes to be processed is approximately 1600 backup tapes; this number is an estimate.  This phase shall ensure that magnetic back-up tapes can be added directly to the production vault, if there is ever a need to go back to the magnetic tapes to retrieve data that was not added to the historical vault during previous phases.  <BR><BR>As I mentioned previously the PWS for this final phase is still being developed.

<DESC>In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.215-3, Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes, General Services Administration (GSA), is issuing this Request for Information (RFI) as part of market research, to obtain various strategic professional business advice with regard to the development, implementation, and delivery of concessions programs with an emphasis on healthy eating and sustainability. This RFI shall not be construed as a formal solicitation or an obligation on the part of GSA to acquire any product or services offered. Submission of any information in response to this RFI is completely voluntary and any costs associated with submission shall not be reimbursed by the Government. Although "proposal" and "offeror" may be used in this Request for Information, your response will be treated as information only and shall not be used as a proposal. The information requested will be used by GSA to facilitate decision making.

Background & Description

This Request for Information (RFI) by the General Services Administration (GSA) seeks to determine the ability to provide contracted concessions services, specifically commercial cafeterias, with a strong emphasis on wellness and sustainability.  This RFI is unique in that is represents GSA's first formal effort to introduce measurable wellness and sustainability objectives into its concessions contracts.  This effort is part of a massive "Work-Life" initiative being undertaken by the United States Office of Personnel Management and Office of Management and Budget. GSA defines healthier food options based upon the U.S. Dietary Guidelines for Americans (Dietary Guidelines). The Dietary Guidelines provide science-based advice to promote health and to reduce risk for major chronic diseases through diet and physical activity. By law (Public Law 101-445, Section 301), the Secretaries of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Department of Agriculture (USDA) issue a report at least every 5 years that "shall contain nutritional and dietary information and guidelines for the general public." Every 5 years, an expert Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee is appointed to make recommendations to the Secretaries concerning revision of Dietary Guidelines. The recommendations are to be targeted to the general public age 2 years and older and based on the preponderance of scientific and medical knowledge that is current at the time of publication of the Committee's report. Because of its focus on health promotion and risk reduction, Dietary Guidelines form the basis of Federal food, nutrition education, and information programs. By law, the Dietary Guidelines is to be "promoted by each Federal agency in carrying out any Federal food, nutrition, or health program. "This means that the Dietary Guidelines must be applied in menu planning and in setting the Healthy People objectives for the Nation. Using Dietary Guidelines helps policymakers, educators, clinicians, and others to speak with one voice on nutrition and health. The full 2005 Dietary Guidelines report can be found at: http://www.cnpp.usda.gov/DGAs2005Guidelines.htm.

In addition to providing more healthful eating options, GSA is committed to incorporating principles of sustainable operations in its facilities. This is in keeping with broad government sustainability goals, including those outlined in executive order 13423 ("Strengthening Federal Environmental, Energy, and Transportation Management").

GSA is interested in assuring that its commercial concessions contracts are structured based on cutting edge, state-of-the-art methods, approaches, principles, metrics, quality, and best practices for wellness and sustainability, therefore GSA is soliciting industry experience, concepts, and capabilities relevant to the development, implementation, and delivery of concessions programs which emphasize these concepts. The Responses shall provide proven information and advice related to innovative approaches being used to provide healthier menu options, encourage customers to make healthier choices, marketing of healthier options and the inclusion of environmentally friendly meal preparation and disposal practices. Responses should relay vendor experience in providing these services. 

Responses do not need to address all questions in the RFI, only those which vendors have direct knowledge or experience providing. The provision of proprietary information should be minimized. The government seeks responses regarding the best practices in the industry, not individual vendor offerings on the elements outlined in this RFI. Interested parties will be provided every opportunity to submit information on their offerings in any subsequent RFP. No telephone inquiries will be accepted. All inquiries (technical, contractual, administrative), questions, or clarifications of any kind must be submitted via email to the (POC) listed below. Regarding this RFI, direct contact or one-on-one meetings with a contracting officer, program manager, or technical parties, is not allowed.

<DESC><BR>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION OR SOLICITATION FORPLANNING PURPOSES (OCT 1997)<BR><BR>(a) The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this solicitation or to otherwise pay for the information solicited except as an allowable cost under other contracts as provided in subsection 31.205-18, Bid and proposal costs, of the Federal Acquisition Regulation.<BR><BR>(b) Although proposal and offeror are used in this Request for Information, your response will be treated as information only. It shall not be used as a proposal.<BR><BR>(c) This solicitation is issued for the purpose of obtaining technology maturity in the areas of multispectral image fusion for missile sensors and seekers.<BR><BR>Pursuant to FAR 15.2, the Infrared and Optical Technology Function, Weapons Development and Integration Directorate of the U. S. Army Aviation and Missile Research, Development, and Engineering Center (AMRDEC), hereby issues this Request for Information (RFI) regarding the technical feasibility and future of fusing multi-sensor/multispectral data from co-located and/or shared apertures.  The primary goal is to achieve scene registration, object discrimination, clutter rejection, target detections, target acquisition, target recognition, and target classification, and robust tracking capability for missile seekers. Other DoD technology is also of interest such as payloads for Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS).  The desire is to fuse imagery immediately after or during image capture or generation to assure optimal scene registration and information alignment. Algorithms, current and future sensor and processing capabilities for accurate, high resolution information fusion are the basis for this RFI.  Future sensors in the 2015 to 2018 timeframe, whether multispectral in nature, polarimetric, active/passive, or multimode should be assumed to be mature (TRL 6 or better) and available for missile and UAS application.  Although Multi-sensor seekers are the primary consideration, other applications like target acquisition devices or multi-sensor payloads for unmanned systems for UASs should also be considered.  Notional systems might include a multimode seeker using infrared and millimeter wave able to generate high resolution Synthetic Aperture Radar imagery. A third sensor could be considered, such as visible, very near IR, and shortwave IR. Passive sensors of interest include polarized spectral bands, hyperspectral, and/or multispectral within the same common band.  <BR><BR> THIS REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) IS NOT AN INVITATION FOR BID OR REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS. Rather this Request for Information is part of a technology survey that is an integral part of US Army planning efforts for possible future programs. Informal or white paper responses using standard font size 10 or 12, with one inch margins in Microsoft Word or Adobe Acrobat PDF format containing a description of appropriate technologies and how these technologies can be applied to this project are encouraged.  <BR><BR>In response to this RFI,  AMRDEC will provide IR and MMW SAR data sets taken of tanks and scene objects from 2008 airborne data collection efforts.  The data was collected from co-located and boresighted sensors during field tests in August and September of 2008.  The data is unclassified and will be made available on request.  Respondents should present their best candidate solutions to these requirements based on the perception of future sensor technology and processing capabilities.  <BR><BR>It is a requirement that potential responders possess the means to properly store and work on information and hardware classified at the FOUO/SECRET/NOFORN level since results of post processing Government data maybe sensitive. Foreign participation not authorized during this effort, US citizens only. Only US based and owned companies are eligible to respond.  Interested responders must request the AMRDEC ANNEX in writing or via e-mail from  Sonya  Read at  sonya.read@us.army.mil .  After validation by the AMRDEC security office of each interested responders security accreditation and eligibility to receive the AMRDEC ANNEX, a complete copy along with the appropriate security classification guide (SCG) will be mailed to each validated responder  .  Request must include:  company name, Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code, classified mailing address, and appropriate point of contact information.  All requests must be received within 14 calendar days of the date of this notice.  <BR><BR>This is a REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI).  The US Army Aviation and Missile Research, Development, and Engineering Center (AMRDEC) is currently conducting a market survey to feasibility and technology maturation of fusing raw data from multiple sensors for improved performance.  No award is intended as a result of this synopsis nor does the Government intend to pay for information received.  Responses to this notice are not an offer and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.<BR><BR>Questions relating to the RFI can be made to Gayle Norman, linda.gayle.norman@us.army.mil.  All other RFI questions, comments, responses and questions relating to the data sets and the AMRDEC Annex must reference the RFI number and are to be submitted within 45 calendar days of the RFI release to US Army Aviation and Missile Command, RDMR-WDG-R, Building 5400, Rm.

The tasks are intelligence missions and the scenarios are representations of "red" activity and "blue" operational capabilities.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Decision makers will use the output of this Construct to make force management and investment decisions for ISR capabilities.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Integration of non-developmental systems is expected.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 8.5pt; font-family: Arial;">The objective of the ISR Force Sizing Construct is to develop a capability that can evaluate existing and planned resources and determine optimal ISR mixes to cover anticipated ISR requirements.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It shall include a tool or system to rapidly recommend optimal ISR capabilities needed to address a series of tasks or requirements.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Optimal solutions are those mixes that meet defined sufficiency criteria.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Central to this segment is the identification and explanation of metrics/measures associated with the assignment of forces against requirements utilizing existing processes; and the establishment of sufficiency criteria (i.e. what is a sufficient amount of intelligence, generated by the ISR mix, to address the tasks).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The tool should be flexible enough to incorporate existing and proposed forces, requirements, and processes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It should be capable of considering wide-ranging scenarios that are potentially geographically dispersed, contain multiple intelligence tasks (i.e. Warning, science and technology, support to military operations, etc) or both.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 8.5pt; font-family: Arial;">Other system segments may include:</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.25in"><span style="font-size: 8.5pt; font-family: Arial;">a) A platform/sensor-to-target tool or system for explicit modeling of sensor characteristics against the given collection requirements, to include tasking the platform, processing/exploiting the data, and disseminating it to the required users.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>(Responders shall identify and explain the metrics used to evaluate sensor performance against requirements); </span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.25in"><span style="font-size: 8.5pt; font-family: Arial;"><br />b) A graphical visualization and map plotting tool to facilitate analysis of performance of ISR mixes against the identified tasks; and</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.25in"><span style="font-size: 8.5pt; font-family: Arial;">c) A data repository compatible with Oracle 11g.<br style="mso-special-character: line-break" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 8.5pt; font-family: Arial;">The platform/sensor-to-target tool should employ accepted operations research techniques to produce a prioritized mix of force structures.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The tool should model platform/sensor-to-target calculations with engineering-level data to determine target detection in a tactical scenario.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Preference will be given to models that take less than 30 days for scenario development and have a less than six hour run time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><br style="mso-special-character: line-break" /><br style="mso-special-character: line-break" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 8.5pt; font-family: Arial;">All tools must consider terrain, weather, cover, concealment, and denial and deception criteria.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Importing and exporting data from the repository must not be a constraining factor in tool usage.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The visualization tool should be scalable from tactical to global levels and display both geological and man-made features.</span></p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span style="font-size: 8.5pt; font-family: Arial;">DIA is in the process of defining functional attributes into various levels and priority of requirements including Key Performance Parameters (KPP).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>However, the identification of such requirements is dependent on the technical maturity of tools that industry can provide in Q1 FY10.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Industry partnering is encouraged to achieve an integrated solution set across the functional attributes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Solutions for the software modules or an integrated solution set should be at a minimum technology readiness level (TRL) 6.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 8.5pt; font-family: Arial;">Interested parties should submit a White Paper no greater than 15 pages in length within 15 days after release of this RFI.

<DESC>Intent to Sole Source: The Department of the Treasury's Bureau of the Public Debt (BPD), intends to negotiate a sole-source procurement with Leased Housing Developers Company for building maintenance/alterations of leased property at 200 3rd Street, Parkersburg, WV. The Government intends to award an IDIQ contract for&nbsp;a base&nbsp;year and&nbsp;four (4) one-year&nbsp;option periods.<br /><br />A sole source to Leased Housing Developers Company is intended for this order. The lessor is responsible for the operation of the Bureau of the Public Debt's building operational systems. The alterations involve work that is tied to, or physically connected to, equipment that is under control of the lessor. Contracting with the lessor will insure the lessor remains responsible for the continued maintenance and operation of all systems. A request for more information will not be considered an affirmative response. If no affirmative written response is received that clearly demonstrates the ability to meet all the requirements, and that is more advantageous to the Government, we intend to negotiate a sole-source award to Leased Housing Developers Company. Telephone inquires will not be accepted.<br /><br />Interested offerors may register at http://www.fedbizopps.gov to receive notification when the solicitation and any amendments are issued and available for downloading. Please note that the General Services Administration provides the notification service as a convenience and does not guarantee that notifications will be received by all persons on the mailing list.

<SUBJECT>Iris Image Quality Evaluation and Calibration (IQCE)
<SOLNBR>SB1341-10-102209
<RESPDATE>043010
<CONTACT>Richard Cordero, Contract Specialist, Phone 3019753976, Email rcordero@nist.gov
<DESC>Subject:  
Iris Image Quality Evaluation and Calibration (IQCE)
Notice Type: 
Special Notice 
Synopsis: 

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Acquisition Management Division, on behalf of the Information Access Division is issuing a special notice to inform the public of IQCE activities supporting a new, formal, standard addressing Iris quality. The purpose of this special notice is to reach a wider audience and doesnt involve procurement actions. NO SOLICITATION IS OR WILL BE ASSOCIATED WITH THIS NOTICE.
That standard; ISO/IEC 29794-Biometric sample quality  Part 6: Iris image data; was initiated by the Working Group 3 of the ISO SC 37 committee in July 2009. The standard will define a vector of quality components each of which is some quantitative measure of a subject-specific or image-specific covariate. The current working draft (SC 37 N 3331) defines 21 subject or image covariates and 12 metrics for assessing the utility of an iris image. The 12 quality metrics are mostly quantification of the covariates. IQCE will evaluate the influence of these quality metrics on iris recognition accuracy. In addition, any measure identified as being influential on accuracy will be considered. The outcome will be a refined list of quality metrics with tolerance bounds for each. Furthermore, IQCE will establish precise methods for measuring each metric. This ensures development of a clear, tested and implementable iris image quality by excluding or avoiding any over-prescriptive and non-testable statements. The overall effect of IQCE and the ISO/IEC 29794-6 standard will be to validate and support camera imaging properties and system design.
In addition, IQCE aims to evaluate the effectiveness of image quality assessment algorithms (IQAAs) that produce a scalar overall image quality in predicting the recognition accuracy of particular comparison algorithms (from the supplier of the IQAA), and of other algorithms. Per the IREX I result that quality scores are not immediately interoperable, IQCE will establish a score calibration procedure for IQAAs.
This activity encourages participation from the main commercial providers and academic institutions, non-profit research laboratories and consultancies for which prototype implementations exist.
The NIST Iris Exchange Program was initiated at NIST in support of an expanded marketplace of iris-based applications based on standardized interoperable iris imagery. IREX I was primarily conducted in support of the ISO/IEC 19794-6 standard, now under revision. It secondarily supports the recently completed ANSI/NIST ITL 1-2007 Type 17 standard, as derived from the ISO/IEC 19794-6:2005 parent, and future revisions thereof. The Iris Quality Calibration and Evaluation (IQCE) is the second activity under the IREX iris image interoperability umbrella.
Draft of IQCE test plan and API is posted for public review at http://iris.nist.gov/irexII/IQCE_conops_API_v2_22oct09.pdf.  For more information and schedule visit http://iris.nist.gov/irexII/.
NIST intends to publish the results of the IREX II IQCE before the end of 2010.

The purpose of the market research is to obtain industry input in assist in making key decisions for consolidation, scoping, business unit definition (functional grouping requirements), contract type and structure decisions.  Feedback is being sought from industry to better assess potential cost savings, administrative and performance efficiencies, and best industry practices that may be incorporated in the acquisition planning decision process.  Market research is also intended to gather information to avoid negative impacts to competition, interest, and to determine the most suitable approach for acquiring needed services.  One or more contracts may or may not result depending on the outcome of the market research.

Research Method. Questionnaire 1 has been specifically designed to focus on initial acquisition planning decisions.  Questions were designed to obtain data for decision making in consolidation, scoping, business unit definition (functional grouping requirements), contract type and structure.Questionnaire 2 will be used to record market information obtained from each commercial source included in the research.Upon receipt and consolidation of comments, a contractor's forum may be conducted to communicate consolidated results and provide information on expected procurement strategy.
NOTE: This Request for Information (RFI) is not a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or otherwise pay for the information solicited.  Please be advised  that information provided as part of this market research will not be used later as part of the evaluation process for proposals submitted in response to any solicitation(s) that may result.

<p><br />Addendum</p>
<p>Wide Area Work Flow Receipt and Acceptance (WAWF-RA) Vendor Instructions <br />Installation and Registration Checklist</p>
<p>Completion of all instructions contained in this checklist must be accomplished prior to activation of the firm and user accounts.</p>
<p>1. Check Central Contractor Registration System (CCR) to see if your company is registered. <br />a. If you are registered in CCR, please go to Step 3 below. <br />b. For help with registration in CCR, contact CCR Helpdesk,<br />888-227-2423 or 269-961-4725, e-mail CCR@dlis.dla.mil, or see the CCR Handbook at http://www.ccr.gov/handbook.cfm.</p>
<p>2. Register with Central Contractor Registry (CCR). <br />a. All vendors desiring to bid on goods or services in support of Department of Defense (DoD) must be registered in the CCR at http://www.ccr.gov/. <br />b. Ensure that all mandatory fields are completed in your new CCR account (i.e., Telephone/FAX number, Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) and/or Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) codes, North American Industry Code Systems (NAICS) codes, etc.). <br />c. Note: All contractors are required to update their CCR registration annually. Failure to do so will result in suspension of the account, which will prevent or delay awarding DoD contracts and payments to your firm.</p>
<p>3. Establish an Electronic Business Point of Contact (EB POC). <br />a. The next step is to ensure that you have identified an EB POC for your company. You are required to establish both a primary and alternate EB POC for each CAGE/DUNS code assigned to the firm. <br />b. To see if an EB POC is listed for your company, go to http://www.ccr.gov/http://www.ccr2000.com/ and click on "Search CCR." Where prompted, enter the DUNS or CAGE or Company Name and click "Submit Query." If you are presented with a list of DUNS numbers, you will need to pick the specific location and click on the DUNS. <br />c. Scroll to the bottom of the Inquiry Results page. There you can see if anyone is listed as the EB POC. If no one is listed, your company has not identified an EB POC yet. If you see that there is no one listed as your company's EB POC, you need click on "Update or Renew Registrations Using TPIN" to add it. <br />d. Each vendor organization may establish up to two EB POC's (primary and alternate) for each Cage/DUNS combination. <br />e. The EB POC will be responsible for authorizing access to employee(s) of the vendor's organization to view and/or modify data submitted on behalf of the vendor. <br />f. Update NAICS codes developed by the Census Bureau, which replaced the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) codes. Until NAICS codes are updated, update will not be complete. For more info on NAICS codes, visit: http://www.census.gov/epcd/www/naics.html</p>
<p>4. Determine if your organization will designate a Group Administrator (GAM) (Proceed to paragraph 5 if you are not going to designate a GAM). <br />a. In medium to large sized companies, there may be a need to establish more than one GAM. <br />b. A GAM determines who has access to the WAWF-RA vendor account. <br />c. The initial GAM shall be the person designated as the EB POC. To appoint additional GAM's, each vendor must submit an official appointment letter signed by the EB POC. <br />d. The appointment letter should be faxed to the WAWF-RA Customer Support Center. <br />e. The Group Administrator's Manual is available for reviewing to all WAWF-RA registered users. <br />f. The GAM Manual can be found in the Software Users Manual link within the WAWF-RA application.</p>
<p>5. Establish an organizational email address<br />a. All records created in WAWF-RA are stored in a virtual file folder and as status is updated or changes the system generates an email notification to applicable individuals identified in the firm's organizational email account. <br />b. The GAM or EB POC shall provide the organizational email to the WAWF-RA Customer Support Center. <br />c. Ensure that your firm's organizational email address is operational and can receive email from WAWF-RA prior to registering your email address with the WAWF-RA Customer Support Center. <br />d. Note: If you do not set up an organizational email address, the personal email address of the first person who self-registers from your firm (CAGE/DUNS code), will be designated as the organizational email address for your firm.</p>
<p>6. Set up PCs to access WAWF-RA<br />a. Set up the PCs of your organization's users to access WAWF-RA. <br />b. Select the "Setting Up Your Machine" link on the WAWF-RA home page for more information: https://wawf.eb.mil/Instr.html.</p>
<p>7. Have all users self-register on the WAWF-RA web site<br />a. Every user for your firm must self-register on the WAWF-RA web site by completing the online registration form. <br />b. Select the "Self Register" link on the WAWF-RA home page and follow the instructions. <br />c. Users may access WAWF-RA with either a User ID/Password combination or a PKI certificate. Users who want to use a PKI certificate must obtain it before self-registering. <br />d. PKI Certificates may be obtained from one of the approved Interim External Certificate Authorities: Operational Research Consultants Inc. http://eca.orc.com, Digital Signature Trust Co. http://www.digsigtrust.com/home.html, or Verisign: http://www.verisign.com. The web sites provide the instructions needed to acquire a PKI Certificate. <br />e. If further assistance is needed, contact the WAWF-RA Customer Service Center.<br />f. Note: Registrations will not be activated until the WAWF-RA Customer Support Center receives an email from the EB POC/GAM as registered in the CCR data- base.</p>
<p>8. Follow-up (if necessary).<br />If your (GAM or user) account hasn't been activated within 2 business days of self-registering contact the WAWF-RA Customer Service Center:</p>
<p>CONUS ONLY 1-866-618-5988, Option 1 <br />COMMERCIAL 801-777-3282, Option 8, Option 1 <br />DSN 777-3282 Option 1 <br />FAX Commercial: 801-605-7453 DSN: 388-7543 <br />Email: cscassig@ogden.disa.mil <br />Note: Reference "WAWF" in email Subject line.</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will NOT be issued. The NAICS is 721110 and the Small Business Size Standard is $7 million.
<p>The Federal Emergency Management Agency, Office of the National Advisory Council, intends to block single occupancy sleeping rooms, procure meeting space, Food and Beverages and Audio Visual equipment for their National Advisory Council (NAC) Meeting in Washington, DC.</p>
<p>&bull;Hotel location: Must be located in downtown Washington DC. Because FEMA leadership and staff must attend these meetings it is imperative in the case of an emergency that the location be no more than 2.5 miles from FEMA Headquarters, 500 C Street Washington DC 20472.</p>
<p>&bull;Accessibility: Must be located not more than 0.30 miles of a DC Metro Station to maximize the ability of FEMA program staff and members of the public to be able to attend the meeting.</p>
<p>&bull;Close to amenities: Must be within walking distance (less than 0.5 miles) from a variety of restaurants and a coffee shop. Since the majority of attendees will be from out of town, it is important that they can easily and safely access a dinner location.</p>
<p>&bull;Hotel Service: Due to the hours members are expected to work during the meeting days the hotel must have room service available for their guests. Generally three-star or higher rated hotels can best meet the program's event planning needs as well as have the experience in serving, hosting and accommodating high profile government employees and executives (the majority of the NAC's meeting attendees).</p>
<p>&bull;Meeting Rooms and Space: The hotel must offer a variety of function space and meeting rooms to easily obtain the program's required room set up.</p>
<p>&bull;Business Center: Due to the high volume of documents and handouts, the hotel must have a business center onsite in order to generate any additional copies needed to facilitate the meeting.</p>
<p>&bull;The cost of the sleeping rooms is the responsibility of the traveler who will make their reservations through National Travel or directly through the hotel. FEMA is not responsible for the cost of sleeping rooms or any associated costs such as room service.</p>
<p>&bull;Must provide NAC meeting attendees (the government rate or less than )for lodging. Meeting attendees will be housed at the same hotel as the conference proceedings.</p>

	Recording Requisites  
	
(a)	Recording hereunder shall be taken by reporters qualified in the operation of Steno-type equipment, Real Time recording, Computer Aided Transcription (CAT), Shorthand and/or monitored Multi-Microphone recording systems, and when permitted by the Presiding Official, by Stenomask.   At the request of the USAO, recording shall also be taken by videotape.  Regardless of the type of equipment used, it is mandatory that there be an accurate read back capability and that a back-up system be utilized.  It is also mandatory that tape recording devices shall have a separate monitor head which shall allow the reporter to monitor the recorded tape.



1.	Monitored Multi-microphone Recording Systems.  The mandatory requirements follow: 
	
	The Contractor's personnel shall operate and monitor the recording equipment at all times. 
	The operating personnel shall provide to the USAO, prior to the commencement of each proceeding, a certification that the equipment is turned on and operating. 
	The recording equipment utilized shall provide for the instant playback of testimony.  
	The equipment shall be capable of recording as many as twenty-three grand jurors together in one room with the prosecutor and the witness. 
	The system utilized shall have a back-up system to allow continuous recording of speakers.  The Grand Jury hearings shall not be stopped for any reason such as the changing of a tape. 
	The tapes shall be of such quality that there shall be no instances of inaudibility because of accents or words used by the speakers.  
	The system shall be portable to allow for transportation of tapes to another location when an immediate decision is required by a Federal District Court Judge. 
	The recording monitor shall be able to identify speakers.  
	A back-up system shall be available so as not to delay the proceedings.  
	The equipment utilized shall not pose any safety hazards due to exposed wires, cords, or for any other reason.

2.	Stenomask Recording.  The mandatory requirements in the event stenomask recording is permitted are as follows:
	
	The respective systems shall be of such quality as to ensure against error, misinterpretation, or loss of voice.  
	The equipment shall contain simultaneous playback, listening, and preamplification.
	
3.	Real Time Recording. The steno machine is attached to the computer.  As the steno types the strikes/words are translated into English onto the screen.
	
4.	Computer Aided Transcription (CAT). With this type of system, the  steno strikes a key which is written onto a disk.  The disk is inserted into an attachment to the computer and the information is brought up on the computer screen.  A back-up voice tape is made also so that a reverification can be made of the transcript.

5.	Video Tape Recording.  The Government must determine video formatting, DVD, CD, or VHS.
	
	(b)  The Contractor, or the duly authorized employee, agent, or representative of the Contractor, shall present himself/herself to the person in charge of the proceedings and he shall at all times be governed by the instructions of the Presiding Official in matters affecting the composition of the record, adjournment to other times or places, and matters of like character.
	
	(c)  Depositions shall be taken by a Contractor-furnished reporter who must be a duly authorized notary for the State or District in which the deposition is held.  Reporters are required to comply with Rules 28 and 30 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and specifically Rule 30(e), which provides in pertinent part as follows:
	
	"If requested by the deponent or a party before completion of the deposition, the deponent shall have 30 days after being notified by the officer that the transcript or recording is available in which to review the transcript or recording and, if there are changes in form or substance, to sign a statement reciting such changes and the reasons given by the deponent for making  them.  The  officer  shall  indicate  in  the  certificate prescribed by subdivision (f)(1) whether any review was requested and, if so, shall append any changes made by the deponent during the period allowed."
	
	The Contractor must give the Government its copy prior to the witness being presented their testimony.  The Government may choose to present the deposition to the witness.  In the event further information is desired, the above referenced volume is a part of the United States Code, Title 28 and may be found at any public library.
	
	(d)  Everything spoken pertaining to the subject matter of the deposition shall be reported, unless the Presiding Official otherwise directs.  No part of any proceedings, of which notes have been taken as required, shall be omitted from the record, unless the Presiding Official so directs.
	
	(e)  All notes, records, documentary exhibits, and any other material which is a part of, or relates to, any action recorded by the Contractor shall be the property of the United States and shall be delivered to the ordering office, together with furnished transcript, unless otherwise instructed. 
	
	(f)  Right to Remove Individual Reporter - It shall be an absolute right of the Government to inform the Contractor through the Contracting Officer of the unacceptability of specific court reporters for Grand Jury or Deposition work.  The failure of the Contractor to provide a court reporter other than one designated unacceptable by the Government shall provide a basis for the Government's decision to obtain court reporting services from another source.
	
	
	Transcript Format 
	
	(a)  A separate transcript shall be provided for each witness/deponent.  The title page shall show the name of the witness/deponent, Grand Jury date, time of the commencement of the proceeding for that particular witness, docket number, the date of proceedings, the name, title and address of the attorney appearing for the Government, caption of matter, the authority for taking the deposition, etc. and shall be followed by a page of distinctive color indexing the exhibits where applicable.
	
	(b)  The paging of the transcripts shall be in a single series by consecutive numbers regardless of the number of days consumed in the hearings, proceeding, etc., and the paging of the transcript in a hearing shall follow consecutively the paging of the last previous hearing in the same case.
	
	(c)  Each copy of the transcript furnished the Government shall be bound with covers of good quality, white or colored 140 pound index paper, #1 sulphite paper, heavy weight transparent plastic, or similar material approved by the ordering office.  Transcripts shall be punched with three holes at the left side; the upper and lower holes to be two inches from top and bottom of the page, third hole in the center of the resulting interval, and shall be secured with a suitable fastener of permanent nature.
	
	(d)  All transcripts shall be typed with black ribbon or reproduced by regular office type duplicating machines on white linen unglazed paper of good quality, #30 white bond paper or similar stock, to be approved by the ordering office.  Transcripts shall be typed on paper 8  inches x 11 inches in size, with a ruled margin of 1 3/4 inches at the left side and 3/8 inch at the right side.  Typing shall be 10 spaces to the inch, double spaced, and shall not be less than 25 lines to the page exclusive of the line containing the witness name, date of testimony, and page number.  The lines of testimony are to be numbered on each page beginning with #1.  These numbers will appear just to the left of the left ruled margin.  Whenever testimony is continuous, requiring more than one line, the typing shall begin one blank space after the left hand ruled margin and shall continue to the right hand ruled margin, with no blank spaces.  The distance between the left hand ruled margin and the right hand ruled margin will be 6 3/8 inches.  Therefore, there will be no less than 60 characters per line available.  No word should wrap to the next line that would properly fit within the 60 count.  Pages necessarily containing less than 25 lines shall be charged and paid for at the full-page rate.  No payment will be made for lines in excess of 25 lines to the page.  The first line of Q and A's will be indented 5 spaces, then followed by a period and 3 blank spaces.  The second line will return to one blank space after the left hand ruled margin.  The first line of colloquy will be indented 10 spaces, followed by a period and 3 blank spaces.  The second line will return to one blank space after the left hand ruled margin.  No extraneous words should be used on the title page or at the beginning of a witness' testimony.  No statement that can properly fit on a line should be extended to an additional line.  There should be no unnecessary blank lines unless absolutely necessary for readability.  The USAO will be the sole judge of this format.
	
	Reduced page transcripts (Condensed Transcripts) shall include four transcript pages in reduced format on a single 8  x 11 inch page.
	
	(e)  Exhibits admitted in evidence, identified in a deposition, or in Grand Jury proceedings, when requested by the Government attorney shall be stamped, marked, numbered by the Contractor, and arranged in numerical order, as directed by the individual Assistant U.S. Attorney (AUSA) and shall be annexed to the deposition transcript.   The marking shall indicate clearly whether the exhibit is offered by the complainant, protestant, intervener, defendant, respondent, applicant, the ordering office, or other party of record.

	SPECIAL CONTRACT REQUIREMENTS
	
H.1 Personnel Security

(a)  The USAO will process background security investigations for Grand Jury court reporter Contractor personnel required for performance of this contract.  Employees of the Contractor shall not be assigned to Grand Jury transcription work under this contract unless and until the Contractor has been notified, in writing, by authorized USAO personnel stating the employee has been granted necessary security approval.  If the Contractor is notified during the life of this contract by an official of the USAO that an employee's access to Grand Jury information has been revoked or suspended, the Contractor shall immediately notify the Contracting Officer.  The Contractor's total loss of access approval for Grand Jury court reporters shall be cause for termination of this contract.

(b)  The Contractor shall submit to the USAO a list of the names of all principals, staff members, and regular employees requiring access to the work performed under the contract.  This includes personnel of the principal Contractor and any subcontractor and consultants.  No employee may be used on Grand Jury testimony until the Contractor has, for each individual, received in writing the approval of the USAOs. 

(c)  Should Grand Jury proceedings require access to classified National Security Information by personnel of the Contractor; additional safeguards will be required to protect that information in accordance with the provisions of Title 28 Code of Federal Regulations, Part 17.  In such instances, national security clearances for the Contractor's personnel will be required in accordance with Department of Justice policies.
 
(d)  In the event the USAO is unable to obtain security approval for access to Grand Jury information for the Contractor by the beginning date of a proceeding, the Government reserves the right to obtain the required services from another source, which has employment security approval for Grand Jury court reporters. 

(e)  The Contractor agrees to ensure any subcontractor proposed for the furnishing of supplies and services which will involve access to Grand Jury information in the Contractor's custody has the appropriate employment security approval in effect prior to being afforded access to Grand Jury information.

H.2 Required Security Investigation

(a)  The Contractor shall assure that all persons to be utilized in the performance of this contract submit to the Government the following Government security investigation forms prior to assignment hereunder.  The intent and purpose of the investigation are to preclude the assignment of any individual who poses a threat to the Government or successful contract completion due to past unlawful or inappropriate behavior.  The contract employee must furnish all required data in the form and format determined by the United States Attorney (USA) or his/her duly authorized representative.  The Contracting Officer will notify the Contractor in writing, with a concurrent copy to the Contracting Officer Technical Representative (COTR), of the results of the investigation.

(b) Risk Level

	In general, services performed by Contractor personnel may fall within three (3) risk 		categories as described below:

High Risk   Are those sensitive positions that have the potential for exceptionally serious impact involving duties especially critical to the DOJ or a program mission with broad scope of policy or program authority, such as:

 	Policy development or implementation

	
 	Higher-level management assignment
	
 	Independent spokespersons or non-management positions with authority for independent action,
	
 	Significant fiduciary and procurement authority and responsibilities, and 
	
				IT-computer positions responsible for the planning, and implementation 
				of a computer security program; the direction, planning and design of a 
				computer system, including the hardware and software; or, accessing a 
				system during the operation or maintenance in such a way, with 
				relatively High Risk to cause grave damage or realizing significant 
				personal gain. (Refer to Appendix III, OMB Circular A-130, 
				Management of Federal 	Information Resources,  for those computer 
				positions that are High Risk at:
				 http://www.whitehouse.gov/OMB/circulars/a130/a130trans4.html
	
	Moderate Risk - Are those sensitive positions that have the potential for moderate to serious impact involving duties very important to the DOJ or program mission with significant program responsibilities and delivery of client services to the public, such as:
	

 	Assistance to policy development and implementation,
	
 	Mid-level management assignments,
	
 	Non-management positions with authority for independent or semi-independent action,
	
 	Delivery of service positions that demand public confidence or trust,
	
 	IT-computer positions of a lesser degree of risk that required for High Risk positions (Refer to Appendix III, OMB Circular A-130, Management of Federal Information Resources,  for those computer positions that are other than High Risk.).
	
	Low Risk (Non-sensitive) - Are those non-sensitive positions that do not fall into any of the above categories and include those positions with potential for impact involving duties of limited relation to the DOJ mission.
		
	(c)  Types and Numbers of Background Investigations
	
	Work performed under this CONTRACT will fall within one or more of the risk categories defined paragraph 3.2.2(b).  As a result, the Contractor's personnel must undergo a background investigation commensurate with the assessed risk category.  In addition, before the issuance of any calls for additional personnel, the COTR, the exact number and types of background investigations required for all Contractor positions hired under this CONTRACT.
	 
	The Contractor will not be permitted to commence performance under the CONTRACT until a sufficient number of its personnel, as determined by the COTR received requisite background investigations or approved pre-appointment background investigation waivers.
	
	Period of Performance of the CONTRACT, the Contractor shall ensure that no Contractor or Subcontractor employee commences performance hereunder prior to receipt of written authorization from the Contracting Officer or the COTR.
	
	(d) Pre-Appointment Background Investigations and Waivers
	
	Background investigations must be conducted and favorably adjudicated for each contract employee prior to commencing work on this task order.  However, where programmatic needs do not permit the Government to wait for completion of the entire background investigation, the SPM, in consultation with the COTR, can grant a pre-appointment background investigation waiver.  The extent of the background investigation and/or the information needed to waive the background investigation will vary depending upon the Risk Category associated with each position.  A waiver will be revoked if the resulting investigation uncovers derogatory information that cannot be resolved in the contract employees favor.  When derogatory information has been discovered that cannot be resolved in the contract employees favor, the employee should be removed from the contract.  Minimum pre-appointment investigative requirements are listed below. 
	
	High Risk Positions. The background investigation shall be an LBI (Limited Background Investigation) consisting of a personal subject interview, NAC, credit history check, written inquiries and record searches covering 5 years, and personal interviews covering specific areas during the most recent 3 years.  Pre-appointment waivers may be granted following a successful National Crime Information Center (NCIC) check, vouchering of previous 2 employers and a favorable review of forms submitted.
	
	Moderate Risk Positions. The background investigation shall be a NACI (National Agency Check and Inquiries) consisting of a NAC, written inquiries, and record searches covering specific areas of a subjects background during the past 5 years.  Pre-appointment waivers may be granted following a favorable NCIC check and a favorable review of forms submitted.
	
		Low Risk Positions.  The background investigation shall be a Federal Bureau of 	Investigation Name and Fingerprint check.  Pre-appointment waivers may be granted 	following a favorable NCIC check.
	
	(e)  The following forms and submission dates shall be adhered to by the Contractor for each type of investigation listed below.  The forms shall be submitted to the designated COTR or point of contact within seven days after receipt of the forms.
	
	Form Number and Title 		Number of Copies
	FD-258 Fingerprint Card		2
	SF 85P - Questionnaire For Public Trust Positions		2
	
	(f) Procedures for Pre-Screening Applicants and Investigations
	
	Contractors Responsibility - The Contractor must determine whether the conduct of the person being considered for assignment on this contract indicates a potential for behavior which would interfere with, prevent, or otherwise impact adversely on:  1) the position to be filled by applicant; 2) the performance of the duties and responsibilities of others on the CONTRACT or in the Government; or 3) the ability of the employing agency to effectively carry out its mandated responsibilities.  If the Contractor determines that employing an applicant will not promote the efficiency of this CONTRACT, the applicant must be disqualified from assignment on the CONTRACT.   In this regard, the Contractor shall be responsible for performing the following pre-screening and investigative duties for all persons proposed for work under this CONTRACT:
	
	1. Furnish to each proposed Contractor employee the forms described in Section 5 and ensure that adequate instructions for completing the forms are provided to each applicant. 
	
	2. Ensure that applicants obtain two (2) complete sets of their fingerprints on the prescribed Form DD-258 from an organization qualified to take fingerprints.
	
	3. Collect completed forms from each applicant and review all forms for completeness and correctness.  Return any incomplete or incorrect form(s) to applicant(s) to be corrected and re-submitted.
	
	4. Submit completed forms to the COTR by no later than seven (7) calendar days after receipt of the blank forms.
	
	(g)  Contractor Status under the National Industrial Security Program (NISP)
	
	Companies participating in the National Security Program (NISP) are required the meet certain federal standards for the investigation of facilities and employees.  If the Contractor is a registered in the NISP, investigation initiated by the Department may not be required.  The COTR should determine if the Contractor is registered in the NISP, then the facility clearance level held by the Contractor, and if individuals selected to work for the USAO were previously investigated in accordance with NISP procedures.  If an individual selected to work for the Department was previously investigated within the last 12 months, the COTR will obtain a copy of the Letter of Consent (LOC) issued by the Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office (DISCO). 
	
	(h)  Factors for Suitability Determinations.  The USAO uses several basic factors in making suitability determinations for contract employees.  This information is intended as a guide for the Contractor during their screening process and is not inclusive of all disqualifying situations.
	
	Disqualifying Factors   The following conduct factors, as disclosed on the SF-85P and the SF-85P-S, in a written statement or personal interview with the applicant, or established during a reference check may disqualify an applicant from employment on a USAO contract.  Contractors should be aware such individuals may not be able to work for the Department under the CONTRACT.
	
	Criminal Behavior (e.g., a conviction resulting from a serious felony -- murder, rape, armed robbery, etc. -- regardless of when the conviction occurred; a felony conviction, notwithstanding the severity of the crime, within the previous seven (7) years; a period of incarceration as a result of a felony conviction within the previous seven (7) years; or pending indictments or criminal charges)
	
	Infamous or disgraceful conduct  (e.g., sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has been prosecuted, or bizarre behavior indicating depravity)
	
	Improper or illegal involvement with drugs within the past 7 years.
	
	Current and continuing alcohol abuse
	
	Intentional false statement, deception, fraud in appointment  (e.g., altering the condition of discharge on military discharge documents, altering college transcripts, falsely completing the SF-85P or SF-85P-S, etc.)
	
	Financial considerations (e.g., deceptive or illegal financial practices; continuing inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; financial problems linked to such dependencies on alcohol, drugs, gambling, etc.)
	
	Non-U.S. Citizenship (e.g. non-legal residents; recent legal residents, residing in the U.S. less than four years; non-U.S. citizens maintaining citizenship in "hostile" countries)
	
	Questionable Allegiance to the United States (e.g., membership in organizations or association with individuals advocating violence or overthrow of the U.S. Government or involvement in any act of sabotage, espionage, treason, terrorism, or sedition)
	
	Emotional, mental, and personality disorders (when a credentialed mental health professional acceptable to the government has determined that the individual has a condition or treatment that may indicate a defect in judgment, reliability or stability or could physically harm him/herself or others)
	
	Previous security violations  (e.g., unauthorized disclosure of classified information or deliberate or multiple violations)
	
	Misuse of information technology systems (e.g. illegal or unauthorized entry into or illegal, unauthorized, or improper use of an information technology system) 
	
	Foreign Influence (e.g. when an individuals immediate family, including co-habitants and other who the individual is bound by close ties or affection, is not a U.S. citizen and may be subject to coercion and/or duress)
	
	Foreign Preference (e.g. and individuals behavior indicates a preference for a foreign country over the United States)
	
	(i)  Mitigating Factors   When questionable conduct is disclosed, the following factors should be considered as to whether or not disqualification of an individual for work in the USAO is warranted.  The decision is made on a case-by-case basis, and is subject to review by the assigned Security Officer, in consultation with the COTR.
	
	1. The nature, extent and seriousness of the conduct.
	
	2. The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation.
	
	3. The frequency and recency of the conduct.
	
	4. The individuals age and maturity at the time of the conduct.
	
	5. The voluntaries of participation.
	
	6. The presence or absence of rehabilitation, resolution, and other pertinent behavioral changes.
	
	7. The motivation for the conduct.
	
	8. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress.
	
	9. The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.
	
	(j)  Given the above guidelines for determining suitability, the Contractor should be able to determine, without USAO involvement, which applicants are unsuitable for employment under this contract.  However, additional questions and requests for information may result from review of the security packages by USAO personnel.  In the event the USAO or the contractor has reasonable cause to believe that an employee under the CONTRACT falls under any of the eleven mandatory disqualification factors listed above, the employee must be removed from this CONTRACT.  In addition, all contract employees are expected to adhere to the USAO Standards of Conduct.
	
	(k)  The COTR will notify the Contractor of the results of background investigations as they are completed and adjudicated.  The COTR will also notify the Contractor of any applicants who are found ineligible for employment under this contract so that the Contractor can immediately recruit and initiate paperwork to clear replacement applicants.  If a contract employee is already business on the CONTRACT and is determined to be ineligible, he or she will be removed from the call order.
	
	(l) The COTR will notify the Contracting Officer when a sufficient number of Contractor employees have received employment security approvals or pre-appointment waivers approvals.  Upon receipt of this information and any other information, which may be required elsewhere in the CONTRACT, the Contracting Officer will issue the Contractor a Notice to Proceed, which permits the commencement of work under the call(s).
		
	(m)  The Contractor shall ensure no contract or subcontract employee commences performance hereunder prior to receipt of a written authorization from the Contracting Officer.
	
	(n)  The Contractor shall make every effort to preclude incurrence of costs by the Government for security investigations for replacement of employees, and in so doing shall ensure otherwise satisfactory and physically able employees assigned hereunder remain in contract performance for at least one year.  The Contractor shall take all necessary steps to assure contract or subcontract personnel selected for assignment to this contract are professionally qualified and personally reliable, of reputable background and sound character, and meet all other requirements stipulated herein.  The fact the Government performs security investigations shall not in any manner relieve the Contractor of the responsibility to ensure that all personnel furnished are reliable and of reputable background and sound character.  Should a security investigation conducted by the Government render ineligible a Contractor-furnished employee, the Contracting Officer will investigate the cause and determine whether the Contractor has abdicated his responsibility to make every effort to select reliable employees of reputable background and sound character.  Should there be a need to replace a contract or subcontract employee due to non-performance, the Contracting Officer will determine whether the Contractor has abdicated his responsibilities to make every effort to select trained and experienced employees.
	
	(o)  Should the Contracting Officer determine the Contractor has failed to comply with the terms of paragraph above, the Contractor may be held momentarily responsible, at a minimum, for all reasonable and necessary costs incurred by the Government to (a) provide coverage (performance) through assignment of individuals employed by the Government or third parties in those cases where absence of contract personnel would cause either a security threat or USAO program disruption, and (b) conduct security investigations in excess of those which would otherwise be required.  
	
	(p)  Nothing in this clause shall require the Contractor to bear costs involved in the conduct of security investigations for replacement of an employee who becomes deceased or severely ill for a long period of time.
	
	(q)  Under no circumstances shall the Contractor fail to comply with the terms and conditions set forth herein without assuming liability for such failure as may be established pursuant to this clause.  The rights and remedies conferred upon the Government by this clause are in addition to all and other rights and remedies specified elsewhere in this contract or established by law.
	
	H.3 Contractor Physical Security Requirements
	
(b)	Contractor employees assigned to work areas where Grand Jury information is processed, stored, or transcribed must challenge the presence of any unknown or unauthorized person.  The need-to-know principle shall be adhered to at all times within the closed area.  When the materials are not stored in security containers or vaults, and when in actual use by authorized personnel, they shall be protected as follows:

o	Kept under constant surveillance by an authorized person who is in a physical position to exercise direct security controls over the material. 
o	Covered, turned face down, placed in storage containers, or otherwise protected when unauthorized persons are present. 
o	The room containing the materials must be locked when vacated for short periods of time. 
o	Returned to storage containers as soon as practicable after use. Grand jury material shall not be removed from the premises of the court reporter for transcription except for delivery to the USAOs. Approved storage containers include: the GSA Class 6 security container; a lock-bar file cabinet (with a GSA approved lock); or 3-position dial safe. 
	
	
(b)An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) 
	         An IDS must be installed to provide intrusion detection to the area where the Grand          Jury information is stored. All potential points of entry to the area must be protected with door position and window sensors. Inoperable windows or those located greater that 15 feet above ground don not require the sensors. If exterior access to the windows can be gained from adjacent unprotected space, then a window sensor(s) is required. The interior area will be protected through the use of volumetric sensors, such as passive infrared and or microwave detectors. Combination detectors that utilize both technologies should be programmed to initiate an alarm when both technologies detect an intrusion. The system shall be capable of arming/disarming through the use of a PIN (Personal Identification Number) and a keypad located within the protected area.

The IDS must be installed and connected to a central station for monitoring at the Contractors facility or the facility of a subcontractor. The central station and the IDS must be Underwriters laboratories (UL) listed for these functions.

Local guard or law enforcement response to alarm must occur within 15 minutes of activation.

A direct- connect or remote station alarm system (i.e., a system connected by direct wire to alarm receiving equipment located in a local police department headquarters, which is activated and deactivated by the using Contractor and responded to by personnel of the local police department) may be utilized. If the contracted firm is housed in a building with a 24 hour guard service, the IDS requirement may be waived with approval of the Contracting Officer. 

 The representative of the Contractor shall be required to report immediately  to the facility to ascertain the nature of alarm and to take appropriate measures to ensure the security of the material. The contractor shall notify the COTR  of any occurrences of alarm activation. Theft, attempted theft of apparent tampering with stored information must be immediately reported, occurrences of false alarms shall be reported the next business day. 
	
(c)  End-of-day security checks shall be performed within the contract facility to ensure that precautions are taken to protect grand jury material. The contracting firm shall designate an individual or individuals, to make daily checks to ensure all grand jury material has been properly stored. This can be the Grand Jury Court Reporter personnel, or another individual who has been granted security approval by the EOUSA SPS.
	
	(d)  The Contracting Officer or his/her authorized representative, of the USAO, shall have the right to inspect at reasonable intervals, but at least annually, the procedures, equipment, and facilities used by the Contractor to ensure compliance with these requirements.
	
	H.4 Information Technology
	
	Information Technology Equipment refers to computers, steno machines, transcription devices, printers, scanners, and all other technological devices used to electronically process grand jury information for the USAO.
	
	When grand jury court reporters process grand jury information outside the USAO while utilizing Information Technology equipment that is not the property of the USAO, the equipment will be used in a dedicated, stand-alone, single user mode (no network capability). The information must be unclassified. All processing must be done on removable storage media (floppy disks, CDs, removable hard drives, cartridges). Removable storage media must be marked "Grand Jury Information." When marking the media, no acronyms should be used. 
	
	In addition, any Information Technology equipment used to process USAO information may be subject to certification/accreditation and/or disk-based sanitization to protect grand jury information. Grand Jury Court reporters may not use personally-owned PCs and equipment to process grand jury information. Personally-owned PCs and equipment are those devices the grand jury court reporter uses to conduct personal projects related to obligations, affairs, assets, or life of the operator.
	
	When grand jury court reporter owned PCs are used, and/or have fixed hard drives, and the PC is also used for transcription work outside of the USAO, the equipment must have the ability to download to USAO equipment or storage media. In addition, temporary files must be deleted from the grand jury court reporters equipment using the currently approved USAO sanitization method. 
	
	Access to information technology equipment must be controlled and restricted to personnel authorized to handle grand jury information and having appropriate access approval. Unauthorized personnel must not be permitted to view any grand jury information. The equipment must be turned off, or otherwise disabled, when not in use.
	
	The removable media must be stored in an approved security container or lockable file cabinet (in accordance with 6.C.1) after normal working hours or when the equipment is not in use. 
	
	All printed output material must be protected. USAO personnel must ensure this requirement is adhered to and documented in the Grand Jury Inspection Reports. 
	
	Only appropriately-cleared maintenance personnel escorted and monitored by USAO personnel or court reporter service personnel are allowed to perform on-site maintenance for the equipment. The USAO must grant approval before maintenance of the PC is allowed. The storage media must be removed from the PC prior to removal of the PC from the area for maintenance. 
	
	Grand jury information should be backed up on a weekly basis. Grand jury information may not be processed by individuals outside of those contracted and granted security approval. 
	
	H.5 Disposition
	
	(a)  During the contract performance period, if any removable hard drives or cartridges used in conjunction with this contract become defective, this (these) removable hard drive(s) or cartridge(s) shall be removed and turned over to the Department of Justice for destruction.  The Government will not compensate the Contractor for costs of any defective drives. 
	
	(b)  At the conclusion of the contract period, all media materials used in conjunction with this contract (i.e. floppy disks, removable hard drives or cartridges, cassette/magnetic tape, stenographic and hand-written notes, typewriter ribbons, etc.) shall be turned in to the USAO for destruction.  Any of the media materials, which become defective during the contract performance period, shall be immediately turned in to the Department of Justice for destruction. The Government will not compensate the Contractor for the costs of these media materials.
	
	
	
	H.6 Protection of Grand Jury Information
	
	(a)  Grand Jury testimony is sensitive Limited Official Use information, which must be protected against disclosure to unauthorized personnel.  Pursuant to Rule 6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, disclosures of matters occurring before the Grand Jury other than its deliberations and the vote of any juror may be made available to the attorneys for the Government to use in the performance of their duties.

To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete.

The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subcontractor 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database.

Section M  Evaluation Process

M.1   Background: This procurement is being conducted using all applicable acquisition regulations pertaining to the purchase of services that will be accomplished via FAR Part 8.405-3. The Government will award a BPA to the Offeror(s) most capable of providing the greatest benefit to The United States Attorneys Office (USAOs) in performing the tasks listed in the Statement of Work and the best value to the Government.  

Award will be based on conformance to the terms of solicitation, and award will be given to the Offeror(s) with the best credentials based on the evaluation criteria. For this procurement, all evaluation factors other than cost or price when combined are more important than cost or price. The Government will award based upon best value methodology using the following evaluation factors with FAR Part 8. The Government intends to award on the basis of a best value tradeoff. Written proposals will be evaluated against the below listed evaluation factors.


M.2  Best Value: The Government plans to award a BPA to the Offeror(s) whose quote represents the best value solution. The Contracting Officer may reasonably determine that the superior solution/approach merits a higher price, and therefore represents the best value to the Government. The Contracting Officer, using sound business judgment will base the selection decision on the integrated assessment of the Statement of Work and the Offerors capability as measured against the below evaluation factors.


M.3 Evaluation Factors Relative Order of Importance:

In accordance with FAR 15.304, All Non Price Factors are listed in descending order of importance with most important first.

M.4 Evaluation Criteria:

Evaluation Criteria

(a) The Government will award a commercial item purchase order resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: 


Factors 1 through 3, when combined, is significantly more important than price.  However, EOUSA will not select an offeror for award on the basis of a superior capability without consideration of the amount of its price. 

Factor 4****   (Price) will become increasingly important as proposal evaluation ratings for the non-price determinants approach equality between vendors. 

 In addition, Factor 4 (Price) will not be scored just evaluated for reasonableness and realism  

(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). 

(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offers specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. 
1.	Proposed Key Personnel
 Proposed Key Personnel will be evaluated based on their pertinent experience as it relates to the requirements of the Statement of Work.  Each Vendor should provide resumes for their key personnel. Proposed personnel will be evaluated on their qualifications to provide the requested services and demonstrated experience in projects of similar size, scope, complexity and results.
2.	Past Performance
		
Vendors will be evaluated based on past performance information presented in their quotes (including past performance questionnaires) and on information obtained by contacting the Vendors supplied references. In addition, the Contracting Officer has the discretion to retrieve information via offeror supplied references, commercial sources, and federal sources including Past Performance Information Retrieval System and Excluded Parties List System. 

 Past performance information shall pertain to work performed that is similar to that anticipated by the Statement of Work. In determining relevance, consideration will be given to contracts of similar project complexity, scope, type, and schedule.    Past Performance shall be evaluated on the following criteria: quality of service provided, timeliness of performance, effectiveness of management, compliance with price estimates, customer satisfaction, and overall performance. 

3.	Organizational Experience
	Organizational Experience will be evaluated on the extent to which Vendors demonstrate organizational experience in addressing the requirements of the Statement of Work.  Experience relative to providing like services for commercial entities will not be considered.
	
	
4.   Price

       Price Risk: The Government will evaluate risk associated with pricing schemes.
	

Each Vendors price quote will be evaluated based on the following:
&#61607;	Evaluation of proposed price/cost
&#61607;	Reasonableness: Reasonableness will be established by the existence of adequate price competition and by comparing all, or a representative sample of the proposed prices to representative market pricing and/or pricing from other contracts similar work, etc.
&#61607;	Realism: A realism assessment will be accomplished by technical review and evaluation of the skill mix and specific hours. The intent of the evaluation is to determine whether the estimated proposed price is realistic for the work to be performed; reflecting a clear understanding of the requirements; and are consistent with the approach described in the Vendor technical proposal

M.5 Evaluation Rating
The USAOs ratings focus on strengths and weaknesses of the Vendors technical and management capability and solution as demonstrated by its written quote. Assigned ratings will reflect the consensus developed by the evaluation panels assessment of the proposed approach to accomplish the USAOs objectives
	
	The following Adjectival Scale will be used to determine the overall technical rating of each Vendors quote:
	
	Adjectival 		Description
	Outstanding	Outstanding. The approach presented by the Offeror meets or exceeds the requirements of the RFP and offers numerous major strengths, which are not offset by weaknesses. The personnel proposed have an advanced understanding of the requirements and have exceptional experience with projects of the same size and scope as the requirement. 
	
	Excellent	Excellent.  The approach presented by the Offeror meets the requirements of the RFP and offers a few major strengths, which are not offset by weaknesses. There is a good probability of success, and any weaknesses can be readily corrected. The personnel have a good understanding of the requirements and experience that enables them to work independently.
	
	Good		Good.  The approach presented by the Offeror meets the basic minimum requirements if the RFP, with no apparent weaknesses. The personnel proposed have some, but not extensive experience or the quality of the experience is average at best.
	Marginal	Marginal.  A rating of "marginal" indicates that, in terms of the specific factor (or subfactor), the offeror may satisfactorily complete the assigned tasks, but there is at least a moderate risk that he will not be successful.

	
	Unsatisfactory	Unsatisfactory.  The proposal is not adequately responsive or does not address the specific factor(s) (or subfactor(s)).  The response is incomplete, vague, incompatible, incomprehensible, or incorrect as to be unsatisfactory.  The assignment of a rating within the bounds of "unsatisfactory" indicates that the evaluator feels that mandatory corrective action would be required to prevent significant deficiencies from affecting the overall project.

Continuing Contract Performance During a Pandemic Influenza
or other National Emergency

During a Pandemic or other emergency we understand that our contractor workforce will experience the same high levels of absenteeism as our federal employees. Although the Excusable Delays and Termination for Default clauses used in government contracts list epidemics and quarantine restrictions among the reasons to excuse delays in contract performance, we expect our contractors to make a reasonable effort to keep performance at an acceptable level during emergency periods. 

The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) has provided guidance to federal managers and employees on the kinds of actions to be taken to ensure the continuity of operations during emergency periods. This guidance is also applicable to our contract workforce. Contractors are expected to have reasonable policies in place for continuing work performance, particularly those performing mission critical services, during a pandemic influenza or other emergency situation. 

The types of actions a federal contractor should reasonably take to help ensure performance are: 

	Encourage employees to get inoculations or follow other preventive measures as advised by the public health service. 

	Contractors should cross-train workers as backup for all positions performing critical services. This is particularly important for work such as guard services where telework is not an option. 

	Implement telework to the greatest extent possible in the workgroup so systems are in place to support successful remote work in an emergency. 

	Communicate expectations to all employees regarding their roles and responsibilities in relation to remote work in the event of a pandemic health crisis or other emergency. 

	Establish communication processes to notify employees of activation of this plan. 

	Integrate pandemic health crisis response expectations into telework agreements. 

	With the employee, assess requirements for working at home (supplies and equipment needed for an extended telework period). Contract Security requirements must be considered in making equipment choices; agencies or contractors may wish to avoid use of employees' personal computers and provide them with PCs or laptops as appropriate. 

	Determine how all employees who may telework will communicate with one another and with management to accomplish work. 

	Practice telework regularly to ensure effectiveness.


	Make it clear that in emergency situations, employees must perform all duties assigned by management, even if they are outside usual or customary duties. 

	Identify how time and attendance will be maintained. 

It is the contractor's responsibility to advise the government contracting officer or COTR if they anticipate not being able to perform and to work with the Department to fill gaps as necessary. This means direct communication with the contracting officer, COTR or in his/her absence, another responsible person in the contracting office via telephone or email messages acknowledging the contractors notification. The incumbent contractor is responsible for assisting the Department in estimating the adverse impacts of nonperformance and to work diligently with the Department to develop a strategy for maintaining the continuity of operations. 

The Department does reserve the right in such emergency situations to use federal employees, employees of other agencies, contract support from other existing contractors, or to enter into new contracts for critical support services. Any new contracting efforts would be acquired following the guidance in the Office of federal Procurement Policy issuance "Emergency Acquisitions", May, 2007 and Subpart 18.2 Emergency Acquisition Flexibilities of the Federal Acquisition Regulations. 
	
	
	
	
	
	Security of Systems and Data, Including Personally Identifiable Data
	
	a.	Systems Security
		
	The work to be performed under this contract requires the handling of data that originated within the Department, data that the contractor manages or acquires for the Department, and/or data that is acquired in order to perform the contract and concerns Department programs or personnel. 
	 
	For all systems handling such data, the contractor shall comply with all security requirements applicable to Department of Justice systems, including but not limited to all Executive Branch system security requirements (e.g., requirements imposed by OMB and NIST), DOJ IT Security Standards, and DOJ Order 2640.2E.  The contractor shall provide DOJ access to and information regarding the contractors systems when requested by the Department in connection with its efforts to ensure compliance with all such security requirements, and shall otherwise cooperate with the Department in such efforts. DOJ access shall include independent validation testing of controls, system penetration testing by DOJ, FISMA data reviews, and access by the DOJ Office of the Inspector General for its reviews.    
	
	The use of contractor-owned laptops or other media storage devices to process or store data covered by this clause is prohibited until the contractor provides a letter to the contracting officer (CO) certifying the following requirements:  
	

1.	Laptops must employ encryption using a NIST Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 140-2 approved product;
	
2.	The contractor must develop and implement a process to ensure that security and other applications software is kept up-to-date; 
	
3.	Mobile computing devices will utilize anti-viral software and a host-based firewall mechanism.  
	
	
	
4.	The contractor shall log all computer-readable data extracts from databases holding sensitive information and verify each extract including sensitive data has been erased within 90 days or its use is still required.  All DOJ information is sensitive information unless designated as non-sensitive by the Department. 
	
5.	Contractor-owned removable media, such as removable hard drives, flash drives, CDs, and floppy disks, containing DOJ data, shall not be removed from DOJ facilities unless encrypted using a NIST FIPS 140-2 approved product;
	
6.	When no longer needed, all removable media and laptop hard drives shall be processed (sanitized, degaussed, or destroyed) in accordance with security requirements applicable to DOJ;  
	
7.	Contracting firms shall keep an accurate inventory of devices used on DOJ contracts;
	
8.	Rules of behavior must be signed by users.  These rules shall address at a minimum:  authorized and official use; prohibition against unauthorized users; and protection of sensitive data and personally identifiable information;
	
9.	All DOJ data will be removed from contractor-owned laptops upon termination of contractor work.  This removal must be accomplished in accordance with DOJ IT Security Standard requirements.  Certification of data removal will be performed by the contractors project manager and a letter confirming certification will be delivered to the CO within 15 days of termination of contractor work. 
	
	b.   Data Security
	
	By acceptance of, or performance on, this contract, the contractor agrees that with 
	respect to the data identified in paragraph a, in the event of any actual or suspected 
	breach of such data (i.e., loss of control, compromise, unauthorized disclosure, access for an unauthorized purpose, or other unauthorized access, whether physical or electronic), the contractor will immediately (and in no event later than within one hour of discovery) report the breach to the DOJ CO and the contracting officers technical representative (COTR).
	
	If the data breach occurs outside of regular business hours and/or neither the CO nor the COTR can be reached, the contractor shall call the DOJ Computer Emergency Readiness Team (DOJCERT) at 1-866-US4-CERT (1-866-874-2378) within one hour of discovery of the breach.  The contractor shall also notify the CO as soon as possible during regular business hours.  
	

I.	Personally Identifiable Information Notification Requirement
	
	The contractor further certifies that it has a security policy in place that contains procedures to promptly notify any individual whose personally identifiable information (as defined by OMB) was, or is reasonably believed to have been, breached. Any notification shall be coordinated with the Department, and shall not proceed until the Department has made a determination that notification would not impede a law enforcement investigation or jeopardize national security.  The method and content of any notification by the contractor shall be coordinated with, and be subject to the approval of, the Department.  The contractor assumes full responsibility for taking corrective action consistent with the Departments Data Breach Notification Procedures, which may include offering credit monitoring when appropriate.
	
	
II.	Pass-through of Security Requirements to Subcontractors
							
	The requirements set forth in Paragraphs a through c, above, apply to all subcontractors who perform work in connection with this contract.  For each subcontractor, the contractor must certify that it has required the subcontractor to adhere to all such requirements.  Any breach by a subcontractor of any of the provisions set forth in this clause will be attributed to the contractor. 







Information Resellers or Data Brokers

Under this contract, the Department obtains personally identifiable information about individuals from the contractor.  The contractor hereby certifies that it has a security policy in place which contains procedures to promptly notify any individual whose personally identifiable information (as defined by OMB)  was, or is reasonably believed to have been, lost or acquired by an unauthorized person while the data is under the control of the contractor.  In any case in which the data that was lost or improperly acquired reflects or consists of data that originated with the Department, or reflects sensitive law enforcement or national security interest in the data, the contractor shall notify the Department contracting officer so that the Department may determine whether notification would impede a law enforcement investigation or jeopardize national security.  In such cases, the contractor shall not notify the individuals until it receives further instruction from the Department.

Best value means the expected outcome of an acquisition that, in the Governments estimation, provides the greatest overall benefit in response to the requirement.<BR><BR>In determining best value, the Government will consider the following three evaluation factors: Technical Approach, Past Performance, and Price.

Evaluation Approach <BR>All proposals will be evaluated by a team of Government employees using a two-phase down-select process, conducted as follows: <BR><BR>In Phase I, proposals will be evaluated and down-selected with a best-value trade-off process on the two non-price factors: Technical Approach and Past Performance. Offerors whose proposals are down-selected in Phase I will be invited to conduct a site visit of the office space in Milford, MA and will be permitted to take measurements of the site and to revise their proposal pricing on the basis of those measurements. Offerors are responsible for verifying all dimensions of the site. <BR><BR>In Phase II, the Government will evaluate the Price factor of the down-selected proposals. Any revised pricing will be taken into consideration in Phase II. Each down-selected proposals price factor will be considered in relation to its non-price factors. Offerors are cautioned that award may not necessarily be made to the lowest price offered.<BR><BR><BR>(V) ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS AND CLAUSES.<BR><BR>52.252-1     SOLICITATION PROVISIONS INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE (FEB 1998)<BR>This solicitation incorporates one or more solicitation provisions by reference, with the same force and effect as if they were given in full text.

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.<br />Listed End Product Listed Countries of Origin <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />(2) Certification.

<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131) <br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />FAX: 202.475.3904</p>

<DESC>United States Air Force Academy Soaring ProgramIndustry Day Announcement
The Aeronautical Systems Center (ASC), United States Air Force Materiel Command, is conducting analyses in support of the non-powered flight capability at the United States Air Force Academy (USAFA).  As part of these analyses, ASC will be offering an Industry Day on 3 Nov 2009 near Wright Patterson Air Force Base, Fairborn, Ohio at the Tec Edge, Wright Brothers Institute Innovation and Collaboration Center (ICC)(reference map attached in FedBizOps).  The purpose of this event is to communicate with industry the intentions of the potential USAFA glider acquisition, discuss minimum system requirements and receive contractor feedback on these topics.  This Industry Day shall be considered a portion of the market analysis being conducted by ASC.
This effort is for the purchase of a government owned fleet of 19 aircraft suitable for cadet soaring training; 14 dual seat basic gliders and 5 dual seat aerobatic/advanced gliders.  To be considered eligible, all aircraft proposed must be commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) FAA certified aircraft.  Due to the urgency of the timeline, it is preferred that the aircraft supplied be currently in production or in-stock, however, ASC remains open to other suitable acquisition options that are able to meet timeline requirements.  Also, while it is preferred that a single manufacturer provide both the basic and aerobatic aircraft for standardization of training and maintenance purposes, the Air Force is fully dedicated to fair and open competition, and as such there is no requirement that a single manufacturer be able to produce both aircraft.  Support of these aircraft will be handled under a separate contract and is not part of this effort.
Please view the PDF Industry Day Announcement on PIXS for additional information.

<DESC>Amendment 04:  The purpose of this amendment is to revise the due dates.  Changes are highlighted in yellow in the attached conformed BAA document.  <br /><br />Original Synopsis Below.   <br /><br />DARPA is soliciting innovative research and development (R&amp;D) proposals in the area of short-range wide-field-of-view extremely-agile electronically-steered photonic emitters (SWEEPER).  The overall goal is to create a paradigm shift in active optical beam steering and sensing by developing chip-scale integrated photonic coherent beam-forming technologies that overcome the limits of opto- mechanical and electro optical systems while being constrained to small size, weight, and power (SWaP).  DARPA envisions that a successful SWEEPER program will establish photonic integrated circuit (PIC) technology that will provide video frame rate beam steering speeds, and emit multiple beams with a total output power of 10 W.   All administrative correspondence and questions on this solicitation, including requests for information on how to submit a proposal abstract or full proposal to this BAA, should be directed to one of the administrative addresses below; e-mail is preferred (darpa-baa-09-66@darpa.mil).  See attached Full DARPA-BAA-09-66 document. Important Dates:  Posting Date: June 24, 2009 Abstract Due Date: August 21, 2009 First Round Proposal Due Date: December 11, 2009

Description: 

Sources sought synopsis announcements are issued to assist the Agency in performing market research, to determine industry interest and capability. This is not a request for proposals (RFP). Responses to this request are not proposals and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. This is not a guarantee of a future RFP or an award.

Specifically, the program enhances the security and safety of WMD and weapons material storage and transportation; monitoring and consolidating dangerous pathogens that pose risks for theft, diversion, accidental release or use by terrorists; helping to prevent trafficking of WMD across non-Russian FSU states; and supporting defense and military cooperation with the goal of preventing proliferation to reduce the threat of WMD terrorism. The objective of the future solicitation is to acquire support for the CTR office and associated Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) offices. The contract is tentatively planned to run for a period up to five years. The projected award date for the contract is planned for April 2010.

13. Cost estimating, technical and cost evaluation of proposals, and technical review of contract deliverables
14. Development of contract technical tasks, Contract Data Requirements Lists (CDRL), and other contract related items
15. Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START) and other arms control requirements, protocols, and conventions as may be developed to include CWC and BWTC
16. Life sciences related: disease surveillance, detection and diagnostics; laboratory operations, epidemiology, research development and oversight to include human and animal user requirements; veterinary and public health system design and associated fields of study. 

Contractors who believe they posses the expertise and experience shall submit a written technical capabilities statement. Interested contractors should also address whether they can fulfill the requirements via GSA schedules.

<DESC>This is modification 5 to the synopsis entitled HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE SUPPORTINGTHE MAKER PROJECT under NNJ09298123Q which was posted on July 20, 2009. The purpose ofthis modification is to post the following updated Statement of Work (SOW) reflective ofthe questions and answers below:Question #1: The SOW refers to stepper motors but the attached EBF3 Manipulator documentshows the motors as DC Brushless; not steppers.  Can you clarify the motors that are inthe manipulator?Answer #1: The motors are brushless DC Servo. The users manual is clear on this, the SOWwas incorrect.	The SOW has been globally updated.  Question #2: On Solicitation Number: NNJ09298123Q I noted the section 3.3.3 of the SOWshows that two of the VFDs(refer to 3.3.3.4, 3.3.3.5) shall output single phase. I haveseen VFDs offered with single and three phase inputs but not single phase outputs. Single phase motors are generally not capable of variable frequency use.  Has Nasadetermined that these motors can be run off of single phase?  Are these some type ofSynchronous reluctance motor?  Is it possible to get info on the motors for purposes ofsupplying power to them?Answer #2: Single phase 110V output is a copy and paste error.	The outputs shall all beof 3 phase, 220VAC.  The SOW has been updated to correct this error.  Question #3: Are you doing a Lawson Software Implementation?Answer #3: There is no requirement for broad platform implementation. The software is tosupport a limited use, lab environment application and is not a true enterprise scaleendeavor.  Question #4: Section 3.3.2 of the SOW (as well as a previous question/answer form)indicates the manipulator motors are steppers.	However, the manual for the manipulatorshows the motors as being brushless DC, which would clearly require a different style ofdrive.	Which is correct?Answer #4: Reference answer to previous question, the SOW has been updated to explainthis.  No additional update requiredQuestion #5: Section 3.3.8 of the SOW requires a manual override for VFD control.  Weunderstand this to be three separate knobs, one for each VFD.  Is this correct, or dothey all vary speed in unison?Answer #5: Each speed control is independent of the other. The SOW has been updated toreflect this in section 3.3.8.	Question #6: Section 3.4 of the SOW indicates that the VFDs are not to be mounted in astandard rack enclosure.  Does NASA have any preference or direction on how to mount orenclose the VFDs?Answer #6: The vendor may choose to utilize rack mounted VFDs or conventional, fullyenclosed COTs units designed to be surface mounted or wall hung.  The note leading intoSection 3.4 of the SOW has been updated to clarify this.  The SOW can be at:http://procurement.jsc.nasa.gov/NNJ09298123Q/SOW_Updated_10-20-09.docx The due date for questions and answers is extended to October 27, 2009.Anticipated release date of the RFQ - NNJ10316425Q, is on or about October 29, 2009. Documents related to this procurement will be available over the Internet.  Thesedocuments will reside on a World Wide Web (WWW) server, which may be accessed using a WWWbrowser application.  The Internet site, or URL, for the NASA/JSC Business Opportunitieshome page is http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/eps/bizops.cgi?gr=D&pin=73	Offerors are responsible for monitoring this site for the release of the solicitation andany amendments.   Potential offerors are responsible for downloading their own copy ofthe solicitation and amendments (if any).

<DESC>THIS NOTICE IS AMENDED TO REVISE THE PROPOSAL DUE DATE AND PRIMARY POINT OF CONTACT. 

The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), National Institutes of Health (NIH), Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) anticipates that Request for Proposals (RFP) No. NHLBI-HB-11-02 will be available on or about October 23, 2009.  The solicitation will be for the Data Coordinating Center for the program entitled Recipient Epidemiology and Donor Evaluation Study  III (REDS-III).  It is anticipated that one award will be made in January 2011 for a period of seven years.  

The objectives of the REDS-III program are to assure safe and effective blood banking and transfusion medicine practices through a comprehensive, multi-targeted strategy involving basic, translational, and clinical research to improve the benefits of transfusion while reducing its risks. Improving blood component safety and availability in the U.S. and internationally through the conduct of epidemiologic, survey, and laboratory studies is the cornerstone of the REDS program. Transfusion therapy is the most commonly employed, and, arguably, one of the least understood medical procedures in the U.S. affecting about five million recipients annually. This research program is not only critical to public health in the U.S. but also to countries struggling with the HIV epidemic where blood safety and availability are major concerns. 

NHLBI plans to support one data coordinating center, one central laboratory, up to four domestic hubs, and up to 4 international collaborative programs involving U.S. investigators and investigators at international blood centers.  THIS NOTICE ADDRESSES THE DATA COORDINATING CENTER ONLY.

The REDS-III program will target the following blood banking and transfusion medicine areas: 1) donor targeted strategies; 2) blood banking; 3) transfusion practices in adult patients; and 4) education and training.  The goal of this highly structured, multi-center, donor-recipient epidemiology, laboratory, and clinical outcomes program is to advance public health by conducting critical research to improve transfusion practices and the safety and adequacy of the blood supply in the U.S. and in countries affected by the AIDS epidemic.  The program will include large survey, epidemiological and laboratory investigations. Clinical trials in potential recipients of blood products are NOT within the purview of the REDS-III program.  The research portfolios of the REDS-III Domestic and International programs will be fashioned in response to contemporary scientific questions which need to be addressed to advance blood transfusion safety in the U.S. and in countries where REDS-III international blood centers are located.  It is expected that about one third of the studies conducted in the REDS-III Domestic program will address donor and/or donation safety and availability issues, and other blood banking questions; and that about two thirds of the investigations will address adult transfusion recipient safety concerns.  Most studies performed in the international setting, however, are expected to address blood banking concerns including donor and/or donation safety and availability issues although a small number of studies might address transfusion recipient safety concerns. Comprehensive databases including information on donors and their donations/components (required for the Domestic and International programs), and on adult patients considered for, or receiving a transfusion (required for the Domestic program only) will enable study investigators with the necessary scientific and analytical expertise to address in a timely fashion, important scientific issues in blood banking and transfusion medicine.

The domestic hubs and the international programs shall be supported by a DCC which shall be responsible for overall coordination, communications, data management, and analytical/statistical support. The domestic hubs and the international programs shall also be supported by a central laboratory which shall be responsible for the necessary infectious disease, molecular, genetic, immunological, hematological, and other testing conducted in the U.S., and for serving as the REDS-III biospecimen repository.  

The Data Coordinating Center (DCC) shall compile donation and patient data from the domestic centers (i.e., hubs) in 1) a centralized cumulative donor/donation/component database; 2) a centralized cumulative patient database; and 3) a centralized cumulative linked donor-recipient database that shall link all information on donors and their donations/components to information on the patients who received these components. The hub Centralized Data Collection Center (CCC) shall provide to the DCC the links that shall allow for the data from the donors, their donations and components to be linked with data on the recipients who received them.  It will be desirable that at least 20,000 RBC transfusion exposures occur per year at each hubs participating hospitals/outpatient clinics.  It would also be desirable, although not required, that the consortium of hospitals participating in the hub admitted the following minimum number of cross-matched adult patients each year at the following hospital services: 1) intensive care units: 1,000; 2) cardiac surgery, 1,000;  3) orthopedic surgery,  500; 4) oncology/cancer center, 1,000; and  5) trauma service, 1,000.  Each hubs blood center must collect at least 75,000 allogeneic blood donations per year.  Analysis of all data compiled in the databases shall be conducted by the DCC.  Additionally, the DCC shall be responsible for coordination, data management, and analytical/statistical support of an estimated five large epidemiological and/or survey studies and about ten laboratory studies [which may or may not be component(s) of the large epidemiological studies] during the course of the domestic program. 

The DCC shall compile donor and donation data from each international site in a centralized cumulative donor/donation database and shall be responsible for providing all statistical/analytical support for the analysis of these data. The blood centers participating in each international program must collect a total of at least 250,000 blood donations annually from at least three collaborating foreign collection sites located in a low or middle income country affected by the AIDS epidemic. Each foreign blood collection site must collect a minimum of 25,000 donations annually. Analysis of all data compiled in the database shall be conducted by the DCC. Additionally, the DCC shall be responsible for coordination, data management, and analytical/statistical support of an estimated three large epidemiological and/or survey studies and about three laboratory studies [which may or may not be component(s) of the large epidemiological studies] conducted at each of the REDS-III international collaborative programs. 

The DCC shall perform the following study requirements: 1) coordinate REDS-III activities and participate as a member of the Oversight and Steering Committees to develop and implement a coordinated plan to achieve program objectives; 2) develop and maintain operating procedures for the REDS-III program; 3) develop and maintain a public and private REDS-III website; 4) develop and finalize the protocols and associated Manuals of Operations for the cumulative centralized databases; 5) coordinate and participate in the development and finalization of REDS-III study protocols and develop corresponding Manuals of Operations;  6) provide all necessary data management and tracking systems; 7) track all REDS-III biospecimens  and their associated data, and identify biospecimens for retrieval; 8) provide training sessions and conduct site visits, as appropriate; 9) provide biostatistical support during protocol development and analyze database and study data collected during REDS-III; 10) assist the Oversight Committee and Steering Committees in preparation of scientific reports for publication and presentation; 11) help coordinate and convene the REDS-III Observational Study Monitoring Board (OSMB),  provide administrative and logistic support for OSMB meetings/calls, prepare and present data reports to the OSMB, and prepare minutes of the sessions; 12) coordinate and convene the REDS-III External Review Panel,  assist the NHLBI COTR(s) with the selection and invitation of the External Review Panel, provide administrative and logistic support for the External Review Panel meetings, prepare minutes from External Panel  sessions and coordinate and pay for External Review Panel members travel and honorarium; 13) prepare quarterly and annual technical reports;  14) interact with the COTR(s) on programmatic research activity issues; 15) At close-out of the study, or earlier as directed by the COTR(s), create public use data sets for each data collection activity with documentation; and 16) ensure an orderly transition of REDS-III resources to a successor contractor at contract expiration. 

THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS (RFP) and the Government is not committed to award a contract pursuant to this announcement.  The RFP will be available on the FedBizOpps web page at www.fedbizopps.gov.  Prospective offerors are responsible for downloading the RFP and all attachments.  It is also the offerors' responsibility to monitor the FedBizOpps web page for the release of any amendments to the RFP.  The RFP will contain all the information and details to allow potential offerors to prepare and submit a contract proposal.  This acquisition has been designated as a full and open competition under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 541712 and the size standard is 500 employees.  Subcontracting opportunities are anticipated during the course of this contract.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which shall be considered by the NHLBI.

<DESC><p>NOTICE: THIS IS A PRE-SOLICITATION NOTICE.&nbsp;NOAA's Alaska Fisheries Science Center has a requirement to conduct&nbsp;two research cruises for Pacific cod using a single chartered fishing vessel in 2009 and 2010 to tag and release cod and to collect catch data and biological data on cod and incidental species in the eastern Bering Sea. In lieu of compensation, the Pacific cod catch shall be retained by the charter vessel.
<p>The first research longline cruise shall begin as soon as possible after the finish of the 2010 A-Season for Pacific cod longline fishing (on or about February 10, 2010) and consist of 30 sampling days in the eastern Bering Sea and&nbsp;end 35 to 40 days later, depending on mobilization and demobilization time and days lost to weather. The cruise will begin and end in Dutch Harbor, Alaska.</p>
<p>The second research longline cruise shall begin on or about June 20, 2010 and&nbsp;consist of 30 sampling days in the eastern Bering Sea and end 35 to 40 days later, depending on mobilization and demobilization time and days lost to weather. The cruise will begin and end in Dutch Harbor, Alaska.</p>
<p>VESSEL REQUIREMENTS for longline operations:</p>
<p>1. Minimum registered length 41.1 m (135 ft), although the preferred vessel registered length is 45.7 m (150 ft) or greater.</p>
<p>2. Minimum main engine continuous horsepower sufficient to permit a cruising speed of 18.5 km/hr (10 kts) in a moderate sea state.</p>
<p>3. Able to accommodate a field party of 8, including 4 contract scientists provided by the vessel.</p>
<p>4. The vessel must have an endurance capability for operating and fishing for a minimum of 40 consecutive days, including running to and from stations.</p>
<p>5. Completely rigged and ready to fish longline gear. The gear shall be provided by the vessel and include, but not limited to, the tackle and machinery necessary for setting and retrieving, flag-and-buoy arrays, buoy line, anchors, running line, and ground line with baited hooks. An auto-baiting system is preferred. The baiting system must consistently bait 95% or more of the hooks. If the baiting rate falls below 95% then fishing operations shall cease until the baiting system has been brought to the required efficiency by the vessel's engineering department. The contractor shall determine Hook size, hook spacing, and all other attributes of the tackle. Each unit of gear (e.g. magazine, rack, skate, etc) shall have the same ground line material and length, the same tackle fixing hooks to ground line, the same hook size, the same hook spacing, and the same number of hooks. Units of gear that vary by more than two percent (2%) from the number of hooks specified by the contractor shall not be deployed.</p>
<p>6. The Contractor shall furnish bait for each cruise. Each hook shall be baited with chopped squid in an amount per hook that is appropriate to the auto-baiting machinery. The bait shall be East Coast or North Atlantic squid (Illex illecebrosus), 2-3 count per lb or larger; Loligo or market squid is not acceptable. The general commercial designation is brown color, fit for human consumption (used as an index of freshness), and 100-200 grams per squid. The head and legs will not be used for bait, only the mantle and viscera. The mantle length should be 15-23 cm (6-9 in) long. The baiting system must consistently bait 95% or more of the hooks. If the baiting rate falls below 95% then fishing operations shall cease until the baiting system has been brought to the required efficiency by the vessel's engineering department. At the beginning of each cruise, the vessel shall be supplied with a single lot of bait sufficient to last the duration of that cruise. Changes in bait characteristics during the course of the cruise will render catch rates incomparable from station to station. Calculation of the required amount of bait depends on the baiting characteristics of the vessel's fishing gear and the expected amount of fishing in a research cruise (see note below on the expected amount of fishing).</p>
<p>7. The vessel shall provide freezer storage, exclusive of that for ship stores, sufficient to store at least 272 mt (600,000 lb) of dressed and frozen fish. If more cod are caught than can be carried in the vessel's freezer storage then a mid-cruise off-load can be negotiated between the Government and the contractor.</p>
<p>8. Contract Scientific Personnel <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. The Contractor shall provide at least four (4) trained biologists to conduct standard survey data collection operations that shall perform 1) catch tallying of individual hooks; 2) length and sex sampling of catch; 3) recording and editing data in appropriate forms and computer files.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. Personnel must receive training in the above operations by Government survey scientists prior to participation in the survey. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c. Personnel shall be employed by a qualified scientific firm or institute engaged in marine fisheries research, or in providing scientific personnel.</p>
<p>9. The vessel and officer licensing requirements shall be sufficient to permit the chartered vessel to carry eight (8) personnel in the field party (both male and female).</p>
<p>EXPECTED AMOUNT OF FISHING</p>
<p>The research fishing to be conducted on these cruises has not been done in previous years so there is no historical basis for an expected catch of Pacific cod and incidental species under these fishing protocols. The object of these charters is to maintain high data accuracy and consistency.</p>
<p>In each cruise, there shall be one day of fishing at each of thirty stations. If foul weather prevents fishing at a particular station then fishing operations shall cease until conditions permit their resumption and that station can be sampled. Each station shall be fished on a 24-hour cycle, including running time from the previous station, which may be as much as 10 hours for the 10 stations in the strata with lower sampling density. Based on the constraints the offeror can expect the chartered vessel to be able to run about half the gear that would be deployed during open access fishing. If a vessel normally fishes 40,000 hooks per day then it will likely average 20,000 hooks per day during the research fishing. If a vessel normally fishes 70,000 hooks per day then it will likely average 35,000 hooks per day during the research fishing. These are conservative estimates and a larger number of hooks may be fished per day in strata with higher station density, though this is not certain.</p>
<p>The number of cod removed from the research catch for scientific purposes is expected to be about 300 per day. The remainder of the catch shall be turned over to the vessel.</p>
</p>
<p>Period of performance shall begin on or about&nbsp;February 10, 2010 for the first cruise. The second cruise shall begin on or about June 20, 2010. The North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) is 532411 with a size standard of $7M.&nbsp; <strong>A Request for Proposal (RFP) solicitation may be available on or about November 6, 2009 at http://www.fedbizopps.gov/.</strong> The estimated response due date is December 7, 2009; however, the actual date offers are due will be stated within the solicitation documents.

PLEASE DISREGARD MODIFCATION #4 POSTED ON FBO ON 10/23/2009 AT 12:18 AM
Modification #5 is a clarification which is being issued to respond to a question received under the solicitation.
Question regarding PSF 1, Subsection1bi:  "Prospectus requests 'two examples of preventative maintenance plans and their execution'.  Is this plans for two assets, and if so, what would be the level, building, asset, component, etc? or is this two full preventative maintenance plans?"  
Service Response:  A preventative maintenance plan could be developed at any asset level - component, building, or grouping of buildings because offerors may have varying levels of experience and examples readily available.  Better examples indicate a clear understanding of what preventative maintence is and show the capacity to implement a preventative maintenance program similar in complexity to the group of assets to be assigned under the Draft Contract.

<DESC>Contract N68936-04-D-0019 Tybrin Corporation is one of three Multiple-Award Contracts (MAC's) for Combat Environment Simulation (CES) support at Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division (NAWCWD), China Lake, CA.  NAWCWD intends to negotiate on an other-than-competitive basis an extension of the contract ordering period from December 21, 2009 to March 31, 2010.  Contract type: Cost Plus Award Fee (CPAF), Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ), level-of-effort (LOE).  The other two CES MAC's are N68936-04-D-0020 with Lockheed Martin Services and N68936-04-D-0022 with L-3 Services Inc., Global Security & Engineering Solutions (L-3 GSES).  The purpose of the modification is to increase the ceiling and extend the ordering period of the contract.  The level-of-effort will be increased by approximately 59,000 hours for the contract.  The work is competed among the multi-award contracts at the order level using best value source selection processes.  An increase to the ceiling for Contract N68936-04-D-0019 is necessary in order to modify existing orders on the contract to meet program needs until follow-on multiple award contracts can be awarded.  The extension is needed to avoid work stoppage on existing programs until the follow-on solicitation can be released and awards made from it.  Contractors who believe that they can step in and take over a program must submit a written response demonstrating technical, cost and management capability without causing hardships to program schedule and costs.  No new work requirements are planned for the current contracts and orders.  Requirements are competed among the CES MAC's and awarded and funded at the task/delivery order level.  The Combat Environment Simulation (CES) Division at China Lake requires support to develop and acquire new range systems, integrate various range systems and upgrade and modernize existing range systems.  Specifically, there are requirements for the integration of various T&E and training systems into existing range systems and infrastructure; the fielding of systems at new range locations; the modification/update/upgrade of major software systems, and the development, modification, or integration of supporting range systems and assets (for participants tracking, data communications, exercise monitoring, and debrief, etc.). The CES Division also requires a variety of engineering, technical and management services related to development, fabrication, procurement, integration, test, training and technical support of radar and pod instrumentation systems, EO/IR/MW/UV/Laser/C4I Threat Simulator systems, tactical training ranges for all DoD services, related network-centric systems and components, Advanced Air Defense technological concepts, Information Assurance/Operations, Artificial Intelligence, and Neural Networking in a Network Centric Warfare environment.  As required by specific task orders, the contractor shall design, develop, fabricate, install, integrate, and test network-centric warfare equipment and/or systems designed to provide a dense, realistic, electromagnetic  (radio frequency, infrared, electro-optic, and laser energy) environment to be used by the Defense community for weapon systems development, real-time aircrew tactical training, test and evaluation, test and evaluation of defense suppression systems, electronic warfare (EW) systems, electronic countermeasures (ECM) equipment, and electronic counter-countermeasures (ECCM) equipment.  These efforts include fixed and moving ground, sea, and air targets, multi-lateration and GPS-based instrumentation pods, threat emitters, integrated hardware/software systems and environments and hostile equipment modeled entirely in software.  The body of projects executed by this division take on the look and feel of a single unified acquisition.  Level of facility clearance required: SECRET.  Level of safeguarding required: SECRET.  Contractor's interested in subcontracting opportunities contact the Prime Contractor.  All responsible sources, that submit a proposal, shall be considered by the Agency.  The anticipated award date of the modification: December 18, 2009.  N68936-09-R-0001 is the solicitation for the CES follow-on and was synopsized on October 21, 2009.  Anticipated date of award for the follow-on is March 31, 2010.  Questions should be addressed to Commander Code 220000D, Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division, 429 East Bowen Road - Stop 4105, China Lake, CA 93555-6108.  POC: Contract Specialist, William Monckton at (760) 939-8234, FAX (760) 939-8329.  Note 25.

The San Clemente Island loggerhead shrike (Lanius ludovicianus mearnsi) is an island endemic that was close to extinction prior to the initiation of the San Clemente Loggerhead Shrike Recovery Program. The current success of the San Clemente Loggerhead Shrike Recovery Program is due in large part to efforts to augment the wild shrike population with the release of captive bred, and in some instances - captive reared, shrikes. This Contract continues the implementation of an ongoing program for the captive breeding, and where appropriate, rearing of the San Clemente loggerhead shrike.
The contractor shall provide all management, labor, travel, transportation, meals, materials and equipment for the purposes of this work effort except for items specified as Government Furnished Property, Materials and Services. The basic requirement of this contract would be to provide for captive breeding, maintenance, and care of the San Clemente Island Loggerhead Shrike population, providing the required number of shrikes for single adult release, juvenile release and bonded pair/family release based on recommendations by the Shrike Working Group and negotiated with the Government Representative and Station Point of Contact. The contractor would also provide supplemental food (crickets, mealworms, and mice) sufficient to enhance the daily diet of a pre-specified number of released shrikes; provide for salvage, artificial incubation and hand rearing of wild eggs/chick from nests; provide demographic and genetic management of the captive flock; provide veterinary care to captive and wild shrikes; provide pathology services; provide for sexing of captive and wild shrikes; provide for genetic analyses of shrike feathers; and as part of the base year only - provide for an update of the 2005 MASTER PLAN.
A firm fixed price service contract will be required. The NAICS code for this requirement is 541990 with a small business size standard of $7.0M. The contemplated procurement will have a performance period of twelve (12) months with options to extend the services out an additional four (4) years.

<DESC>RML Paging System<br />The Paging project, located at the National Institutes of Health's (NIH) Rocky Mountain Laboratories (RML) in Hamilton, MT, consists of installation of a supervised paging system to serve approximately 27 buildings on the campus. The existing Notifier fire alarm system will serve as the backbone for the system, including fiber optic cable system between buildings and upgrade of existing Notifier fire alarm panels. For the majority of the buildings, interior wiring and speaker systems will be installed. In some new buildings, existing paging systems will be connected to the overall system. <br />The underground conduit pathways are largely in place to install the fiber cable. Existing cabling being abandoned will be removed. Interior works consists largely of installing devices with associated cutting and patching, terminating fiber and copper, providing power supplies, replacing fire alarm panels, low voltage work with speakers amplifiers and similar devices, pulling conductors, programming and testing. <br />

<DESC>Synopsis:

Contract modification was awarded on October 21, 2009. 

RECOVERYTHIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY.   THIS NOTICE IS NOT A NOTICE FOR SOLICITATION OF OFFERS.  THE ACTION DESCRIBED HEREIN IS A MODIFICATION TO AN EXISTING CONTRACT, DOLJ08UA00020.  THIS OPPORTUNITY WAS AVAILABLE ONLY TO THE CONTRACTOR IDENTIFIED BELOW.

This opportunity was available only to Dynamic Educational Systems, Inc. under contract number DOLJ04UA00008.  The Office of the Assistant Secretary for Administration and Management on behalf of the Office of Job Corps has awarded a modification in the amount of $14,659 to the Bamberg Job Corps Centers, operated by Dynamic Educational Systems, Inc.  These funds are provided under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA).  The funding is within the not-to-exceed ceilings for this contract.

The funding is intended to address the following program areas:  1) Career Technical Skills Training pertaining to the development of green training elements/modules in each of the priority areas (Automotive, Green and Construction Technology) of center-operated programs as detailed in Job Corps Curriculum Change Notice 09-01 and Curriculum Change Notice 09-02.  The operator of the Bamberg center will utilize these funds to make available additional Career Technical Skills Training opportunities to the students of the Bamberg Job Corps Center.  The operator of the Bamberg Job Corps Center will not procure the services through subcontracting opportunities.

<DESC>This contract action was not awarded as a fixed price type because uncertainties involved in contract performance did not permit costs to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed price contract. As such, a cost-reimbursement type action was awarded (FAR 16.301-2).<br><br>Furthermore:<BR><BR>1)  A detailed scope of work can not be prepared.  The extent of the work and the resources that are needed can not be fully determined prior to starting the work because conditions are different at each area.<BR><BR>2)  The Contractor is already responsible for the complete inspection, maintenance and repair of these facilities.<BR><BR>3)  The scheduling, coordination, quality assurance and/or subcontracting for the work to be performed are within the scope of the original contract technical provisions and must be accomplished under the terms of the existing contract.  The incumbent contractor not only has the management, technical, and administrative skills necessary to efficiently and effectively accomplish this work at a reasonable cost, but also, the advantage of the flexibility to readily adjust to any unforeseen obstacles encountered during installation. <BR><BR>4)  This contract enables repairs to begin immediately after and during inspections without a detailed scope of work and thus minimizes the time the facilities are closed and the impact on public access to camping and recreation during the busiest season of the year.<BR>
