Statement of Work
For
Sustainable Initiative Support for HQ AFRC 
30 Apr 2003

Background

The USAF Sustainable Development Policy requires Military Construction (MILCON) projects to incorporate sustainability principles into facility delivery.  HQ Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) recognizes that additional project experience and a framework for cross-functional participation will enhance its implementation of sustainable development.  Contractor support is required to execute four tasks.  These include:
							
Task 1.  Conduct a sustainability charrette for an O&M project at one AFRC base		
Task 2.  Conduct a cross-functional sustainable development workshop at HQ AFRC		
Task 3.  Prepare a Command Sustainability Action Plan			
Task 4.  Prepare an Installation-wide Sustainability Plan for one AFRC base	


Task Descriptions	

TASK 1:  Sustainability Charrette and Project Consultant Services

HQ AFRC will identify a large O&M (renovation or repair) project at an AFRC installation.  The contractor will travel to this installation, meet with the design team, advise them on incorporating sustainability into the project, and produce a brief technical report on the process and necessary actions to be taken by the design team.  HQ AFRC will provide a guidance document on MILCON charrettes that can be adapted to the O&M process.  The goals and objectives of this task are:

1.	Develop a contractor/AFRC team to work with installation personnel and their A&E on incorporating sustainability into the candidate project
2.	Identify the differential design cost per agreement with directorate and related divisions (HQ AFRC/CEV will fund this cost, but not the “design cost” that is typical)
3.	Facilitate completion of a sustainable design project that can serve as a model for AFRC O&M projects of similar scope and nature
4.	Produce a written process description (in outline form) that identifies the steps other installations will take to incorporate sustainability concepts into O&M projects


TASK 2:  The Sustainable Design Workshop at HQ AFRC 

The workshop will be a forum for implementing sustainable design by gathering all key stakeholders, identifying issues and solutions, and creating a consensus-based framework for applying sustainability to the facility life cycle at AFRC installations.  The goals and objectives of this 

Workshop are:

q	Bring together HQ personnel and key stakeholders in the AFRC who represent various facets of management of installations. 
·	Discuss common definition and framework for sustainability within AFRC, based on AF and AFRC policy.  
·	Establish key goals and objectives for AFRC host installations.  
·	Discuss principles and concepts within this framework that are relevant to AFRC infrastructure systems.  
·	Explore the implications of Sustainability for planning, design, procurement, construction, commissioning, and start-up, as well as operation and maintenance of projects within AFRC installations.
q	Facilitate open dialogue among participants to identify issues and concerns:
·	Regarding application of common definition and framework for sustainability
·	Regarding sustainable goals and objectives for AFRC host installations
·	Regarding application of principles and concepts of sustainability to AFRC’s facilities and civil infrastructure systems
·	Regarding planning, design, procurement, construction, commissioning, and start-up as well as operations & maintenance of projects within AFRC host installations
q	Develop Plan of Action for the implementation of Sustainability at AFRC Installations that:  
·	Establishes a common vision for implementation, aligns Civil Engineering’s divisional goals toward vision achievement, and establishes common set of implementation tactics for vision achievement
·	Establishes set procedures and set of parameters for technological and logistic support infrastructure for execution of the tactics
·	Establishes how identified issues and concerns are resolved and identifies POCs, deadline, and tools required
·	Establishes commitments from participants and their organizations toward achievement of sustainability at AFRC host installations
 

Pre-workshop tasks will include: 
1.	Develop Pre-workshop readings and questionnaire.
·	Pre-read list includes AF Sustainable Facilities Guide (web-based), ILE Policy, AFRC policy, AFRC background paper, March Sustainable Operations Report (Volume I)
·	Questionnaire to address objectives, issues, concerns, and commitments (completed prior to workshop)
2.	Review of relevant documents including policy directives, handbooks, guidelines, divisional mission statements, roles and responsibilities, tasks, & challenges.
·	Documents will be identified and provided by HQ AFRC.
3.	Develop participant handbook and develop materials for presentations and exercises.

Workshop activities will require a trip to HQ AFRC and will include:
1.	Conduct a workshop, expected to last from 12 to 16 hours.  
2.	Establish context for sustainability in AFRC installation programs.
3.	Establish common point of departure (issues and concerns).
4.	Conduct team exercise for systems thinking.
5.	Establish common vision, strategic goals, and implementation tactics for application of Sustainability. 
6.	Establish basic operational procedures and support infrastructure.
7.	Review highlights of first session.
8.	Establish common and aligned action plan
9.	Establish commitments (institutional commitments need CE and CE-2 participation and agreement, individual commitments require individual buy-in and follow-up)

Post-workshop activities will include:
1.	Process workshop results and provide to AFRC a final report with a common and aligned action plan that will document –
·	Proposed definition and framework for sustainability as it applies to AFRC
·	The main principles and concepts that are relevant and the implications for AFRC’s planning, design, procurement, construction, commissioning, and start-up, as well as operations and maintenance of projects.  Includes issues and concerns
·	The common vision among participants for implementation at AFRC  
·	The institutional and individual goals required to achieve common vision
·	The common set of implementation tactics for goal achievement
·	A basic set of ops procedures for execution of tactics
·	A basic set of parameters for technological and logistical support infrastructure for the operational procedures 


TASK 3:  Command Sustainability Action Plan

Prepare a written plan for cross-functional implementation of sustainable development within AFRC.  The plan should logically flow from the Sustainable Design Workshop  (Task #2) guidance and consensus.  The path this task takes is the path laid-out for AFRC by the workshop participants.  

The goals of this Action Plan are:

q	Should assist HQ AFRC in issue resolution based on installation training exercises previously conducted at host installations
q	Enables users to develop and implement a common vision for sustainability efforts within AFRC  
q	Needs to align with the proposed EMS for the HQ AFRC (information provided by AFRC)
q	Reflects agreement on tactics, operational procedures, and parameters for technological and logistical support
	
	Required activities include:
i.	Conduct two trips to HQ AFRC (working trip, results briefing)
ii.	Prepare a written Action Plan.  Some of the elements of the action plan should be:
a.	Our agenda identification (similar to vision).
b.	What are the implementation steps?
c.	What is next and in what order (sequencing)?
d.	What standards are used to measure success (goals in each area)? 
e.	Identify the impediments and possible solutions
	
	Actions to be identified in the plan should include:
	-- 1 year --
i.	Assemble HQ AFRC/CEC, CEO, CEP, CEV facilities working group (integrated design)
		build a process to make our facilities more sustainable
		What are each division’s “needs” from others to accomplish?
ii.	Educate, train/retrain HQ and Host installations on sustainable facilities planning, design, construction, and operation
iii.	Create a sustainable development template for AFRC implementation (based on SD work at Homestead & March)
		Template identifies sustainable projects and initiatives to increase sustainability at installation
n	5 year –
 

iv.	Incorporate sustainable facility guide design charrettes into all MILCON and selected O&M projects
		Train staff (first step)
	Establish an AFRC in-house or contracted traveling charrette facilitator for installations use at planning, pre-design, or design reviews, as needed
v.	Create sustainable development plans for all AFRC installations
	Based upon the template above
	An installation-specific, detailed roadmap to a sustainable installation


TASK 4:  The Installation-wide Sustainability Plan (Youngstown ARS)

Create an installation-wide plan for achieving sustainable operations at Youngstown ARS, similar to the plans performed by others for Homestead ARB & March JRB.  HQ AFRC wants an independent expert to evaluate the installation opportunities and avoid duplication of effort from Homestead ARB & March JRB.  Conduct at least two trips to the installation, including a project kick-off/Charrette and an out-briefing.

The main elements of the plan will include:  
1.	An installation policy statement developed in conjunction with the charrette 
2.	Identification of baseline conditions
3.	Identification of operational practices
4.	Development of installation goals (aligned with AFRC and other installation goals) for sustainability.  Goals identified should minimally cover the LEED criteria
5.	Identify projects to assist the installation meet the identified goals
