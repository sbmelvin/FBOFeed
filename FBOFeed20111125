<DESC>Synopses:
<p>The purpose of this notice is to comply with the synopses and pre-solicitation notice requirements of FAR 5.2 - Synopses of Proposed Contract Actions. Any solicitation resulting from this notice will be handled in accordance with FAR 5.102(d); therefore, availability of any resulting solicitation package may be limited to this electronic medium.</p>
<p>The United States Government, represented by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), intends to issue a Request for Proposals (RFP) for anticipated multiple-award indefinite-quantity contracts (IQCs) for evaluation services restricted to South African local organizations (as defined below). Evaluation services will be performed in any of the following countries: South Africa, Lesotho, Botswana and Swaziland. Work under the IQCs will be delivered under Task Orders to perform evaluations that will serve two primary purposes: providing accountability to stakeholders and learning to improve aid effectiveness. All evaluations conducted under the IQCs will be unbiased in measurement and reporting, relevant in terms of linking evaluation questions to specific future decision to be made by USAID leadership, partner governments and other key stakeholders, based on best practices, oriented toward building local capacity and with a commitment to full and open disclosure of findings. Task Orders may include: 1) Problem diagnostics and analytics, 2) Problem identification, 3) Program/project/task design, 4) Analysis and assessment, 5) Strategic planning, 6) Technical Evaluations for Health, Democracy and Governance, Economic Growth, Environment, Education, 7) Contractor/ recipient performance evaluations, 8) Impact evaluations, 9) Partnership evaluations, 10) Development of metrics, 11) Performance monitoring and data quality assessments, 12) Assessments and analysis and 13) Provision of logistical support for task implementation teams.</p>
<p>The period of performance is anticipated to be three (3) years. The maximum sum of all Task Orders awarded under all IQCs is anticipated to not exceed $5,000,000. Note that this ceiling applies across all contracts and cannot be exceeded in the aggregate; each successful contractor will be eligible to compete on all Task Orders until the shared ceiling for all contracts is reached. There is no guarantee on the number of contracts awarded, the number of Task Orders that any one firm will receive or the amount of money each contactor is entitled to beyond the minimum monetary amount stated in the anticipated Request for Proposals (RFP). USAID's preference is that Task Orders will be awarded on a firm fixed price basis.</p>
<p>Eligible organizations shall be limited to local organizations, defined as follows:</p>
<p>"Local Organization means an entity, that at the time of the award and performance of the contract or subcontract, is one that:</p>
<p>(1) is organized under the laws of the South Africa;<br />(2) has its principal place of business in South Africa; <br />(3) is not less than 51 percent legally and beneficially owned by one or more resident citizens of South Africa or is managed by a governing body, the majority of whom are citizens or lawful permanent residents of South Africa; and<br />(4) is not controlled by a foreign entity or by one or more individuals who are not resident citizens of the South Africa. "</p>
<p><br />Additionally, USAID wishes to notify potential offerors that USAID intends to hold a Pre-Proposal Conference.</p>
<p>Pre-Proposal Conference to be Held in Pretoria, South Africa</p>
<p>USAID/SA is planning on holding a pre-proposal conference in Pretoria, South Africa. This pre-proposal conference is for informational purposes only. At the conclusion of a presentation, attendees will have the opportunity to ask questions. The presentation and all questions and answers from the pre-proposal conference will be posted to this notice after the conference. The pre-proposal conference is scheduled for January 11th, 2012.

<p>Ms. Fatima DosSantos at fdosssantos@usaid.gov and<br />Mr. Eric Strong at <a href="mailto:estrong@usaid.gov">estrong@usaid.gov</a>.</p>
<p>The organization's email should include the names of individuals whom they expect to attend. Due to high interest and space limitations, participation is limited to two (2) representatives per organization. Organizations must send their email and submit attendees names no later than January 1st, 2012.&nbsp;</p>

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION/DRAFT SOLICITATION (RFI)
The Veterans Health Administration (VHA), Office of Informatics and Analytics Health Information Management has a requirement for scanning services for File Room Reduction/Closure at various facilities throughout the US.  The purpose of this RFI is to solicit informal expressions of interest and comments on the draft Performance Work Statement (PWS) for this requirement from potential Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) vendors with active contracts under FSS 36, The Office, Imaging and Document Solution.   All comments on this PWS and expressions of interest should be forwarded in writing to the Contract Specialist, Michelle Bailey, via email at michelle.bailey@va.gov.  Please title all emails on this requirement as “VA101-12-I-0027 FILEROOM CLOSURE”.  Please submit your comments to Ms. Bailey NLT December 2, 2011, 11:00 AM EST, after this period; commentary will no longer be received.
  BACKGROUND
The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Veterans Health Administration (VHA) is a healthcare system that provides care at approximately 139 medical centers nationwide for approximately nine (9) million patients.  VHA records are maintained for a minimum of 75 years.  VHA’s Office of Informatics and Analytics (OIA) Health Information Management (HIM) has transitioned from a paper to an electronic health record environment.  This has created the opportunity to reduce the overall footprint/square footage of the HIM department through the archiving of health records in the file rooms located at specific Veterans Affairs Medical Centers (VAMCs) across the nation. 
File room space is limited, thus each year inactive records are required to be identified, inventoried, and retired.  Records are considered inactive when the patient has not had patient care activity within the last three (3) years, including Non-VA purchased care.  These inactive records are retired to the VA Records Center & Vault (RC&V) in Neosho, Missouri.  Scanning and image capturing of paper files are used to produce electronic records.  VAMCs may currently use scanning/ image capturing technology for active record documents.
VA anticipates that 30 facilities may use this Blank Purchase Agreement (BPA) to reduce or close its file rooms over the next five (5) years, which is depicted in the table below.  These facilities are located throughout the continental United States (U.S.). Due the differing size and condition of the individual file rooms, varying levels of effort will be required for each of the 30 facilities.  Depending on a facility’s record retirement history, anywhere from 600 – 5000 boxes of records may need to be shipped to Neosho, Missouri in a given Task Order (TO).   The size of these 30 file rooms range from holding under 500 linear feet – 10,000 linear feet of paper records.  However, most facilities’ file rooms contain less than 6,000 linear feet of paper records.  Some of the records that will be retired or sent to offsite storage may need to be barcoded. 15 of the 30 potential facilities have adequate onsite scanning equipment for Contractor use. However as noted below, the place of performance shall be determined at the TO level.

SCOPE OF WORK
The Contractor shall provide all resources necessary to accomplish the requirements described in this PWS.  Specifically, the Contractor shall perform file room reduction/closure services at specified VAMCs in a defined, accurate, timely, measurable, and fiscally responsible manner that protects the interests of VA.  This contract shall not encompass ongoing operational scanning. Moreover, it is not expected that special considerations will be made for diagnostic quality imaging. Document destruction is not included in the scope of services.
PERFORMANCE DETAILS
The Contractor shall make certain that appropriate physical care and security measures are taken to ensure that documents and health records and the VA information they contain are not damaged or compromised throughout the entire process from the point of receipt through the return shipment.  The contractor will be compliant with all VA established security policies to ensure VA data, whether captured electronically or as a paper or other media type record, are not compromised.  The contractor will adhere to established VA physical security policy prior to receipt and while in possession of documents and health records off and on site.

The contractor is expected to scan documents with a minimum resolution of 300 x 300 dots per inch (dpi) as established by VistA Imaging specifications and ensure that images are correctly indexed, oriented, legible, and complete (See reference documents).

The local facility will provide the contractor with guidance to identify the indexing values for all document types.  Due to the variety of documents the contractor will scan, documents will need to be reviewed in order to determine the correct indexing values.  To ensure accurate indexing, VHA will work with the contractor to identify document index terms and will update the list accordingly as new document index terms become available.  Documents will be imaged as an exact replica of the original document with quality control processes in place with assurance that the imaged document is stored, accessible and retained according to the 75 year retention requirement.  
Either fulltime VA representatives or designated agents of the Government will perform quality assurance on site for a period of time to be determined by VHA.

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>Contractor SHALL provide the approved water distributor's name, address, and inspection responsibility code (IRC) with the bid. The water source must be approved and listed on the U.S. Army Medical Department/U.S. Army Veterinary Command Approved Sources list. This list is a comprehensive list of sanitarily approved food establishments and sources that may be utilized to provide services to the U.S. Government.

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>Contractor SHALL provide the approved water distributor's name, address, and inspection responsibility code (IRC) with the bid. The water source must be approved and listed on the U.S. Army Medical Department/U.S. Army Veterinary Command Approved Sources list. This list is a comprehensive list of sanitarily approved food establishments and sources that may be utilized to provide services to the U.S. Government.

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>Contractor SHALL provide the approved water distributor's name, address, and inspection responsibility code (IRC) with the bid. The water source must be approved and listed on the U.S. Army Medical Department/U.S. Army Veterinary Command Approved Sources list. This list is a comprehensive list of sanitarily approved food establishments and sources that may be utilized to provide services to the U.S. Government.

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>Contractor SHALL provide the approved water distributor's name, address, and inspection responsibility code (IRC) with the bid. The water source must be approved and listed on the U.S. Army Medical Department/U.S. Army Veterinary Command Approved Sources list. This list is a comprehensive list of sanitarily approved food establishments and sources that may be utilized to provide services to the U.S. Government.

<DESC>Previously, the T-Craft Transfer At Sea(TAS) system for transferring vehicles at sea was successfully demonstratede at the 1/4 scale level under contract number N00014-07-D-0200.&nbsp; Where the T-Craft TAS system addressed the problem of moving&nbsp; rolling stock between the two vessels there are other issues within the Navy that can be addressed with this technology.&nbsp; These issues focus on the transfer of personnel between two vessels at sea, and it is proposed to address these needs with the demonstration effort.&nbsp; This effort will concentrate on the design for a Personnel Transfer System(PTS) while also advancing the technology of the vehicle transfer system, especially the launch and recovery of the system, in the unconstrained environment beyond the T-Craft BAA requirments.
