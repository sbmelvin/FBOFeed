<DESC>The NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) intends to solicit proposals under the statutory authority 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(2) "Urgent and Compelling" to meet the agency's need for investigation and comparison of a variety of demisable propellant tank conceptual designs for a spacecraft propulsion subsystem.  This study is of such compelling urgency that NASA has determined that it would be seriously injured unless FAR Part 6 competition is precluded.  The agency has identified a limited number of qualified sources from which it will solicit proposals.  NASA is the leader among the world in exploring the development of demisable propellant tank architecture.  The objective of this investigation and comparison is the feasibility of a variety of demisable propellant tank conceptual designs for NASA's Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission. Currently, the central structure of the spacecraft cannot be defined due to uncertainties in the tank. Until these research activities under this proposed study are complete, the definition of the tank set cannot be obtained.   Without the definition of the tank set, NASA's will be unable to meet commitments made to the scientific community (education, government, and commercial industry) involved in this endeavor and will have a significant global impact to the science community. GSFC has identified five vendors with the technical expertise necessary to perform these studies without delay.  The market for spacecraft propellant tanks is relatively small and thus the capabilities in this highly specialized field are only possessed by a handful of vendors. It is expected that simplified acquisition procedures (&gt;$100,000) will be followed.  The firms to be solicited are:  1) Pressure Systems, Inc., Commerce, CA, 2)Carleton Technologies Inc., Glen Burnie, MD, 3)Lincoln Operations (General Dynamics Armament and Technical Products) Lincoln, NE,4) ARDE Inc., Norwood, NJ, and 5) Keytone Engineering Company, Los Angeles, CA. In order to achieve safe disposal, GPM has chosen to design its spacecraft propellant tank to demise upon entering the atmosphere. NASA provides guidelines for the safe disposal of spacecraft that have completed their missions. For GPM, titanium and steel tanks of any thickness (including overwrapped) have been found by analysis to survive reentry and cause a significant amount of debris. Demisability of propellant tanks depends on factors such as materials, thicknesses, shape, mass, and volume.  The designs must be compliant with design and performance requirements and have a level of cost, technical, and schedule risks consistent with the benefits of the design. The resulting contractor(s) shall deliver to NASA all completed reports, analyses, internal technical memoranda, drawings, and other documents relating to the development and management of the Demisable Tank Concept Study activities no later than 22 weeks from the initiation of the purchase order. Companies who believe they can provide these services without any detrimental impact to the program schedule supported by this work, should fully identify their interest and capabilities within 15 days after publication of this synopsis.  Capability statements must address the organizations current technical ability to perform these studies and provide a minimum of 3 references (name of organization, point of contact, and telephone number) where same/similar effort has been performed.  All qualified responsible sources shall be considered by the agency.  All questions must be submitted in writing (fax or mail). All capability statements must be received in writing (fax or mail - no e-mail accepted). Telephone questions will not be accepted.  The response must be sufficient to permit agency analysis to establish a bonafied capability to meet the requirements to perform the study. Additional background information can be found at the following web site:	  http://gpm.gsfc.nasa.gov/mission.html     The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. See Note 26 and Note 22.  An Ombudsman has been appointed. See NASA specific Note "B".

PROGRAM OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION:
The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Advanced Technology Office (ATO) is soliciting proposals under this BAA for Phase 2 of its Friction Drag Reduction (FDR) Program.  The Phase 2 FDR Program consists of three (3) program topic areas, which include the following:  1) Microbubble Predictive Modeling, 2) Polymer Predictive Modeling, and 3) Large-scale Experiments.  The government is soliciting proposals in all three of these Phase 2 topic areas.

SCOPE AND FUNDING:  
The government anticipates award of multiple contracts/agreements.  Total program funding for this BAA is currently estimated at the following amounts:  $2,000,000 for FY03, $3,800,000 for FY04, $2,300,000 for FY05, and $900,000 for FY06.

NOTE:  Although this BAA will be open for one (1) year from the date of its publication in FedBizOpps, the government anticipates that the majority of funding for this program will be committed during First Selections.  To be considered for funding during First Selections, proposals must be received no later than 4:00pm Local Time on 16 JUN 2003.

The 2 kW MTG is an open frame power unit that is equipped with a Yanmar model L48AE-DEG, one-cylinde r, air-cooled diesel engine to provide 2 kW of power at either 120 volts, 60 Hertz AC or 28 volts DC, using different generator and control elements.  The wet weight of the 2 kW MTG is 158 pounds for the AC unit and 138 pounds for the DC unit.  Both genera tor units emit a noise signature of 79 dBA @ 7 meters.  This contract shall consist of three individual or independent R&D tasks to reduce the weight of both the AC and DC generator sets by 20% to 25%, and also reduce the noise levels of both sets to 70 dB A at 7 meters.  Task 1 effort shall independently focus on reducing aural noise levels emitted by the existing 2 kW MTG.  Task 2 shall independently focus on reducing the system weight of the existing 2 kW MTG.  The third task will be conducted to identify  the potential for a combined weight and noise reduction.  R&D changes applied to the 2 kW MTG to meet these new performance requirements must not impact the system's ability to comply with current military requirements for EMI per MIL-STD- 461; Environmen tal Capabilities such as operation from -25°F to 120°F, rain, humidity, altitude, sand/dust, rail transport, -65°F cold storage, salt spray and fungus; Electric Power Rating: 2 kW, 1.0 pf @ 4000 ft/120°F, derate 3.5%/1000 ft (4000 - 8000 ft), max power rat ing at 110%; and all Electric Power Quality requirements.  The end product of this contract will be the development of a field kit(s) that can be procured and installed at the Unit Level.  It has been determined that Dewey Electronics Corporation is the 'O nly One Responsible Source and no other Supplies or Services will satisfy Agency Requirements' that is able to design, develop, fabricate and test a field kit to reduce the system weight and the external noise output of the DoD 2 kW MTG and to execute this  contract in a timely manner.  The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is 10 USC 2304 (c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and no Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements.  However, all responsible  sources that can provide supporting data to demonstrate they can successfully conduct R&D effort to reduce the system weight and the external noise output of  the existing 2 kW MTG and deliver two (2) complete units of finished, modified, tested 2 kW MTG sets of each type for each task of the contract, shall be considered by the agency.

<DESC>This announcement is made for subcontracting opportunities. The FAA anticipates the award of a contract in the estimated amount of $4,000,000 to Raytheon Company on a non-competitive basis for retrofit work to be performed on the FAA ASR-11 systems currently being manufactured and installed under DASR Contract No. F19628-96-D-0038. The Raytheon Company is the developer and manufacturer of the ASR-11 system. An award to a different contractor would result in delays of the ASR-11 radar installation and commissioning schedules, as well as delays of the delivery schedule of the interfaces. In addition, the DASR contract is a Non-Development Item (NDI) and the drawings and technical data that any other contractor would require to perform the proposed effort are not available. Contract award is planned for May 2003.

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This solicitation, No. F02604-99-QU058 is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ). This solicitation document, incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 97-09.  This is a 100% Small Business Set-Aside; SIC 9511, $5 million.  Contract Line Item (CLIN) 0001; NONPERSONAL services to provide all personnel, equipment, tools, materials, supervision, and services necessary to comply with the following:  STATEMENT OF WORK PROJECT: Work Order 39156, BIO-REMEDIATION SERVICES TO TREAT WATER CONTAMINATION, LUKE AFB, AZ. This statement of work is for the requirement to remediate water contaminated with TRPH and grease, which is collected in oil/water separators, holding tanks, grease traps, and wastewater collection piping transferring contaminated water from its sources to wastewater treatment facility.  This shall be done with the use of microbes that will reduce the contaminants and the preventive maintenance activity.  The product will be the latest generation of microbial bacteria identified as 327-HC and 327-GT: not to compare to less effective enzyme process.  This work specification establishes the minimum requirements to provide bio-remediation services to treat water contamination of total recoverable petroleum hydrocarbons (TRPH) in oil water separators and grease in grease traps at Luke AFB, AZ.  There are three general sources for the contaminants to enter the oil water separators/traps: sinks, paved surfaces such as aircraft ramp with associated aprons and roads, and drains and food preparation facilities.  The objective is twofold.  First, reduce the contamination to below Environmental Protection Agency standard 418.1 at the effluent from the wastewater treatment plant by commencing and sustaining the cleaning process from the source throughout the system.  Second, obviate the need to periodically contract removal of oil contaminants from the oil water separators, holding tanks and grease removal from traps for disposal at authorized landfills or processing facilities.  The contractor shall provide all personnel, equipment, tools, materials, supervision and services necessary to treat contaminated wastewater.  Reducing the TRPH count to less than 100 parts per million (PPM), phenol compounds to less than 5 parts per billion (PPB).  Grease collected to particle count to EPA standards through the process where microorganisms will metamorphize the contaminates to a by-product of water and carbon dioxide.  Contractor will install peristaltic pumps at 32 locations (22 for TRPH and 10 grease), and 16 (TRPH) manually fed locations where contaminates originates.  The pumps/time dissolve cakes will introduce bacteria to the drain lines carrying the contaminants to the separators/traps.  These process and digest contaminants adhering, to the surface of drain lines as well as those TRPH contaminants in the separators or grease in traps.  A container filled with 327-HC/327-GT hydrocarbon will be installed with a battery-operated pump under a sink, near a drain.  For those sites where a sink is not available, the contractor will construct a unit to provide a complete enclosure.  No visible openings for equipment and products, and install it next to site where bacteria will be added. The pump is designed to release a predetermined amount daily.  Contractor personnel will schedule replenishment of the container to ensure uninterrupted insertion of microbes to drain lines.  Contractor must provide a complete enclosure shelter with no visible opening for all equipment that is not located inside of a facility.  The contractor guarantees the bio-remediation process will successfully accomplish the objectives within the stated parameters.  The contractor reserves the option to introduce alternate methods for treatment to enhance the process.  The contractor will evaluate all grease traps to determine if they require pumping, then report locations that require pumping to necessary personnel.  The contractor will have a Arizona certified analytical laboratory, perform quarterly tests for Phenols and TRPH after oil water separator #912 and before treatment at wastewater treatment plant to ensure meeting or less than limits stated.  The contractor will perform all services in accordance with local, state, and federal laws and regulations.  The contractor shall provide the manpower and expertise to perform tasks associated with the contract.  Contractor shall analyze the bio-remediation activity and determine proper actions to complete the process.  Contractor is not responsible for removal of contaminants other than those identified in the contract.  The contractor will develop the capability to integrate its data collection electronically (E-mail) with customer's process activity.  The contractor will establish and maintain a file for tracking each oil water separator/trap at which bacteria are added facility number(log Sheet).  The documents will define approximate quantities and dates of addition to tanks/traps.  A file will contain analyses provided by the independent laboratory.  Data will be tracked to establish parameters and monitored during subsequent years to identify variations, which exceed the parameters.  The contractor will identify the source and adjust the release of microbes to return the readings within parameters.  The records will be placed in an inactive file at the conclusion of each fiscal year.  The records will be stored for the period of the contract and released to the customer.  The contractor will provide Material Safety Data Sheet for nutrients and bacteria supplied for the bio remediation processes.  Documentation stating and verifying the advertised product will be maintained as part of the consumption data file.  The contractor will maintain records concerning maintenance of the equipment to include battery replacement.  The contractor will establish and maintain records accurately defining the consumption of the bacteria and nutrients if used to perform the tasks identified within statement of work.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), acting on behalf of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), plans to procure GeneChip probe arrays from Affymetrix Inc., 3380 Central Expressway, Santa Clara, CA  95051.  The NICHD has as one of its missions the goal of manufacturing quality cDNA microarrays for comprehensive gene expression analysis in experimental models of biological development, and to provide support to NICHD-supported researchers and develop new microarray technologies and applications.  High density DNA micro-array technology has been used to achieve high throughput analysis of massively parallel genomic sequences. These high density DNA micro-arrays (arrays) will be and have been used to perform expression studies, re-sequencing experiments, and genotype analysis on the genes from many organisms. Affymetrix will provide two DNA micro-arrays, one containing at least 15,000 different zebrafish and the other containing 15,000 Xenopus target sequences per square centimeter of solid support substrate;  the sequences will be represented as 25-mer oligonucleotide probes immobilized on a glass support using light directed solid phase combinatorial chemistry. Arrays will utilize approximately 16 paired oligonucleotide probes per gene for gene expression analysis. Arrays will contain sequences from UniGene, GenBank, and other databases currently available up to the date of manufacture.  The arrays must be sensitive enough to detect mRNA transcripts at the rate of 2-3 copies per cell.  Arrays will also be sensitive enough to identify  mRNA concentration level changes 2-3 fold and greater for high sensitivity expression comparison.  The arrays are commercial as defined in 
FAR Part 2, and this acquisition is being made in accordance with the test program using simplified procedures for certain commercial items as authorized in FAR 13.5.  Affymetrix, Inc is the only organization known that  has aforementioned features that are required and believed to be unique and only their products will work with NICHD Government owned Affymetrix Equipment.  This is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a capability statement.  This statement must demonstrate that the arrays provided will meet all of the specifications mentioned above and will be compatible with Affymetrix equipment.  The vendor must submit of list of clients to whom chips of this nature have been provided for use with Affymetrix equipment.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

The Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) anticipates award of a Firm-Fixed Price Design-Build contract for the design and construction of a Secure Woman’s Facility, in Hazelton, West Virginia.  The scope of work includes all architectural, engineering, construction and other related services necessary to provide a new federal correctional facility.  The facility will be constructed on BOP property adjacent to the existing federal correctional institution at United States Penitentiary (USP) Hazelton, West Virginia.  The proposed project is currently planned to consist of a group of buildings in a “campus plan” arrangement with related site utilities and site development. This Secure Woman’s Facility will have a gross building area of approximately 22,000 square meters and be designed to house and support approximately 512 inmates.  

The anticipated performance period of this project is 800 calendar days - after the notice to proceed is issued.  

The estimated magnitude of this project is expected to be more than $10,000,000.  

For consideration on this project the offeror at a minimum must be a firm or joint venture with experience, individually or as a member of a team, successfully and satisfactorily completing a project of similar size and scope.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered.  For the design member of the design-build team, the Architect/Engineer firm, or the principal or lead A/E firm of a joint venture, must have an existing active office, which will have responsibility for the plans and specifications,  located within the State of West Virginia.  The design of the architectural, structural, mechanical, electrical, civil, or other engineering features of the project shall be accomplished or reviewed and approved by architects or engineers registered in the State of West Virginia to practice in the particular professional field involved.  Participation by architects, engineers, consultants and subcontractors located within the State of West Virginia is encouraged.

Participation by small, small-disadvantaged, HUBZone small businesses, small woman-owned businesses, veteran-owned businesses, and service disabled veteran-owned small businesses is encouraged.  The Offerors included in Phase Two will be required to submit a subcontracting plan for this procurement regarding the utilization of small, small-disadvantaged, small woman-owned, veteran-owned small businesses, and service disabled veteran-owned small businesses.  

The FBOP will be utilizing two-phase Design-Build selection procedures.  This notice is not a request for proposals.  Interested offerors may request and obtain a Phase One solicitation of the two phase process, distributed solely through the General Services Administration’s Federal Business Opportunities web site http://www.fedbizopps.gov.  Hard copies of the Phase One solicitations will not be available.  The web site provides downloading instructions.  All future information regarding this acquisition, including solicitation amendments, will also be distributed solely through this web site.  Interested parties are responsible for monitoring the web site to ensure they have the most up-to-date information regarding this acquisition.  Phase One solicitations will be issued on or about April 16, 2003.  The Phase One proposal due date will be identified in the Phase One Solicitation.  The Phase One solicitation will provide the scope of work,  evaluation factors including:  Past Performance (Sub-factors: Past  Performance Quality Assurance and Quality Control, Relevance of Past Performance, Demonstrated Commitment of Team Members and Key Personnel, and Performance Problems), Capability to Perform, Specialized Experience and Technical Competence and Technical Approach and submission information for interested Design-Build firms to prepare their Phase One qualification proposals.  Phase One qualification proposals will be evaluated to determine which firms will be selected as offerors for Phase Two.  Phase Two participants will submit competitive past performance, technical, small business and price proposals as defined in the Phase Two solicitation.  The Phase Two evaluation factors (Past Performance Sub-factors: Past Performance Quality Assurance and Quality Control, Relevance of Past Performance, Demonstrated Commitment of Team Members and Key Personnel, and Performance Problems);  Preliminary Design and Proposed Technical Solutions;  Proposed Organization and Key Personnel, Consultants and Subcontractors;  Management and Scheduling Approach;  Small Business Subcontracting;  Plan for Quality Assurance and Quality Control)  are significantly more important than Price, however, as proposals become more equal, price becomes more important and may be a determining factor for award.  Additional or Bonus points may be awarded for Technical, Past Performance, and/or Small Disadvantaged Business Utilization proposals.

<DESC>MODIFICATION TO SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE POSTED ON 02/21/03.  THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH (NIH) is conducting a market survey to determine the availability and potential technical capability of small businesses to provide all management, supervision, administration, and labor for the administrative support of specific extramural research programs at the NIH.  For the purposes of this survey, this includes 1) Grants management support services (e.g., administrative and logistical support, file management, IMPAC II and other data management), 2) support for review of grants and R&D contracts (e.g., administrative support, IMPAC II and other data management, meeting logistics, internal receipt and referral, processing of assigned applications and proposals, and document processing and preparation), and 3) program technical support services (e.g., administrative support, logistical support for conferences and workshops, IMPAC II and other data management, other related support, and support for scientific and technical activities) to Program management.  Services are to be provided to the NIH Bethesda campus, other locations in Montgomery County, Maryland and Research Triangle Park, North Carolina. It is noted that these extramural activities support services are currently performed by Government and contract employees providing support to the NIH extramural research programs, estimated at $20 billion annually.  The acquisition will be for one (1) 12-month period with four (4) 12 month options and will comply with the OMB Circular A-76 in effect at the time the solicitation is issued. The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code assigned to this procurement is 561110, Administrative Services, with a size standard of an average annual receipts of $6.0M over the last 3 years.  The Performance Work Statement (PWS) for this effort, available for reference purposes, was posted in Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) on 04/22/03 under Reference Number ZG-RW and the Final PWS 0201 is accessible under the Final PWS posted in FedBizOpps and entitled NIH Extramural Activities Support Services with Attachments located at URL: http://www.nih.gov/od/olao/oa/contracts/GrantsMgmt2/.  Modification 02 posted in FedBizOpps on 04/22/03 under this reference number contains relevant schedules for this procurement. It should be noted that the NIH will synopsize  this procurement as a full and open competition through Solicitation Notice 263-03-P(GK)-0059; however, the Government reserves the right to convert the full and open procurement strategy to a small business set-aside, should results of this market survey demonstrate that small business set-aside criteria is met.  THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AT THIS TIME. This request for capability information does not constitute a request for proposals and submission of any information in response to this market survey is purely voluntary; the Government assumes no financial responsibility for any costs incurred.  If your organization has the potential capacity to perform these contract services, please provide the following information: 1) Organization name, address, email address, Web site address and telephone number as well as size and type of ownership for the organization, i.e., small business, Small Disadvantaged Business, 8(a), woman-owned, Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) concern, Veteran, and or Service-disabled Veteran; and 2) Tailored capability statements addressing the particulars of this effort, with appropriate documentation supporting claims of organizational and staff capability. Organizations responding to this market survey should keep in mind that only focused and pertinent information is requested. If significant subcontracting or teaming is anticipated in order to deliver technical capability, organizations should address the administrative and management structure of such arrangements to demonstrate that small business prime contractors can maintain labor, technical, and management control of the project, meeting the “limitations on subcontracting” imposed on small business set-asides. Taking into account the magnitude of the scope of this effort, organizations also should address the capacity of their financial infrastructure to deliver contract performance. Although no geographic restriction is anticipated, if responding organizations are located outside the Washington Metropolitan area, indicate how the organization would coordinate with the agency program office to provide support to multiple sites. The Government will evaluate the capability information using the following criteria: 1) potential technical capability to provide the administrative support services consistent in scope and scale with those described in this notice; 2) potential capacity to secure and apply the full range of corporate financial, human capital, and technical resources required to successfully perform similar requirements; 3) potential capability to implement a successful project management plan that includes: compliance with tight program schedules; cost containment; meeting and tracking performance; hiring and retention of key personnel; and risk mitigation; and 4) potential to provide services under a performance based service acquisition contract.  Interested firms responding to this survey are encouraged to structure capability statements in the order of the area of consideration noted above.  Responding firms should provide three (3) copies of a tailored  capability statement to the above noted address within ten (10) business days from the date of publication of this notice. This market survey is being conducted through the FedBizOpps to reach the widest possible audience and to gather current market information. This survey is subsequent to an initial survey posted in FedBizOps on 02/21/03 under the same reference number.  Firms that have submitted general capability information in response to the initial sources sought notice, are also invited to resubmit their capability statement or to submit additional information to best reflect their capability as it relates to the requirement information contained in this notice.

<DESC>The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) is conducting a Sources Sought/Market Survey to locate Small Businesses, HUBZone, and/or 8a firms under NAICS Code 541611, capable of providing services to develop Health Workforce Profiles of Border Counties.

The effort will include development of a health professional database from secondary data, describing and analyzing the data, and preparing a final report.  It will be necessary to define the border health workforce infrastructure, including safety-net facilities, while describing who and what constitutes the health workforce in the 50 border counties (including those in CA, TX, NM, AZ, and FL).  In addition, the 239 counties covered by the Health Education Tracing Center (HETC) program should also be fully characterized. 

An understanding of the training and professional duties of major health professions (including physicians, non-physician providers, registered nurses, and dentists) is instrumental in thorough data assimilation and analysis. Calculation of factors influencing the supply of, and demand for, major health professions will be required to adequately characterize the border health workforce in the context of population characteristics and potential shortages of health professionals in the border and HETC counties.

Information sent should be relevant and specific, addressing the following tasks: 1) Examine the border health workforce and relevant population characteristics by county; 2) Define the border health workforce infrastructure; 3) Define what constitutes the border health workforce: 4) Describe the Border/HETC county population characteristics; 5) Identify and describe the health status of the population within the Border/HETC counties, and 6) Prepare a final report that analyzes and describes the workforce issues and infrastructure surrounding the health workforce in the Border/HETC counties and creates a database with the study data.  

Interested organizations should submit their capability statements demonstrating their capability to perform this work.  Understanding and experience in studying the health care workforce and how the workforce impacts the health status of the population is critical.  Interested organizations must demonstrate and document, in any capability statements submitted, extensive experience with, and the ability to perform, the above tasks.  Organizations should demonstrate capability to administer and coordinate interrelated tasks in an effective and timely manner.  Documentation may include, but not be limited to, both Government and commercial contracts, providing references (with Names, telephone numbers, and email address) and any other information serving to document the organization's capability.

The Government anticipates awarding a twelve-month contract.  This is not a Request for Proposals and does not commit the Government to award a contract now or in the future.  Your submission must be received in this office by 3:00 PM on May 12, 2003, by surface mail, email or fax at the following address:  HHS/HRSA;  Attn:  Anne McFarlane;  5600 Fishers Lane, Room 13A19;  Rockville, MD 20857;  Tel (301) 443-5131;  Fax (301) 443-5462;  amcfarlane@hrsa.gov.

<DESC>The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) is soliciting information from air particle collector, biological sensor, and taggant technology firms and other interested parties on technology available for providing an affordable approach to use these technologies in the detection and tracking of biological aerosol agents.  Air particle collectors, biosensors, and taggants will become integral parts of a Biological Combat Assessment System (BCAS) Advanced Concept Technology Demonstration (ACTD) planned to begin in FY04.  The ACTD schedule and milestones will be to integrate, test, and demonstrate a remote, point-sample collection system in the second quarter of FY05, and a remote, point-sample collection and identification system in second quarter of FY07.  This ACTD will culminate in FY07 in a technology demonstration of a near real-time collection, detection, identification, tracking and characterization system for biological aerosol agents released during counterforce strikes against Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) targets.  Sustainment of the residual assets produced during the ACTD and requisite training for operational personnel will follow in FY08 and FY09.  


Government sponsorship of the BCAS ACTD includes the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA), the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD), and the U. S. Pacific Command (PACOM).  The objective of this Sources Sought is to identify air particle collector, biological sensor, and taggant technological concepts and performance potentials for the BCAS ACTD, which may also be used as the basis for developing the BCAS ACTD performance specification.  This specification may subsequently be provided to industry as part of the anticipated BCAS ACTD solicitation. 

The BCAS ACTD will demonstrate the capability for combat assessment of counterforce strikes against biological weapon production and storage facilities.  The desired combat assessment system will utilize air particle collectors to concentrate samples, and biological sensors for detection and identification of biological agents that are released in a counterforce strike.  The anticipated maximum payload weight threshold for the combination of an air particle collector and biological sensor is less than 20 pounds.  Taggants will be used to facilitate standoff post-strike plume tracking and plume characterization.  The taggants will be incorporated in the strike weapon, to be released upon detonation.  Once released, the taggant must co-migrate with the post-strike plume to facilitate standoff post-strike tracking and characterization.

Key performance parameters for the BCAS ACTD air particle collectors include but are not limited to: (a) the capability to selectively collect and concentrate particles 1-10 microns in size; (b) compatibility with prolonged exposure to operational temperatures from 10°F to 100°F and humidity from 0-100%; (c) compatibility with harsh operating conditions including dust, dirt and cloud debris; and (d) full automation and compatibility with continuous, remote operations. 

Key performance parameters for the BCAS ACTD point sensors include but are not limited to: (a) the capability to detect and identify bacteria, viruses and toxins including B. anthracis, variola, plague, botulinum toxin, and ricin; (b) the sensitivity to detect and reliably quantify Biological Warfare (BW) agents in the 1000 CFU or particle per milliliter, or the 10,000 PFU per milliliter range; (c) the capability to detect BW agents within 45 minutes; (d) a false positive rate of less than 0.1% for the initial detection in the presence of non-BW microbes, dust, smoke, pollen and dirt; (e) full automation and compatibility with continuous, remote operations; (f) compatibility with prolonged exposure to operational temperatures from 10°F to 100°F and humidity from 0-100%; and (g) be adaptable to meet the changing BW threats. 

Key performance parameters for the BCAS ACTD taggant technology include, but are not limited to: (a) the ability to withstand the detonation pressures (225-300 kilobars) and temperatures (2000-2400 degrees Celsius) of typical military high explosives; (b) be compatible with, and have no adverse effect on the performance or certification/qualification of MK-84, BLU-109, and BLU-116 warheads deployed within the Air Force and Navy; and (c) be detected from standoff infrared or other sensors at a minimum height of 15,000 ft MSL (mean sea level) and a minimum slant range of 16,400 ft out to approximately 49,000 ft.  Additionally, respondents shall identify and discuss any toxicity and/or carcinogenic effects associated with their taggant concept, pre- and post warhead detonations. 

This Sources Sought solicits the identification of appropriate technologies and technical capabilities for the development of the ACTD program plan.  Respondents to this Sources Sought may choose to address the air particle collector technology, the biological point sensor technology, the taggant technology, or any combination thereof.  Maturity and risk level of the supporting technologies should be addressed; however, concepts that require significant basic research (TRL 1-4) are not desired.  Additionally,  respondents should provide Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) cost estimates, based on the assumption that the ACTD go-ahead will be in July 2003 for an October 2003 start. 

Responses shall be limited to no more than 10 pages plus no more than a four (4) page addendum, not including cover letter, cover page, and table of contents.  If the material provided contains proprietary information, please mark and identify disposition instructions (submitted data will not be returned).  The response should include, but is not limited to, the following: (a) system concept(s) and associated performance, cost, and risk parameters; (b) ROM estimate with respondent's stated assumptions; (c) technology maturity and Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs); (d) any other technical information respondents deem necessary to aid the government in making an informed assessment.  Cost information provided should include basis of estimate substantiation.  It is the Government's intention to review the data and possibly schedule a briefing with the respondents to gain further insight.   Responses shall be submitted no later than 4pm EDT on 15 June 2003 to Defense Threat Reduction Agency, Biological Combat Assessment System ACTD RFI, Attn: Cynthia Sanders, ALT (703) 325-9210, 8725 John J Kingman Rd, MSC 6201, Fort Belvoir, VA 22060-6201.  Electronic responses are recommended and encouraged and should be submitted to Ms. Sanders at cynthia.sanders@dtra.mil.  If providing information electronically, please ensure that the information is compatible with and accessible using Microsoft Office 97 software.  

Additional Information: Unless otherwise stated herein, no additional information is available.  Requests for the same will be disregarded.  There is no commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation, to make an award or awards, or to be responsible for any monies expended by any interested parties in support of any effort in response to this Sources Sought. Information provided herein is subject to change and in no way binds the Government to solicit or award a contract.  If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities website located at www.fedbizops.gov.  It is the potential offerors’ responsibility to monitor this site for the release of any follow-on information.

<ARCHDATE>07152003
<CONTACT>Major Richard Prieve, (781) 377-5845, Program Manager, and Mr. Neil Miller, Contracting Officer
<DESC>This is not a solicitation, but market research to determine potential sources.  The Force Protection Command and Control Systems Program Office wishes to identify potential sources for a Mobile Detection Assessment System (MDAS).  The MDAS should provide all weather, all terrain, wide area (360 degrees) capability to detect, track, and assess intrusions in open areas.  It should detect and assess during both day and night, without artificial lighting, and detect and assess in atmospheres containing fog, smoke, haze, dust, and clear air.  Detection and assessment ranges for this sensor should vary depending on the application:   Flight lines and Weapon Storage Areas:  (a) Walking/Running, 500 meters threshold, 1000 meters objective; (b) Crawling, 250 meters threshold, 500 meters objective; and (c) Vehicles, 1000 meters threshold, 5,000 meters objective.  Assessment 500 meters threshold, 1000 meters objective.  Launch Facilities and Austere Bases: (a) Walking/Running, 1000 meters threshold, 5000 meters objective; (b) Crawling, 250 meters threshold, 750 meters objective; and (c) Vehicles, 5000 meters threshold, 10,000 meters objective.  Assessment 2500 meters threshold, 5000 meters objective.  Convoy Operations:  (a) Walking/Running, 250 meters threshold, 500 meters objective; (b) Crawling, 150 meters threshold, 250 meters objective; and (c) Vehicles, 1000 meters threshold, 5,000 meters objective in addition the detection must be achieved while vehicle is in motion. Assessment 1000 meters threshold, 5000 meters objective.  All detections should include the following criteria:  The sensor should localize target range within ten meters and azimuth within ten degrees.  It should provide the capability for area masking.  False alarm rates should be less than three per 24 hours and less than two nuisance alarms per hour.  The MDAS can be commercial or battery powered with an objective of charging the battery via solar, on board vehicle system, or other means of independent power.  Remote and redundant annunciation will be necessary in all applications with some distances to exceed 320 km from MDAS to command and control station.  Built in lethal and or non lethal response is an objective but no threshold has been established at this time.  Interested sources should respond by providing evidence of experience in accomplishing the scope of work indicated and a plan for producing testable prototypes.  The Government will assess prospective sources' potential based on the qualification packages provided.  Firms considered by the Government to be most highly competitive to design and provide the MDAS will be contacted by the PCO and a list of such firms will be made available on the Hanscom Electronic RFP Bulletin Board (HERBB).  Firms considered by the Government not to be most highly competitive to design and provide a MDAS will be afforded an opportunity to receive the Government's rationale and provide additional information. Therefore, if the number of sources that identify themselves in response to this sources sought prove to be excessive, the Government may decide to conduct a pre-qualification effort in order to realize a manageable number of firms deemed most highly competitive to perform this effort.  Any interested source initially judged as not most highly competitive, will be provided a copy of the solicitation upon request, should one be issued, and any offer submitted by such a firm would be evaluated without prejudice.  Firms who respond to this notice are requested to identify any on-going Government contract vehicles they have for the same or similar work; include the name and number of the on-going contract, contract scope, contract type, period of performance, contract deliverables, dollar thresholds and limitations, issuing Government agency, and name and telephone number of the Government point of contact (preferably the Contracting Officer).  Should it be in the best interests of the Government and within the scope of an on-going contract, the Government reserves the right to satisfy its requirements under such contract. Firms should indicate whether they are a large business, small business, small disadvantaged business, 8(a) concern, women-owned small business, whether they qualify as socially or economically disadvantaged, and whether they are a U.S. or foreign-owned firm.  Please note that the HERBB will be the primary source of information for this acquisition. Interested parties should check for updates frequently and subscribe to the HERBB update service for the "Mobile Detection Assessment System". Interested potential sources should respond to the above screening criteria, in writing, by 15 June 2003 to ESC/FD, 5 Eglin Street, Building 1624 1st Floor, Hanscom AFB MA 01731-2100, Attn: Mr. Neil Miller. Responses should not exceed 10 one-sided 8 1/2"x11"pages.  This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) nor does its issuance restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach.  The Government will not reimburse the contractor for any cost associated with preparing or submitting a response to this notice.

<DESC>Lake Tahoe basin is considered a national treasure and therefore the subject of legislation, research, and management in order to restore the lake’s ecosystem.  Watershed management concerns in the Lake Tahoe basin focus on the preservation of water clarity in the lake. Increased loading rates of nutrients and sediments into the lake are reducing water clarity and are associated with alterations in the landscape surrounding Lake Tahoe. The majority of wetlands in the Lake Tahoe basin have been degraded or destroyed.  Disturbances within Tallac Watershed include timber harvest, road construction, livestock grazing, and recreational use. The cumulative effects on natural resources have caused a decline in riparian and aquatic ecosystems as well as ecological processes and functions.  In order to achieve management goals for this watershed, the USDA Forest Service (USFS), Lake Tahoe Basin Management Unit (LTBMU) proposes to conduct a thorough ecosystem assessment and restoration plan to determine needed management direction.

The USFS, LTBMU is seeking SF-254s and SF-255s from qualified consultants to provide professional services for the development of a comprehensive ecosystem assessment of Tallac, Spring, and Taylor Creek watersheds, development of a restoration plan, and design of identified restoration projects. The project area is located in El Dorado County in the southwest portion of the Lake Tahoe Basin and is accessible from US Highway 89.  Tallac, Spring, and Taylor Creek Watersheds encompass a total of approximately 5.6 square miles (3,584 acres)(Figure 1).  The drainage area for Tallac and Spring Creek is 4.5 square miles with a channel length of 3.66 miles. Spring Creek connects with middle reach of Tallac Creek at 753362 N 4312204 E. Elevations range from 6,235 feet at the mouth of Tallac creek to 8,120 feet at the headwaters of Spring Creek. Maximum elevation of the Tallac drainage area is 9,735 feet. Taylor Creek is adjacent to Tallac Creek and is approximately 1.5 miles. The range of elevation for the channel is from 6,320 to 7,960 feet. The majority of the project site is located on Forest Service land excluding a small parcel of private land.  Vegetation within the project site includes annual and perennial grasses, sedges and rushes, aspens, deciduous shrubs, conifers, and Tahoe Yellow Cress, a threatened species.  

The main components of this project are: 1. Geomorphology - 
Geologic and geomorphic analysis of Tallac, Spring, and Taylor Creek Watersheds - 
describe watershed morphological characteristics created by climate, glaciation, faulting, landslides, land management etc. that impose physical controls on the geomorphic function of the ecosystem  - determine the pre-Euro-settlement, pre-Comstock, and pre-fire-suppression conditions and the natural processes related to these conditions - Time series aerial photo analysis of watershed changes from 1939 to present - analyze channel dimension and pattern, sediment transport dynamics, reaction of watershed to floods of record, etc -  Fluvial geomorphology analysis - describe system stability under current climatic regime - determine channel configurations/channel types & floodplain/floodprone configurations, channel bar and streambank size and shapes  -determine floodplain connectivity - determine aquatic habitat types - 
determine the range of variability in channel dimension, pattern, and profile under the full range of discharges, describe current sediment and nutrient transport dynamics, etc. 
2.Hydrology - Hydrologic Analysis to: determine hydrologic characteristics including drainage pattern, precipitation patterns, average annual flow rates, mean hydrograph, etc. - perform flood frequency analysis and discuss impact of peak flows on the landscape - 
estimate flood magnitude for rain, snow, and rain-on-snow events- 
determine the influence of ground water, surface flow, and lake level on wetland ecosystems - Time series aerial photo analysis of watershed changes from 1939 to present - determine the historic connectivity between the watersheds, the hydrologic changes, and the natural or human induced causes for the changes through time
3.Limnology - Investigation of aquatic chemistry - determine seasonal and annual water quality characteristics within Tallac Wetland - Hydrogeomorphic classification and analysis of Tallac Wetland - develop a functional profile that describes the physical, chemical, and biological characteristics - identify which functions are most likely to be performed, and discusses different ecosystem and landscape attributes that influence each function  - Integrated Benthic Index to establish aquatic biological function as an indicator of watershed health, for use as a baseline for future monitoring of watershed ecosystem recovery
4.Forest Health - Assessment of stand dynamics (health, structure, species composition) -Compilation of historic aerial photography, ground photography and historic documentation of forest conditions - Logging History - document the spatial and temporal account of logging activities - assess historic logging methodologies and objectives and their impacts on stand dynamics (health, structure, species composition) - assess logging impacts on large wood recruitment to the fluvial system - Assessment of fire fuels conditions (stand density, pathology, mortality)
5.Soils and Vegetation - Compilation of latest available information on watershed soils - Compilation of latest available information on watershed vegetation -  
assess vegetative composition including noxious weeds and other non-native species and all existing data on rare and sensitive species - Aerial photograph time series analysis depicting the alteration of vegetation within Tallac Wetland
6.Fire History - Assessment of the pre-human-disturbance fire regime - History of fire as a management tool - Impacts of fire exclusion on ecosystem processes - Effects of fire on aspen stands and other SEZ vegetation
7.Wildlife Inventory, Dynamics, and Habitat - Collection of all existing data (BE/BAs) that will support planning of future restoration projects in the watershed - Assessment of primary wildlife habitat types and functional processes that maintain dynamic equilibrium in species abundance and diversityQualitative analysis of terrestrial and aquatic species communities’ interrelationships with each other and their habitats and how those interrelationships have been affected by human disturbance - Assessment of beaver activity and its fluvial geomorphic and biological role in the ecosystem

The Lake Tahoe Basin is one of this country’s most unique ecosystems. The Lake Tahoe Basin has become one of the most intensively studied and managed landscapes in the nation. The United States Congress has passed legislation and provided funding to support a massive interstate and interagency effort to restore and maintain this invaluable resource.
The USDA Forest Service, Lake Tahoe Basin Management Unit (LTBMU) is working cooperatively with other land management and regulatory agencies and the public to systematically identify and prioritize restoration opportunities in the Basin. It is the LTBMU’s goal to conduct comprehensive ecosystem assessments of Basin sub watersheds, and from the knowledge gained in those assessments, develop restoration plans that achieve the greatest balance between healthy, diverse natural ecosystems and the human activities they support.
The LTBMU is seeking SF-254s and SF-255s from qualified consultants to provide professional services for a comprehensive ecosystem assessment and long-range restoration plan for the Meeks Creek watershed. The project area is located in El Dorado County on the west shore of Lake Tahoe and is accessible from US Highway 89, thirteen miles north from the city of South Lake Tahoe (Figure 1).
PROJECT SITE DESCRIPTION
The Meeks Creek watershed covers 8.8 square miles. It is a narrow, glaciated watershed approximately seven miles long. Underlying bedrock is primarily granodiorite of the Sierra Nevada Batholith. The upper two thirds of the watershed lies within the Desolation Wilderness. The lower one third of the watershed was inundated by lake level rises of the Pleistocene era. This once inundated portion of the watershed is now characterized by a wide, flat valley bottom formed by deposition of sediments into the historic bay. There are several lakes in the upper watershed within the wilderness boundary. Elevations range from 6230 feet at Lake Tahoe to 9300 feet at the headwaters. About ninety five percent of the watershed is under Forest Service ownership with about five percent, near the lake, under mixed ownership.
The main components of this project are: 1. Geomorphology - 
Geologic and geomorphic analysis describe watershed morphological characteristics created by climate, glaciation, faulting, landslides, land management etc. that impose physical controls on the geomorphic function of the ecosystem  - determine the pre-Euro-settlement, pre-Comstock, and pre-fire-suppression conditions and the natural processes related to these conditions - Time series aerial photo analysis of watershed changes from 1939 to present - analyze channel dimension and pattern, sediment transport dynamics, reaction of watershed to floods of record, etc -  Fluvial geomorphology analysis - describe system stability under current climatic regime - General watershed hydrology and channel hydraulics.  Determine the influence of groundwater, surface flow, and lake level on wetland function
2.  Limnology
Bathymetric survey of lagoon/marina.
Conceptualization of departure from pre-human-disturbance bathymetry.
Investigation of aquatic chemistry. 
Estimates of diurnal, seasonal, and annual nutrient flux from marina to lake.
Inventory and assessment of marina aquatic biology.
Assessment of lagoon/marina sediment and water column contamination, biological availability and potential mobility of contaminants.
Hydrogeomorphic classification to determine wetland physical, chemical, and biological function and relationships to ecosystem and landscape processes.
Integrated Benthic Index to establish aquatic biological function as an indicator of watershed health, for use as a baseline for future monitoring of watershed ecosystem recovery
3.Forest Health - Assessment of stand dynamics (health, structure, species composition) -Compilation of historic aerial photography, ground photography and historic documentation of forest conditions - Logging History - document the spatial and temporal account of logging activities - assess historic logging methodologies and objectives and their impacts on stand dynamics (health, structure, species composition) - assess logging impacts on large wood recruitment to the fluvial system - Assessment of fire fuels conditions (stand density, pathology, mortality)
4. Soils and Vegetation
¨  Compilation of latest available information on watershed soils
¨  Compilation of latest available information on watershed vegetation (including all existing data on rare and sensitive species)

5.Fire History - Assessment of the pre-human-disturbance fire regime - History of fire as a management tool - Impacts of fire exclusion on ecosystem processes - 
6.Wildlife Inventory, Dynamics, and Habitat - Collection of all existing data (BE/BAs) that will support planning of future restoration projects in the watershed - Assessment of primary wildlife habitat types and functional processes that maintain dynamic equilibrium in species abundance and diversity Qualitative analysis of terrestrial and aquatic species communities’ interrelationships with each other and their habitats and how those interrelationships have been affected by human disturbance - Assessment of beaver activity and its fluvial geomorphic and biological role in the ecosystem - Human Infrastructure – Transportation - Supplementary to a general inventory of transportation infrastructure, a focused assessment of the HWY 89 bridge and its impact on fluvial geomorphic function and ecosystem processes.
-Utilities, -Land Ownership, -Recreation --A thorough account of current and traditional recreation activities connected to the watershed, an overview of planned recreation developments, a detailed accounting of the Forest Service special use permit for the Meeks Bay Marina (cost/benefit analysis of the permit, public interest in marina operations, risk assessment of operation changes and/or improvements). -Cultural Interests --Compilation of all existing information on Heritage Resources that will support future planning of restoration projects in the watershed.  Thorough description of the Washoe Tribe’s goals for desired conditions

7. RESTORATION PLAN - A thorough description of desired conditions developed through analysis of pre-human-disturbance conditions and interaction with watershed stakeholders during the Ecosystem Assessment - A long-range restoration plan that will achieve desired conditions established in the Ecosystem Assessment - A set of proposed actions that meet the goals of the long-range restoration plan - Technical documentation that justifies and supports proposed actions and selected alternatives in the NEPA process -  Cost/benefit analyses of proposed actions, alternatives to proposed actions (either generated in the NEPA process or identified by LTBMU Restoration Staff), and no action alternatives that assist the LTBMU Forest Supervisor in making informed management decisions -Biddable, certified-engineer-stamped designs and specifications for selected restoration projects.

<DESC>The Marine Corps Systems Command (MCSC) intends to augment their existing pool of technical and analytical services contractors for FY04.  Both existing vendors and new vendors will be provided with the opportunity to participate in the Command’s Commercial Enterprise Omnibus support services (CEOss) business model, established in August 2002.   To date, $50 million in task order awards have been accomplished, with an average value of $725 thousand.  CEOss is predicated upon Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 8.404(b)(4), which authorizes agencies to issue Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs) with Federal Supply Service (FSS) contractors.  Twenty-two competitively awarded BPAs have been established with contractors using approved FSS schedules aligned with four (4) competency-based domains.  MCSC is conducting a CEOss Open Season to allow current prime contractors to (1) reorganize their teams and (2) add additional CEOss prime vendors to the Business and Analytical (BA) and Specialty Engineering (SE) Domains.  Only one (1) small business team is expected to be added to the BA domain, and no more than four (4) firms of unrestricted size added to the SE Domain.

CEOss Background Information:  Individual Task Orders are competitively awarded to BPA contractors within their respective domains.   There is no maximum dollar limitation on any task order, nor any minimum order amount assigned to the BPAs.  The CEOss model relies exclusively on paperless, e-commerce transactional processes.  There are four (4) domains within the CEOss model:  Specialty Engineering, Business and Analytical, Engineering and Scientific, and Acquisition, Logistics and Administrative.  Vendors are required to identify the domain for which they would like to be considered for a prime BPA.  To be selected for the Specialty Engineering domain, vendors must have one of the following GSA schedules:  874 – MOBIS, 871 – Engineering Services, 899 – Environmental Services, 70- IT Services and Support, 873 – Lab Testing and Analysis.  To be selected for the Business and Analytical domain, vendors must have one of the following GSA Schedules:  874 – MOBIS, 872 – Financial Management Services, 69 – Training Services.  Although vendors may receive a prime BPA award in only one of the four domains, teaming and subcontracting relationships within the domains are unrestricted.

Instructions for new CEOss applicants:  To be considered for a CEOss prime BPA, interested vendors should submit the following information NLT 16 June 2003:   A capabilities statement, limited to five (5) pages that identifies capabilities within the domain of prime interest (BA or SE);   a copy of the applicable GSA Schedule, and general marketing information.

<SUBJECT>A -- NINDS Pilot Clinical Trials Network
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-RFI-NOT-03-008

<DESC>The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) is seeking information that may be used to help develop specifications for a network for pilot clinical trials and those organizations that might be capabilities to conduct such an effort.  NINDS is seeking input about the technical expertise required and available to create and operate an efficient network, as well as input into its specific structure.

Background

Recent progress in neuroscience has led to an explosion in potential pharmacological interventions for neurological diseases that require testing in clinical trials.  NINDS is supporting initiatives for drug screening and pre-clinical testing (http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PAR-02-139.html).  However, many interventions may never reach early phase clinical trials.  There are several barriers to entry for pilot clinical trials, including issues of competing interventions, infrastructure and funding, access to patient populations, lack of experienced clinical investigators, and inadequate communication between pre-clinical and clinical researchers.  The goal of this project is to ensure that potential treatments are tested in pilot clinical trials in a timely and efficient way by developing a network of sites and a coordinating center that could implement trials for different neurological diseases.  The trials conducted by this network would be studies that are needed to determine if further clinical testing of the intervention is warranted.  The proposed network will be a resource for investigators to test promising new agents that result from pre-clinical translational research efforts. 

The overall objective of the network is to facilitate the timely transition from pre-clinical to clinical studies.  Within the network, hundreds of academic-based and practice-based centers would be pre-qualified, based on simple criteria, to participate in pilot trials for one or more diseases.  The goal is to have broad participation and representation of different populations and diseases to limit the barriers for sites to enter the network.  New sites would be invited to apply to be added to the network at regular intervals.  Sites would be maintained in the network at minimal cost, then compete to participate in specific fully funded studies as the need arises.  Each year, the network will potentially start two or more pilot studies.  There will be a single coordinating center that will work with investigators to develop protocols, consent documents and case report forms, facilitate compliance with regulatory requirements, train and monitor study sites, and perform data management and analysis, and coordinate all aspects of the network.  It is anticipated that the network will perform studies in disease areas in which few if any previous clinical trials have been performed.  Thus, substantial flexibility and intellectual leadership – clinical and statistical – will be required on the part of the coordinating center.  The selection of particular interventions for study will be performed by a steering committee comprised of NIH staff and scientists independent of the centers in the network.  Participation in the network will not replace existing grants or contracts to perform clinical studies, nor should it discourage independent investigators or existing networks or cooperative groups from applying for funding.  The network will expedite clinical testing for select, high priority agents and provide clinical trials infrastructure where needed.

The major aims of the network are:

1.	to facilitate the transfer of pre-clinical research results to clinical trials.
2.	to minimize the cost of the infrastructure by building a network for several disease areas.
3.	to make study of rare neurological diseases economically feasible
4.	to expedite recruitment of subjects.
5.	to involve a wide spectrum of investigators .
6.	to recruit a broad range of participants, particularly minorities.
7.	to make participation in NINDS clinical research more accessible to patients.

These aims must be achieved while maintaining the highest ethical standards in human subject research, setting a benchmark for the entire neurology research community.

Information Requested

Information in the areas listed below will aid in the design of a solicitation to establish and operate the network.  We request that interested organizations identify their technical expertise and resources, and capabilities and describe their availability to conduct such an endeavor. 

1.	Design and structure of the network

a.	What are the major essential components of the network?  What expertise, capabilities, and levels of effort are required for each of the network centers and for the coordinating center?
b.	Should the network included centers capable of performing phase I studies in healthy subjects?
c.	What are the barriers to participation of neurological disease treatment centers in this endeavor?
d.	What steps (or phases) are necessary for initiation of the network?  What is the proposed timeline?
e.	What should the criteria be for selecting treatments to be studied in this network and how should this selection process be organized?
f.	How can outreach and recruitment of children, women, and minority participants be implemented?
g.	How can outreach and recruitment of uncommon disease populations be implemented?
h.	What low-cost effort would sustain the capability of centers in the network to compete for the opportunity to participate in studies when the opportunity arises?
i.	Only a small fraction of centers would ever participate in any trials.  What benefits would there be for the network centers that do not successfully compete to participate in trials sponsored by NINDS?  

2.	Subcontract Award and Management

The pilot trial network may involve hundreds of investigators funded through small awards issued by the contractor as subcontracts.  Describe the personnel and database requirements associated with awarding and managing multiple subcontracts, including quality control procedures, and research support services.

3.	Program Management and Evaluation

Initiating the network will be a complex and multifaceted process.  The contractor will additionally be required to evaluate the progress of the subcontracted research and of the efficiency of the network.

a.	Describe your experience with strategic planning and initiation of comparably complex projects.

b.	Describe the technical, medical, and clinical methodological expertise that you possess that is necessary for the design, operation, and maintenance for the network.

c.	Describe how you would evaluate the overall performance of the network at each stage of its development.

d.	Describe your resources for organizing training and planning sessions for the investigators.

4.	Personnel

For the following, assume that at any time several hundred network centers would be qualified in one or more disease areas and that one or two 30-100 patient early to middle development studies would be started per year, each study to last 2 years or less.  The number of centers to participate would vary widely depending on the scarcity of patients.  The costs at each center would have to vary based on the number of patients they could be expected to provide.  

Provide an assessment of the number and mix of personnel required to create and operate the network and the approximate level of effort required, broken down by its major components.

This Request for Information is for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the Government.  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of the responses nor otherwise pay for the preparation of any information submitted or the Government’s use of such information.  Respondents will not be notified of the Government’s evaluation of the information received.  Should a proposed solicitation materialize, no basis for claims against the Government shall arise as a result of a response to this request for information or the Government’s use of such information as either part of our evaluation process or in developing specifications for any subsequent requirement.  Responses will be held in a confidential manner.  Any proprietary information should be so indicated.

Project Title: Integrating ECR Evaluation Results into Practice

This is an announcement that the U.S. Institute for Environmental Conflict Resolution (the U.S. Institute) is soliciting quotations from qualified professionals to analyze and interpret evaluation data for environmental collaborative problem-solving and conflict resolution (ECR) cases.  Part of the effort will involve aggregate quantitative and qualitative analysis of new evaluation data and part will involve comparing the results of the analysis with findings in the published ECR literature. The goal of this project is to identify the key ingredients of ECR success, and to communicate these findings within the ECR field to improve practice. 

Background

The U.S. Institute for Environmental Conflict Resolution is a federal program established by the U.S. Congress to assist parties in resolving environmental, natural resource, and public lands conflicts. The U.S. Institute serves as an impartial, non-partisan institution providing professional expertise, services, and resources to all parties involved in such disputes.  See www.ecr.gov for more information on the U.S. Institute.

In 1999, the U.S. Institute and the Policy Consensus Initiative (PCI) began an inquiry into the feasibility of developing program evaluation guidance for state and federal agencies that administer public policy and environmental conflict resolution programs. With funds from the Hewlett Foundation, PCI has extended the initial collaboration involving the U.S. Institute, the Massachusetts Office of Dispute Resolution and the Oregon Dispute Resolution Commission (ODRC) to additional states.  At the same time, the U.S. Institute has been working with federal agencies to enlist their cooperation and involvement.  The initial collaborative effort focused on developing a conceptual framework for evaluating ECR programs – a logic model of expected outcomes for each of the agencies’ program areas.  With respect to ECR cases, the logic model identifies necessary practice factors and a set of both process and agreement outcomes.  In addition, specific questionnaires were developed to collect data needed to measure the degree to which the practice factors were in place and the outcomes were achieved.  

The U.S. Institute, ODRC, and the Florida Conflict Resolution Consortium (FCRC) have adopted and are using the same theory of practice model and essentially the same questionnaires to evaluate their cases.  In addition, the U.S. Institute is working with several other federal agencies to evaluate their ECR cases.  This collaborative effort will produce an initial combined excel database collected in a consistent manner for 30 - 40 cases.  Analyzing this aggregate database and interpreting the results should add substantively to the growing body of information from other ECR research and evaluation efforts.
Project Partners 
The partners providing cases or case evaluation data for this study include:
- Oregon Dispute Resolution Commission
- Conflict Prevention and Resolution Center, Environmental Protection Agency
- Office of Collaborative Action and Dispute Resolution, Department of Interior
- Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
- Florida Conflict Resolution Consortium 
- Other state programs with available and compatible data sets.

Overview of the Project Inquiry
The aggregate analysis component of this evaluation effort will use the theory of practice model adopted by the U.S. Institute, ODRC and FCRC as the basis for this inquiry. (An overview of the U.S. Institute’s ECR evaluation system, a list of variables, and a draft ECR evaluation-report template are available under the section “What’s New–Upcoming Events” on the U.S. Institute website at www.ecr.gov.) The primary goal of this evaluation effort is to understand the key ingredients of success (i.e., achieving expected process and agreement outcomes). While exploring and explaining variations in achievement of outcomes, the relationships between variables such as practice factors and specific outcomes will be analyzed. The study results will also review the results from published ECR literature and compare and contrast the findings of the aggregate analysis with the findings in the published literature. Findings will then be framed in terms of learnings for program improvement and ECR practitioner training.

The types of questions to be addressed through this ECR evaluation effort (both the aggregate analysis and the review and synthesis of published ECR literature) include but are not limited to: 
1. What aspects of ECR best practices are most important for collaborative problem-solving and conflict resolution processes to be successful?
2. Which practices need to be employed more effectively by ECR practitioners and program managers? 
3. What is the relationship between the complexity of cases (duration of the controversy, the number of parties, etc.) and the process and agreement outcomes?
4. What is the relationship between the degrees to which best practice factors are employed and whether or not agreement is reached?
5. Which of the services provided by the neutral(s) are most important in determining the parties’ overall satisfaction with the neutral(s) and with the process?
6. Does prior experience of the parties with collaborative processes influence their level of satisfaction with ECR processes?
7. What elements of the process influence participants overall satisfaction with the process?
8. What factors influence the participants’ perspectives on whether the ECR processes are better than any other processes they are aware of?
9. What elements of the agreement (flexibility, parties understanding of the key elements of the agreement, etc.) influence whether the participants feel the agreement will last?
10. To what extent does reaching agreement affect participants’ satisfaction with the process?
11. In cases where full agreement is not reached, what factors influence (positively or negatively) satisfaction with the process?

Required Professional Expertise

It is anticipated that a two- or three-member analysis and review team will be assembled to perform the required tasks (one member may be qualified to perform more than one function and individuals may submit responses for more than one of the described team roles).  The team will reflect the following competencies:  
* Statistical evaluation – a program evaluation expert who is familiar with evaluation in the ECR field, and possesses methodological expertise needed to design and interpret the results of aggregate analyses of case data, and possesses (or has access to) analytical skills needed to conduct such analyses;
* The ECR research – a recognized expert in research on the effectiveness of ECR and public involvement activities, will be thoroughly familiar with the associated literature, and will be able to assess the rigor and generalizability of the findings of both the aggregate case analysis and of other empirical studies; and
* The ECR practice – an experienced facilitator of collaborative planning and problem solving processes and/or a mediator of environmental disputes, who is a recognized leader in the field, and who has the expertise to assess the utility of the evaluation findings to ECR practice.

Individual statements of interest and quotations will be solicited from and individual contracts will be negotiated with each member of the analysis and review team.  The U.S. Institute also encourages interested candidates to identify and assemble a complete team and to submit a combined response. 

PART A: STATISTICAL EVALUATION
Scope of Work
The U.S. Institute is seeking an evaluator with statistical expertise to:
1. Conduct aggregate statistical analysis of ECR case data from several similar data sets.
2. Work with the other members of the review team to distill and interpret key findings from the aggregate analysis and the published results from other ECR studies.
The successful candidate will be responsible for the research design in consultation with the other team members, and the U.S. Institute staff. The candidate will conduct the aggregate case data analysis and address data reliability and validity issues. The candidate will report results in the form of presentation slides as well as a brief written evaluation report. Both report formats should summarize the findings, describe the statistical relationships, interpret the findings of statistical results, in light of the key questions to be addressed and the implications for ECR practice. 
The candidate will work with the other members of the team to review key findings from the aggregate analysis and compare these results with published results from other studies. The candidate will assist the other team members in preparing a draft report of the combined findings for distribution to a broader review group (i.e., approximately 30 practitioners, program managers from state and federal ECR programs, trainers, and researchers). The candidate will present the study findings at a two-day workshop with the broader review group to be held in Tucson (tentatively scheduled for November 20-21, 2003). The candidate will also participate in workshop discussions assisting with the identification and prioritization of significant themes or issues for communication to the field to improve practice.
 
Evaluator Qualifications 
Specific qualifications and expertise sought are listed below: 
- Training and extensive experience in quantitative research methods and statistical analysis (experience with Excel and SPSS preferred).
- Training and experience with program evaluation.
- Familiarity with ECR.
- Ability to work both independently and collaboratively.
- Ability to communicate professionally and effectively, both orally and in writing.
- Available July 2003 – February 2004 to complete project related work and participate in project related activities.
The Contractor will be selected by and contract with the U.S. Institute for Environmental Conflict Resolution. The U.S. Institute will provide project oversight.
 
PART B: Researcher/Practitioner

Scope of Work
The U.S. Institute is seeking two ECR researchers and/or practitioners to help design, organize, and review findings from the aggregate ECR case data analysis (conducted by the team evaluator) and the published results of other ECR studies, state program evaluation efforts, and other recently published research pertinent to improving ECR. 
The successful candidates will be responsible for providing input to the research design for the aggregate ECR case data analysis. The candidates will conduct and compile a literature review of recent evaluation and research findings pertinent to improving ECR.  The candidates will systematically review and synthesize the findings from the aggregate case data analysis and the published results of other studies to distill from this work the key findings on ECR success that will be useful to practitioners and program managers working in the ECR field. The candidates will be responsible for submitting a draft report of findings (including the literature review) to the U.S. Institute for distribution to a broader review group (i.e., approximately 30 practitioners, program managers from state and federal ECR programs, trainers, and researchers). The candidates will also present the preliminary findings at a two-day workshop with the broader review group in Tucson (tentatively scheduled for November 20-21, 2003).

Researcher/Practitioner Qualifications 
Specific qualifications and expertise sought are listed below (note, we are looking for two team members.  Each may have strengths primarily as an ECR researcher with knowledge of ECR practice, or as an ECR practitioner with knowledge of research methods). However, a single candidate with strong credentials as both a researcher and practitioner could qualify for both roles:
- Extensive knowledge of and experience with environmental conflict resolution (ECR) processes, either from a research or practice perspective.
- Familiarity with research methods (an ECR practitioner), or expertise with research methods and familiarity with statistical techniques (an ECR researcher).
- Experience and ability to work both independently and collaboratively.
