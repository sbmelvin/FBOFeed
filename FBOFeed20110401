It is anticipated that this requirement is competitive.  Non-approved sources wishing to submit a bid may do so; however, only qualified sources will be considered for award.  
This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application.  The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined.  Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation, regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small business set aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors).
It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in sub contracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement make contact with the firm listed.

Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. 
Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer
Electronic procedures will be used for this solicitation. Hardcopies of the solicitation will not be sent from this office. The solicitation will be available for download only at www.fbo.gov.

The proposed contract action is for supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one, or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302.  
Note: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Interested parties are invited to call the Ombudsman at (405) 734-8241. DO NOT CALL THIS NUMBER FOR SOLICITATION REQUESTS.
Request for written quotation will be issued.  Only written or faxed request received directly from the requestors are acceptable. The anticipated award date will be 60 days after the issuance of this notice.

<DESC>This notice is posted in its entirety and hereby serves as the official solicitation for this project.  POINT OF CONTACT (POC) FOR THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS SERGIO J. MOLINA. THE ALTERNATE POC IS MARY J. DUNCANSON. SUBMIT QUESTIONS VIA E-MAIL TO:  sergio.j.molina@us.army.mil AND TO: mary.j.duncanson@us.army.mil.  The NAICS code is 541310 "Architectural Services".  The size standard is $4.5 Million.  This action is being undertaken in accordance with the Architectural & Engineering (A-E) provisions of FAR Part 36 and DFARS Part 236.  This announcement is being solicited as a TOTAL SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE for the selection of A-E firms for Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts.  Firms must be capable of concurrently working on and responding to multiple projects.  Selection of firms will not be based upon competitive bidding procedures, but rather upon the professional qualifications necessary for the performance of the required services, as more fully set forth in the selection criteria.  All firms responding to this announcement are given notice that they should review FAR Part 9.5 - Organizational and Consultant Conflicts of Interest and FAR 36.209 - Construction contracts with A-E firms.   <br><br>SCOPE OF SERVICES: The USPFO for Arizona intends to award one (1) or more Firm Fixed-Price (FFP) performance-based A-E IDIQ contract (s), based upon a firm's response to this solicitation and upon the professional qualifications necessary for the performance of the required services.  Each A-E IDIQ contract will be established for a base period of 1 year and up to 4 option years.  Individual task orders will be issued at a minimum value of $1,000.00 within the contract maximum ceiling value of $10, 000,000.00.  FFP Task Orders (TOs) are anticipated to be awarded against the A-E IDIQ contracts.  The Government anticipates that this announcement will result in the minimum award of one (1) contract to provide A-E services at National Guard locations throughout the State of Arizona.  The USPFO for Arizona reserves the right to award more than one A-E IDIQ contract.  By making a submission, the submitting firm acknowledges that a TO may be issued for locations throughout the State of Arizona.  One evaluation factor will be the proximity of a firm's office and its assigned project team and the firm's knowledge of the locality, as it pertains to design and construction methods of military projects in the geographic area where anticipated work will be accomplished. During the past 5 years, 60% of all TOs issued have been in or around the Tucson, Arizona Metropolitan area.   Individual TOs anticipated to be issued under the A-E IDIQ contracts may be issued under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act.  Firms are advised that under such circumstances, Recovery Act reporting requirements and contract clauses will be applicable to those TOs.  A-E services for which a TO may be issued include: <br><br>1. Design of new facilities or utility systems of various types, sizes, and complexities. <br>2. Rehabilitation of existing facilities or utility systems of various types, sizes, and complexities. <br>3. Design of projects on Army or Air Force installations. <br>4. Application of Anti-Terrorist/Force Protection criteria. <br>5. Sustainable design utilizing LEED rating tools. <br>6. Preparation of the development of the technical information for design-build Request for Proposals (RFP). <br>7. Development of construction cost estimates and schedules. <br>8. Design of Demolition. <br>9. Comprehensive planning that is related to future construction requirements on military installations. <br>10. Construction phase services including commissioning, shop drawing review and preparation of operations and maintenance (O&M) manuals.  <br><br>EVALUATION:  The Government's selection of the contractor who proposes the "best value" will be based upon an integrated assessment of the factors found in the selection criteria.  The Government will use these factors to determine the most highly qualified firm (s).  Each factor will be assigned a rating based on the level of risk to the government and in view of the factor being evaluated how well the firm will successfully perform the contract.  A rating will be given to each submission.  The following factors will be considered in deciding which of the most highly rated firm will be selected to hold discussions with.  All factors are listed in their order of importance. <br><br>SELECTION CRITERIA:  The following factors will be assessed and rated in descending order of importance (unless determined otherwise). <br><br>FACTOR 1. Professional qualifications necessary for satisfactory performance of required services. - This factor assesses the individual experience of the personnel and professional qualifications assigned to the project team.  Firms should provide information for one to three individuals from each design discipline that is anticipated to be assigned to key positions on the project team.  Key positions may include:  Project Managers; Quality Assurance Managers; Architects; Structural Engineers; Civil Engineers; Mechanical Engineers; Electrical Engineers; Fire Protection Engineers; Geotechnical Engineers; Environmental Engineers and Land Surveyors.  Firms may provide information on other personnel they feel are significant for the type (s) of work described in the SCOPE OF SERVICES.  Resumes must be submitted for all qualified professional personnel selected by the firm to be assigned to the project team.  Professional licenses, registrations, and/or certifications shall be specifically identified on resumes.  Failure to indentify a license, registration and/or certification will result in a presumption that none exists for the individual for whom the resume is offered.<br><br>FACTOR 2.  Specialized experience and technical competence in the type of work required.  - This factor assesses the experience of the firm and project team in completing projects requiring skills similar to those anticipated for the A-E IDIQ contract (s).  Where appropriate, a firm must describe specialized experience and technical competence in energy conservation, pollution prevention, waste reduction, and the use of recovered materials.<br><br>FACTOR 3.  Capacity to accomplish work in the required time. - This factor assesses the ability of the firm to accomplish a project (s) within required time periods, given its current projected workload and the availability of key personnel.  The evaluation will consider the availability of an adequate number of personnel in key disciplines for effective execution as a Project Delivery Team (PDT).  The design team for the firm must demonstrate the ability to concurrently perform at least two, $250,000.00 multi-disciplinary TO contracts in a 150-day period.  The evaluation will also consider the experience of the firm and any consultants with similar size projects, the availability of an adequate number of personnel in key disciplines, and the capability of the firm to provide qualified backup-staff for key personnel in order to ensure continuity of services in meeting unexpected project demands.  Firms must demonstrate the ability to respond quickly and coordinate multiple tasks.  Firms must include records of proposed personnel working together as a team.<br><br>FACTOR 4.  Past Performance (previous 5 years). - This factor assesses and considers the past performance of the project team on related work performed for the DoD, other Government agencies, private industry and other similar contracts with respect to quality of work, cost control, compliance with performance schedules, cooperation and responsiveness.  The Government may consider information provided by the firm, customer inquiries, Government databases, and other publicly available sources.  Failure to provide requested data, accessible points of contact, or valid phone numbers could result in a firm being considered less qualified. In addition, any records of significant claims against the firm because of improper or incomplete architectural and engineering services must be included.  Firms will also be evaluated based on established A-E Contract Administration Support System (ACASS) ratings and other credible documentation included on Standard Form (SF) 330.  Firms may include brief references to letters of commendation or awards for work performed as part of the descriptive project narrative in SF 330 - Part 1, Section F. <br><br>FACTOR 5.  Firm Location & Locality Knowledge.  This factor assesses the information provided that demonstrates expertise in geological features, climatic conditions, natural resources, architectural context, local construction methods, local and state building codes and permit requirements.  The description for this criterion must be included in SF 330, Section H. This factor also evaluates both the distance of the firm's project office from the Greater Tucson and Phoenix Metropolitan Areas, the extent of the firm's knowledge about both metropolitan areas and the knowledge and experience of the firm pertaining to state, county and local requirements for projects of the types anticipated for the A-E IDIQ contract (s).  Relative to Factor 5, the Government recognizes that firms with multiple offices may form a project team with personnel from more than one office.  As such, the Government will consider the performance risk associated when a firm's project team (s) is not co-located in the same office.<br><br>FACTOR 6.  Volume of Department of Defense (DoD) Awards (during the preceding twelve (12) months).  This factor assesses the volume of DoD work awarded during the twelve month period immediately preceding the date of this announcement.  Firms must provide a list of all awarded DoD contracts to include dollar value.  Firms must list only basic contract awards. Work performed as a subcontractor will not considered.  An individual list of TOs is not required.  <br> <br>SUBMISSION FORMAT:  Qualifications data. - A firm must file SF 330, Architect-Engineer Qualifications - Part II, and when applicable, SF 330 - Part I, in order to be considered for an A-E contract.  Three (3) completed and bound paper copies and one (1) electronic copy in PDF format on CD are required for each submission.  Submitting firms must include their DUNS number, along with the name of the firm in Block 5 of SF 330 - Part I, Section B.  A firm located within the United States may obtain a DUNS number by calling Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 or via the internet at http://www.dnb.com/us/.  If a submitting firm is located outside the United States, the nearest local Dun and Bradstreet office should be contacted.  <br><br>Instructions and Suggestions for preparing SF 330.<br><br>The capability of an A-E firm to perform a certain project will be evaluated based upon the factors listed in this notice and from the information submitted on SF 330.  Hence, a firm must prepare this document thoroughly, logically and professionally to ensure the best consideration by the A-E evaluation board.  Some general advice: <br><br>  Read the FedBizOpps synopsis carefully.  Address all requirements in the synopsis thoroughly, concisely and clearly. Submit only for projects that your firm is well qualified to perform. <br><br>  Do not include extraneous material such as a general marketing brochure. A thicker submission is not a better submission.  Evaluation board members spend the same amount of time viewing each submission.  Hence, extraneous material will only dilute the review of your submission. <br><br>  A cover letter is not necessary.  Use SF 330 - Part I, Section H to express your firm's commitment to a project.<br> <br>  Part I and Parts II should be bound into one document using a plastic spiral fastener or 3-ring binder.  Tab all documents.<br> <br>  Bold print or shading may be used to emphasize important information.  Avoid small and difficult-to-read fonts.  Font size shall be 10 point or larger using Times New Roman, Arial and Courier New fonts. <br> <br>  Except as otherwise indicated, pages shall be 8-1/2 inches by 11 inches.  Where page limits are indicated for Parts and Sections of SF 330, excess pages will not be read or considered.  Each side of a sheet of paper shall be counted as a single page.  Blank sheets or tabs separating the Sections within the SF 330 will not count toward any page limitation. <br> <br>  Automated software may be used to prepare the SF 330 provided the general order and format of the information are maintained. <br> <br>  The organizational chart required in Section D and the Matrix required in Section G, may be presented on sheets up to 11 inches by 17 inches.  If an 11 inch by 17 inch sheet is used, it shall be neatly folded to 8-1/2 x 11 inches and bound in the SF 330 at the proper location.  <br> <br>Part I - Contract Specific Qualifications. <br><br>SF 330 - Part I is prepared for the entire team.  Part I can be adjusted some, provided the basic order and format of the information is maintained.  Use bulleted phrases, charts, graphics and matrices instead of long sentences.  The instructions on SF 330 - Part I are generally self-explanatory.  The following additional advice is offered: <br><br>  Section C.  List only the offices that will have a key role in the performance of the contract. Include a Part II for each key office.  For example, a person may be new to a firm, and all of his or her relevant projects are with a previous firm.  Make sure all key EP personnel are registered, licensed or certified, as appropriate.  <br><br>  Section D.  All key personnel for whom resumes are provided shall be shown on the organizational chart.<br><br>  Section E.  The relevant projects selected to illustrate the qualifications of the key personnel do not have to match the projects in Section F.  Resumes shall not exceed two (2) pages each. <br> <br>  Section F.  A maximum of ten (10) projects including the prime and consultants will be reviewed.  Select recent projects; an evaluation board will generally give less credit to projects completed more than five years ago.  Stress the relevancy of the projects to the announced contract.  Photographs of completed projects can be inserted in block 24, but are optional.  In Block 25, indicate which firms from the proposed team indicated on Section C were involved in the example project.  No more than one (1) page should be used for each project.  Multiple projects may be reflected on a single page.  Select projects where multiple team members worked together, if possible, that demonstrate the team's capability to perform work similar to that required for this contract.  Example projects are intended to demonstrate projects performed by some or all of the firms on the project team.  Multiple task orders that are associated with a single project may be used and will be considered a single project.  Listing a single contract with task orders that may be unrelated is not considered a single project.  A task order executed under an IDC contract is a project.<br><br>  Section G.  This matrix graphically shows which of the key personnel proposed in Section E worked on the example projects in Section F.  Evaluation boards certainly do not expect that all of the key personnel worked on all the example projects.  However, boards will generally rank firms higher than demonstrate greater team continuity.  In Item 26, include the name of the firm with which the person was associated with.<br>  <br>  Section H.  Do not repeat information that was already presented in the previous sections. This is the place to address selection criteria that cannot be presented in Sections E - G, such as equipment resources, computer capability, and quality management approach. Acknowledge and address any negative comments on performance evaluations or any "marginal" or "unsatisfactory" performance evaluations.  Identify what your firm has done to improve performance since the evaluation was completed.  Section H shall not exceed fifteen (15) pages.  Indication of favorable performance ratings, awards, and repeat clientele in Section H is recommended.<br><br>Part II - General Qualifications. <br><br>A SF 330 Part II is required for each designated branch office of the prime firm, each joint-venture partner, and each subcontractor shown Section C of Part I. The synopsis will instruct whether to submit current Parts II with Part I, or that the Parts II on file in ORCA will be used if not submitted.  In the latter case, a firm should ensure that the Parts II in ORCA for all of their proposed team members are current. <br><br>Part II is prepared on a branch or subsidiary office basis, which aligns with the assignment of DUNS Numbers.  Hence, all of the information on a Part II, except column 9.c (1) for total firm personnel, is for the specific branch or subsidiary office.  The instructions on the SF 330 - Part II are generally self-explanatory. The following additional advice is offered: <br><br>  Block 7.  Indicate the name of the parent firm if the Part II is for a branch office or subsidiary firm. <br><br>  Block 9.  There is space for 20 disciplines.  So select the primary disciplines in an office.  All remaining employees are totaled and shown under "Other Employees."  Select from the disciplines listed on page 5 of the instructions, or insert the titles of other disciplines pertinent to the office.  Column 9.c (1) is for the total firm (all offices), whereas column 9.c (2) is for the specific branch office.  If a firm has only one office, both columns will be the same. <br><br>  Block 10.  There is space for 22 experience profile codes.  So select experience categories that represent the primary capabilities of an office.  Firms must make a business decision about breaking a project down into various component profile codes or identifying a project with a single profile code.  Select from the experience categories listed on page 6-8 of the instructions, or insert other types of experience pertinent to the office.<br> <br>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL.

<p>Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation. This will be awarded as a firm fixed price type contract.</p>
<p>Period of Performance: Performance shall be for twelve (12) months from date of award.</p>
<p>The Molecular Imaging Program (MIP) at the National Cancer Institute (NCI) conducts research in designing, developing and testing new novel targeted imaging agents for the detection and characterization of cancer. These imaging agents include tissue-specific MRI, PET, radionuclide, and optical probes. NCI is focused on the clinical translation of targeted imaging agents for cancer imaging. The MIP houses a government owned BioScan NanoSPECT/CT Imaging Scanner (Serial number NS-706022-4RCT) on which radioactive research animals are imaged.&nbsp; NCI proposes to purchase a service agreement for the BioScan NanoSPECT/CT Imaging Scanner. This instrument is essential and important to research in the Molecular Imaging Program.</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide: 1) Two (2) preventive maintenance inspections per year; 2) unlimited emergency repair within twenty four (24) hours of first call; 3) furnish all required replacement parts with the exception of consumable parts at no additional cost to the Government; 4) software service and updates in accordance with the manufacturer's latest established service procedures. Contractor personnel shall be technically qualified factory-trained personnel in order to perform service to this instrument. The contractor shall also provide maintenance of optional equipment including the reconstruction workstation and Minerve anesthesia system.</p>

<RESPDATE>051611
<CONTACT>Patrick Sisk, Contract Specialist, Phone 703-696-6804, Email Patrick.Sisk@navy.mil - Michael I Given, Program Officer, Phone (703) 696-0455, Email michael.given@navy.mil
<DESC>The Office of Naval Research (ONR) is interested in receiving proposals for development of an Autonomous Critical Care System.
<p>Background: The ONR Force Health Protection program has been researching use of autonomous (closed-loop-control) systems for fluid resuscitation and mechanical ventilation since 2005 which demonstrated improved medical situational awareness and safety while reducing logistical requirements for fluids and oxygen. As a continuation of these studies ONR approved a Science and Technology (S&amp;T) research program to develop a prototype Autonomous Critical Care System (ACCS).</p>
<p>Need Statement: To support naval combat and humanitarian assistance/disaster relief missions there is a need for a modular, automated, critical care system for close management of hemodynamically unstable patients. The system may be employed in both land-based and shipboard medical treatment facilities and during medical evacuation to a sea-base, as a means to increase survivability and improve patient outcomes. Minimally-supervised patient transport may be accomplished by ground vehicle, rotary or fixed wing aircraft, or by high-speed vessel, and the system will need to provide continuous monitoring and medical management of patients to prevent any degradation in clinical status. It is also anticipated that unmanned ground or air vehicles may be used in the future for patient transport and the system will validate effective patient monitoring and control in an unmanned vehicle during transport.</p>
<p>Objective: Advances in machine learning and associated development of computer-based automated control algorithms, device integration, and wireless communications enable improved pre-hospital and hospital patient care capabilities. The goal of this program is to develop a prototype system that will provide complete medical management of a critically injured casualty for a period &ge; 6 hrs without human intervention and to demonstrate the ability of the system to correctly diagnose and manage a series of scripted, medically complex, life-threatening clinical events. The prototype system will have both decision-assist and fully-autonomous (i.e. closed-loop-control) capabilities, or mixed modes selected by the caregiver. Decision-assist algorithms provide treatment recommendations based on the real-time assessment of the physiology of the patient which can either be accepted or rejected by the caregiver; closed-loop-control algorithms manage the patient without caregiver input. The development and implementation of closed-loop algorithms must be done in accordance with 21 CFR 820.30 Design Controls.</p>
<p>The ACCS can be thought as "system of systems" which contains both hardware and software components and requires near infallibility and redundancy to prevent loss of life. Selection of components must be based on performance, reliability, usability and maintainability. The ACCS should be scalable, i.e. modular in design to allow addition/removal of components to meet mission requirements; components should be plug-and-play to the greatest extent possible. Software will be assessed as to efficiency, integrity, reliability, survivability, usability, correctness, maintainability, verifiability, expandability, flexibility, and interoperability. A spiral development process is desired to incorporate changes resulting from experimentation as well as technology opportunities.</p>
<p>Table 1: Key Performance Parameters</p>
<p>Key Performance Parameters (KPPs) Development Objectives</p>
<p>System Performance: 1. Successful demonstration of ACCS ability to manage a large animal poly-trauma model (hemorrhagic shock, bone fracture, muscle damage and moderate/severe traumatic brain injury) under controlled (laboratory) and operational conditions for a minimum of six (6) hours. As part of the evaluation process the system must be able to demonstrate ability to successfully manage induced clinical events to insure survival of the patient.</p>
<p>2. Demonstrate remote monitoring and control of the ACCS.</p>
<p>3. Demonstrate remote monitoring and control of the ACCS in an unmanned ground or air vehicle using combatant communication network.</p>
<p>Table 2: Key System Attributes</p>
<p>Attribute Development Objectives</p>
<p>Weight: &lt; 30 lbs; The objective is to make the system as small and as light as possible.</p>
<p>Size: Must be able to fit in all current naval air platforms (CH46 &amp; CH53, and MV22).</p>

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

The Government is seeking to lease approximately&nbsp;7,972 contiguous rentable square feet of office and related space. The rentable space must yield a minimum of&nbsp;6,932 ANSI/BOMA Office area square feet (OASF). The lease term requirement is for&nbsp;ten years with cancellation rights after five years. The spacemust be available for occupancy by September 1, 2011. The delineated area is as follows:</p>
<p align="left">North: Starting at the intersection of Kennedy Drive and Route 2 (Williston Road). East along Williston Road to St George Road.</p>
<p align="left">East: South along&nbsp;St George Road&nbsp;to Interstate 89 (Vietnam Veterans Memorial Highway).</p>

</ul>
<p align="left">The offered space must meet Government requirements for Fire and Life Safety and ABAAS compliance.</p>
<p align="left">The Government is considering alternative space if economically advantageous. The Government will use the information it receives in response to this advertisement as a basis to develop a cost-benefit analysis and to determine whether to compete the lease requirement or pursue a sole source justification to remain at its current location. In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Government's requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications infrastructure, and non-productive agency downtime.</p>

<DESC>This solicitation will be issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP) resulting in the award of a single firm fixed price (FFP) contract. The Request for Proposal will be issued on or about February 9, 2011 and the Proposal Due Date will be on or about March 11, 2011. The estimated value of this work is $1,000,000.00 to $5,000,000.00.  Proposals received in response to this solicitation will be evaluated in accordance with procedures outlined in Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 15 for Best Value. NAICS Code: 237990. This is an UNRESTRICTED procurement.  The site is located at the BNSF Railroad crossing, immediately east of the Davis Pond Diversion Canal near Ama, La, and north of the two tracks, the existing levee alignment would transition to a floodwall section consisting of sheet pile I-wall, reinforced concrete T-wall, and steel floodgate built to El.+13.5, 13.0, and 15.0 NAVD88, respectively. The total length of floodwall is approximately 150 feet and requires an approximate 60-foot easement for the construction of the railroad floodgate structure. Work included within this project consists of  the following: Steel Swing Gate at BNSF Railroad Crossing, Government-designed temporary falsework, Government-designed temporary retaining structures/temporary flood protection, construction dewatering, concrete reinforced T-Walls, clearing and grubbing, structural excavation and backfill, turf establishment and maintenance, painting, driving steel sheet piling, driving steel h-piles, driving steel pipe piles, and other incidental work.  The railroad gate will require contractors to drive steel H-piling and steel sheet piling, pour base slabs, install false work (temporary bridging consisting of steel pipe piling and structural steel superstructure) for the rail road tracks, construct reinforced concrete floodwall stems, and install steel flood gates in very limited windows of time to facilitate keeping both tracks in service during construction, since this railroad line is reported to be the busiest in the state of Louisiana. The Contractor will be required to provide means to clear railroad ROW quickly should any breakdowns or equipment failures occur (this could mean providing redundant cranes, etc.). Any delays will incur a substantial fine by the railroad company on the construction contractor. As such, a certain level of insurance and bonding capacity will be required as follows: <BR>Contractor, Public and Railroad's Protective Public Liability and Property Damage Liability <BR>  Combined Single Limit for Bodily Injury Liability, Property Damage Liability and Physical Damage to Property - $2,000,000 per occurrence. <BR>  Aggregate Limit - $6,000,000 for the term of the policy. <BR>  For AMTRAK - Aggregate Limit - $12,000,000 for the term of the policy. <BR><BR>Selection will be based on the following criteria, with non-cost factors being more important than price.  Factors 1, 2, and 3 are comparatively equal.  Factor 4 is less significant than factor 1, 2, and 3.  Factor 5 is less significant than factors 1, 2, 3, and 4.  (1) Past Performance Risk which includes Safety (2) Technical Approach and Key Personnel (3) Proposed Construction Duration (4) Small Business Participation Plan (5) Price. Factor 5 will not be scored, but will be subjectively evaluated for reasonableness by the board.   These evaluation factors are subject to change. Any changes to evaluation factors will be shown in the solicitation. The solicitation will include a detailed list of evaluation factors, including any sub-factors or elements, and will provide instructions for proposal requirements and the basis for award. The Government will not provide written paper copies of the solicitation.  Telephone, written, facsimile, or e-mail requests for the solicitation package will not be honored.

<p>4. An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from potential offerors during the proposal development phase for this effort. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. Before contacting the Ombudsman, potential offerors should first communicate with the contracting officer for this acquisition. If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the Center/MAJCOM ombudsmen, Ms. Sue Hunter; 1864 4th Street, Building 15, Room 225; Wright-Patterson AFB OH45433-7130; Phone: 937-904-4407; FAX: 937-904-7024; Email:Sue.Hunter@wpafb.af.mil.

<DESC><p>Solicitation Number: <br />AG-3198-S-11-0008</p>
<p>Notice Type: <br />Sources Sought</p>
<p>Synopsis: <br />SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE <br />This is a Sources Sought Notice for market research purposes only and is not a Request for Proposal (RFP). A solicitation is not being issued at this time and this notice shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation, nor does it restrict the Government to a particular acquisition approach.</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture, Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) intends to solicit bids in 2011 for the procurement of nationally descriptive files and summary reports on a census of Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) participants (WIC Participant and Program Characteristics (PC) 2012 &amp; 2014 RFP) and is seeking statements of capability from potential contractors. Preference will be given to small businesses with experience and staffing to perform the requirement as demonstrated in the statement of capabilities.</p>
<p>In the WIC PC 2012&amp;2014 RFP, FNS seeks the services of qualified contractors to perform a large scale administrative data collection, provide detailed information on the demographic characteristics, economic circumstances and health conditions of WIC participants, and to provide information on the operational characteristics of State and local WIC Agencies to support the agency's management, evaluation and improvement of the program. This is a biennial update to the tasks described in the WIC Participant and Program Characteristics 2008 &amp; 2010 Statement of Work (refer to attachment 1 to the old PC 2008/2010 statement of work). FNS expects that approximately 10 million participant records from about 90 WIC State Agencies will be collected, cleaned, processed and analyzed.</p>
<p>The Government requests that all interested parties submit a statement of capability outlining past work that is related to this requirement as stated below. The statement of capability shall include:</p>
<p>&#61656; Contractor Name</p>
<p>&#61656; Address</p>
<p>&#61656; Point of Contact (POC)</p>
<p>&#61656; POC phone number and e-mail address</p>
<p>&#61656; Statements of past performance on comparable projects</p>
<p>&#61656; DUNS number</p>
<p>&#61656; Business status (i.e. large/small business, disadvantaged, Hub Zone, woman-owned, etc.)</p>
<p>The Statement of Capabilities must demonstrate the contractor's expertise in particular social science analysis and evaluation skills (including, but not limited to, data collection and cleaning, statistics, sample size estimations, and nutrition and technical writing). Specifically the contractor must demonstrate experience in performing large scale data collections from multiple State level Management Information Systems (MIS), and in working with State staff who maintain administrative data to ensure that information is received in a usable format and is ready to be further processed. Because State agency MIS systems are maintained independently, the contractor must demonstrate the ability to work with any data platform, database structure, and record format encountered during the data collection phase of the project. In addition, because data in some State systems are maintained in separate files or databases, the contractor must demonstrate expertise in linking records from multiple sources. The contractor should also know that each State codes some of the variables in its datasets using coding systems unique to that State (refer to www.fns.usda.gov/wic/PC2010Guidance.pdf for current data collection guidance to States); recoding and standardizing State agency data is a significant part of the project. Data quality and data completeness are additional concerns. The Agency's experience with previous WIC Participant and Program Characteristics (PC) data collections has proven that it is an iterative process and requires multiple submissions from many States to achieve a complete and valid dataset. FNS is particularly interested in the contractor's experience with data collection projects similar in size, scope, and complexity to PC.</p>
<p>The Statement of Capabilities must also demonstrate that the contractor is able to create nationally descriptive data files on a census of participants; including discussion of the contractor's previous experience in sampling and application of appropriate sample weights and the use of SAS for statistical analyses.</p>
<p>Finally the Statement of Capabilities must also demonstrate that the contractor is able to produce reports comparable to the level of detail contained in previous WIC Participant and Program Characteristics reports (refer to http://www.fns.usda.gov/ora/MENU/Published/WIC/FILES/pc2008.pdf).</p>
<p>Any information provided by industry to the Government as a result of this sources sought synopsis is strictly voluntary. Responses will not be returned. No entitlements to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges to the Government will arise as a result of contractor submission of responses, or the Government's use of such information. The information obtained from responses to this notice may be used in the development of an acquisition strategy and future RFP. No questions will be entertained or comment responded to by the Government. <br />Offerors capable of providing these services should submit the information requested above via e-mail to ty.sar@fns.usda.gov and karen.meade@fns.usda.gov no later than 2PM Eastern Standard Time, April, 8, 2011.</p>

<DESC><p>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Office of Air and Radiation (OAR), Office of Transportation and Air Quality (OTAQ), National Vehicle and Fuel Emissions Laboratory (NVFEL), Ann Arbor, MI, and Cincinnati Procurement Operations Division (CPOD) intend to negotiate on a sole source basis, under the authority of the test program for commercial items (section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996), with Horiba Instruments, Inc, Ann Arbor, MI The applicable NAICS code is 334516 - Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing</p>
<p>OTAQ has a requirement for the purchase of an alcohol and carbonyl sampling system (commonly referred to as an Impinger Bench) in its Ann Arbor facility in order to collect samples of vehicle exhaust containing ethanol, an additive in gasoline, to meet the regulatory mission of EPA.</p>
<p>The Impinger Bench shall be composed of several discrete functional components which together provide the necessary conditions and measurements to perform alcohol and carbonyl sampling from dilute exhaust as taken from the existing Constant Volume Sampling System (CVS). This procurement is for one unit, on-site training, one year warranty (after date of acceptance), and optional four year extended warranty. Major components shall provide:<br />&bull; Heated sampling capability from a dilute exhaust stream<br />&bull; Mass flow measurements of the sample removed from the CVS<br />&bull; A conditioning bath which holds the Impinger flasks and maintains their temperature at a desired set-point below ambient conditions<br />&bull; Data acquisition of critical measurements and communication with existing Horiba CDTCS and MEXA systems</p>
<p>The vehicle testing which this procurement supports involves a complex series of actions and events that take place over a specific time frame or "test cycle." The test-cell control and data acquisition computer has the complex task of coordinating the entire test process. This task includes:<br />&bull; Collecting operator input which configures the test for the engine to be tested<br />&bull; Operating the vehicle over a prescribed series of speed and loads<br />&bull; Monitoring the engine for fault conditions<br />&bull; Issuing commands to various pieces of test equipment, including the exhaust analysis system before during and after testing<br />&bull; Monitoring equipment for fault conditions and taking appropriate actions<br />&bull; Collecting data from several pieces of equipment and sensors continuously during the test<br />&bull; Processing a large data set after the test to calculate, report and transmit results</p>
<p>In addition to engine tests, the test-cell control and data acquisition computer must perform similar functions on a periodic basis to conduct various diagnostic tests required by regulation. These tests are conducted in order to demonstrate the validity of engine test results. These tasks utilize serial communication throughout the test, to issue function commands, pass information and data back and forth and to monitor the analysis system for proper functioning. As a result, a specific communication structure for commands and variable names, in this case MEXA-LAN is utilized throughout the custom software of the test-site computer system. The new Impinger Bench system must be compatible with the existing Horiba MEXA-LAN system.<br /><br />Based on market research, EPA has concluded that in order for another vendor to be responsive to the solicitation they would have to provide a system that responds to the same extensive set of computer commands that the Horiba &reg;MEXA system responds to. This set of commands is part of the proprietary Horiba MEXA-LAN network protocol. This protocol is associated with Horiba proprietary software imbedded in Horiba MEXA system microprocessors. Use of this imbedded software by another supplier in their products would be infringement upon Horiba intellectual property. Incorporation of a new communication protocol in the existing test control and data acquisition system would be required with any other analytical systems and would require significant additional investment by the government. Replacement of the test host computer system in this test site is neither anticipated nor desired. Replacing the test host computer system would entail considerable cost to the government in the form of labor to debug and completely validate new software at the test site, as well as postpone the performance of ethanol emission measurement for regulatory testing of new and in-use vehicles, and also result in concurrent loss of test function during the implementation process, impacting critical enforcement functions.</p>
<p>EPA's market research indicates that Horiba Instruments, Inc. is the only known source able to satisfy the Government's requirement(s) because of the proprietary Horiba Mexa-7000 LAN host communication protocol utilized by existing EPA test site-specific equipment that will not be replaced.</p>
<p>This is not a request for proposal. However, any firm believing itself capable of meeting EPA's requirement may submit technical documentation to establish the potential of complying with the specifications. Such documentation must be submitted to the point of contact not later than April 18, 2011.</p>
<p>A determination not to compete the proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered only for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement or to proceed on a sole source basis.</p>
<p>Please submit your response in writing to: U.S. EPA, Attn: Samantha Fuchs, 26 W. Martin Luther King Drive, MS NWD-001, Cincinnati, OH, 45268-0001 or via fax 513) 487-2107, or email fuchs.samantha@epa.gov.</p>

<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.75in">&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'">From a hull maintenance perspective, each is an independent system having a straight forward function and purpose.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The goal of the Maintenance Free Ship Technologies program is to eliminate the need for paint and corrosion related maintenance by technological advancements that combine these three (3) components into one integrated underwater hull system which has been identified, in concept, as the Integrated Underwater Hull Shield (IUHS).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It is the purpose of this RFI to identify component technologies for the IUHS. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'">Navy hulls generally utilize an impressed current cathodic protection (ICCP) system to provide sufficient levels of protection throughout the ship life-cycle.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>ICCP technology has only recently moved from simple analog power supply systems to more advanced computerized systems and simple power supply components.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>While the basic functionality of the ICCP system has changed little relative to the cathodic protection function, new developments in software control and computational aspects offer a multitude of new capabilities for prognostics, enhanced control, and force protection through real-time underwater sensing. Current ICCP systems may be effective as stand-alone corrosion control systems using simple point source anodes, but they have a significant and measurable contribution to the non-acoustic signature.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The approach proposed here is for replacement for the current ICCP system that would incorporate CP protection, eliminate AF and AC<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>hull coatings and the attendant dry-docking for recoating.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Advanced control capabilities would be required and may be exercised to operate the integrated system in CP or AF modes independently or concurrently. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'">Anti-corrosion (AC) and Anti-fouling (AF) coatings are standard systems applied to every hull and have a combined life of 10-12 years.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Since longer lasting AC coatings are readily available, underwater hull husbandry (cleaning and recoating) is mostly governed by the life of the AF coating system.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Hull cleaning occurs periodically during the 10-12 year period to rejuvenate the AF surfaces in order to reduce the effects of biological growth induced drag.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Both the recoating and the periodic cleanings are costly and have become increasingly important with rising fuel costs and emphasis on Navy energy usage.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In addition, components of existing AF coatings have been subject to increased regulation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Tri-butyl tin AF systems were globally banned due to concerns of persistent environmental toxicity and current ablative copper systems which is in use by the Navy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This remains under scrutiny by the EPA and the International Maritime Organization (IMO). While new technology, such as silicone easy release systems and co-biocide resins are under development, no effective and lasting system has been identified.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'">The IUHS will have an antifoulant (AF) component:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The system is envisioned to operate in the AF mode<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>periodically such that low levels of brominated halogens (highly biocidal) are generated at the hull anode surfaces at a defined rate and time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Testing has shown the even 0.2 ppm for only two hours per day is an effective treatment.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Note,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>this concept is currently used for the biofouling control of U.S. Navy ships.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The IUHS should not produce a higher level of promainated halogens than the existing systems.</span></p>

<a href="mailto:scott.welcheck@us.army.mil">PEO STRI Acquisition Center</a>
<DESC>PROGRAM DESCRIPTION: The Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training and Instrumentation (PEO STRI) has a requirement for Systems Engineering Support and Integration (SE&I) Services to aide in the development and integration of the Joint Land Component Constructive Training Capability (JLCCTC) Army Command and Staff training federations to include the Entity Resolution Federation (ERF) and Multi-Resolution Federation (MRF).<br><br>The JLCCTC SE&I team works closely with PEO STRI and National Simulation Center (NSC) Government representatives, components/federate developers and users to support the full capability development process.  The JLCCTC SE&I team must possess a highly specialized knowledge base and skill base to effectively support Command & Control (C2) system stimulation in support of Army and Joint Command and Staff training.  The JLCCTC SE&I team provides systems engineering, technical, and functional Subject Matter Expertise (SME) to support the integration of the following capabilities within JLCCTC: <br>    -	After Action Review (AAR) Component<br>    -	Multiple Unified Simulation Environment (MUSE)<br>    -	Extensible C4I Instrumentation Suite (ExCIS)<br>    -	Joint Deployment and Logistics Simulation (JDLM)<br>    -	Warfighters' Simulation (WARSIM) <br>    -	Fires Support Simulation (FIRESIM) <br>    -	One Semi-Automated Forces (OneSAF)<br>    -	Joint Training Data Services (JTDS) Order of Battle Service (OBS)<br><br>Additionally, the JLCCTC SE&I team provides technical and SME support for Federation Infrastructure operations and diagnostics, systems administration, data communications/networking, Systems of Systems Engineering (SoSE), test planning and integration. <br><br>A combined functional, technical and military operational background is crucial in certain functional areas to ensure simulation capabilities meet Warfigher expectations. In particular, direct military experience in the highly complex Sustainment and Logistics (LOG) and Indirect Fires (FIRES) functional areas enables JLCCTC systems engineers to meet user expectations.  In addition to directly applicable military experience, the JLCCTC SE&I team must have a strong software development and systems engineering background in simulation federation tools and infrastructures such as the High-level Architecture (HLA), to include HLA Run-Time Infrastructures (RTI's) and Distributed Interactive Simulation (DIS).  Knowledge of both time managed and non-time managed federations is necessary for the SE&I team to support both the MRF and ERF product lines.  The ability to build military scenarios for execution in the JLCCTC ERF using the JTDS OBS is also required.   <br><br>In addition the SE&I team provides facility network designs, sets up and configures networking infrastructure, diagnoses data communications and networking issues/errors and provides remedies.  This networking and data communications support is conducted locally at the PEO STRI Joint Development and Integration Facility (JDIF) and at additional distributed sites.<br><br>The JLCCTC SE&I team must also provide configuration, technical operations, and diagnostic support to the Live, Virtual, Constructive - Integrating Architecture (LVC-IA) program's integration efforts.  As such, a level of knowledge and expertise of the LVC-IA federation infrastructure and tools, to include the HLA RTI, sufficient to perform rapid diagnostics of complex inter-federate integration issues is critical to this effort. The JLCCTC SE&I team requires a wide range of systems engineering, software development and data communications skills, combined with extensive military background and knowledge.  This skill set will enable the JLCCTC SE&I team to provide a unique capability base upon which PEO STRI draws support in executing the full range of JLCCTC development and integration tasks. <br><br>ACQUISITION APPROACH: The Government anticipates awarding a Firm Fixed Price contract under NAICS code 541330 - Engineering Services.  The Government anticipates a five-year period of performance consisting of one base year period and four one-year options.<br>	<br>RESPONSES REQUIRED: All interested contractors must provide a written capability statement of no more than ten pages to the contract specialist identified below by Wednesday, 18 April 2011 at 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time.  The capability statement should include the following information:<br><br>-	A description of the background, experience, and skills of the projected personnel to provide the combined systems engineering and military functional expertise for the LOG and FIRES functional areas.<br>-	A description of the of the background, experience and skills of the projected personnel to provide the combined systems engineering services for the After Action Review (AAR),  Multiple Unified Simulation Environment (MUSE), Warfighters' Simulation (WARSIM), and One Semi-Automated Forces (OneSAF) functional areas.  It is highly desired that these individual have significant software development expertise.   <br>-	A description of expertise and skills of the projected personnel of the systems engineering team relevant to time managed and non time managed HLA federations as well as simulation federation infrastructure to include operations and diagnostic of HLA RTIs. <br>-	A description of the background, experience and skills of the projected personnel to provide combined simulations and networking expertise for detailed setup and configuration of JLCCTC network devices to include switches and routers.<br>-	Company small business size status under NAICS 541330, if applicable.<br>-	Any other information that clearly demonstrates the respondent's capabilities, expertise, and experience to perform the requirements.<br><br>DISCLAIMER: This notice does not constitute an invitation for bids or a Request for Proposal (RFP) and is not a commitment by the U.S. Government to procure subject products or services.  <br><br>The point of contact for responses is Scott Welcheck, 407-384-5512, scott.welcheck@us.army.mil.  <br><br>

<DESC><p style="text-align: center;">GENERAL CONTRACTOR WITH DESIGN BUILD CAPABILITIES, PRESIDIO CPB HOUSING PROJECT, PRESIDIO, TX</p>
<p><br />THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS FOR SMALL BUSINESS ONLY. The General Services Administration (GSA) is seeking qualified small business contractors with Design Build project delivery experience to design and construct new housing in Presidio, TX, for Customs and Border Protection (CBP) as GSA's client. The project is bounded on the east by Erma Ave., the west by Cibolo Creek, and the south by existing CBP housing property. Due to the small size and isolation of the town of Presidio, CBP needs to make housing available to their personnel in order to meet its mission at this location.</p>
<p>The SOW reflects requirements related to the GSA that is implementing this housing project as the service provider for CBP. The project includes (but is not limited to) the design and construction of all grading, drainage, underground utilities (water, sanitary sewer, storm drainage, gas (if required), electricity, telephone, CATV, internet), streets, and sidewalks street lighting for approximately 61 modular or stick-built housing units on 25 acres based on the Preferred Alternative from the Feasibility Study by Garrison Architects. In addition, one or more common areas consisting of green spaces, shade structures, playground equipment, picnic tables and barbeque pits will be a part of this project. There is also an optional additive alternate for a community center/training center that may be built if funding is available. Design Build Bridging Documents (DBBD) are in development and will be issued with the Request for Proposals (RFP).</p>
<p>This is not a request for proposals. This notice does not represent a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or award a contract. The Government is not obligated to and will not pay for information received as a result of this announcement.</p>
<p>GSA is in the process of determining the availability and capabilities of potential small business sources prior to issuing a solicitation for a Design Build Contractor to design and construct new housing in Presidio, TX for CBP. These units have been designed by Garrison Architects. The houses have been designed to facilitate construction using modular/pre-manufactured methods. However, stick built houses built using traditional construction methods in Presidio are allowed if the final products can meet the design requirements and specifications shown in the house construction documents. The housing units may be free standing units or attached/duplexed units. Sizes will be one, two or three bedroom units.</p>
<p>If no responses are received from potentially responsible sources, GSA under the FAR part 19.501(b) will have completed its due diligence regarding setting this procurement aside for small businesses and will proceed with procuring this requirement on an unrestricted basis.<br />Firms interested in this effort must be able to demonstrate experience as a General Contractor on three similar projects as defined below:</p>
<p>SIMILAR PROJECT is defined as a project that is similar in size, type and complexity.

Please ensure that any sensitive or protected information is marked as such and the government will ensure this information is not released externally.
Technical Requirements/Specifications: - Must be able to over allocate memory among the virtual servers and then dynamically switch it around. For example if the physical server has 24GB memory and there are 3 virtual servers, you should be able to allocate 10GB of memory on each server because the virtual software will dynamically limit it to 24GB without having each virtual server have a hard static limit.- The virtual software shall require less than 500 MB of space for the software to operate.- The virtual software must provide the ability to replicate a server on the fly. It should allow one to taken an entire server instance and then make a copy of it including all settings and configurations. The copy can then be stored or moved to another physical server.- Must be able to operate on the following physical server OS:  SuSe 10 or higher, Red Hat, Windows 2008 R2- Must be able to run virtual environments for the following OS: Suse 11 or higher, Red Hat, Windows 2008 R2, Solaris- Must be able to run different virtual OS on the same physical server. For example, one virtual server is Suse 11 and the other virtual server is running Windows 2008 R2.- Must be able to run on different types and size levels of hardware from a laptop up to a blade center server. - Must provide direct driver I/O capability in order to limit any bottlenecks.- Must provide a way to prioritize network traffic, storage i/o and other resources between the virtual servers on a physical server. - Must be able to manage fail over from production to disaster recovery as well as fail over between servers with active loads.- Must be able to automate test runs of recovery plans for testing scenarios as well as cleanup of testing environments after tests are completed. - Must provide tools/features that will allow for capacity and performance planning as well as tracking what is currently being done. This will allow us to effectively look at what is being used today and decide if upgrades are needed. It will also provide key information in deciding if additionally there are resources to install additional virtual servers.- Must be able to add virtual drives/partitions to existing virtual servers on the fly without having to take the virtual server down - Must provide monitoring tools to provide status on availability of the virtual servers as well as performance.- Must provide tools to allow alerts/notifications to be sent specified groups or user when certain thresholds are met or failures occur.- Must provide network capability to do both NAT and bridging.  (end of technical requirements/specifications)
To notify the Government of sensitive information, data identified as Proprietary (e.g. 41 USC section 423, the Procurement Integrity Act restrictive legend per Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 52.215-1, contained in a response to this RFI, offerors shall mark the cover page of the response and each affected page of the response with indications that it contains proprietary information.  The Government assumes no liability for the disclosure or use of information contained in a response if it is not marked proprietary.  
Interested parties who believe they have the capabilities to meet the technical requirements/specifications are invited to submit a capability statement, not to exceed 10 pages, company information, and the specifications of the Virtual Server License you propose can meet the technical specifications to the Contract Specialist via email at jenglehart@usgs.gov no later than 11:00 AM EDT, Monday, April 11, 2011.

3.0	DELIVERY
Devices ordered shall be delivered to VAMC's or to locations specified in delivery order/purchase order. 

4.0	TECHNOLOGY REFRESH  

4.1. State of the Art.  All hardware, software, accessories and devices offered shall be state-of-the-art technology.  "State-of-the-art" is defined as the most recently designed components, which are announced for marketing purposes, available, maintained and supported in accordance with requirements specified in the solicitation.  Offerors may not switch manufacturers without prior approval from the Contracting Officer, VA Blind Rehabilitation Program Office and the Denver Acquisition and Logistics Center. Components and products with a manufacturer's planned obsolescence within the first year of contract award are excluded.  
 
4.2 Upgrades. If upgrades of hardware, software, accessories or devices become available after award of this contract, the contractor will substitute them for the awarded items on current new delivery orders per paragraph 4.3 below.

4.3 Updates. The contractor will provide to the contracting officer the following information:
(1)	A list of specific awarded items, which shall be updated.
(2)	Product literature for the new items and a detailed description of the differences between the awarded items and the new items, and a specific analysis of the comparative advantage/disadvantages of the items involved.
(3)	The Contracting Officer will provide the information to the Blind Rehabilitation Service Program Office for approval. Upon approval, the contract will be modified to acknowledge the updated items.

5.0	CONTRACT HARDWARE
  
Because a laptop can function as a small desktop CPU, as well as a portable device, laptops will replace desktop computers as the standard for issuance for visually impaired and blind Veterans.  Laptops are easier to ship and store, and allow Veterans to bring them in luggage when returning to a VA blind rehabilitation program for further training.  Desktop systems may be utilized for Veterans who are challenged in using a laptop system.
Blind Rehabilitation Service (BRS) programs that need stock on hand to avoid delays in service delivery may purchase units ahead of time and issue from stock. Providers may order for delivery to the appropriate VA office or the Veteran's home at time of issuance.  The DALC ordering process will provide both purchase options and will allow Blind Rehabilitation Specialists and Blind Rehabilitation Outpatient Specialists to assign pre-purchased stock to individual Veterans at time of issuance for national record keeping.  BRS programs with Blind Rehabilitation Specialists who are trained technology instructors will order hardware options and software options for the Veteran following assessment and will configure the system as appropriate.  
Blind Rehabilitation Specialists and Blind Rehabilitation Outpatient Specialists who are not trained technology instructors and are less familiar with accessible technology may order systems pre-configured by a contracted vendor, but the computer equipment to be configured will be assembled from the standard list of items available under DALC contract.  The VA will be purchasing only configuration as a service, and will not purchase hardware and software sold by the 'configurator' as a package.  
If the Blind Rehabilitation Specialist or Blind Rehabilitation Outpatient Specialist determines that a Veteran needs items not under DALC contract, the items should be purchased through local Prosthetics Service submitting a required 2641 waiver.  The services of a 'configurator' may still be ordered through the DALC in such cases.

5.1. Laptop Computers. Two categories of laptops will be under contract to cover the two most popular operating systems -- Windows-capable laptops and Mac OS-capable laptops.  Laptops (and any other CPU/form factor combination on contract) will be configured according to modern specifications and obtained from major manufacturers with mainstream support and competitive pricing.  Business class units will be considered only when no consumer class units meet all the salient characteristics listed below for either operating system:
"	Support for multiple languages in the operating system.
"	11 to 15 inch screen.  (Larger units are too heavy to be truly portable.  Large monitors will be made available for home or office use.
"	Mid-range dual or quad core processor.
"	4 or more gigabytes of memory.
"	250 or more gigabyte hard drive or 128 or more gigabyte SSD drive (preference given to SSD drive). 
"	Multi-touch track pad.
"	Keyboard with "Enter" key, "Backspace" key and "Arrow" keys along right margin to allow blind users to easily identify and reach these keys.  Laptops with built-in numeric keypads will not be considered because they cause difficulty in identifying and striking the appropriate keys when present in a 15 inch or smaller laptop.  Preference will be given to "chicklet" style keyboards due to greater key differentiation.  
"	 DVD burner (may be integrated or external).
"	2 or more USB ports. 
"	10/100/1000 Mbps Ethernet interface.
"	WPA2 Personal encryption and Wireless IEEE 802.11 B, G &N.
"	Sound input and output ports or combination input/output port.

6.0 CONTRACT SOFTWARE  

Contract software will be available for purchase via physical delivery or on-line download.  Both options must be available to prevent delays in service delivery due to shortages in stock on hand, over-stocking, and, in some locations, poor Internet download speeds.  
The DALC will develop and maintain a database including serial numbers and expiration dates of items issued so that VA Blind Rehabilitation Specialists may review all previous orders.  This will enable Blind Rehabilitation Specialists and Blind Rehabilitation Outpatient Specialists to order appropriate upgrades or provide the serial numbers to Veterans or repair technicians if they must download and reload their software following computer repair.  Blind Rehabilitation Specialists, Blind Rehabilitation Outpatient Specialists, community access rehabilitation providers or other configurators will load free and secure security software options available from the Operating System vendor or other vendors agreed upon by the BRS CATS Super Users workgroup. 

6.1 Screen Reader Software.  Software will be included that allows the user to access the information on the screen via a speech synthesizer and/or a Braille display. The screen reader will track keystrokes with audible output and/or refreshable Braille display.
 
6.2 Screen Magnification Access Software.  Software will be included that allows a visually impaired user to access a standard computer via screen magnification and optional synthesized speech. To be purchased as a separate item (not integrated into the operating system), a screen magnifier solution must provide font-smoothing,  cursor-tracking with its associated screen reader to keep the spoken item in view at all times, and must offer magnification more than the 4x magnification already built into many mainstream productivity applications.

6.3 Optical Character Reader (OCR) software.  Software will be included that enables the user to convert scanned document into speech output.  OCR software must be capable of scanning editable text directly into issued word processing software with no more than one user step to initiate the scan and one to add more pages or end scanning and begin the recognition process.  This will be a separate purchase beyond basic OCR functionality required under item 5.3 above.

6.4 Speech Recognition Software.  Software will be included that enables the user to enter text/data and edit text/data using voice commands with minimal or no use of a keyboard or mouse. 
  
6.5 Simplified Comprehensive Accessibility Packages.  All-inclusive software packages will be included that offer screen reading, magnification or large print access, and simplified, menu-driven access to web browsing, email, OCR and simple document creation.  Some packages offer speech recognition in addition to these standard features.

6.6 Application Suites.  Application suites that include word processing, spreadsheet, e-mail clients and various 'office productivity' suites to be ordered as needed for a veteran who requires this option.  Software suites must be fully accessible to screen readers and screen reader/magnification programs.  To be considered fully accessible, the user must be able to access the complete set of available commands using the keyboard and speech feedback from access technology.  
6.7 Back up software.  Software used to return computer systems to a desired operational state will be included.  The software can be supplied to Veterans at the completion of their training for home use.

7.0 ASSISTIVE TECHNOLOGY CONFIGURATION SERVICES

7.1 Configuration Services.  Vendors with expertise in accessibility for users with visual impairment may contract to assemble 'turnkey' technology systems designed for people with disabilities.  The VA Blind Rehabilitation Specialist will order the hardware and software from standard items under contract with the DALC and add configuration as a line item.  The vendor will receive the order specifications from the DALC, configure them according to needs listed by the Blind Rehabilitation Specialist at time of order, and deliver them to the Veteran.  Vendors must provide up to five (5) no-cost telephone assistance calls with the Veteran or his or her designee within the first month following delivery to assure the technology solution is configured correctly to meet Veteran needs. (What happens after the first month, who does the Veteran contacts for assistance?)
7.2 Assistance Services.  Blind Rehabilitation Specialists may order single and multiple sessions of telephone\home\ remote log-in assistive technology assistance from configuration providers.

8.0 WARRANTY  

Laptops, monitors, printers and mobile computing devices must have a three (3) year warranty from the manufacturer, regardless of site configuration.  Repair service must be in-home by the vendor, or repair may be provided via pickup and both-way shipping arranged and paid for by the vendor.  During warranty period, replacement or repairs (or shipping if repairs cannot be completed in the veteran's home) will occur within 7 business days after notification to the contractor. If a computer is found to be defective within 30 days of delivery, a replacement computer (or specific part) will be provided within 10 business days. Contractor shall be responsible for shipping charges for defective product returns. 
Failures or damaged components out of the box will be replaced within 3 business days of notification with new components by the contractor. VA Blind Rehabilitation Specialists will determine what constitutes failure out of the box.

9.0 DISKS AND MANUALS 
 
Contractors will provide written set up instructions with hardware.  Full manuals and any tutorials must be available in accessible electronic format.
The laptop contractor will provide an operating system software (OSS) disk and recovery program disk with the unit.  Some devices may provide OSS in another media format, such as USB drive.   
An accessible mechanism to reinstall purchased software must be provided - either technician-assisted download and installation, or disk/USB copies.

10.  SCHEDULE OF SUPPLIES

Web Mediated Self help Programs

 Introduction:
This Request for Information (RFI) is for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).  The purpose of this RFI is to identify qualified contractors who are able to meet VA's requirements, on GSA schedule and the Open market.   

The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) is seeking interested sources (contractors) for a near-future solicitation and procurement for Web Mediated Self Help Services.  At this time, no solicitation exists.  Therefore, DO NOT REQUEST A COPY OF THE SOLICITATION.  

 Background: 
The Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs, Veterans Health Administration, have agreed to advance an integrated and coordinated public health model to improve the access, quality, effectiveness, and efficiency of mental health services for all Active Duty Service members, National Guard and Reserve members, Veterans, and their families.  The plan is outlined in the DoD/VA Integrated Mental Health Strategy Implementation Plan, July 2010. This plan is based on the following tenets:

i.	There is a growing population of Service members and Veterans with mental health needs.
ii.	Mental health care is unique in that conditions are not visible and stigma associated with obtaining care reduces the incentive for individuals to seek it
iii.	Mental health care provides different challenges for the two organizations with different missions in that they serve a common population, but at different life stages.

The Integrated Mental Health Strategy Implementation Plan has 28 strategic actions to improve the access to care, quality, consistency, implementation of innovative treatments and continuity of behavioral health.  Strategic Action #20 focuses on developing web-mediated resources for Veterans, Service members, and families across the DoD and VA.  Co-leads for this Strategic Action are Dr. Ken Weingardt, VHA Office of Mental Health Services, and Dr. Greg Gahm, National Center for Telehealth and Technology, Defense Centers of Excellence for Psychological Health and Traumatic Brain Injury.  

The first resources to be developed will be self-help courses which will be accessed via the internet. This will provide a first line approach for individuals who may not otherwise seek help. Additional benefits include increasing access to rural areas, 24/7 availability, and a possible reduction in stigma. These courses would be the foundation for a strong empirically supported "stepped care model" that combines web-based self-help modules with telephone coaching and support. 

Scope of Work: 
A.	Design and development of web mediated self-help programs. The contract will result in the creation of two (2) highly interactive self-paced training courses for Veterans and Active Duty Service Members.  Each course will be approximately 3 hours in total seat time, and will be fully compliant with SCORM 2004 standards and CFR Section 508 accessibility requirements.   Courses will be developed by an interdisciplinary Planning Committee consisting of VA and DoD Subject Matter Experts, in collaboration with contractor resources with experience in Project Management, Instructional Design, e-Learning production, and video production.   Each three hour course will be divided into 5-7 modules focusing on specific topics, and will be developed in two discrete phases - the first focused on analysis and design of the courseware, and the second on its development and deployment. 

Period of Performance:
The period of performance shall be one 12 month base period, plus one 12 month option period.

Tasks:

A.	Task 1.0: Analysis and Design
Drs. Weingardt and Gahm will convene a formal Planning Committee (of which the Contractor Project Manager will be a member of) for each course, and will recruit VA and DoD SMEs with relevant experience who will contribute their time.  The Contractor will identify necessary resources with expertise in Project Management, Instructional Design, video production, and e-Learning production. Each course will begin with a kickoff meeting that defines project scope, roles and responsibilities, and the working process. The Contractor shall set up a shared workspace (SharePoint site) that they will maintain for the duration of the project.  The Contractor shall coordinate all project management aspects including but not limited to developing a detailed Project Management Plan (PMP) coordinating meetings, producing detailed minutes, maintaining timelines and other essential project management support functions. 

i.	Subtask 1.1: Course Outline: The Planning Committee (PC) will have approximately 4 weeks to review existing training materials, videos, manuals, courseware, etc. on the identified topic and reach consensus on a high-level outline for the course. The Contractor will use this information to prepare a formal course outline. This Course Outline will include the overall course objectives, the intended audience, the primary topics that will be covered in each of 3-5 modules or sections of the course, and student performance objectives for each module.   


ii.	Subtask 1.2: Storyboards: The Contractor shall be responsible for the preparation and development of a set of 3-5 storyboards for each module contained in the Content Outline.  A storyboard is a detailed design document developed in MS PowerPoint that includes all course content, interactive exercises, graphics, and scripts of Audio and Video segments.  The Storyboarding process shall include the following steps:
1.	SMEs generate a detailed content outline for that module
2.	Content outline  reviewed and approved by PC
3.	Instructional Designer (Gov't Employee) generates first draft of storyboard
4.	SMEs review and refine storyboard
5.	Storyboard is reviewed by PC and Veteran focus group(s), coordinated by the Contractor
6.	Feedback is incorporated, prototype revised
7.	Final review and approval of SB, delivery to development team

The estimated timeframe from draft content outline to final storyboard approval is 3-4 months. Storyboarding of each module can proceed serially, or in parallel depending on the availability of Planning Committee members and contractor level of effort. Simultaneously developing and evaluating more than one storyboard can significantly accelerate this process.   


iii.	Subtask 1.3: Audio/Video Production: The Contractor shall prepare all related audio/video production necessary for each module. Video will be used extensively throughout these courses to illustrate key concepts and enhance user engagement.  The scripting of audio and video clips will occur as the SBs are being developed.   Government SMEs will identify opportunities for video and audio clips as they work on the SBs. The Contractor shall pull information about these clips from the SBs, and track them on a consolidated Media Tracking Sheet. The SMEs will create and revise scripts for the audio and video clips, and include detailed notes for video production. The scripts will be reviewed and approved by focus group and PC members


B.	Task 2.0: Development and Implementation
i.	Subtask 2.1: Web Development: The Contractor shall use final storyboards to create the HTML mock up. The Contractor shall design and develop the course template, including menus and submenus, and test for 508 compliance. After the Government SMEs review the course template and the PC approves, the Contractor shall populate the template with content and incorporates media files. The Contractor shall make the prototype module available on the shared site for PC and focus group review. The Contractor shall incorporate feedback and create final version of each course.



ii.	Subtask 2.2: Audio/Video Production

The Contractor shall be responsible for producing all media elements required for these courses, including photography, Flash animation sequences and professional quality audio and video segments. Government video production team will review draft scripts and provides feedback to SMEs. Upon script finalization, characters and locations will be identified and the Contractor shall cast for production and provide candidates for PC review. The Contractor shall coordinate all logistics, and provide all necessary services to shoot and produce video on location or in studio. The PC will review and provide approval of final media clips. The Contractor shall compress video files as necessary for successful incorporation into the web course.
	


iii.	Subtask 2.3: Deployment: The Contractor shall coordinate with OMHS, OI&T, My Healthe Vet, VA Web Operations, and DoD stakeholders to successfully post the courses to the Internet. The Contractor shall deliver the courses in two formats; a version that can be deployed on a SCORM 2004 Learning Management System, and a stand-alone version that can be deployed without an LMS. The Contractor shall additionally work with DoD partners to VA to make resulting courses available through afterdeployment.org and/or other DoD sites.

<DESC>Request for Information<br />Air University (AU)<br />Commercial Wireless Internet Services for Air University Faculty, Staff and Students<br /><br />Purpose: <br />THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP). The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to gather information from industry on establishing an Air University-wide commercial Internet Service Provider (ISP) presence to support the educational mission. The Government considers information on market capabilities, common industry standards, latest technological advances, commercial terms and conditions, timelines for adaptation and integration, and possible suppliers and sources to be helpful. All feedback and information received may be used to determine the appropriate acquisition strategy for a possible future acquisition. This notice is issued solely for market research and planning purposes and does not constitute a request for proposal, request for quote, or invitation for bid, nor does its issuance in any way restrict the Government as to its ultimate acquisition approach. No award will be made from this RFI and the Government will not pay for any effort expended in responding to this notice.<br /><br />Responses:<br />This RFI is prepared for planning purposes only and is not restricted to small business. If the government decides to pursue an RFP, portions of your RFI response may be incorporated into the Performance Work Statement (PWS) . Sources are discouraged from submitting any information deemed competition-sensitive or proprietary. However, if sources elect to submit competition-sensitive or proprietary information, sources bear sole responsibility for marking said information as such to ensure appropriate safeguarding by the Government. The Government shall not be held liable for any damages incurred if proprietary information is not properly identified. All submissions become Government property and will not be returned. Correspondences related to the RFI should be submitted electronically via e-mail to kevin.williams@maxwell.af.mil.<br /><br />After review of the responses to this RFI, the Government may or may not proceed with an acquisition. Information the government releases related to this RFI will be made available on the Federal Business Opportunities site (www.fedbizops.gov). It is the potential offeror's responsibility to monitor this site for new information related to this RFI.<br />
<p>Request for Information / Questions:<br />Air University (AU) is considering making a commercial wireless internet service available to the student population of Air University (approximately 4000 students) attending AU schools. In addition, the service would be provided to AU faculty and staff actively involved in the academic research. Coverage would encompass approximately 30 AU buildings. The wireless presence within the respective facilities would include classroom, faculty offices and general areas.<br />In order to develop any potential acquisition strategy the following information would be useful:<br />1. Estimated cost of service<br />2. Estimated timeline to provide the service<br />3. Service delivery options (i.e., provide service to service delivery point and provide service to the user)<br />4. Possible peripheral or allied support required from the government<br />5. Currently we subscribe to Blue Socket service and are interested in maintaining this control on the commercial service. What is the viability and estimated costs for continuing this service within your proposed solution?<br />6. What performance metrics could be made available to the government related to usage?<br />7. The current Computer Network Defense Service Provider (CNDSP) for AU.AF.EDU is the High Performance Computer Modernization Program. The services provided include network protection, detection, response and notification services. What are the costs and issues associated with providing this service?<br />8. Any other aspects that should be considered by the government as it refines the requirement and potentially develops an acquisition strategy?<br />9. Any inputs concerning the NAICS and SBA size standards that should be considered for any potential RFP?<br />If additional information is required to formulate your response to this RFI, request the information through the POC listed below. If the government determines the request is meaningful to the RFI, the information will be posted on the Federal Business Opportunities site. In addition, site surveys may be available by appointment to provide more accurate responses.</p>

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD A SOLE SOURCE CONTRACT - The Air Force Flight Test Center, Directorate of Contracting, Edwards Air Force Base, California, intends to solicit with and award a new sole source service contract to Airborne Systems North America of CA, INC., 3701 W. Warner Ave, Santa Ana, CA 92704-5218 for the following requirement. This sole source acquisition meets the conditions of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1); only one responsible source has been identified as reasonably available to provide the service and supplies that will satisfy the agency requirements. Information received as a result of this notice will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. This synopsis is for notification purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation for bids, quotes, or proposals. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 314999 and the Small Business size standard is 500 employees. A firm-fixed price contract is contemplated to include a contract period not to exceed 60 days. The purchase of these support services includes the on-site repacking and inspection of two 19' ribbon re-enforced airdrop parachutes. Parachutes are required to withstand airdrop platforms of up to 60,000 lbs from altitudes of up to 35,000 ft, at airspeeds of 220 to 250 knots. Estimated extraction force is 15,000 lbs (not expected to exceed 20,000 lbs). After platform is extracted from the aircraft the parachute will separate from the type 5 platform with an EFTC and the extraction force will be transferred to a ballast load (multiple G-11 recovery parachute bags secured close) which will release from the platform and bring the parachute to the ground. This airdrop process will be repeated for a total of four drops. Two of the drops will be at low level - standard LVAD airdrop altitude. The parachute must have been previously tested on the C-17 aircraft, "V-ring" capable of interfacing with the C-17 PDM, and able to accommodate a "permanent" reefing line with potential to modify sizes of reefing line between airdrops. Airborne Systems has prior experience supporting C-17 airdrop test missions. Interested parties required to provide both the parachute meeting above requirements and be certified and capable to perform all of the services, including repacking and inspection. Capabilities packages shall include, as a minimum: 1) evidence of past experience and related projects that covers the criteria above, with value/price of past efforts; 2) size of firm, large or small business; 3) whether or not these items and services are provided commercially to non-government agencies; and 4) the capability to support the requirements as identified above. The Government does not intend to pay for any information provided under this notice. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based on this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. This synopsis does not constitute a solicitation, however all responsible sources that believe that can meet all of the requirements may submit a quote, which shall be considered. If no responses are received by 4:00 p.m. Pacific Standard Time, 15 April 2011, a Sole Source contract will be pursued with Airborne Systems.

<DESC>In accordance with FAR subpart 6.302-1, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) intends to issue a sole source contract to Cerner Corporation in St. Louis, MO The purpose of this procurement is to procure a follow on contract for the Combined Activity to Abstract Data from Persons Receiving Ambulatory Care for HIV Infection in the United States. This activity covers medical data abstraction in two CDC studies, the HOPS Study, ongoing since 1993, and the SUN Study on-going since 2002. Both projects collect continuous real-time clinical outcomes and demographic data on a cohort of HIV-infected patients at a select number of HIV-specialty clinics nationwide. Cerner is the only known vendor with the ability to generate long-term longitudinal data on a contemporary cohort while ensuring the validity of the data. Furthermore, the data is currently being collected on proprietary software that is only available to Cerner. Utilization of other sources would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition. Interested parties who feel that they possess the capabilities to provide the services described above should submit a capability statement demonstrating their abilities to provide the services. The information received in response to this notice will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct a competitive requirement. Please send your documentation to Sharon Cunningham at the office identified above, by email at cux0@cdc.gov. Documentation should be received within fifteen (15) days after the date of publication of this synopsis to be considered by CDC. A determination by the CDC not to compete this proposed contract, based upon responses to this notification, is solely within discretion of the government.

<DESC>Announcement of Opportunity<br />(RFP) 1410-00005<br />Request for Proposals for providing Dissolved Oxygen and Dissolved Nitrate Instruments on Fixed Platforms (OOI)
<p>The Consortium for Ocean Leadership, Inc. (hereinafter referred to as "Ocean Leadership"), with funding from the National Science Foundation, is soliciting proposals from qualified organizations interested in providing two classes of instruments--dissolved oxygen (O2) instruments (DO2) and dissolved nitrate (NO3-) instruments (NUTNR)--and related services to support the objective of the Ocean Observatories Initiative (OOI). The OOI will construct a networked infrastructure of oceanic sensor systems to measure physical, chemical, geological, and biological variables in the ocean and seafloor. The measurements of dissolved oxygen and dissolved nitrate in water are vital to our understanding of many of the crucial scientific questions to which the OOI can provide answers.</p>
<p>Ocean Leadership is seeking firms who are interested in submitting proposals for the DO2 and NUTNR Instruments. Offerors may submit proposals for either or both of these classes. The selected firm(s) will provide approximately 78 DO2 Instruments across 5 different series and approximately 28 NUTNR instruments across 2 different series for deployment on fixed platforms at OOI arrays.</p>
<p>The two classes of instruments may be awarded separately or both may be awarded to the same vendor. For the DO2 Instruments, Ocean Leadership may issue a single award for all CLINs or up to five single-CLIN awards. For the NUTNR instruments, Ocean Leadership may issue a single award for all CLINs or up to two single-CLIN awards. Ocean Leadership will not make more than one award for any one series of instruments within an instrument class.</p>
<p>Ocean Leadership is the only point of contact for this procurement.</p>
<p>Potential Offerors who intend to submit a proposal should plan on participating in an online informational Bidders' Conference (via WebEx) to be held on April 1, 2011.

Funding is provided by USFWS Office of Subsistence Management (OSM) through project 10-406.  USFWS AFWFO will install and operate a weir at the outlet of McLees Lake, count the sockeye escapement into the lake, and sample a portion of the escapement for age, sex, and length (ASL).  A scale will be collected from these fish from which age is determined.  ASL data will be sent to Alaska Department of Fish and Game (ADFG, contractor).  This contract provides funding for ADFG to age the scales and provide a data file and summary to USFWS AFWFO of the age, sex, and length for each sampled fish. ADFG is a co-investigator in this project.  ADFG serves in several roles including management agency for the subsistence fishery in question, as well as the only agency that historically assessed this sockeye return.  ADFG has a long history of expertise in aging salmon scales from a myriad of fisheries and escapements; including these very sockeye.  ADFG, Kodiak has an aging lab and can incorporate assessment of these samples in a timely manner.   The services can only be obtained from ADFG due to their unique technical expertise; no other source can provide this service

<DESC>In accordance with FAR 6.305(b) and (d)(3), this special notice is provided for informational purposes only.  This opportunity was only offered to the contractor awarded under solicitation no. N9512100031 (Contract no. C9512100031 - Rognlin's, Inc.).  The Government awarded contract modification no. 0002 for additional work within scope, as described in the justification below.

JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION / Over $100,000 (FAR 6.303-2)
1.  Identification of the Agency and the Contracting Activity:  US Dept. of the Interior, National Park Service, Olympic National Park, Port Angeles, Washington.
2.  Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Approved:  Non-competitive award to Rognlin's, Inc. for contract modification no. 0002 to contract no. C9512100031, Hoh Septic System, Olympic National Park.
3.  A Description of the Supplies or Services Required to Meet the Agency's Needs, Including the Estimated Value:  This action is to modify contract no. C9512100031 for additional work within scope, for the contractor to supply and install new septic tanks at each of the four comfort stations in the Hoh Campground within Olympic National Park.  Per original design, the contractor removed the individual septic tanks from each comfort station because, under the new design, grey water and solids would flow from the comfort stations directly to a newly-constructed lift station. The contract specifications and design failed to address the grade/slope of an existing 4-inch underground pipe at the comfort station located the greatest distance (approx. 1100 feet) from the new lift station.  The contractor's LOSS report, prepared by a licensed engineer, indicated concern that the 4-inch pipe which previously only carried grey water, would also be carrying solids that would have to travel a much greater distance to the new lift station and septic tanks.   Based on these issues, the Washington State Dept. of Health (DOH) refused to permit the new septic system.  Between late January through February 2011 a number of engineering solutions were explored by the National Park Service.  The preferred solution involves the placement of a 3,000 gallon septic tank at each of the four comfort stations that will collect solids. Grey water will flow through to the larger system. This solution was reviewed and approved by the DOH.  Olympic National Park is confident that installation of the new tanks at each comfort station, in lieu of changing the grade/slope of the 4-inch pipe, or lowering the depth of the lift station, is the most efficient and economical solution to obtaining a fully functional septic system.  The value of this procurement is $166,000.
4.  An Identification of the Statutory Authority Permitting Other Than Full and Open Competition:  The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-2, "Unusual and compelling urgency."
5.  A Demonstration That the Proposed Contractor's Unique Qualifications or the Nature of the Acquisition Requires Use of the Authority Cited:  The U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service has established the date of April 1, 2011 as the start of the early breeding season of the Marbled Murrelet.  In accordance with the Endangered Species Act, all high decibel construction work must be completed prior to April 1st.  This comprises a significant portion of the proposed contract modification
6.  A Description of Efforts Made to Ensure That Offers Are Solicited From as Many Potential Sources as is Practicable, Including Whether a Notice Was or Will Be Publicized as Required by FAR Subpart 5.2 and, If Not, Which Exception Under FAR 5.202 Applies:  This action will not be synopsized pursuant to FAR 5.202(a)(2), which provides an exception to the requirement for synopsis based on the urgent nature of the acquisition.  
7.  A Determination By the Contracting Officer That the Anticipated Cost to the Government Will Be Fair and Reasonable:  Based upon analysis of the proposed price in the amount of $161,500, the Contracting Officer determines the cost of the modification to be fair and reasonable.
8.  A Description of the Market Research Conducted (see FAR Part 10) and the Results or a Statement of the Reason Market Research Was Not Conducted:  The original contract was competed, as required by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act.  The original contractor is bound by the terms of the contract to provide Olympic National Park with a fully functional septic system.  No market research was conducted.
9.  Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other Than Full and Open Competition (see FAR 6.302-2 (9) (i) - (iii) for some examples):  The Hoh Rainforest receives the highest visitation of any area within Olympic National Park.  Failure to establish a functional system within the parameters of the U.S. Fish & Wildlife deadline will require the National Park Service to shut down the Hoh campground for the entire spring and summer seasons.  
10.  A Listing of the Sources, If Any, That Expressed in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition:  None.
11.  A Statement of the Actions, If Any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome    Any Barriers to Competition Before Any Subsequent Acquisition for the Supplies or Services Required:  Based upon the urgency of the requirement, no additional efforts will be made to obtain competition at this time.  Any competitive effort would result in a significant delay in completion of the septic system, and would also result in significant inconvenience to the public.
12.  Certification:  
I certify that any supporting data that is the responsibility of technical or requirements personnel (i.e. verifying the Government's minimum needs or schedule requirements or other rationale for other than full and open competition) and which form a basis for the justification have been certified as complete and accurate:
/s/ Carl E Elleard, COR/Civil Engineer, Olympic National Park   03/01/2011

I certify that the justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief:

<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.25in; mso-layout-grid-align: none"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'">(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.25in; mso-layout-grid-align: none"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'">(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159.

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested, and a seperate written solicitation will not be issued.
The solicitation number for this request is F11PS00543 and the solicitation is issued as a request for quote (RFQ).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through the current Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC 2005-50).
This is a small-business set-aside procurement under NAICS classification code: 541360 and PSC code: T006.  The small business size standard is $4.5M.
BACKGROUND:Wildlife managers routinely conduct aerial surveys of waterfowl as a means of tracking population size and trend. Correct identification of species is critical to most surveys.  All aerial observers struggle with waterfowl identification to some degree, and new inexperienced observers are continually entering the work force.  To date, no comprehensive guide to waterfowl identification has been developed specifically for aerial observers.  
Historically, previous video shoots have used a Bell 206B3 Jet Ranger.  
We intend to create a multi-media guide to improve aerial waterfowl identification, survey training, and standardize protocols.  The guide focuses specifically on aerial surveys with a "top-down" perspective of birds and will include all North American waterfowl and some waterbirds that are routinely encountered during aerial surveys (e.g., coots, loons, murres, grebes, cormorants).  The intended audience is professional wildlife biologists and other aerial observers, including those associated with private conservation organizations, and environmental consultants.
The goal of the project is to develop a user-friendly training manual and identification guide to standardize and enhance observer training and improve waterfowl identification and counting from the air.   The Guide will ultimately have two parts:  a Handbook:  a 6 x 9 inch sturdy, spiral bound handbook for in-flight use, and a DVD for on-the-ground training and reference.   
The DVD will use high-definition video clips to aid in species identification and training.  For each species, we will include the following video sequence:a.	Aerial video of a bird on the water (narrator points out key characteristics, particularly for the male ducks, highlighted with arrows/circles; includes both close-up and distant perspectives)  b.	Aerial video of birds flushing (narrator points out how it jumps, or skitters, or dives )c.	Aerial video of birds in flight - slow motion (narrator points out the key characteristics to look for during flight, complemented with arrows)d.	Aerial video of birds in flight - normal speed (narrator points out rapidity of wingbeat, how erratic the flight is, how close to the water they fly, etc.)e.	Aerial video of birds landing (some species have distinctive landing patterns, such as apparent "crash-landing")
Note:  The production of the Handbook and DVD is entirely outside the scope of work for this project and described here for your information only.  This project involves only the acquisition of appropriate video footage and the transfer of that footage to the Service, as described in more detail below.  
Examples of previous video products for this project can be downloaded then viewed at http://www.fws.gov/filedownloads/ftp_Doug_Canfield_Videos/Waterfowl/
The USFWS, Alaska region (headquartered in Anchorage) is leading this effort and seeks a contractor that will provide high definition aerial videography for a variety of bird species.  Several shooting locations in North America will be required to obtain adequate footage for all target species.  South Dakota is one location that harbors a high diversity of breeding waterfowl and is thus a relatively efficient area for obtaining video footage for many species. Most of these species are routinely encountered in South Dakota during spring, however, the USFWS project manager may decide to drop or substitute species from this list if they are not available for video capture.   
List of target species for videography in South Dakota include:Waterfowl: Canada Goose, Common Goldeneye, Bufflehead, Hooded Merganser, Lesser Scaup, Redhead, Canvasback, Ruddy Duck, Ring-necked Duck, Gadwall, Mallard, Northern Pintail, Green-winged Teal, Blue-winged, Teal, American Wigeon, Northern Shoveler, Wood Duck
Other waterbirds(second priority): American Coot, Purple Swamphen, Double-crested Cormorant, Great Egret, Great Blue Heron, Black-crowned Night Heron, American Bittern, Pied-billed Grebe, Western Grebe, Eared Grebe
In addition to video footage of birds, there may be footage obtained for wetland assessment and to illustrate various aspects of waterfowl survey methodology. 
The location for this project will be in Aberdeen, South Dakota and vicinity.  Aberdeen is a full service community with an airport (Aberdeen Regional Airport) and available jet fuel.  
SCOPE OF WORK AND SPECIFICATIONS: The Service will be procuring the use of a helicopter through the Aviation Management Directorate (AMD) utilizing a separate contracting method.  The helicopter operator will be selected after this videography contract is awarded, and their location will likely be in the mid-west states.   
During videography flights, there will be one USFWS Government observer in the front seat who will help direct the pilot and camera operator to target birds, identify bird species, and confirm that the video footage is appropriate for meeting the scope of work as outlined in this RFP.  The additional observer will require a separate monitor, to be provided by the Contractor. 
Flights will only be conducted when wind speeds are less than 15 mph, skies are bright overcast or sunny, and there is no fog or precipitation that would obscure the camera lens or otherwise compromise the quality of the video footage.  Flight altitude will vary from about 100-500 ft agl.  Flight speeds will vary from a hover to up to 100 mph.  Flights will at times be over water or marsh.
The Service of the videographer shall be unit-priced using a daily rate.  The quantity specified for the videographer services are estimated and may vary based on weather conditions and availability of target species.  The Service shall guarantee a minimum of three days, maximum 7 days, for the video shoot.  Payment shall be made for actual number of days that the camera is used to capture aerial video footage described in the objective.  
Insurances to be included with the AMD helicopter procurement. 
The Contractor will meet all of the following requirements:
1.	Videography flight will commence between May 15 and May 23, 2011 (at contractor's discretion; dates to be agreed upon no later than April 20).   2.	Contractor shall provide camera operator and all necessary camera equipment, including a remote video monitor for the front seat observer.3.	Contractor shall ship the camera mount and FTC number and paperwork for that mount to the helicopter operator's home base no more than two working days prior to the start date to allow time for installation.4.	Contractor shall demonstrate ability to capture sharp and smooth (i.e., follow focus) video, from a moving helicopter, of small moving targets (such as individual animals in flight or objects otherwise moving).  a.	Contractor shall submit a maximum of three (3) recent and relevant descriptions of aerial videography showing experience to include samples of relevant video footage.5.	Contractor shall employ the use of a gyro-stabilized camera platform with a high definition lens with power of 42x9.5mm plus a lens doubler, or equivalent.  The camera platform shall be a Cineflex or equivalent controllable, color, high definition (HD), 1080 resolution, progressive, gyro-stabilized system with a recorder capable of capturing 1080 progressive 59.94 frames per second.  The camera system must be a gimbal type capable of filming birds to the right, left, front, behind, and below helicopter, at varying altitudes, and will be mounted on the nose of the helicopter.   Although the camera mounting hardware will be installed at the helicopter contractor's home base, the camera itself will be installed at the project site under the supervision of the videographer.  6.	Contractor shall be responsible for the acquisition and operating cost of all camera equipment, transportation of camera operator and equipment to and from Aberdeen, South Dakota, lodging and per diem costs for the operator, tapes, footage transferring, hard drives and shipping to the USFWS project manager. 7.	The footage shall be captured at a resolution of not less than 1920 x1080 progressive frames, 60 frames per second, and all raw footage obtained while filming shall be delivered to the Service project manager on a portable hard drive at full resolution no later than June 15, 2011.  8.	Contractor will download and back up all video footage to a hard drive on a daily basis.  In addition, the footage must be made available daily in a format that allows the Project Manager to review footage expediently (i.e., during the evening) to evaluate video quality and progress toward meeting video needs for all target species (for example, a Compact Flash recorder and viewing software compatible with a PC).9.	Contractor will be required to wear required protective equipment, including a nomex suit, helmet with aircraft-compatible intercom system, leather boots, and gloves (providing it does not significantly interfere with ability to operate camera equipment).10.

Informatica software is the only software that works in the current IRS environment because it is highly scalable, enables B2B data exchange, Data governance, Data migration, Data synchronization and replication, Enterprise data warehousing, Integration Competency Centers (ICC), Master data management (MDM) and Service-oriented architectures (SOA).  Informatica offers all of the above required functions in one software package whereas multiple applications would have to be procured thereby vastly increasing the cost and compatibility issues.  Changing software configurations would have a major impact on the performance of the network, learning curve, and could potentially jeopardize the timelines for critical milestones to be achieved.  If new software was introduced into the network there could be numerous compatibility issues and potential loss of functionality in current programs which in turn could also jeopardize critical milestones and the ability to complete future tax filing seasons. The use of Quests Informaticas software is essential to the Governments requirements, thereby precluding consideration of a product manufactured by another company. 
The Government has determined that only Quest Informatica software maintenance products will meet the Governments needs.  Only brand name products will be considered.  Equal or comparable products will not be considered.  If a vendor submits a proposal with a comparable product the vendor will not be considered for award.  The vendor shall be an authorized reseller/provider of Quest Informatica products.  

The period of performance for this order will be 5/1/2011  4/30/2012.
The following clauses will apply to this order:  FAR 52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items (March 2009), FAR 52.227-14 Rights in Data-General (Dec 2007), FAR 52.227-19 Commercial Computer Software License (Dec 2007), FAR 52.232-33, IR1052.224-9000(a) Disclosure of Information-Safeguards (January 1998), IR1052.224-9000(c) Disclosure of Information  Safeguards (Nov 2005), IR1052.239-9008 (standards a-c): Section 508 - Information, Documentation, and Support (Sep 2006), 1052.239-9009 (Provision 1194.21 standards b, d-l; 1194.22 standards a-p and Provision 1194.31 standards a-f):  Section 508 Conformance (Sep 2006).  FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications  Commercial Items, also applies to this order.  The vendor shall submit a completed copy of the provision with its offer.
Responsible sources who believe they can provide the required product shall submit a completed Informatica Pricing Spreadsheet (attached), written capability statement, via email, no later than 10 am ET on April 5, 2011.  Contact Jennifer Henley at 202-283-1670 for questions regarding the solicitation.  The award will be made on a low-price technically acceptable basis to the vendor who meets the Governments requirements and offers the lowest price.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with FAR Parts 12 and 13, as supplemented with additional information in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a separate solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation Number NEED2000-11-02568 is being issued as a Request for Quotation. The North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) is 541330 and business size of $4.5M. The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service (NEDSIS), Office of Research and Applications (E/RA), has a project to Diagnosing Temporal Trends in Thunderstorm Severity Using Coupled Proxy GOES-R Advanced Baseline Imager and Global Lightning Mapper Data. This project will use a satellite-based "storm severity index" product to understand temporal trends in thunderstorm severity and make recommendations for future GOES-R products and applications. Items such as turbulence, convective-initiation, and overshooting-top/enhanced-V signatures are all important parameters for geostationary operational environmental satellites (GOES) to calculate. In the future a Global Lightning Mapper (GLM) and an Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) will be available on GOES-R. Derived GLM/ABI products are a natural fit into enhancing and understanding possible severe storm and aviation-related applications. This task is to evaluate the usefulness of a Storm Severity Index product to identify temporal trends in thunderstorm severity. DELIVERABLES: 1) Correlate the satellite-based storm severity index product with MSG SEVIRI static spectral data and TRMM/LIS data as proxies for the GOES-R ABI and GLM instruments; 2) Correlate the temporal trends in the MSG SEVIRI spectral data as well as anvil expansion rates, coupled with lightning flash-rate data from TRMM/LIS with the satellite-based storm severity index product; 3) Investigate differences in storm intensity indicators between an all-land domain and all-ocean domain in the Equatorial Africa and Atlantic Ocean region; and 4) Document the results of 1-3 in a peer-review quality paper along with recommendations for future GOES-R products and applications. Period of Performance: Date of Award through March 30, 2012. The resulting purchase order shall negotiated on a firm fixed price. The award shall be made on a best value basis. Best value evaluation factors include the following: 1) Technical Approach - The likelihood of effectively meeting the requirements; 2) Past Performance - The relevance and quality of prior performance; and 3) Price - The amount, realism and consistency of the evaluated price. The evaluation shall be based on use of the adjectival scheme as follows: Excellent (E) - Superior or first class; Good (G) - Beneficial and worthwhile; sound and valid; Marginal (M) - Minimally suitable at the lower limit; Unsatisfactory (U) - No acceptable, not adequate to carry out. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-50.

Item 0001
Calibration Alignment Tool Sets
Quantity 3 each
Alignment Tool Set consists of the following:
	800-268-PL Alignment Tool
	800-275-PL Mirror Tool Set
	800-273-PL Legs
	Laser Energy Probe Meter

Item Specifications:

1.) 800-268-PL Alignment Tool: This is a flat aluminum plate with a reference mirror bonded into it. It attaches to the front of the VEO-2 housing to form an optical reference to the front mounting features on the collimator. An external autocollimator is aligned to this mirror to establish the optical line of sight.
 Please see attached drawing.
2.) 800-275-PL Mirror Tool Set: This part covers a selection of tools used during the alignment process:
Three pedestals (one tall, two short) are attached to the bottom of the collimator housing to raise it up so that the lower front of the collimator can be easily accessed; Six adjuster tools that are used to unlock, adjust and lock the Hughes Adjusters in the mirror mounts within the collimator assembly. Three Tee-handle hex wrenches that are used with the adjuster tools to lock the center part of the Hughes Adjusters. Three optical feet that are used to secure the three pedestals to an optical table. Three threaded studs for attaching the pedestals to the collimator.
 Three washers. Please see drawing.
3.) 800-273-PL Legs: Includes pedestal pillar post, 1 inch; pedestal pillar post, 4 inch; small clamping fork; screw, HSHC, .250-20 x .750 Stud; 8-32 thread, 1.5 inch; insert 8-32 int, -28 ext; insert -28 int, 3/8-24 ext; adhesive threadlock 222.Please see drawing.
4.) Laser Energy Probe Meter:The Head is intended to measure the pulse power and shape of pulsed semiconductor lasers at the low levels obtained in the far field. It has a small receiving Head containing an aspheric lens with the photo-diode in the focal plane.  It is therefore strongly directionally sensitive. It is really only suitable for measurements of essentially parallel light aligned with the Head axis.
 The Head output is measured by a fast 50 'Scope to make power measurements. All the circuitry in the Head is impedance matched throughout to give the fastest possible response and to prevent re-reflection of any signals reflected back down the cable from the 'Scope.
Wavelength range:950nm to 1650nm (GaInAs detector).
Active aperture:	22mm  
Beam Angle: 	For an exactly parallel beam the alignment should be within 4.0degrees of the Head axis.  In practice it should be easy to keep within 2degrees.
Beam position:	Less than 3% variation as a narrow beam scans across the aperture. 
Polarization:	Less than 1% variation as polarization is changed.
Response time:	The response to a step edge is 8ns (10-90%).
 (Approximately 46MHz)
		Response to a short impulse is 11ns FWHM   
		The response to a Gaussian pulse of 25ns FWHM is 27.4ns FWHM
All these times are limited by the electronics. The detector itself has a response time of less than 1.5ns.
Signal Output:This Model needs calibrated for power (rather than power density); 79SB-02 is nominally130mV/mW
at 1550nm, 44mV/mW at 1065nm. These outputs are into 50 load at 'Scope.
Absolute Accuracy of Calibration:	3.8% at calibration wavelengths 
Max. Linear Output: 2.8V into 50 (approximately 21mW @1550nm or 65mW @1065nm)
Noise levels: 5.0mV P-P (giving NEP of 40W @1550nm or 110W P-P @1065nm). 
Dynamic range:	560:1 (Sat. signal/P-P Noise) 
Temperature Coefficient:   less than 0.1%/C from 1000nm to 1600nm.
 
Detector Bias: The particular GaInAs diode in S.N 79SB-01 is biased at 24 Volts (determined by a Zener diode in the Head).  This is the maximum bias which is safe for this particular diode.
AC Coupling: The AC Coupling time constant of the output when driving a 50 load is 10s. Thus any flat topped pulse longer than 200ns will have a droop of more than 1%. 
Output Socket: 50 BNC on side of Head. This must go to a 50 'Scope or the 50 load of a transient analyzer. 
Power Socket: 7 way DIN Socket 
Head Size: 70 mm diameter x  68 mm long
Head Mounting: 	M6 (="O"BA) thread in principle plane of lens.
Power Supply:Stand Alone PSU powers the Head (+ 15V, -15V, +70V), The 70V is reduced to 24V by a Zener diode in the Head Input set for 120V AC

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  <br><br>1.  CONTRACT INFORMATION:  These contracts are being procured in accordance with the Brooks A-E Act as implemented in FAR Subpart 36.6.  Firms will be selected for negotiation based on demonstrated competence and qualifications for the required work.  See Numbered Note 24 for general information on the A-E selection process.  The services will consist of core drilling and geotechnical subsurface sampling via continuous and/or standard SPT techniques, large diameter coring within rock units, sonic drilling, vibracoring, field and in situ testing, geophysical site investigations, field and laboratory testing of materials (including construction Q/A testing), chemical analytical laboratory testing, site preparation, and establishing coordinate locations for projects located within the Florida boundaries of the Jacksonville District, Puerto Rico, U.S. Virgin Islands, and the Caribbean area.  The primary purpose of these proposed contracts are to provide services for projects located within the geographic boundaries of the Jacksonville District.  Secondarily, these contracts may be used to provide services within the geographic boundaries of the other U.S. Army Corps of Engineers districts within the South Atlantic Division.  The contractor will have the right to refuse orders for services to be performed outside the geographic boundaries of the Jacksonville District.  North American Industrial Classification System code is 541330, which has a size standard of $4,500,000 in average annual receipts.  It is the intent of the Government to initially award combination.  However, if there are no highly qualified 8(a) small businesses, the award will be made from the highly qualified small business firms.  No one firm will receive more than one award as a result of this solicitation.  Only firms considered highly qualified will be awarded a contract.  Indefinite delivery contracts will be negotiated and awarded from this solicitation with subsequent work issued by negotiated firm-fixed-price task orders.  This announcement will result in up to two (2) awards.  Criteria used in allocating task orders among contracts include performance and quality of deliverables under current task orders, current capacity to accomplish the order in the required time, specialized experience, equitable distribution of the work among the contractors, and other relevant factors.  The contracts will be for a period of one year from date of award, with options to extend for four additional years; not to exceed a total of five years.  While the estimated dollar amount per year is $1,000,000.00, the actual obligation per year may be greater than or less than the $1,000,000.00.  Maximum order limit is $5,000,000.00 for the life of the contract, including options.  The Director of Defense Procurement has issued a final rule requiring that contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database before receiving a contract from any activity of the Department of Defense.  The rule authorizes contracting officers to reject offers from contractors that have not registered.  For more information, visit the CCR website at http://www.ccr.gov.  You must also be registered in Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) in order to receive an award from this solicitation.  The ORCA website is located at http://orca.bpn.gov.  <br><br>2.  PROJECT INFORMATION:  Services will include core drilling and geotechnical subsurface sampling via continuous and/or standard SPT techniques, large diameter coring within rock units, sonic drilling, vibracoring, field and in situ testing, geophysical site investigations, field and laboratory testing of materials (including construction Q/A testing), chemical analytical laboratory testing, site preparation, and establishing coordinate locations. Use of automatic hammers and strict adherence to calibration requirements will be required. Use of manual hammers with appropriate calibration will be accepted by exception only and must be approved in advance. Maximum possible recovery of sampled materials is mandatory. A geologist or geotechnical engineer, knowledgeable in the geology of Florida, must observe all drilling operations and prepare detailed field logs to document sampling procedures and materials recovered. A registered surveyor must validate all coordinate locations and elevations obtained. Firms will be required to maintain, either in-house or through association with qualified subcontractors, Corps of Engineers validated geotechnical laboratory testing facilities for each test type during the performance period of the basic contract and all task orders. Firms will be required to submit documentation confirming that it has obtained or is in the process of obtaining Corps of Engineers validation of geotechnical laboratory testing facilities for this contract at time of contract award. No task orders will be issued until Corps of Engineers validation of geotechnical laboratory testing facilities has been successfully completed. The chemical analytical laboratory performing chemical analysis of environmental samples must participate in USEPA's National Environmental Laboratory Accreditation Program (NELAP) and be accredited by the State of Florida's accrediting authority, Department of Health, where applicable. The analytical laboratory must be capable of analyzing environmental samples utilizing USEPA-derived analytical methods and have a sound quality assurance program.

The Government may at any time conduct audits (including requests for pertinent data or information) to confirm compliance with the specified chemical analytical laboratory requirements. A summary geotechnical report including an expert opinion and geotechnical recommendations will be required as part of each assignment.<br><br>3.

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>8. STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) was created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID to help local partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries. Seizing critical windows of opportunity, OTI works on the ground to provide fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations. OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the organization's programmatic goals and objectives.</p>
<p>DCHA/OTI is an exciting, fast-paced, operational office in USAID. Program and Operations staff work as a team to ensure country programs are started, managed, and closed efficiently and effectively.</p>
<p>For DCHA/OTI to implement its rapid response strategy, it is essential that OTI PSC staff are deployed and supported expeditiously and programs started quickly, often with little or no lead time. The Administrative Assistant position is a key position in a busy office which responds rapidly to crisis situations. It is essential that DCHA/OTI personnel receive prompt support. To achieve this, OTI requires an Administrative Assistant who has the capacity to work well within a team environment and anticipate the needs of a complex organizational unit.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The Administrative Assistant works closely with other Administrative Assistants and other members of the Operations and Management Division (OMD) as well as the OTI Country Program teams to ensure OTI programs are provided with outstanding administrative support. The Administrative Assistant has responsibility for daily administrative operations in support of OTI program-funded staff in Washington and the field. Approximately 95% of the workload will be in support of program-funded staff and activities in OTI/Washington and the field, and approximately 5% of the workload will also be in support of Direct Hire staff in Washington and the field. Key functions of the Administrative Assistant are to provide general administrative support to a majority program-funded staff, and provide backup support to the other Administrative Assistants and Personnel Assistants in OTI in their absence. It is expected that an initial primary task for this Administrative Assistant will include providing reception and duty officer services for DCHA/OTI staff in a large office space.</p>

<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note: Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC.

The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. HQ Army Material Command, Office of Command Counsel, 9301 Chapek Rd, Room 2-1SE3401, Ft. Belvoir, VA 22060-5527, Facsimile number (703) 806-8866 or 8875.

<DESC>Amendment A001 to Solicitation SB1341-11-RQ-0148 for Vacuum Jacketed (VJ) Multi-Section (Spools) Helium Transfer Lines.<br /><br />The above referenced solicitation is hereby amended to respond to technical questions submitted, attach a new version of Drawing 000-0224 (Attachment 1), and extend the due date for quotations.<br /><br />1.) Technical questions and responses are hereby provided:
<p>QUESTION #1: Specification for testing states for evacuation and bake-out to precede pressure test and mass spectrometer leak test. Would performing a preliminary evacuation for pressure test and mass spectrometer leak test, and then performing bake-out and final evacuation after completion of successful pressure and mass spec leak tests be acceptable?<br /><br />RESPONSE #1: Yes, this procedure is acceptable.</p>
<p>QUESTION #2: Specification for testing states for pneumatic pressure test at 1.5 times the design pressure. In accordance with ASME B31.3, we would perform a pressure test at 150% design pressure if the test were hydrostatic, however for pneumatic pressure test, B31.3 specifies a test pressure of 110% design pressure. Is this acceptable?<br /><br />RESPONSE #2: Yes, this is acceptable.</p>
<p>QUESTION #3: Drawing 000-0224 (Attachment 1) Note Section 4 states the 1.5" flow control valve in the supply line is installed in a 1.5" spool, which has a 1.5" bayonet on one end and transitions to a 2" bayonet on the other end. Please confirm the following:<br />1.) All rigid and flexible supply piping from the CVI female bayonet in Drawing 000-0224 Zone 4-B to the CVI male bayonet in drawing 000-0224 Zone 7-F has a 2" inner line.<br />2.) The tee in the supply piping Drawing 000-0224 Zone 3-E is 2" inner with a 2" bayonet located at the tee branch immediately above the tee, and a 2" x 1.5" reducer immediately above the bayonet.<br />3.) All rigid and flexible supply piping from the 2" x 1.5" reducer to the PHPK male bayonet in Drawing 000-0224 Zone 7-H have a 1.5" inner line.<br />4.) All rigid and flexible return piping have a 2" inner line. <br /><br />RESPONSE #3: The responses are as follows:<br />1.) Correct<br />2.)Correct<br />3.) The spool pieces referred to in Note Section 7 have a 1.5" inner line.<br />4.) All spool pieces (return line) downstream and including the tee have a 2" inner pipe.</p>
<p>QUESTION #4: In Drawing 000-0224 Zone 3-F appears to have the stem and actuator oriented vertically down, below the valve body. Please confirm if any other orientation is possible that would allow the actuator to be higher than the valve body.<br /><br />RESPONSE #4: The valve orientation shown on Drawing 000-0224 is less than optimal. All Contractors are free to propose a more suitable configuration of the spool pieces. Any new configuration must meet NCNR requirements, therefore fit in the present envelope covered in Drawing 000-0224.</p>
<p>QUESTION #5: It appears that the system will be using helium with temperatures down to 14K (-434.5*F). The existing bayonets are not what we would use for those temperatures. A helium bayonet would have a longer nose to prevent frosting and cut down on heat leak. With the exception of the tapping into the existing bayonets, should the rest of the system use similar bayonets or longer nosed helium bayonets?<br /><br />RESPONSE #5: The ends are required to mate with existing equipment (Notes 1, 2, and 3 of Drawing 000-0224). All other connections must meet the specification of cold liquid helium service. The existing connections already meet that requirement, however Contractors may supply any similar bayonet that meet the specification for the connections not covered in Notes 1, 2, and 3 of Drawing 000-0224.</p>
<p>QUESTION #6: Specification for insulation states that 15 layers of aluminized Mylar and Dexter paper minimum. Are more layers acceptable?<br /><br />RESPONSE #6: The specification requires a minimum of 15 layers. Additional layers are acceptable.</p>
<p><br />2.) A clearer version of Drawing 000-0224 (Attachment 1) has been uploaded to the solicitation.</p>
<p>3.) The due date for quotations is hereby extended:</p>
<p>From: 3:00 PM eastern time, on April 4, 2011.</p>
<p>To: 3:00 PM eastern time, on April 11, 2011.</p>

<DESC>This combined synopsis/solicitation is amended to clarify the delivery requirements:
The chip seal oil will be delivered in multiple deliveries of individual orders to occur between 7/5/11 and 9/30/11. The vendor will be contacted a week before deliveries will begin to confirm and coordinate.  Once project begins, the Park will call the vendor a day prior to delivery to order quantities and time for delivery for the next workday.  Product shall be delivered in an insulated 6,000 gallon or greater capacity tank with the oil termperature between 165 - 190 degrees Fahrenheit.  The park will order at least one tanker per day and occasionally two or more.  Due to inclement weather, sudden weather changes, or the fact that the park has limited storage capabilities, it is possible that the Park will be returning oil back to the vendor during these conditions.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to extend the quote submission period to <strong>3:00 PM Alaskan&nbsp;Daylight Time, 5 April 2011,</strong> and to add the questions and answers posed by interested vendors who attended the site visit on 1 April 2011.&nbsp; The questions are as follows:<br /><br />1. Is a wireless system an option?<br />a. No.<br /><br />2. Is there a third party control for the proposed system? <br />a. No. <br /><br />3. Will the proposed system hook into overhead speakers?<br />a. No<br /><br />4. How will the proposed microphones be connected to the audio system of the JOC?<br />a. The system will have one input into the existing Biamp system in the JOC.<br /><br />5. How will the cabling be installed?<br />a. Cabling can be installed with J-hooks or other methods as the available space allows. <br /><br />6. What are the dimensions of the room?<br />a. 60 ft x 55 ft.<br /><br />7. Is a particular color of cabling required?<br />a. Red copper is required to separate this system from the cables of others in the same room/raceways. <br /><br />8. What hours are available for contractor personnel to perform the installation?<br />a. Typical hours of operation are 7 AM - 5 PM, Monday - Friday; however mission operations take precedence and can impact these hours. Contractor should be flexible to accommodate changes in schedule. <br /><br />9. When does installation need to be completed?<br />a. At the very latest, mid-May is the required completion date. <br /><br />10. Is there special consideration for placing cables next to or near cables that carry classified data?<br />a. Yes. Spacing requirements between cables are needed in certain areas. Shielded cables must be at least 5cm away from other cables and non-shielded must be 15cm away from other cables. Contractors shall coordinate with on-site personnel to meet these requirements during installation. <br /><br />11. Is it preferred to quote the proposed installation time in hours or days?<br />a. Contractors can quote how they see fit, as long as they specify how many hours they consider a work day. <br /><br />12. How many microphones are required?<br />a. A total of 34 microphones are required, three of which are chairperson units.<br /><br />13. What are the other features required by this system?<br />a. The system must have the ability to mute speakers. Chairperson units must have the ability to override other delegate microphones. Contractors must include the physical dimensions of the desktop units that will be installed in their proposal. <br /><br />14. What types of access is available in the room?<br />a. All of the floor tiles are removable for access to components in the floor.<br /><br />15. What considerations are there for the work site?<br />a. Base and JOC access will be provided. Contractors should be aware that the JOC is an operational center; therefore any tiles taken up during a work day must be replaced before leaving. The mission may require the contractor to work hours outside of a normal work day.<br /><br />An additional schematic of the electrical underfloor power plan for the JOC has been attached to this solicitation.<br /><br />All other questions should be addressed to <a href="mailto:bethany.carlan@elmendorf.af.mil">bethany.carlan@elmendorf.af.mil</a>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>STATEMENT OF LIMITATIONS ON PERIOD AND PLACE OF PERFORMANCE:</p>
<p>The purpose of this contract is to establish an employee/employer relationship with the contractor to perform services on a temporary, on-call, basis as part of the Support Relief Group (SRG). It is the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) / Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA)'s intent to contract for these services for a maximum of 250 days per calendar year.</p>
<p>The level of effort anticipated under this contract will be provided within the terms of this contract at times mutually agreed to by DCHA/OFDA and the contractor. Upon identification of a temporary need within the scope of work, DCHA/OFDA will contact the contractor and provide the following information:</p>
<p>1. Date contractor is needed to report to DCHA/OFDA or assignment in the field<br />2. Duration of Assignment<br />3. Place of Performance</p>
<p>The contractor will notify DCHA/OFDA within 24 hours of availability. At the time the contractor accepts the assignment, he/she is expected to commit for the duration of the assignment. While the contractor will be required to commit to a certain time period, it is understood that the exigencies of a disaster may require the assignment to be extended (not to exceed 250 days). The Contractor shall notify OFDA at the time of commitment if their existing schedule would preclude an extension. Notification of schedule conflicts shall not necessarily disqualify the contractor from the assignment but will simply assist DCHA/OFDA in recruiting a replacement. Subsequently, if the contractor agrees to an extension of the duration of a particular assignment, thereafter, the contractor will be required to give DCHA/OFDA 10 days notice for release from the assignment.</p>
<p>7. PLACE OF PERFORMANCE: Worldwide</p>
<p>8. STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) is the office within USAID that is responsible for providing emergency non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters. OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) and is organized into three divisions. The Disaster Response and Mitigation Division (DRM) is responsible for the provision of emergency humanitarian assistance through a grants mechanism to non-governmental organizations (NGOs), Private Voluntary Organizations (PVOs), the United Nations agencies and to partners to ensure the implementation and delivery of this assistance. This division also oversees OFDA's non-response efforts in disaster risk reduction. DRM also coordinates with other organizations and donors for the provision of relief supplies and assistance. DRM devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human caused disaster situations with a focus on disaster risk reduction. It encompasses a group of technical sector specialists who provide expert capability in assessing the quality of disaster response and disaster risk reduction activities. The Program Support Division (PS) provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning and guidance, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA's Washington and field offices. The Operations Division (OPS) develops and manages logistical and operational support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations. OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue Teams (SAR), coordinating and supporting Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and the Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs) as needed.</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The Support Relief Group (SRG) is a program developed by OFDA to satisfy its growing need for surge capacity. In response to numerous disasters worldwide, it became clear that OFDA could not find, in a timely manner, adequate staff to cover all positions in the field and in Washington, and to backfill for permanent staff deploying to the field. The SRG program brings on board select candidates who could work on a part-time basis, for no more than 250 days per calendar year, and who can be deployed within hours to facilitate OFDA's response to disasters, or to backfill staff in Washington and other locations. SRG positions are contracted for an initial period of one year with the option to extend up to five years.</p>
<p>The SRG program is managed by the Overseas Administration Team (OAT) in OFDA/OPS. This team maintains a database for all contracted Support Relief Group staff and provides information to the rest of the office on their availability, skills and previous OFDA experience. OAT assists the program offices within OFDA in choosing the best qualified SRG for any specific task, and provides administrative and personnel support to existing SRG. Each SRG incumbent will provide enhancement to the OFDA team according to his/her skills. They will be considered part of OFDA-Washington resources that can be deployed worldwide. At times they may also be a resource for the DCHA. Foreign language ability in one or more major world languages is preferred.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>OFDA requires SRG generalists to meet its surge capacity objectives, and to strengthen its capability to support OFDA's mandate and the delivery of humanitarian assistance around the world.</p>
<p>9. CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note: personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<DESC>Counterfire Target Acquisition Radar Full Rate Production (FRP) Synopsis<br><br>The United States Army, Army Contracting Command (ACC) APG-C4ISR, Aberdeen Maryland, 21005 intends to procure EQ-36 Radar systems that will serve to be the Army's replacement for the AN/TPQ-36 and 37 radars. This procurement will meet TRADOC requirements in the Capability Production Document (CPD) dated 11 June 2010.The enhanced capabilities of this radar will provide the Warfighter with continuous and responsive counter-battery target acquisition for all types and phases of military operations. It will detect projectiles in-flight, as well as determine and communicate the firing point location of mortars, artillery, and rockets. It will be deployable and capable of operation in varying terrain and climatic conditions. The system shall provide 360 degree azimuth coverage against all threats at increased ranges, enhanced human machine interface, ease of programmability, and built-in capacity for growth. It also will accurately locate and classify hostile weapon locations at greater ranges and coverage patterns to permit more effective detection and counter-battery.<br><br>The Contracting Officer, Army Contracting Command, APG, MD, is posting this formal announcement of a pending competitive Request for Proposal (RFP). The resultant contract will be Firm Fixed Price (FFP)/ with range quantities for systems and spares. In addition, engineering support and related services will be solicited in this RFP on a Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) basis. The total anticipated value of the contract is approximately $940M. The basic contract is planned to procure 16 Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) systems and spares in FY-11 to support Development Test 1/ Limited User Test (DT1/LUT and Development Test 2 and Initial Operational Test & Evaluation (DT2/IOT&E) as well as user fieldings. DT1 must be completed to support entrance into LUT NLT 21 Months after contract award. DT2 must be completed to support entrance into IOT&E NLT 33 Months after contract award. In order to establish an initial production base for the system, and permit orderly ramp up to the full production rate, a second LRIP option is planned to procure 23 systems and spares. An option for an initial year of Full Rate Production (FRP) to procure 32 additional systems is planned to complete the total production quantity to be procured under this contract. Training will also be acquired on a FFP basis. Contract award will be made based on the best value proposal that is determined to be the most beneficial to the Government, with appropriate consideration given to the four (4) evaluation factors: Technical, Performance Risk, Cost/Price, and Small Business Participation Plan.  <br><br>The Source Selection will include a Live Ammunition System Demonstration (LASD).  The LASD will encompass the following scenarios of live ammunition system demonstration in both 90 degree and 360 degree mode for rockets, artillery and mortars: launch point location, hostile impact location, friendly fire registration, volley fire, simultaneous fire, and single weapon fire. Additionally, demonstrations will be held for false weapon locations in 90 degree and 360 degree mode. Interoperability will also be demonstrated.  Data will be collected and Subject Matter Expert (SME) survey information will be collected to assess areas such as System Safety, Maintainability, Emplacement/Displacement and Human Factors areas in relation to requirements in the Performance Specification.  LASD demonstrations are currently expected to start on or about 8 July 2011.<br>This notice is to inform Industry of a forthcoming  Request for Proposal, Solicitation Number W15P7T-11-R-T201 is assigned for reference purposes.

<DESC>This announcement revises PRE-SOLICITATION NOTICE  - R11PS30233 to correct the authority to solicit this action on a noncompetitive sole source basis.  All other information remains the same.
THIS PRE-SOLICITATION NOTICE WILL BE ADVERTISED AS A NONCOMPETITIVE SOLE SOURCE SOLICITATION.    The statutory authority for use of other than full and open competition for this transaction is the Test Programs for Commercial Items (section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996) or the Services Acquisition Reform Act of 2003 (41 U.S.C. 428a).
Requirement: The Bureau of Reclamation, Boulder Canyon Operation Office (BCOO), Boulder City, Nevada (Reclamation) has a requirement for annual user maintenance and support as well as annual upgrades and enhancements for RiverWare.  (Product Service Code: D302 - Advanced Data Processing (ADP) Systems Development and NAICS Code 541511 Custom Computer Programming Services).   It is Reclamation's intent to award a five (5) year, Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity Type contract, on a sole source basis to the University of Colorado's, Center for Advanced Decision Support for Water and Environmental Systems (CADSWES), 3100 Marine Street, Room 481, Boulder City, CO 80309-0572 to support this requirement.  This contract will have a guaranteed minimum award dollar value of $180,000 and a maximum award dollar value that shall not exceed $1,000,000 over the five year performance period.  
Since 1993, Reclamation, the Tennessee Valley Authority and CADSWES have participated in a collaborative research and development program to develop decision support tools for water management.  Riverware is a major application that was developed from this program.  RiverWare plays an integral role in the daily scheduling and monitoring of water deliveries along the Lower Colorado River System.  The scheduling and monitoring of this volume of water via a system of dams, powerplants and diversion canals requires that RiverWare be operational at all times.  To remain operational, annual user support, software upgrades and enhancements are required.  Professional software standards are applied to maintain a reliable, robust, version-controlled software product that is exclusively licensed through the University of Colorado Technology Transfer Office.  RiverWare is proprietary software that is exclusively maintained, supported developed and enhanced by CADSWES.  The support, development and enhancements required by Reclamation are identified annually and require changes to the RiverWare source code to implement.  These changes can only be accomplished by CADSWES.  As there are no known commercially available applications that can meet the specific needs of Reclamation, the Government intends to solicit this requirement on a noncompetitive basis.   
This procurement will be awarded using Commercial - Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  Award is anticipated to be made in mid June 2011 and run for a five year period ending in June 2016.   The resulting contract will be a firm fixed price type.  
The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source for this requirement.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.   Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement.   
The contract award information will be posted on the Federal Business Opportunities website (FBO) at (www.fedbizopps.gov).  The Justification and Approval for using noncompetitive procedures will be posted after an award is made at the following address: http://www.usbr.gov/mso/aamd/doing-business-acquisitions-noncompetitive.html 
The point of contact for this acquisition is Liz Bailey eebailey@usbr.gov  or call 702-293-8460.

<DESC>Proposal Disallowed Reason: This is a synopsis of upcoming acquisition; therefore, proposals cannot be submitted directly with this notice. Actual solicitation will be posted at a later date.
<p>The Department of Energy (DOE), National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) to procure Security Protective Force and Systems Services in support of the Nevada National Security Site (NNSS), the Remote Sensing Laboratory on the northeast portion of Nellis Air Force Base, and the North Las Vegas Facility, which includes A, B and C complexes and Nevada Support Facility, which is headquarters for the NNSA Nevada Site Office (NSO) operations.</p>
<p>The uniformed security protective force at NNSA/NSO is a bargaining unit represented by the Independent Guard Association of Nevada, a union that has been in existence since the 1960s. The successful offeror awarded the ensuing contract would be bound by the terms of the current Collective Bargaining Agreement which was effective in 2009 and expires in 2014. The actual Protective Force strength is dependent upon operational and funding requirements and is currently authorized at 195 Security Police Officers and 41 Duty Officers. It is anticipated the contract type will be a Modified Cost-Plus-Award-Fee with fixed, non-fee bearing labor rates with fee earned through the award-fee process. The total term of the contract is anticipated to be five years.</p>
<p>The overall objective of this contract will be to provide continuous protective force services 24 hours a day, 365 days per year at the NNSA/NNSS, Remote Sensing Laboratory, and North Las Vegas Facility in accordance with DOE and NNSA requirements under both routine and emergency conditions. The mission of the Security Protective Force Contractor is the physical protection of security interests to include Nuclear Explosive Devices, Special Nuclear Material, National Security Operations and Vital Equipment, Classified and Sensitive Information, Property, and Unclassified Facilities.</p>
<p>NNSA plans to issue the RFP early May 2011 with proposals due approximately mid to late June 2011. This will be a competitive requirement using &lsquo;Full &amp; Open Competition' procedures.

Question:  Please provide information specific to the Indirect Cost Services Directorate at NBC.Government Response:  The mission of the National Business Center's Office Indirect Cost Series (ICS) Directorate is to negotiate indirect cost rates in accordance with federal government regulations, 2 CFR 255 and 230, formerly Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circulars A-87 and A-122, respectively.  Annually, ICS negotiates with almost 1,000 non-federal entities including nonprofit organizations, tribal, insular, state, and local governments that receive the majority of their federal funding from the Department of the Interior or one of eight other federal agencies that ICS provides services to under interagency agreements.  The ICS inventory includes 462 tribal organizations, 447 nonprofit organizations, 138 state and local governments, and 26 insular governments.  A federally approved indirect cost rate is required for these entities to be reimbursed for allowable indirect costs, such as general administration, incurred while conducting programs mandated or authorized by the Federal government.  In FY 2010, ICS issued 1,174 negotiation agreements containing one to twenty program rates:  631 for the Department and 543 for contracted customers.  The ICS also approved 15 cost allocation plans and conducted five indirect cost proposal workshops for tribal governments.  The ICS team, consisting of auditors and program analysts, reviews indirect cost proposals to ensure compliance with applicable regulations, makes required adjustments, and issues government-wide indirect cost rate agreements to non-federal entities.  The ICS team also serves as technical experts, conducts training sessions on how to prepare indirect cost proposals, and provides information and assistance to Federal program managers and contracting officers.The ICS staff keeps abreast of the latest issues concerning the negotiation of indirect cost rates by participating in training and information sharing with other Federal agencies performing indirect cost negotiations.Program Performance EstimatesIn 2011, ICS will increase the number of negotiations performed under interagency contract to 750 and plans to increase by another 100 negotiations in 2012.  ICS plans to continue making improvements to its indirect cost proposal processes to maintain performance levels and increase service offerings to the Department and other Federal entities.

<p>THE REQUIREMENT:</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), anticipates a requirement for Construction Manager as constructor (CMc) services for the renovation of Building 1 (B1R) on NIST's campus in Boulder, Colorado. The NAICS code for the proposed acquisition is 236220, Commercial and Institutional Building Construction, and the Small Business size standard is $33.5 million. The project is planned to be announced in the spring of 2011 with an award anticipated for the summer of 2011. The estimated price range of this project is $50,000,000.00 to $80,000,000.00. The performance period for this project is estimated at one thousand ninety five (1095) calendar days after the written Notice to Proceed.</p>
<p>The B1R project will provide a facility that will allow NIST to advance measurement science, standards and technology beyond current constraints. Electronic, optical, radiation, chemical and information technologies must be supported. The renovation will allow key technology areas such as nanotechnology, biotechnology, new energy sources, computing and telecommunications in a high performance facility.</p>
<p>Environmental and space requirements for the B1R are based on extensive programmatic studies of NIST's technically demanding scientific programs, many of which directly or indirectly support US competitiveness. The building environmental requirements for programs slated for the B1R are not being effectively and economically met with laboratory space currently occupying a structure dedicated in 1954.</p>
<p>The proposed NIST B1R project is a necessity for NIST's continued long-term support of US industrial competitiveness in the world market. The B1R will provide extensive renovation of approximately three fourths of Building 1, including Wings 3, 4, 5, 6 and a portion of the Center Spine. The exterior work will include the building structure, roofing, doors and windows, exterior wall finishes, site utilities, and landscaping. The building is multi-storied and will be fully occupied throughout the renovation. This renovation will provide new renovated space of 150,000 net assignable square feet of high performance laboratory space and offices to perform research and measurements needed by industry and the scientific community. There will be approximately fifty laboratories renovated and seventy office spaces. Both of these are areas are approximately seven hundred square feet. The laboratory space is Level III or class room 10,000. The high performance for B1R consists of enhanced temperature control to +/- 0.5 degree C, humidity control to +/- 5%, continuous air flow with filtration to class 10,000, and new service corridors to provide lab support space for utilities in addition to the pedestrian corridor. The building will be occupied throughout the construction process. The CMc will be responsible for the move coordination, and the actual move of the tenants (approximately 500 employees) throughout the building, throughout the entire project.</p>
<p>Electrical elements included in the renovation will be lighting, power distribution, power quality, electromagnetic interference, and standby emergency power for critical laboratory functions. The CMc will be responsible for locating the bus ducts in the service corridors which contain the chilled water, steam, and compressed air supplied from the Boulder site Central Utility Plant. Communication elements include infrastructure components including the telephone cabling and fiber optic networks for data. Life safety and building security elements in the renovation include the fire alarm systems, fire sprinkler systems, and building access control. Renovation design and construction must comply with the Energy Policy Act of 2005 and will be submitted for LEED certification for existing buildings.</p>
<p>CMc:</p>
<p>The CMc shall provide pre-construction phase services and construction phase services. The CMc's contract is anticipated as a firm fixed price basic requirement for pre-construction phase services and optional requirements for construction phase services for the exterior work that includes building structure, roofing, doors and windows, exterior wall finishes, site utilities, and landscaping along with interior work that will be divided amongst the wings and sections of the building, which will be awarded with a Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP) not to exceed $80,000,000 for all options. The four wings of the building (wings 3, 4, 5, 6, and the spine) include laboratory space and office space. The spine of the building only contains offices as well as the main thoroughfare for the utilities as they enter the building and are dispersed throughout the entire building.</p>
<p>Pre-Construction Phase Services shall include: but may not be limited to, review and evaluation of concept, design development and construction documents; constructability review; sustainable design review; consultation during construction document production; preliminary project schedule development; recommendations on phased construction; cost estimates; development of subcontractor and supplier interest; and identification of long-lead items. Also included in this phase is the CMc's development of a migration plan for Building 1 occupants emphasizing minimal impact to NIST's core mission during a multi-year phased construction. This plan and coordination will include the five hundred employees who currently occupy the building.</p>
<p>Construction Phase Services shall include, but may not be limited to; administration of the construction contract (whether the work is performed with the CMc's own forces or under subcontract), coordination of regular pre-construction and construction meetings; CPM scheduling; daily logs and monthly reports; monitoring of construction costs; record keeping; progress reporting; schedule control; inspections; testing; and other required supplemental LEED services. The CMc shall review all construction document submissions for constructability and ensure conformance to the project budget. The CMc shall review A-E cost estimates, shall provide independent cost estimates and recommend adjustments to the estimates or the design to assure that the project stays within budget. The CMc shall provide NIST with sound management advice regarding the approach to the project, how to achieve the best value in the work being accomplished, necessary actions, schedule control, alternative ideas, problem/claim prevention, and budgeting.</p>
<p>All contractors doing business with the Government are required to be registered at the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and the On-line Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA). To register with the CCR and ORCA and become eligible to receive an award, all offerors must have a Dun &amp; Bradstreet Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) identifier. A DUNS number may be acquired free of charge by contacting Dun &amp; Bradstreet at 800-333-0505 or on line at <br />https://www.dnb.com/product/eupdate/requestOptions.html.</p>
<p>If the requirement is set aside for small business, the awardee shall comply with FAR 52.219-14 Limitations on Subcontracting (Dec 1996), which states in relevant part, "(b) By submission of an offer and execution of a contract, the Offeror/Contractor agrees that in performance of the contract in the case of a contract for...(3) General construction. The concern will perform at least 15 percent of the cost of the contract, not including the cost of materials, with its own employees."</p>
<p>CAPABILITIES STATEMENT SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS</p>
<p>Any interested small business, 8(a), HUBZone , service-disabled veteran-owned small business, or woman owned concerns shall submit its capability statement no later than Tuesday, April 26, 2011, at 12:00 p.m. Mountain Time to the following address:</p>

<CONTACT>Morgan Reese 202 781 3951 Morgan Reese, Procuring Contracting Officer, SEA 02441, (202)781-3951, morgan.reese@navy.mil.
<DESC>This is a sources sought announcement in accordance with FAR 15.201 and in anticipation of a potential future procurement program. The Naval Sea Systems Command is conducting market research to determine industry capability and interest in performing non-dry-docking maintenance, repair, and alterations of DDG-51 and FFG-7 Class vessels home ported and visiting Everett, Washington. The Naval Sea Systems Command is especially interested in determining small business capability and interest in performing non-dry-docking maintenance, repair, and alterations of DDG-51 and FFG-7 Class vessels home ported and visiting Everett, Washington. The Government is seeking responses from sources that can perform non-dry-docking maintenance, repair, and alterations of DDG-51 and FFG-7 Class vessels home ported and visiting Everett, Washington, beginning at contract award (anticipated late Fall 2011) and continuing for a period of performance of 5 years.
 

NAVSEA intends to procure execution planning, ship repair, modernization, and inter-availability maintenance (continuous and emergent maintenance) of DDG and FFG ship classes in the homeport of Everett, Washington, utilizing Multi-Ship Multi-Option (MSMO) contracting.  MSMO contracts target efficient and effective maintenance practices. These contracts allow the executing agency the ability to better plan its work and take advantage of best repair capabilities.  MSMO contracts will provide long-term vendor relationships throughout ships' training/ deployment/ maintenance/ modernization cycles.  In order to reduce costs through the benefits of advanced planning, MSMO contracts allow the contractor to respond to continuous and emergent maintenance requirements on short notice, and as the contractor is intimately involved with both the planning and execution, less time is spent evaluating prospective jobs.
 The MSMO contractor can also respond on short notice to voyage repairs required on deployed ships, giving the Navy the option of using the homeport based contractors vice a foreign source, if needed. MSMO contracts will be repair and overhaul contracts for an entire ship class awarded to a prime contractor for a base plus several option years. The MSMO contract provides continuity for planning and maintenance processes for Navy ships and private sector teams awarded the work.

The Government has provided the following information as attachments to this sources sought announcement:
1.	The draft solicitation statement of work.
2.	A representative sample of standard work items completed under past DDG-51 and FFG-7 Class availabilities, highlighting the type of work that may be completed under future availabilities.
 
 

Interested companies should submit, on company letterhead, a notice of interest including the name, telephone number, mailing address, and e-mail address of one point of contact to Commander, Naval Sea Systems Command, Attn: Morgan Reese SEA 02441. Please scan your letter of interest and e-mail it to Morgan.reese@navy.mil with Pacific Northwest DDG-51 and FFG-7 MSMO Sources Sought Response in the subject field. The notice of interest should include a brief description of your company and its capabilities as they relate to the requirements set forth on this announcement, and answers to the following specific questions. Please limit your response to no more than 10 pages. 

1.	Is your company a small or large business as defined by the Small Business Administration(SBA)?
2.	How many employees does your company have?
3.	Does your company have a website? If so, what is your companys website address?
4.	Is your company a NAVSEA certified Master Ship Repair Contractor (MSRA)?
5.	Is your company a NAVSEA certified Boat Repair Contractor (ABR)?

6.	Strategic Planning/Program Management.
  Strategic Planning/Program Management plays a critical role in MSMO contracts due the overlapping of execution planning events, conducting Selected Restricted Availabilities (SRAs), inter-availabilities (both CM/EM) and visiting DDGs/FFGs that could potentially require repair/maintenance at a moments notice. The MSMO prime plays an important role in the maintenance and modernization of the surface Navy because the MSMO contract is considered a partnership between the Navy and the prime.  The MSMO prime is expected to become subject matter experts on the ships in the homeport. What is your companys experience/strategy in managing/executing several comprehensive/technically challenging maintenance and repair activities simultaneously?   

7.	Surge Capacity.
  The MSMO prime is expected to have surge capacity due to flex in operational schedules of the Navy.  On short notice, any ship could require repair/maintenance and the MSMO prime would be expected to be there and support.  It is not uncommon for MSMO primes to have teaming partners to handle such needs.  In other words, management responsiveness is essential for success as MSMO prime. What is your companys strategy for surge/emergent requirements?

8.	Integration.  Integration strategy is a key role of the MSMO prime.  The MSMO prime is expected to work with many different vendors, sub contractors and customers to ensure a successful SRA and ability to provide a high quality product through sound Engineering practices, technical expertise and PM.
 They are expected to work with Alternation Installation Teams (AITs) so the prime understands the support requirements such as power, lighting or ventilation and that work must be integrated into the master schedule.  The MSMO prime will need to integrate schedules with customers such as Type Commander (TYCOM), Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR), ships force, and I-level work etc.  All work must be properly scheduled and managed.  Need to have a sound plan for managing subcontracts as well. What is your companys integration strategy, especially in regard to managing sub-contractors?

9.	Accounting Methodology.  Sound financial tools and practices such as a certified accounting system, EVMS reporting, interface/approval with DCAA and approved purchasing systems are required to adequately provide proper billing to the Navy.
  The accounting system would show the breakout of direct, indirect and overhead charges.  In addition, the accounting system would used to manage the business with vendors as required.  While it is important to have an integrated schedule; it is equally important to have cost controls in place. The MSMO will submit timely invoices/vouchers to the Navy by Contract Line Item (CLIN), Contract Subline Item (SLIN), and ACRN level.  Cost of performance shall be segregated, accumulated, and invoiced to the appropriate ACRN categories.  What accounting system and other best practice accounting methodology does your company currently use?

10.	Logistic Support/Sustainment.  The MSMO prime needs to understand Logistic Support/Sustainment.
  All repairs, maintenance and modernization have Integrated Logistic Support (ILS).  This means the ship and Navy receives the proper technical documents after upgrades have occurred and respond accurately and timely to the volume of Contractor Data Requirements List (CDRLs). What is your companys experience with ILS?  

11.	Given the complexity of the work described in this sources sought, including attachments 1 and 2, please describe your companys historical experience completing work of this complexity or briefly describe how your company would be capable of meeting the requirements described herein as of contract award. 

12.	Given the complexity of the work described in this sources sought, does your company plan to submit a proposal in response to the anticipated solicitation for non-dry-docking maintenance, repair, and alterations of DDG-51 and FFG-7 Class vessels home ported and visiting Everett, Washington?

<DESC>AMENDMENT NOTICE:
The purpose of this amendment is to:
(a) extend the quote due date from 4:00pm PST, Monday, April 4, 2011 to 4:00pm PST, Monday, April 11, 2011.
(b) provide answers to questions submitted.  Please see below.


Questions and Answers for Ecological Footprint analysis for California sustainability indicators suite.
Question 1: Does scope of the RFQ represents follow on work for an existing contract, or does this RFQ represent a new scope?  
Answer 1: The RFQ does not represent follow on work for an existing contract.  This RFQ is for completely new work.

Question 2: The solicitation asks that respondents document three previously conducted footprint analysis they have conducted.  What if a vendor lacks formal prior contract experience in footprint analysis but has other formal training (e.g. in ecosystem functions, carbon budgeting, etc.) that provide a foundation for footprint analysis?  What guidance would you give the vendor if they were interested in responding to your request?
Answer 2: A vendor may submit a response and include any experience or information that they deem relevant.  However, EPA will still review all responses based on the criteria outlined in the RFQ.

Question 3: Is EPA aware of which vendors shall be submitting responses?  Are there a good number of potential respondents with prior experience in footprint analysis?  
Answer 3: This RFQ has been posted publicly for full and open competition, and therefore any interested vendor may submit a response.  EPA is aware of vendors interested in this requirement, but does not disclose information pertaining to an ongoing solicitation.  However, a public listing of interested vendors is located directly on the FedBizOpps (FBO) posting page.  You may access this list by going to the FBO posting (https://www.fbo.gov/spg/EPA/OAM/RegIX/RFQ-CA-11-00017/listing.html) and clicking on the "Interested Vendors List" tab.

Question 4: Will the Ecological Footprint analysis include the Ecological Footprint of consumption (what is generally presented as the "Ecological Footprint") as well as the Ecological Footprint of production for the state, and its Biocapacity?  
Answer 4: Yes, the Ecological Footprint analysis will include both consumption and biocapacity calculations.

Question 5: There are multiple methods to perform calculations for the Ecological Footprint analysis.  Each method of calculation may require different sets of data.  Furthermore, data availability may also vary.  What sets of data would be used and what is the availability?
Answer 5: EPA does not intend to furnish any specific data (for biocapacity or other calculations) at this time.  Task 2 of the project specification in the Background and Statement of Work (attachment A to the RFQ) involves working with EPA to identify and acquire necessary data.  Prospective contractors should base their methodology, work plan outline, and quote on data sources they know is or is likely to be available from international, national, or state agencies.  

Question 6: The solicitation mentions wanting the Ecological Footprint for specific sub-areas of California. Have you already determined what these would be? 
Answer 6: No, EPA has not already determined these areas. Respondents should propose analyses of up to three subareas (counties or regions within California) to demonstrate a range of ecological conditions.  

Question 7: The solicitation mentions that the Ecological Footprint will be one indicator amongst a suite of other indicators.  What other indicators have been identified for inclusion, or are under assessment? 
Answer 7: Indicators included in the overall project are: Ecological Footprint, water footprint, plant growth index based on satellite-derived data, groundwater flux indicator based on satellite-derived data.  EPA does not require that the Ecological Footprint analysis incorporate data from the other indicators.

Further, offerors are required to go on-line to the Business Partner Network at http://orca.bpn.gov to complete their Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) prior to submittal of a proposal.<br /><br />For questions regarding this announcement, please contact Kristin Blackmore who can be reached at 215-521-2291 or via e-mail Kristin.Blackmore@dhs.gov.<br /><br />The FedBizOpps staff is not authorized to determine the classification code for any FedBizOpps notice. Because a misclassified contract action fails to notify the firms most likely to respond and therefore may violate the Competition in Contracting Act, the contracting officer is held responsible for correctly classifying a FedBizOpps notice. A misclassified contract action must be corrected and re-synopsized in the FedBizOpps. Detailed classification codes are available on the FedBizOpps website at: http://www.FedBizOpps.gov/.

<DESC>Questions and Answers for Solicitation VA-241-11-RQ-0431

1.	Question:  The Solicitation, in block 20, requests one custom pack sample. Then on page 5 it requests one "sterile" sample. Will this sample pack be actually used in a surgery? If not, will non-sterile suffice as sterilizing will take much longer and more expense as they will have to run several of the same.

Answer:  This sample pack is solely a sample pack and will not be utilized for surgery.  In the essence of time, a non-sterilized pack will be accepted for review.  Please advise in the RFQ response how long it would take to build up inventory of sterilized packs for the VA Medical Centers.

2.	Question: Are substitutions allowed for components or must they be exact?

Answer: Refer to the statement of work for exact answer. 

3.	Question: The response date is still set as March 18, 2011.  What is correct response date?

Answer:  The response date is April 15, 2011 at 1300EST, as stated on the solicitation in Block


4.	Question: Do these packs have to be inventoried in VHA VISN 1 geography?

Answer: No, they need to be inventoried within the United States of America.


5.	Question: Can they be shipped as required by FEDEX or UPS as ordered from outside VISN 1?

Answer: The shipment is determined by the offeror, all final pricing needs to be FOB Destination, so the shipping costs are included with the line pricing.

6.	Question:  What is required delivery after receipt of order from facility?

Answer:  This is determined by the vendor.

<DESC>The Government conducted this acquisition as a Full and Open competition utilizing a Best Value-Tradeoff Source Selection Process (FAR 15.101-1).&nbsp; An Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity contract type with a five year ordering period was awarded with&nbsp;the issuance of a&nbsp;Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) Task Order.&nbsp; CPFF contracts are most applicable as the exact nature and extent of the work covered by this contract, as well as the precise method of performing the work, cannot be established far enough in advance.&nbsp; Therefore, a contract type that is flexible in nature and can change as the work progresses is considered appropriate for this procurement.&nbsp; In addition, the cost of performing the work under this type of contract cannot be established in advance or accurately forecasted so as to permit the undertaking of the work for a Fixed Price.

<DESC><br>*** This J & A synopsis is provided for informational purposes only and is not to be considered a request for proposal. ***<br><br>POSTED: 01 APRIL 2011<br>CLOSED: 15 APRIL 2011<br><br>This action is to increase the Cost Plus Award Fee ordering ceiling of the contract by $12.5M, for continued software support and field support services on Advanced Field Artillery Tactical Data Systems (AFATDSs) and the Joint Automated Deep Operations Coordination System (JADOCS). This modification shall be awarded on an other than full and open competition basis pursuant to the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1).<br><br>Raytheon is currently providing software support and field support services as the original manufacturer of the AFATDS and JADOCS. This entails the development of the future integration and continuous improvement on the software system. This support will continue to provide Warfighters with the most effective systems to support critical missions in support of Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO)s.  The ordering period of Contract Number DAAB07-99-C-E003 ends on 31 December 2012. This action is in response to ceiling being reached earlier than originally anticipated due to the demands of OCO support, and it is imperative that the support continue without interruption. <br><br>The U.S. Army ACC-APG has established the IBOP website as part of the Army's Single Face to Industry, to allow electronic posting of contract actions that are required to be publicized for notification to Industry IAW FAR 5.201(b)(1).

<p>Justification and Approval for Other Than Full and Open Competition</p>
<p>1. This document constitutes justification and approval for other than full and open competition for the acquisition described herein, under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. It is executed on behalf of 274th ASOS.</p>
<p>2. The 174 FW proposes to procure by means of other than full and open competition Vindicator Service. FES Installations installed the Head End system last year for the Main Vindicator System. Another company working and installing components to the Head End System will compromise the systems integrity and warranty.</p>
<p>3. The purchase is at a cost of $2,962<br /><br />4. Identification of statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition.</p>
<p>a. FAR 6.302-1, only one source responsible and no other services will satisfy the Government</p>
<p>b. 10 USC 2304(c)(2)</p>
<p>5. Demonstrate that the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited.</p>
<p>This procurement is for a purchase order to obtain Vindicator Service for Bldg 800. The statutory authority cited is FAR 6.302-1, Only one source responsible and no other services will satisfy the Government, is necessary as delay in award of this contract would result in serious injury, financial or other, to the government. This is for Vindicator Security System Service Maintenance. FES has installed this system and maintains a warranty on these parts. FES also installed the Head End System for the base. If we were to allow another company to add components or work on the FES system we would not only compromise the integrity of the system but we would void the warranty on the existing system. All prices are deemed fair and reasonable.</p>
<p><br />CONTRACTING OFFICER CERTIFICATION</p>
<p>I certify that this justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS

Justification and Approval For Other Than Full and Open Competition

1.	Contracting Activity:  Department of Veterans Affairs, VISN 1, VAMC BHS, Boston, MA (MAVERIC/Research 151) 150 South Huntington Avenue Boston, MA 02130. The contracting activity is a request for Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition.

2.	Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Processed:  This request is for the purchase of Matrix 2D 1.0 ml Barcoded Screw Top Storage Tubes.

3.	Description of Supplies/Services Required to Meet the Agency's Needs:  The requested product is a supply/item: 3471, MATRIX Technologies (ThermoScientific) 2D 1.0 ml Barcoded Screw Top Storage Tubes. This particular item is a specialized tube used to store laboratory samples, most notably in the vapor phase of liquid nitrogen. The cost for this item is expected to be $295.50 per case if ordering more than 50 cases or more per quote number #817833.

4.	Statutory Authority Permitting Other than Full and Open Competition:  Reference 41 USC 253(g), as implemented by FAR 6.302, Paragraph 1; Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements per FAR 6.302-1. 

5.	Demonstration that the Contractor's Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority): 

MATIRX Technologies is one of the world's leading manufacturers of cryovial storage rack systems. One of the most notable features of these storage tubes is the screw caps that allow storage temperatures down to the vapor phase liquid nitrogen. Each tube is leak tested to ensure it is a high quality product and that such extreme storage conditions will not impact the function of the tube. In addition to storage and extreme temperature constraints correct identification and tracking are also fundamental factors. The cryovials use a two dimensional bar-coding system where the 2D barcode is actually part of tube itself. The label is forged on the bottom which ultimately prevents the identifier from falling off the tube. This is extremely valuable in an environment where misidentification, improper labeling, or missing labels are simply not an option. Overall, the most important characteristic which makes the contractor and this product unique is the fact that our entire processing and storage systems are built upon the use of this exact tube. All our robotic equipment and their corresponding software are calibrated and programmed for this tube and rack. All our storage equipment (freezers, freezer racks, sample storage software) are set up to handle this specific tube. Changing to a different tube would have a significant negative impact on our laboratory as months and years of work and development have been invested into the storage and processing system.

Research and Development is integral to the activities of the VA, as medical research is one of it's the three fundamental missions. VA Boston Healthcare has one of the largest and most active research programs in the VA nationwide. The Massachusetts Veterans Epidemiology Research and Information Center (MAVERIC) Core Laboratory processes and stores specimens for clinical trials run by the VA Cooperative Studies Program. The laboratory is getting ready for a large scale genomics project that will require processing of up to 1000 samples a day in addition to existing and ongoing processing for other Cooperative Studies Program projects. The requested product is necessary to guarantee accurate and sufficient identification and storage of samples, to provide study stake-holders and analysis labs with high quality samples, and to facilitate the processing of such a large volume of samples. Central Office is interested in ramping up the ability of the laboratory to process specimens under the constraints previously noted. 

We have already acquired, set up, and tested an automated system for processing blood samples which requires the currently requested cryovials. The reason these cryovials are used by the system is they are automation "friendly". Automation friendly implies that the tubes must be in standard SBS microplate format so they are aligned with the pipettor of the automated system. Additionally, the rack dimensions are specifically defined so the robot arms can move the racks as required. The robot manufacturer indicated the requested tubes were acceptable for use on the automated blood fractionation machine. On an operational level the storage schema of the laboratory is centered around the use of these exact storage vials. Each current piece of automated equipment is set up and calibrated for this specific consumable. More specifically, the robotic hardware has been calibrated for the exact dimensions of this tube and its corresponding storage rack. The controlling software has been calibrated to recognize and handle this exact tube and its corresponding storage rack. We purchased special automated equipment to cap and uncap these tubes which will currently not work with any other tube or tube format. Custom freezer racks were designed against the exact dimensions of this tube and the corresponding storage rack. Additionally, the freezer identification and inventory system is being set up to read, track, and retrieve this exact cryovial. A great deal of time, money, and effort has been dedicated to developing the current identification, tracking, processing, and storage processes around this specific storage vial. Changing tubes also means changing dimensions, formats, software, and hardware. A change of tube would mean reformatting and recalibration of every piece of hardware on every piece of equipment that touches this tube. A change in tube would require the reformatting and recalibration of every software program controlling each piece of automated equipment. Changing the tube at this stage is not cost effective or logistically sound. Substitution of a different tube will ultimately render our current processes and procedures useless. 

6.	Description of Efforts Made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as deemed practicable: 

In the months preceding the first procurement MATRIX, MICRONIC, and NUNC were identified as potential vendors for this product. Each company was contacted to request quotes for their particular product line. MATRIX and MICRONIC responded with price quotes. At past scientific meetings representatives from NUNC indicated the possibility of introducing a lock that holds their tubes in each rack. The NUNC tubes with locked plates would cause the laboratory more grief than gain. From an operational perspective using locked plates of NUNC tubes would require another instrument to remove the tubes, requiring more time and money. When requesting a quote from NUNC we asked that the lock be removed in order to maintain the most optimal state of sample security. Following this exchange NUNC did not submit a quote. 

7.	Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable:  

The anticipated dollar value of the proposed acquisition is $59,600.00.  The Contracting Officer determines that the anticipated price will be fair and reasonable based on the fact that the MAVERIC lab has been equipped with automated robotics that have been configured and calibrated specifically for the Matrix 2D Barcoded Screw Top Storage Tubes & Caps.  Not using a tube with the same specifications and dimensions would cost the government a significant amount of time, man-power and money.  The entire process and system would have to be reconfigured based on a change in the tube screws.

8.	Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results, or a Statement of the Reasons Market Research Was Not Conducted:  

Market research was immediately focused on, but also limited to, manufacturers whose products would work on cutting edge automated liquid handling robots. More specifically, we were constrained by the fact the tubes have to work on the blood processing machine we have already purchased and the inventory and tracking system that is currently developed. Given our constraints all acceptable and available vendors were contacted. The largest, most experienced supplier is MATRIX Technologies, an acquired division of ThermoFisher Scientific. MATRIX has been a preferred vendor with a proven track record for previous cryovial orders. Additionally, changing tubes also means changing dimensions, formats, software, and hardware. A change of tube would mean reformatting and recalibration of every piece of hardware on every piece of equipment that touches this tube. A change in tube would require the reformatting and recalibration of every software program controlling each piece of automated equipment. Changing the tube at this stage is not cost effective or logistically sound. Substitution of a different tube will ultimately render our current processes and procedures useless.

9.	Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition:  

In addition to the technical descriptions and justifications noted above, it is important to recognize these cryovials are involved in a very large scale and very high profile genomics study known as the Million Veteran Program (MVP). MVP is one of the transformative initiatives passed down by Secretary Shinseki for the VA to fulfill. Any impediments incurred while working on this project may result in profound repercussions for our service.

10.	Listing of Sources that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition:  

MATRIX, MICRONIC, and NUNC were identified as potential vendors for this product. MATRIX and MICRONIC responded with price quotes.

11.	A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome any Barriers to Competition before Making subsequent acquisitions for the supplies or services required:  

Not applicable; MATRIX Technologies is the company we need to supply the aforementioned tubes given the reasons and descriptions cited above.
