<DESC>A previous sources sought noticed was posted on FEDBIZOPPS under “FA4890-05-CAT/CWD.”  All current and future postings will now occur under the solicitation number “FA4890-06-R-0157.”  

As a result of the earlier sources sought notice and careful small business capability evaluation, it has been decided to keep this follow-on contract requirement as FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION rather than set-aside solely for small businesses.  All vendors, regardless of size are encouraged to provide proposals for this requirement.

Accompanying this posting is a DRAFT Statement of Work (revised from earlier posting), DRAFT DD 254, and DRAFT Solicitation.  At this time, we are requesting INDUSTRY COMMENTS on everything posted including: perceived errors, clarifications, suggestions (contract CLIN format, SOW wording, evaluation factors, instructions, etc.).  This is an excellent opportunity for contractors to provide the Government with constructive feedback, which could affect the structure and format of the final version RFP that is scheduled to be posted in January 2006.   DO NOT PROVIDE PROPOSALS AT THIS TIME!  

The final RFP is estimated to be posted to FEDBIZOPPS o/a January 9, 2006.  However, if time allows, the final RFP may be posted earlier during the month of December.  Proposals based on the final RFP are scheduled to be due 14 Feb 2006.  It will be the responsibility of the offerors to monitor the FEDBIZOPPS site for further postings.  The government plans to use the Internet (FEDBIZOPPS) and e-mail as the primary means of disseminating and exchanging information throughout this acquisition process.  

A synopsis of the Fighter Contracted Aircrew Training and Courseware Development (CAT/CWD) requirement is included below:

Air Combat Command (ACC) is purchasing CAT/CWD services for the F-15C, F-15E, F-16, and F/A-22 aircraft at locations within the Continental United States (CONUS).  The aircrew training will consist of academic and ground device instruction.  Seymour Johnson AFB, NC is the primary place of performance for courseware development and will support the F-15E Formal Training Unit (FTU).  Aircrew training and limited courseware development will occur at Mission Training Center (MTC) and Full Mission Trainer (FMT) sites in support of Distributed Missions Training (DMT).  These sites include Seymour-Johnson AFB NC (F-15E MTC), Eglin AFB FL (F-15C MTC), Langley AFB VA (F-15C MTC and F/A-22 FMT), Shaw AFB SC (F-16 CJ MTC), Mountain Home AFB ID (F-16 CJ and F-15E MTCs).   Other aircrew training places of performance with older legacy systems include Cannon AFB NM (F-16 UTD), Mountain Home AFB ID (F-15C WST), Hill AFB UT (F-16 UTD).  

The successful offeror will assume full training and courseware commitments for the basic contract year on 1 Oct 06 through 30 Sep 07.  (Phase-in will be accomplished prior to 30 Sep 06.)  Four one-year options are planned for the period beginning 1 Oct 07 and ending 30 Sep 11.  

Comments may be mailed to:  ACC CONS/LGCB, Attn:  Ryan McCauley, 130 Douglas Street, Suite 401, Langley AFB, VA  23665.  The cutoff date for receipt of comments is 2 Dec 2005 COB.

<DESC>THIS IS THE FORMAL PRESOLICITATION NOTICE IN ACCORDANCE WITH FAR 5.204. The purpose of this synopsis is to announce the forthcoming electronic release of the final Request for Proposal (RFP) for SAF/XC’s Advisory and Assistance Services (AAS) contract(s).  This acquisition was previously posted to the FedBizOpps under Reference Number RFI-FA7012-SAF-NWI-CIO, AAS in support of SAF/XC, which included ten (10) subsequent Amendments.  Under Amendment 05 to this RFI-FA7012-SAF-NWI-CIO, Solicitation Number FA7012-05-R-0034 was assigned.  From this date forward, interested offerors seeking information regarding this acquisition should use Solicitation Number FA7014-06-R-0002, as any subsequent postings shall be listed under this Solicitation Number only.  The Office of the Secretary of the Air Force, Chief of Warfighting Integration and Chief Information Officer (SAF/XC) has a requirement for comprehensive AAS to support its staff.  The Government intends to award two contracts to prime contractors for SAF/XC AAS, but reserves the right to award more or fewer if the SSA determines it is in the Government's best interest, considering the Government's expected volume of work over the period of the task order contracts, available funding, the need to sustain adequate competition, and the availability of best-value proposals following completion of evaluation of the proposals received.  The Government contemplates award of an Indefinite-Delivery-Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) contract with Firm Fixed Price (FFP), Time & Material (TM), and Labor-Hour (LH) Task Orders resulting from this solicitation.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this acquisition is 541611 with an applicable size standard of no more than $6M gross annual revenue.   This size standard applies for the establishment of eligibility as a small business. This acquisition will be procured on an unrestricted basis.  Source selection procedures will be followed as prescribed in FAR Part 15, as supplemented.  Multiple contract awards are anticipated with a total program ceiling of $392 million.  Terms of contract(s) include a five-year basic ordering period.  A draft of the RFP was released under Amendments 05 and 10 to RFP FA7012-05-R-0034 (previously known as RFI-SAF-NWI-CIO).  The Government anticipates releasing the final RFP on or about 5 Dec 05.  The RFP will be issued via FedBizOpps under Solicitation Number FA7014-06-R-0002.  All contractors interested in receiving information on this acquisition are encouraged to register with the FedBizOpps website.  No hard copies of this solicitation shall be issued.  Offerors who determine that the technical requirements of this RFP require clarification(s) to permit submittal of a responsive proposal shall submit all questions in writing to the Contracting Officer within ten (10) days of publication of the final RFP. All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which will be considered by the agency.  Fascimile or alternate proposals are not acceptable.  Contractors must be registered in Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database prior to award.  Contractors may access CCR at the following URL www.bpn.gov.  Also, effective January 1, 2005 the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) requires that all contractors use the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) in federal solicitations as part of the proposal submission.     You may access ORCA via the following URL, www.orca.bpn.gov.     Potential offerors will be responsible for downloading the solicitation and monitoring this website for amendments, if any, to the solicitation.  An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential Offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition.  The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel.  When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process.  Interested parties are invited to call the Ombudsman at (202) 767-4033.  DO NOT CALL THIS NUMBER FOR SOLICITATION REQUESTS.  All proposals must be received by the due date and time specified in the RFP. The due date will be no less than 30 calendar days after the release of the final RFP.  It is the contractor’s responsibility to check the RFP for the actual issuance date, proposal due date/time, and delivery address.  Inquiries regarding this notice shall be directed to Lynne.Hanson@bolling.af.mil, voice (202) 767-7943.

3.	Estimated Value of Procurement: TBD

4.	Recommended Sources: THALES COMMUNICATIONS INC.
 
5.	 Reason for Sole Source/Limited Sources:
( X )  Only one source (unique capabilities)
(   )  Proprietary drawings, specifications, and/or engineering
       data, patents, copyrights
(   )  Brand Name essential to the Government’s needs.
(   )  Standardization Program supported by Agency Head
(   )  Determination and Findings (D&F).
(   )  Unusual and Compelling Urgency (limited sources)

Briefly Explain: 
1.   FAR 6.302 (a)(2)(ii), pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), permits contracting for supplies or services when the supplies or services required by the agency are deemed available only from the original source(s) for the continued support of a major system or highly specialized equipment. This is a last buy of parts from the OEM as they have discontinued support of the CEJD-MSR Ikw TRANSMITTER. These parts will be used to support the system until recapitalization. 

2.   In accordance with FAR 10.001(a)(3) (i) the USCG conducted a market research utilizing the World Wide Web, Thomas Register of American Manufacturers and GSA Supply Schedules, in order to locate as many capable sources of supply for these piece parts as possible. The only vendor located is the OEM, THALES COMMUNICATIONS INC. These subassemblies are only manufactured by the OEM, THALES COMMUNICATIONS INC.

6.	Impact to the Government if not awarded in accordance with the above:  
All parts must be physically the same form, fit and function as the already supported piece parts. This is mandatory in order to maintain parts already purchased and any new parts to be purchased. Any deviation from this standard will significantly increase the USCG cost for support and will greatly impact the USCG’s ability to support the original equipment used. If the USCG is no longer able to support the original equipment, this will force the USCG to recapitalize the entire equipment population

<DESC>The Pharmaceutical Resources Branch, Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis (DCTD), National Cancer Institute (NCI) is seeking offerors for the purpose of procurement of bulk chemicals and drugs that are needed by the Drug Treatment Programs (DTP) for preclinical and clinical use. Assigned compounds are not readily available in the quality or quantities required from the original source, other suppliers or the open market. The compounds could be known or new chemicals with a wide variety of chemical structures. Multi-step preparation sequences will generally be involved and process development for scale-up preparation will be expected using provided investigator’s procedures. The quantity of a given material synthesized may range from multi-grams to multi-kilograms.  All materials prepared will be fully characterized for high purity and the preparative cost will also be calculated. Most of assigned projects should be performed under the current good manufacturing practice (cGMP) complied with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) rule and regulations. The following MANDATORY QUALIFICATION CRITERIA must be met at the time of receipt of initial proposals by the Contracting Officer in order to be considered for award:  (A) All offerors shall be registered with the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a manufacturer of bulk drugs; and (B) The facilities shall conform to the applicable regulations of the U.S Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT), and those of state and local regulatory agencies.

All chemicals handled during the project should be considered to be potentially hazardous and/or toxic and, thus, should be handled accordingly. Offerors will be instructed to describe their safety program and their proposed approach for the handling of hazardous and toxic agents.  Submission of safety manuals will be required. In addition, offerors must have facilities to handle cytotoxic agents because most projects involve preparation of potentially carcinogenic compounds (e.g., adequate air-handling system).

Multiple awards of cost reimbursement, incrementally funded completion type contracts are anticipated. The contracts will be competed and awarded at two levels, Level I and Level II. Level I awardees are expected to complete 8 to 12 deliveries each year excluding reports and Level II awardees are expected to complete 15 to 25 deliveries each year excluding reports. Monthly progress reports describing work performed and annual project reports will be submitted, but additional reports may be required. Laboratory notebooks containing raw data should be maintained at the contract site for reviewing at the discretion of the Government. Prepared compounds are shipped to the NCI or the NCI repositories along with data sheets.  Synthetic procedures and cost information should also be submitted for each compound when available.

It is anticipated that resulting awards will be made for a five year base period with two option years.  

The solicitation is scheduled for release approximately December 2, 2005. Proposals will be due 45 days following the actual date of RFP issuance.  This is a 100% small business set-aside under the NAICS Code No. 54171 and a size standard of 500 employees.  (See Number Note 1.)  The RFP may be accessed through the Research Contracts Branch home page by using the following Internet address:  http:/rcb.nci.nih.gov/rfp.htm.

<DESC>NASA/JSC has a requirement for technical representative services at Ellington Field to support maintenance of the General Electric J-85 engines installed in NASA/JSC's T-38N fleet.	The technical representative is required to function as a liaison between General Electric and NASA/JSC personnel.  The period of performance for this requirement is one year.  The period of performance begins January 1, 2006 and ends December 31, 2006. NASA/JSC intends to purchase the items from General Electric on a sole source basis.  This determination was reached based on the fact that General Electric has all of the proprietary information rights for General Electric J-85 engines.  This proprietary information is unobtainable from sources outside of General Electric.  Thus, General Electric is the only known source capable of meeting all of NASA/JSC's requirements for this procurement. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on November 29, 2005.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541511   THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN SUBPART 12.6, AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION. QUOTES ARE BEING REQUESTED AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED. The solicitation number is RFQ-RT-06-00024  and the solicitation is being issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-4. The associated  North Industry Classification System (NAICS) is 541511  and the  size standard is 18.0 million dollars.  Full and open competition procedures will be utilized. A firm, fixed price purchase order using Simplified Acquisition Procedures is anticipated to result from the award of this solicitation.  This procurement is for the acquisition of : Objective Classification Software: CaT. Statement of Work:   Develop software to objectively and efficient identify and quantify biological structures (e.g., tube and tunnels produced by macrobenthic organisms) within sediment cores such that the input,  is operable on Windows- based computer platforms, and data output is in standardized formats. Statement of Need: AED has need of an efficient way to process computer aided tomography (CT) image data that is acquired from sediment cores as part of ongoing studies to monitor, predict and manage  ecological conditions in aquatic systems. Analysis of sediment cores using medical imaging techniques has been done over the last 20 years and has usually been restricted to simple x-rays. Recently, computer aided tomography has been applied to sediment samples and has enable multidimensional  visualization and quantitative analyses of sediment cores. The physical and biological structures in sediment, the formation of tubes and tunnels, as well as alterations in sediment texture, have been shown to be correlated with the health of benthic communities. Foe example, the community is   healthier  when tubs and tunnels and diversity of biological structures are observed in the sediment. The date, the identification of these structures in CT images of cores is subjective and time-consuming in that the investigator has to find them, identify them, and quantify them in a non-routine  manner. Because data sets from a single core are large (150 Mb) and skill is required for the data processing, analysis with the existing system can take months. Consequently, there is a strong need to shorten the processing time, improve consistency and quality of data interpretation, make the  method more widely available and easier to learn, and increase information derived from the data. These needs can be met with development and use of  Ct image-analysis and quantification software that automatically and objectively  classifies  data  from medical-based CT imagery of sediment cores.  Scope of work, including EPA and Vendor Responsibilities: (A) EPA Responsibilities:  (1) Provide a set of data from sediment cores that have been previously CT imaged  and analyzed. Data for each core will include 1) DIACOM-format data from a commercial  medical CT  imaging unit, 2) Specifications  of the sediment core  dimensions and description of the core barrel and sediment, 3) interpreted and quantified data previously generated by EPA for  selected cores, and 4) written   requirement to contractors for quality assurance of software. (2) Provide cores and listing of minimum types of  fearures to be quantified in soft bottom  sediments. (B) Vendors Responsibilities: Deliver Software that is Operational and meets the Specifications and Performance Criteria stated here: (1) Develop software capable of performing the following: (a) Operate on a Windows-based platform. (b) Be  User-friendly" in that a non-specialist can learn to operate the software and output  data with less than 8 hrs of training. (c) Read image data in DIACOM format and generate a database that allows random  access of raw and semi-reduced data on each imaging unit/core slice.  (2) Software allows  user to view raw and reduced data for any plane in the core and be able to concatenate sections/files for 3D rendering. (3) Functionality for unsupervised classification of sediments based on the extraction of sediment features capturing voxel (a unit of graphic information that defines a point in  three dimensional space) texture and intensity. This should classify or aggregate groups of similar features. This process will be determined in an objective and documented manner. (4) Functionally for supervised classification of sediments based on the extraction of features capturing voxel  texture and intensity. That is, create a reference set of sediment core features as defined by the user. This is create a reference set of sediment core  features as defined by the user. This reference set will be used to segment sediment core images in various classes. (5) Functionality to store  the results in a manner (e.g. Excel) that subsequent quantitative analysis can be performed. The output data should also contain a least one  measure of confidence associated with each record, as an aid in determining accuracy of results. (6) Functionality to calculate, using supervised  classification procedures, (a) the volume of tubes and tunnels produced by macrobenthic organisms within the EPA cores image data set and (b) the volume of additional classes identified and (c) render all sediment classes in 3D for viewing. (7) Compliance with published EPA and Federal requirements  for quality assurance for software development and of handicapped access for software. Evaluation Criteria: (1) Vendor must provide demonstration of operation on Windows based platform with user/help subroutines displayed. (2) Vendor must provide demonstration of 3D rendering of raw image date and  selected sediment classes (e.g., tubes and tunnels) using EPA supplied sediment image data. (3) Vendor must provide demonstration of unsupervised and supervised classification of EPA sediment image data, (4) Vendor must provide demonstration of data transfer from software to Excel or similar data  analysis software. (5) Vendor must provide demonstration that automated data reduction and display performed by the software is capable of calculating the volume of tubes and tunnels in the EPA test image data set within 10% of  EPA's  figures. (6) Software is compliant is compliant with Section  508 of American Disabilities Act  (http://intranet.epa.gov/accessibility/sw.htm). Evaluation Criteria for Objective Classification Software using CaT: (1) Vendor must provided documentation demonstrating  the production of software using image data and associated analysis tools. (2) Previously  developed software must have either used existing or developed classification algorithms for one or more of their analysis tools. (3) One or more of the vendors software packages is widely used on the open market by academia, government and commercial entities. (4) Delivered  f.o.b. to  Narragansett, RI 02882. The Government intends to award a single purchase  order  to the  responsible contractor whose quotation  meet all the required specifications and represents the overall best value to the Government.

The Subsecretaría de Telecomunicaciones (“the Grantee”) invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms that are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study for the Rural Connectivity Project in Chile.

The Rural Connectivity Project is designed to address the digital divide in Chile.  The Grantee plans to auction concessions for rural internet access services to private sector operators.  The operators will be required to offer internet access services in rural areas at subscriber rates comparable to those available in urban areas.  The winning bidders would be compensated for the relatively higher cost of providing rural internet access with a subsidy.  Bidders will compete based on the basis of the least subsidy required.  Funds for the subsidy will come from the Chilean government’s Telecommunications Development Fund (Fondo de Desarrollo de Telecomunicaciones, FDT).  With the support of the Netherlands consultants trust fund at the World Bank, the Grantee contracted with consultants to carry out a pre-feasibility study, which developed preliminary estimates of demand, recommended the appropriate technologies, and developed a preliminary business model that estimated that the US$15 million subsidy would make internet connection available for approximately 1,000 rural localities. 

The objective of the feasibility study is to assist the Grantee with the preparation of more precise data needed to conduct an efficient auction for concessions to provide rural internet access.  The Grantee needs more accurate demand data, including the potential demand for Voice Over Internet Protocol (VOIP) services in order to help bidders more accurately gauge the level of risk.  The other key information needed for the bidding process is more precise capital expenditure and operating cost data in order to more accurately define the conditions of the bidding process, such as the maximum allowable subsidy.

A summary of the specific tasks is as follows:

Task 1:  Demand study (including in-field polling)
Task 2:  Propose Network Solutions to Service the Identified Demand (Network Design,
 Capital Expenditure and Operating Costs)
Task 3:  Evaluate the potential of VOIP service as a source of additional revenues
Task 4:  Propose a Business Model associated to the Network
Task 5:  Compute new estimates for subsidies
Task 6:  Organize a workshop including potential operators, subscribers, 
  equipment suppliers, regulators, international organizations, and consultants
Task 7:  Prepare a preliminary review and assessment of the environmental and 
	 developmental impacts of the Project
Task 8:  Provide advisory support on the preparation of draft tender 
 documents
Task 9:  Present all findings and recommendations to the Grantee
Task 10: Prepare Final Report

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a US$263,402 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background desk study report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.

The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<DESC>The DLA HQ Information Operations Directorate (J-6) has tasked the DLA Enterprise Support Acquisition Office (DES-A) to award a Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) establishing terms by which the DLA Enterprise can obtain world class support for its Cisco hardware, software, and maintenance requirements.  

The goal is to provide the DLA Enterprise with best value, world class Cisco support.  In assessing best value, DLA will consider a number of factors, which may include, but may not be limited to the following: 1) Price; 2) Delivery/Response Time; 3) Past Performance; and 4) Technical Capability, which can be broken down into the following subfactors: a) Asset Management, b) Organizational Structure, c) Value Added.  Two critical elements of asset management that should be noted are: 1) Order tracking (the effective maintenance of records including but not necessarily limited to sales data, DLA requiring activity/location, P/N, serial #, maintenance term, warranty, etc.); 2) Contractorâ€™s plan to meet DLA goal of consolidating/organizing DLA maintenance agreements to co-terminate at one end date.    

The Government anticipates the scope of the requirement to include all Cisco P/N items currently in offering, including CONUS and OCONUS maintenance/support for the various DLA field activities around the world.    

The Government invites all interested, responsible parties to provide a brief plan/outline as to how they would best meet the Governmentâ€™s requirement.  The format for submission is at the discretion of the contractor, but should address the prospective evaluation factors noted.  The following information should also be provided by the interested party: 1) CAGE Code; 2) Business Size (Use NAICS code 423430, size standard: 500 employees as a reference point); 3) Cisco Certifications (i.e. Gold, Silver, Premier, etc.).  Keep in mind that this is not a formal solicitation, but a Request For Information (RFI) / Presolicitation Notice and responses to this notice should not be submitted, nor will they be evaluated as offers.  The Government will take into account feedback to this preliminary notice in the drafting its formal solicitation to be released at a later date.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The following questions have been answered: 1.  Which ISS products are in use at  AAC, i.e.  RealSecure, Internet Scanner, Database Scanner, System Scanner, etc?   Site Protector, Intrusion Prevention Appliances, Intrusion Detection Sensors, Server Sensors, Desktop Sensors, Internet Scanner 2.  In paragraph 2 of the Statement Of Objective for this RFP is the expected response time via phone?  Is someone expected to be available 24/7 Is this a two hour or less response time?  Is there any remote access capability available for analyzing a given situation when a trouble call is placed?  The current support we have with ISS is phone support; with the upgrade to premier we were adding onsite time and a dedicated support person as opposed to just waiting in the phone queue with ISS support.  There is no remote access capability available for any of the products.  These are standard offerings from ISS that are sold to their resellers. 3.  Paragraph 6:   Is the primary engineer expected to be a full time position, i.e. 2080 hours per year? This isn't a position at the AAC, it was suppose to be an ISS engineer assigned to the AAC to get to know our environment for a higher level of support.  See CLIN 0003. 4.  What are the VA/AAC OCN numbers for the ISS licenses?   OCN 261701 OCN 262781 OCN 169709 OCN 190883 OCN 197269 OCN 197270 OCN 197270 OCN 203608 OCN 203608 OCN 234220 OCN 234220 OCN 234220 OCN 237371 OCN 188129 OCN 188129 OCN 188129 OCN 188129 OCN 188129 OCN 243112 OCN 240440 OCN 240440 OCN 240440 OCN 240440 OCN 240440 OCN 246011 OCN 222503 OCN 222503 OCN 222503 OCN 226571 OCN 241174 OCN 241174 OCN 241174 OCN 241174 OCN 250927 OCN 250927 OCN 250927 OCN 250927 OCN 252755 OCN 228442 OCN 228442 OCN 254038 OCN 254038 OCN 254038 OCN 254038 OCN 257975 OCN 258264 OCN 258264 OCN 258264 OCN 259750 OCN 258264 OCN 258264 OCN 269832 OCN 269832 OCN 269832 OCN 273679 OCN 273679 OCN 273679  5.

Concerning the above requirement, is this new? If not, can you provide me with the incumbent contractor name, contract #, award date, and total value?

2.  Red Team support.  Red Team provides planning/analytic/operational support to emulate an adversary while performing vulnerability assessments of critical DoD assets.  
3. Home Support.  Home support includes classified holdings management, IT support including SCI LAN maintenance and administration and Blue/Red Team field equipment preparation (such as laptop computers, cell phones, GPS devices, cameras, etc) and support.
 Potential Offerors are requested to provide information that demonstrates the organization’s capability to perform any or all of the above services.  Capability statements shall demonstrate an understanding of the skills and approaches necessary to provide Blue Team, Red Team or Home support.

<DESC>The DLA HQ Information Operations Directorate (J-6) has tasked the DLA Enterprise Support Acquisition Office (DES-A) to award a Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) establishing terms by which the DLA Enterprise can obtain world class support for its Cisco hardware, software, and maintenance requirements.  

The goal is to provide the DLA Enterprise with best value, world class Cisco support.  In assessing best value, DLA will consider a number of factors, which may include, but may not be limited to the following: 1) Price; 2) Delivery/Response Time; 3) Past Performance; and 4) Technical Capability, which can be broken down into the following subfactors: a) Asset Management, b) Organizational Structure, c) Value Added.  Two critical elements of asset management that should be noted are: 1) Order tracking (the effective maintenance of records including but not necessarily limited to sales data, DLA requiring activity/location, P/N, serial #, maintenance term, warranty, etc.); 2) Contractorâ€™s plan to meet DLA goal of consolidating/organizing DLA maintenance agreements to co-terminate at one end date.    

The Government anticipates the scope of the requirement to include all Cisco P/N items currently in offering, including CONUS and OCONUS maintenance/support for the various DLA field activities around the world.    

The Government invites all interested, responsible parties to provide a brief plan/outline as to how they would best meet the Governmentâ€™s requirement.  The format for submission is at the discretion of the contractor, but should address the prospective evaluation factors noted.  The following information should also be provided by the interested party: 1) CAGE Code; 2) Business Size (Use NAICS code 423430, size standard: 500 employees as a reference point); 3) Cisco Certifications (i.e. Gold, Silver, Premier, etc.).  Keep in mind that this is not a formal solicitation, but a Request For Information (RFI) / Presolicitation Notice and responses to this notice should not be submitted, nor will they be evaluated as offers.  The Government will take into account feedback to this preliminary notice in the drafting its formal solicitation to be released at a later date.  
***NOTE: RESPONSES TO THE GOVERNMENT'S REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ARE DUE NO LATER THAN COB 11/30/05***

<DESC>Title:  Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP). This is not a solicitation announcement.  This is a sources sought synopsis only.  The purpose of this sources sought notice is to gain knowledge of potential qualified sources and their size classifications (large business, small business, HUBZone, 8(a), Veteran-owned, small disadvantaged business, etc.) relative to the NAICS Code.  The NAICS Code for this requirement is 541519 with a size standard of $21 million.

The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) is conducting a market survey to seek potential sources from firms which have the capability to conduct the next phase of the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) contract.

HCUP is a family of health care databases and related software tools and products developed through a Federal-State-Industry partnership and sponsored by the AHRQ.  HCUP databases bring together the data collection efforts of State data organizations, hospital associations, private data organizations, and the Federal government to create a national information resource of patient-level health care data.  The participation of State Partners is essential for the success of the HCUP project and is based on cooperative, detailed agreements made between AHRQ and each data Partner.  The majority of States have programs in place to collect discharge records describing all hospitalizations within the State.  Increasing numbers of States are expanding their data collection efforts into the areas of outpatient care such as emergency room and ambulatory surgery.  Currently, there are 39 States with data organizations that currently participate as HCUP Partners by sharing their data with AHRQ.   HCUP involves many activities, a subset of these are achieved through a contract mechanism.

The current HCUP contract (Sept. 2000 – Sept. 2006) has expanded greatly from building State and national databases in earlier years.  The project now includes activities such as user support, electronic documentation, central data distribution, training, and expansion into outpatient data, among others.  As currently designed, the HCUP contract annually produces over 80 inpatient, ambulatory surgery, and emergency department state-level databases, 2 national databases, over 30 publicly disseminated databases, 10 software tools, and numerous presentations and trainings; receives over 500,000 hits per year on the HCUP Web site; and responds to approximately 2,000 technical assistance and data support inquiries per year.

The HCUP family of health services databases includes:  HCUP State databases – state-specific annual inpatient and outpatient discharge and visit level data files; HCUP nationwide databases – nationwide samples derived from the HCUP State databases enabling focused research on special populations; and other HCUP databases – auxiliary databases that are used to augment information in the HCUP State and nationwide databases.  These databases enable research on a broad range of health policy issues, including cost and quality of health services, medical practice patterns, access to health care programs, and outcomes of treatments at the national, State, and local market levels.  The HCUP databases are quite large in size.  The annual national database contains approximately 8 million records; the total of all the State inpatient records in a given year is approximately 32 million, and the total of all ambulatory surgery and emergency department records in a given year is approximately 16 and 17 million respectively.

Detailed descriptions of the project and data can be found at the HCUP Web site at:  www.hcup-us.ahrq.gov .

The next phase of HCUP will meet the following objectives in support of AHRQ’s mission to improve the quality, safety, efficiency and effectiveness of healthcare for all Americans:  create and enhance a powerful source of national, State, and all-payer health care data;  produce a broad set of software tools and products to facilitate the use of HCUP and other administrative data; enrich a collaborative partnership with statewide data organizations aimed at increasing the quality and use of health care data; and conduct and translate research to inform decision making and improve healthcare delivery.

The core component of the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) contract is processing, and creating uniformly formatted State inpatient and outpatient encounter-level data files obtained from HCUP Partners.  Processing the data includes checking the quality of data received and developing additional analytic data elements from the source data.  The data are often derived from billing records; thus, they are often submitted in formats consistent with the Uniform Bill-92 (UB-92) and occasionally with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Form 1500 (CMS-1500) (although many of the statewide data organization deviate from these national standards in coding and data content).  HCUP purchases inpatient and outpatient (ambulatory surgery and emergency department) data files from the HCUP Partners.  

Once the data files are purchased from the State, the Contractor must process the data and create three uniformly formatted databases: State Inpatient Databases (SID), State Ambulatory Surgery Databases (SASD), and State Emergency Department Databases (SEDD) following existing HCUP formats.  HCUP nationwide databases are then created from the HCUP State databases by sampling hospitals across the participating States.  Currently, two types of HCUP nationwide databases exist: The Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) and the Kids’ Inpatient Database (KID).  The NIS contains data on all discharges from about 1,000 hospitals located throughout the country, approximating a 20 percent stratified sample of community non-rehabilitation hospitals in the United States. The KID contains a sample of discharges from approximately 2,500 hospitals.

The HCUP Contractor will be required to conduct the following activities:

Manage the HCUP partnership’s data acquisition including recruiting new States into the project; requesting additional data types from existing HCUP State Partners; obtaining annual data files; and retaining Partner participation in the project.  These activities require completing data applications and supporting materials, and assisting in negotiating Memorandums of Agreement for participation.

Operate the HCUP Central Distributor, which handles all activities directly related to the sales and dissemination of the restricted access public release HCUP databases (the NIS, KID and a sub-set of the full State files used by AHRQ) and related HCUP files.  These activities include: maintaining a tracking and distribution system: answering general inquires about HCUP databases and related products; reviewing and processing data purchase applications; collecting and reimbursing fees from sales to Partners as appropriate; and making copies of the HCUP databases and files and preparing database binders.  

Provide HCUP Partners with technical assistance on their collection and use of their statewide encounter data to improve the collection and use of inpatient and outpatient data.  Topic areas include, but are not limited to, national standards for data elements in inpatient and outpatient encounter data, electronic transmission of encounter data, improved timeliness, edit checks and other data quality issues, adding clinical content and other analytically useful data elements to encounter data, and advances in health information technology that may lead to improvements in their data programs including the electronic healthcare record, Regional Health Information Organizations, and the National Health Information Network.

Provide AHRQ staff with technical support including access and use of data and documentation system, general technological innovations affecting HCUP data processing, and advances in health care information technology (HIT) relevant to HCUP.

Deliver user support by maintaining an infrastructure to provide technical support to outside users on HCUP databases, software tools, linkable files, written reports and all other products developed for the HCUP project.  The objective of the assistance is to increase the usefulness and use of HCUP data and products, and of administrative data in general.  Types of technical support to be provided include: explanations, applications and usage techniques of HCUP, its databases, software tools, linkable files, HCUPnet, and database and software documentation; answers to questions about appropriate use and reporting of data analyses; and procedures and requirements for acquiring HCUP databases and HCUP products.  User support also involves presentations designed and delivered to targeted audiences to increase their knowledge about HCUP; developing and implementing dissemination strategies; developing software tools that enhance the value of HCUP data and other administrative data; and conducting special research and policy analyses and preparing reports and publications which may be either descriptive, analytic, or methodological.

Maintain and further develop the HCUP Web site (HCUP-US) which serves as the project’s primary vehicle for public outreach, and a virtual repository for project information and documentation.  HCUP data is not stored on the HCUP-US Web site, but with few exceptions, all documentation components are archived in this system.  

Support the generation of estimates derived from HCUP data for the Congressionally- mandated reports:  National Healthcare Quality Reports (NHQR) and National Healthcare Disparities Reports (NHDR).  The NHQR provides assessments of health care quality at the national and State levels and tracks improvement across a broad array of quality measures.  The NHDR provides assessments of health care disparities related to racial and socioeconomic factors at the national level and within diverse priority populations and tracks the NHQR quality measures as well as an array of access measures.  The key task involves applying the AHRQ Quality Indicators (QI) software to the HCUP national and State databases.  The main products include QI estimates in tables, documentation of methods, special analyses, and coordination with HCUP Partners in the use and reporting of their State data.

Sources must have an understanding of and experience in:  maintaining and managing multiple, complex activities concurrently at the highest level of professional and scientific quality; managing subcontractors and consultants; building, managing, and analyzing a large administrative encounter-level database in direct support of health services research; developing systems for monitoring and maintaining secure and efficient computing environment (including programmer resources); processing inpatient and outpatient data; outpatient billing and CPT/HCPCS coding and inpatient billing and ICD-9 and ICD-10 coding; providing assistance on understanding and adoption of technological innovations that may affect different aspects of the project for the transmission and sharing of data such as the Electronic Health Record; applying national health care data standards; conducting complex programming in support of sample design and other statistical software; developing sample design and sampling weights to produce national or other such estimates; producing electronic documentation from large administrative encounter-level data for independent use by other organizations; recruiting data Partners, coordinating and negotiating with outside agencies for data purchase and collection, and providing technical assistance to data organizations; conducting special analyses, providing technical support and training in data collection and analysis; managing large health care electronic databases and Web sites; health policy, uses of administrative data; ability to write user-friendly, technically accurate reports.  Source must possess, or be able to obtain (in-house or through subcontracting/consulting arrangements) the staff and other resources needed to expeditiously carry out the different types of activities listed.

The Government encourages novel approaches to existing requirements, realizing cost savings, and obtaining alternative recommendations to enhance the Project’s success.  Of particular interest is demonstrated flexibility in a rapidly evolving data environment that can carry the HCUP project forward in this next phase.  

Responses to this sources sought notice are neither mandatory nor a condition for eligibility to participate in any resulting formal Requests for Proposals or future acquisition.  The Government will not provide comments to any Offeror’s submission.  

Interested businesses should submit their capability statements (approximately 10 pages in length to Sharon Williams, Contracting Officer, Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, Division of Contracts Management, 540 Gaither Road, Rockville, MD, 20850, no later than 4:00 p.m., eastern standard time, on December 1, 2005.  Capability statements should be tailored to this request and identify the source’s capabilities to complete this requirement, including information on key staff experience and education, and a description of corporate experience with similar projects.  Sources should indicate which tasks they will perform and which tasks they anticipate would be subcontracted out and what percentage of effort is anticipated to be performed in-house and what percentage would be subcontracted out.  Capability statements should include the size classification relative to NAICS Code 541519 ($21 million). Capability statements should be submitted in an original and three (3) copies.  Only paper copies will be accepted; no electronic or e-mail submissions will be accepted.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE IS FOR INFORMATION AND PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS AND DOES NOT COMMIT THE GOVERNMENT TO AWARD A CONTRACT NOW OR IN THE FUTURE. NO SOLICITATION IS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. BASED ON CAPABILITY STATEMENTS RECEIVED FROM THIS SOURCES SOUGHT THIS ACQUISITION MAY BE SOLICITED AS AN 8(a) SET-ASIDE; 100% SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE OR AS FULL AND OPEN. ALL SIZE ORGANIZATIONS ARE ENCOURAGED TO RESPOND. THE NAICS CODE IS 541710 WITH A SIZE STANDARD OF 500 EMPLOYEES.  The Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID), of the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), is seeking contractors interested in providing the effort to advance the field of contemporary clinical laboratory diagnostics for Invasive Aspergillosis (IA).  Diagnosis and treatment of serious fungal infections are high priorities of the NIAID.  Systemic fungal infections are a significant health problem in immunocompetent hosts (the endemic mycoses) and immunocompromised hosts (the opportunistic mycoses in addition to the endemic mycoses). The burden of invasive fungal disease in the U.S. has shifted from the community to the hospital base. These are recognized as important emerging infectious diseases, especially in nosocomial settings involving the management of bone marrow and solid organ transplant recipients, neutropenic cancer patients, and surgical, trauma and critical care patients.  Fungi cause approximately ten percent of nosocomial bloodstream infections.  This contract will link the appropriate clinical specimens (blood, urine, etc.) from patients at risk for IA and potentially interfering medical conditions to currently available and experimental laboratory tests for the purposes of diagnostic proof of principle, test comparison and evaluation. Respondants are required to demonstrate relevant experience in establishing and operating a clinical sample repository in accordance with the Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP) guidelines, access to human subjects at high risk for developing Invasive Aspergillosis that must include subjects receiving hematopoietic stem cell transplantation therapy and subjects at high risk for IA with potentially interfering medical conditions that must also include subjects receiving hematopoietic stem cell transplantation therapy, personnel with experience in Good Clinical Practices and collection of samples from human subjects, personnel with experience in Good Laboratory Practices and diagnostic test development, and adequate facilities.  The contractor will be expected to achieve these goals through the establishment and maintenance of a repository of clinical samples from patients at risk for IA and by performing evaluation and comparison studies between FDA-licensed tests for IA and experimental IA diagnostic tests.  Organizations that submit capability statements in response to this notice will be evaluated against the adequacy of their training, experience, expertise and availability of the proposed PI, including technical and management skills, knowledge of applicable regulations to manage a GCP and GLP compliant clinical sample repository and ability to direct GLP compliant test studies along with personnel that have appropriate GCP and GLP training.  The organization should have access to patient populations at risk for Invasive Aspergillosis (IA) such that it is highly probable that serial clinical samples will be collected from at least 30 subjects diagnosed with proven IA during the first three years of the contract.  A potential offerer would be asked to provide a cost-effective plan for obtaining and storing samples from subjects at risk for developing IA and provide documented evidence of all collaborations/consortiums that will be formed to collect and/or store specimens.  Patient populations must include bone marrow transplant patients and may also include neutropenic cancer patients, and solid organ transplant recipients.  You should address staff expertise in the collection of clinical research samples and medical information in a GCP compliant manner along with an understanding of the OHRP guidelines for the operation of a repository.  You should have experience in the storage, retrieval and distribution of samples and would be expected to provide personnel, facilities (clean rooms, laboratories, storage area, etc.), and equipment (freezers, refrigerators, etc.) available for preparing the samples and the repository, along with a system that will be used to track samples in the repository.  Potential offerors should have an understanding of state, federal and international shipping regulations, validation testing for cold chain shipping containers, preparing SOPs based on the results of validation testing, preparation of all shipping documents and preparing SOPs for recipient to properly store the samples.  You would be expected to have experience in the techniques used in published laboratory tests available to detect Aspergillus fumigatus to include PCR and other technologies that could potentially be used to develop IA diagnostic tests, expertise in performing and interpreting the results from the Bio-Rad PlateliaTM Aspergillus EIA test, and access to samples required for replication studies (IA animal model or samples from previous IA clinical studies.  It is estimated that approximately 6 FTEs will be required for the performance of this project over a 7-year period of performance.

<DESC>It is the Governments intent to solicit a requirement with L. Robert Kimball and Associates, 615 West Highland Avenue, Ebensburg, PA  15931, for the Armys Regional Integrated Command Center (RICC) Program, to provide all necessary  labor and materials to develop, coordinate and execute a program focused on  supporting a prototype regional 9-1-1 dispatch facility designed during the  base year effort, and to include additional incremental efforts of piloting  the dispatch facility concept in Southwest PA Region 13 (pilot to include  Allegheny and Cambria Counties), and integrating 9-1-1 services into the Army  Integrated Emergency Operations Center (IEOC) Program.  This proposed contract  action is for the continued research and development efforts for which the  Government intends to award to only one source under the authority of FAR  6.302.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.   However, interested persons may identify their capabilities and experience by  responding to this notice via email to cyanavok@pica.army.mil.  All responses  received within the dates and time indicated will be considered by the  Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete with this  proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the  discretion of the Government. The rationale for sole source to L. Robert  Kimball and Associates is that to replicate existing capabilities would incur  a potential cost of up to $2M to the Government and would cause a program  slippage of approximately twelve (12) months.  L. Robert Kimball and  Associates also have a strong working relationship with the Emergency  Management community within the State of Pennsylvania as well as Southwestern  PA, for assessing and validating user requirements for adequate data package to enable competition at this time.  Note 22 and 26 apply.

THADDEUS J. DULSKI FEDERAL BUILDING

BUFFALO, NEW YORK

Building Fact Sheet

GENERAL INFORMATION

Introduction
The Federal Building, Buffalo, New York, was designed and constructed for the General Ser¬vices Administration, Public Buildings Service, Region 2, New York, New York. The building was constructed in 1971.  In 2004, GSA undertook a detailed review of the financial performance of the Dulski Building.  GSA concluded that the asset was not contributing to the overall portfolio and disposal was the recommended option.  Early in 2005, GSA commenced the disposal process by reporting the property to be excess to its needs.  The first step of the process was a screening of the property to other federal land holding agencies.  This 30-day screening ended in September 2005; no federal agencies expressed interest in acquiring the property.  In October 2005, GSA determined the property surplus to the needs of the Government and initiated a screening for certain non-profit organization, as well as local, county, and state public agencies.  If no non-profit organizations or public bodies express interest in the property after that 60-day screening period, GSA will proceed to market the property for a sale to the general public.

Building Design

The Federal Building is an unusual structure in several respects. Described by its architect as being designed “inside-out and upside-down” this fifteen-story building features a huge ser¬vice tower dominating the facade on the West Huron side, which is the Main Entrance.  The windowless tower will contain eight passenger elevators, a freight elevator and lavatories, leaving each floor of the building completely devoted to office space.  The top floor houses machinery generally found in basements. Boilers, refrigeration plants and electrical installation will be on the fifteenth floor. An underground automobile park¬ing area is located in the basement, with its entrance and exit on South Elmwood Avenue.  Approximately 180 parking spaces are also available. 


The Service Tower, rising more than 200 feet will give interest to the building, as will the sculp¬tured effect of the precast concrete facade with its recessed windows.  The windows are vertically pivoted, anodized aluminum sash and grey tinted glass. Designed for effective maintenance and cleaning. These windows can be rotated 360 degrees.  Careful planning and consideration have been given to the comfort of the employees scheduled to occupy the building.  Modern equipment and facilities have been provided throughout to pro¬duce an efficient and effective working environment. The ceilings in all offices are acoustically treated to provide noise control. Sound-resistant partitioning has been used to divide office space. All offices have recessed fluorescent lighting, designed to provide a minimum of 75-foot candles of illumination at desk level. The use of an under floor electrical duct system through¬out the office areas on the first through the eleventh floors facilitates the installation of tele¬phone and power receptacles in convenient locations.
An air distribution system has been installed to provide comfortable air cooling and heating regardless of outside weather conditions. Two 600 and 100 ton centrifugal refrigeration plants for air ¬conditioning and two 10,463,000 BTU per hour capacity-boilers for heating are inter-connected to a distribution system with automatic temperature controls and related equipment. The boilers are duel fuel oil/gas to assure dependable operation under all conditions. Complementing the air distribution system are independent thermostatically controlled fan coil units located on all floors, which provide heating and cooling of perimeter office space. 
Four low rise elevators servicing the basement through ninth floor and four high rise elevators servicing the basement to fifteenth floor provide rapid vertical transportation to govern¬ment employees and to the public.

In addition, a freight elevator and two enclosed stairways provide ready access to and from all floors.  Special consideration has been given to the accessibility of the building for handicapped per¬sons. Ramps are provided at the Delaware Street entrance.
