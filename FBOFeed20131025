<DESC>The U.S. EPA's NVFEL intends to negotiate on a sole source basis, under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with The Mathworks, Inc. for the renewal Matlab/Simulink licenses.
Matlab and Simulink are proprietary programming and modeling computer software programs that are only sold by The Mathworks, Inc. These programs are used by the NVFEL engineers to program and design engine control units. Furthermore, these software programs are also used to design and implement hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) and full vehicle modeling systems. NVFEL has invested time and resources into the utilization of this software. Only Matlab and Simulink possess the functionalities of the software to integrate seamlessly with the existing in-house software, programming infrastructure, and existing test data.
THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE QUOTATIONS. However, any firm that believes it is capable of meeting the NVFEL's requirement may submit technical documentation to attempt to establish the potential of complying with the specifications. Such documents must be submitted within 15 days of the electronic posting of this notice. A determination not to compete the proposed requirement based upon the responses to this notice will be considered solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered only for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement or to proceed on a sole source basis. The applicable NAICS code is 511210. Written requests should be submitted via email to Noah Goldberg at Goldberg.noah@epa.gov. No telephone requests or request by fax will be honored.

<DESC>The purpose of this RFI is to identify commercially available products that will meet requirements for a Portable Detection System for Select Environments (PDSSE). The primary purpose of the PDSSE is to provide a temporary system that can be deployed, set up, configured and operational within a short time frame (less than 24 hours). The PDSSE shall detect intrusions into the perimeter; provide location (i.e. sector or zone) of intrusions along the perimeter; annunciate the alarms and the location to security forces; and provide a means of assessment of alarms. The PDSSE shall allow for scalability, in that perimeter sizes and environments will vary from location to location. The PDSSE shall be capable of being transported rapidly to locations that require temporary perimeter detection. <br /><br />The Force Protection Branch needs to assess the current state of the technology and what is commercially available that can be used to meet the goals and requirements of security forces in providing a portable intrusion detection system.

FedBid has developed an online, anonymous, browser based application to conduct the reverse auction. A Seller may submit a series of pricing bids, which descend in price during the specified period of time for the aforementioned reverse auction. VHA NCO 07 - 534 - Charleston, SC is taking this action in an effort to improve both seller access and awareness of requests and the agency's ability to gather multiple, completed, real-time bids.All responsible Sellers that respond to this solicitation MUST submit the pricing portion of their bid using the online exchange located at www.FedBid.com. There is no cost to register, review procurement data or make a bid on www.FedBid.com.Sellers that are not currently registered to use www.FedBid.com should proceed to www.FedBid.com to complete their free registration. Sellers that require special considerations or assistance may contact the FedBid Helpdesk at 877-9FEDBID (877-933-3243) or via email at clientservices@fedbid.com. Sellers may not artificially manipulate the price of a transaction on www.FedBid.com by any means. It is unacceptable to place bad faith bids, to use decoys in the www.FedBid.com process or to collude with the intent or effect of hampering the competitive www.FedBid.com process.Should Sellers require additional clarification, contact FedBid at 877-9FEDBID (877-933-3243) or clientservices@fedbid.com. <BR> <BR>Use of FedBid:   Buyers and Sellers agree to conduct this transaction through FedBid in compliance with the FedBid Terms of Use. Failure to comply with the below terms and conditions may result in offer being determined as non-responsive. <BR> <BR>In addition to any VHA buy terms entered in FedBid, the Seller (Bidder) has reviewed and acknowledges any attached solicitation documents, item details, delivery schedule, and/or instructions to Seller (collectively referred to as requirements), and agrees to all terms and conditions set forth in the solicitation documents. While additional support documentation (e.g. Seller Attachments) may be requested, pricing shall be entered as a 'bid' in the reverse auction - offline pricing is not an acceptable bid. At the conclusion of the reverse auction, if attached to the buy, the apparent winning bidder shall be required to complete the solicitation documents prior to award. <BR> <BR>This solicitation requires registration with the System for Award Management (SAM) prior to award, pursuant to applicable regulations and guidelines. Registration information can be found at www.sam.gov. <BR> <BR>Any questions and /or responses that materially change the solicitation will be incorporated in the resultant award document. <BR> <BR>If an "or equal" item is being offered, the offeror shall submit product literature at the time of quote submission in sufficient detail to evaluate compliance with the salient characteristics requirements in the RFQ. Additionally, if the offeror is not the manufacturer of the quoted items, the offeror shall submit written evidence at the time of quote submission that clearly verifies that the firm is an authorized distributor and/or reseller of the quoted products and will provide the items on or before the delivery date. <BR> <BR>

order to maintain the quality of the part. Existing unique design capability, engineering skills, and manufacturing knowledge by the qualified source(s) require acquisition of the part from the approved source(s). The approved source(s) retain data rights, manufacturing knowledge, or technical data that are not economically available to the Government, and the data or knowledge is essential to maintaining the quality of the part. An alternate source must qualify in accordance with the design control activity's procedures, as approved
by the cognizant Government engineering activity. The qualification procedures must be approved by the Government engineering activity having jurisdiction over
the part in the intended application.The subject item requires Government source
approval prior to contract award, as the item is flight critical and/or the technical data available has not been determined adequate to support acquisition

<DESC>This is a sources sought synopsis; there is no solicitation available at this time. Requests for solicitation will receive no response. This Sources Sought Synopsis is published for market research purposes only. This market survey is conducted to identify potential sources capable of meeting the requirements of the 96th Range Squadron, 96th Range Group, 96th Test Wing, for providing overhaul/rebuild/refurbishing services and parts for the armored and non-armored target vehicles used on the test ranges at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida.<br />&nbsp;
<p>The Air Force intends to issue a solicitation for this requirement in the near future and to award to one contractor capable of meeting all of the requirements detailed in this sources sought and the attached Statement of Requirements. It is anticipated that vendors may have trouble meeting both the foreign and U.S. domestic requirements. For this reason, the government is considering award to one (1) vendor who can meet the foreign requirement and one (1) vendor who can meet the U.S. domestic requirement, if one vendor cannot be found who can meet all requirements. Please clearly indicate which block of requirements you can and cannot meet (Foreign, U.S. Domestic, or Both). The government does not intend to break apart the foreign and U.S. domestic blocks.</p>
<p>Due to the critical nature of the supporting the Air Force's test missions, a thirty (30) day After Receipt of Order (ARO) is required. The parts and services required are for both foreign and U.S. military vehicles. As a result of various derivatives of each vehicle being made available for testing on Eglin AFB, the overall families of vehicles (FOV's) that parts and services will be required for are as follows.</p>
<p>M-60 Main Battle Tank (MBT) Family of Vehicle (FOV), M1 MBT FOV, T-72 MBT FOV, T-55 MBT FOV, M-113 Armored Personnel Carrier (APC) FOV, BMP APC FOV, BRDM APC FOV, BTR APC FOV, MT-LB FOV, SA-6 System FOV, 2S1 System FOV, ZSU-23-4 System FOV, HEMTT Series Truck FOV, M-900 Series Truck FOV, M-35 Series Truck FOV, FMTV Series Truck FOV, ZIL Truck FOV, URAL Truck FOV, KRAZ Truck FOV, P-40 Truck FOV and MAZ truck FOV.</p>
<p>The contractor is responsible for arranging for the procurement and delivery of all parts without assistance from the government. All licenses and approvals for the attainment of any parts are the responsibility of the contractor.</p>
<p>The Air Force anticipates utilizing a Firm-Fixed Price (FFP) Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract. The Air Force anticipates the ordering period will be a base year and two (2) option years, for a total of three (3) years. Firms responding to this announcement shall indicate whether they are a large business, small business, small disadvantaged business (SDB), woman-owned small business (WOSB), 8(a)-certified business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business (SDVOSB), veteran-owned small business (VOSB), or Historically Underutilized Business small business (HUBZone). The National American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this action is 336992 "Military Armored Vehicle, Tank and Tank Component Manufacturing," the small business size standard is 1,000 employees. All prospective contractors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database to be awarded a DoD contract. Prospective contractors are cautioned to ensure that the proper NAICS code appears in their SAM. The Air Force has not yet determined the acquisition strategy for this requirement, including whether a set-aside strategy is applicable. Note that a key factor in determining an acquisition to be a Small Business Set Aside is that small business prime contractors must perform over 50% of the effort, as defined in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.219-14. <br /><br />All interested contractors shall submit a 10 page or less capabilities document. Provide recent, relevant experience in all areas, including whether this experience was as a prime or subcontractor, whether it was in support of a government or commercial contract, and what the scope and requirements of the effort were. Teaming and/or subcontracting arrangements shall be clearly delineated and previous experience in teaming must be provided. Interested contractors will clearly explain how they intend to meet the stated requirements: (1) the company has the technical knowledge and/or manufacturing capability to acquire/produce the spare components listed above; (2) the company has the ability to provide the required repair/refurbishment/rebuild/overhaul services required; (3) spare components delivered will meet form, fit, and performance requirements for physical and functional compatibility with the current vehicles that are part of the 96 Range Squadron's target inventory. The Air Force has no development funding for this procurement. Spare components will be procured using RDT&amp;E and Operations and Maintenance (O&amp;M) funding.<br /><br />Please Provide:</p>
<p>Company Name; Address; Point of Contact; Telephone number; E-Mail Address; CAGE Code; Web Page URL; and Small business size certification if applicable. Please submit one (1) electronic copy of your response to AFTC/PZIE (Eglin), Mr. Michael Hoover, michael.hoover.11 @us.af.mil, and Ms. Karen Wagner, karen.wagner.1@us.af.mil, no later than December 6, 2013 (date) at 1:00pm Central Standard Time.<br /><br />The Government will neither award a contract solely on the basis of this sources sought nor will it reimburse the contractor for any costs associated with preparing or submitting a response to this notice. This notice does not constitute a Request for Quotation (RFQ), Request for Proposal (RFP) or an Invitation for Bid (IFB), nor does this issuance restrict the Government's acquisition approach. The Government reserves the right to reject in whole or part any industry input as a result of this announcement. But vendors are encouraged to reply with recommended improvement to the attached draft Statement of Requirements. The Government recognizes that proprietary data may be a part of this effort. If so, clearly mark such restricted or proprietary data and present it as an addendum to the non-restricted/non-proprietary information. If the Government decides to award a contract for this or related effort, a solicitation will be published and posted on the FedBizOpps website.</p>

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)<br />KC-135 R/T Air Refueling Fuel Vapor Protection
<p>INTRODUCTION<br />This is a Request for Information (RFI) is for the KC-135R/T and OC-B. There is not solicitation available at this time. This RFI is published for Market Research purposes only. Participation in this RFI is optional and not required in order to respond to any subsequent procurement this Contracting Agency may take. Any information used will be on a non-attribution basis. Restrictions that would limit the Government's ability to use the information for these purposes are of limited value to the Government and are discouraged. There is no commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation, to make an award or awards, or to be responsible for any monies expended by any interested parties in support of any effort in response to this RFI. Any information submitted in response to this RFI is strictly voluntary. This RFI is strictly for information planning purposes and the Government will not pay or otherwise reimburse respondents for information submitted. All documentation shall become the property of the Government. Unless otherwise stated herein, no additional information is available.</p>
<p><br />PURPOSE<br />The AFLCMC/WKDM Program Office, Tinker AFB, OK, is conducting market research to determine estimated cost and schedule to procure an upgrade to existing air refueling (AR) and refueling receptacle (ARR) manifold systems. The purpose of this RFI is to gather information on providing dual fuel vapor barrier protection that could be installed on AR and ARR manifold systems across the KC-135 R/T fleet. Dual fuel vapor barrier protection for the AR and ARR manifold systems is required to provide primary and secondary liquid-tight and vapor-tight barriers, a means to determine if the primary barrier has failed, and safe drainage of primary barrier leakage.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND<br />If a rubber seal fails on an ARR or AR manifold system there is no secondary seal or safe drain to keep fuel separate from the crew compartment. Leaking ARR manifolds introduce fuel into the flight deck near the area of the navigator's station. AR manifold leaks can introduce fuel in the boomer's pod and accumulate in the boom sight window and floor.</p>
<p><br />DESCRIPTION <br />AFLCMC/WKKPA is requesting information pertaining to the procurement of 398 AR manifold upgrades (plus 40 spares), 9 ARR manifold upgrades (plus one spare per design, or two spares total), and 2 OC-B fuel drain manifold upgrades (plus 1 spare). Of the 9 ARR manifolds, six were designed by LTV and three by Boeing. An Illustrated Parts Breakdown (IPB) is available upon request to assist in the design of a viable solution. The IPB drawings are Distribution Statement D, "Department of Defense and U.S. DoD Contractors Only" and as such will only be shared with U.S. DoD contractors with an assigned CAGE code. Photographs of the ARR receptacle and of certain sections of the AR manifolds are available upon request to the DoD and U.S. DoD contractors only. Fuel manifold leaks into the cabin and crew compartment where ignitions sources may exist which could potentially result in cabin fire/explosion. AFLCMC/WKDM aims to mitigate this serious risk by procuring AR and ARR manifold upgrade kits able to provide dual fuel vapor barrier protection.</p>
<p>The current system utilizes one o-ring at each pipe junction. When the o-ring fails there is nothing in place to prevent fuel from entering the crew compartment.</p>
<p>For AR equipped aircraft, the following apply:<br />There are a total of seven junctions with a single o-ring between two flanged pipe ends.</p>
<p>For OC-B aircraft fuel drains, the following apply:<br />There are a total of five junctions with a single o-ring between two flanged pipe ends.</p>
<p>For LTV ARR equipped aircraft, the following apply:<br />There are a total of nine junctions with a single o-ring between two flanged pipe ends. There are a total of two couple joints with one o-ring on the top and bottom.</p>
<p>For Boeing ARR equipped aircraft, the following apply:<br />There are a total of four junctions with a single o-ring between two flanged pipe ends.</p>
<p>The dimensions of these pipes are not available due to restricted rights.</p>
<p>DISCLAIMER<br />This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a solicitation. In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Respondents are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI. Responses to this RFI will not be returned. Respondents will not be notified of the result of the review. All responses must be unclassified.</p>
<p><br />Response <br />Responses shall address:<br />1. Technical details of design<br />2. Program Estimated Cost information (ROM) for design<br />- Include separate estimates for: Production Kits, Non-recurring Engineering, Spares, Prototypes (1 per design), Kit-proofing, and Installation Costs (for one KC-135R/T model with AR mod only, for one KC-135R/T model with AR and ARR mod, and for one OC-135 mod)<br />3. Delivery schedule/product availability of 398 AR manifold kits<br />4. Delivery schedule/product availability of 9 ARR manifold kits<br />5. Delivery schedule/product availability of 2 OC-B fuel drain manifold kits</p>

<p>Guidelines<br />Guidelines consist of the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR), the Department of State Acquisition Regulations, the CO's letter of delegation of authority appointing the COR or GTM, the terms and conditions of the contracts, and official INL bureau guidelines. In addition, the incumbent must be able to determine application of basic administrative policy statements concerning the issue or problem being studied, which may include reference to pertinent legislative history, related court decisions, state and local laws, or policy initiatives of agency management. The incumbent must also consider and adhere to various other existing federal regulations, and the interaction between DOS policies, legislation, the Foreign Assistance Act, and other authorization and appropriations in the INL account, applicable National Security and Presidential Decision Directives, OMB Circulars, the Foreign Affairs Handbook (FAH), the Foreign Affairs Manual (FAM) and DOS financial operating procedures and policies.</p>
<p>Complexity<br />The programs implemented by INL are generally highly complex multi-year development and capacity-building programs. The programs often require the ability to resolve critical problems and achieve difficult goals that may impact on other programs.</p>
<p>Programs are also characterized by large obligations of USG funds, a potentially high-risk security environment, a geographically broad operating platform, demanding program schedules, frequently-changing requirements, politically sensitive outcomes, multiple interagency and international actors, multiple contractor and sub-contractor relationships, and intense audit/oversight scrutiny. Detailed plans, goals, objectives and evaluation criteria are required for the long-range implementation and administration of the programs. Decisions concerning planning and organizing the programs are complicated by the intricacy of the contracts and the need to deal with multilayered concepts. Problems can arise that require intuition - the ability to tell when something is wrong or is likely to go wrong; inductive reasoning - the ability to combine pieces of information to form general rules or conclusions (includes finding a relationship among seemingly unrelated events); and deductive reasoning - the ability to apply general rules to specific problems to produce answers that make sense.</p>
<p>Physical Demands</p>
<p>The work requires the ability to travel to and from several remote areas. The work requires an above average resistance to fatigue and physical hardships. Successful completion of a State Department Class 1 unrestricted medical exam is required. Extended assignments to remote program sites will be required, necessitating the ability to walk medium to longer distances (hundreds of yards or more) on generally irregular dirt or stone surfaces, in both hilly and flat terrain. Additionally, those undergoing medical treatment or taking certain medicines that limit their physical or mental abilities may find it difficult to adhere to the limitations recommended by their physician(s). Travel on helicopters and/or cargo-oriented fixed wing aircraft may also be required. Those with ear or other problems, who do not easily adapt to pressurized environments or higher but non-pressurized environments, will find the travel requirements of these positions difficult. Climate conditions are also a factor. Work is often done in extremes of cold and heat, in dusty and windy environments, and frequently outdoors. Those with circulation problems or difficulties adapting to climate extremes or extremely dusty environments will find this aspect of the work difficult and may not be capable of passing the State Department required medical exam.</p>
<p>III. POSITION ELEMENTS<br />Supervisory Controls: The COR carries out duties on behalf of the CO, but reports to the INL Director at Post. The GTM is delegated authority by the CO to assist the COR. The incumbent's actions, decisions and recommendations are reviewed on the basis of demonstrated professional judgment, results achieved and conformance with appropriate laws and regulations.</p>
<p>The period of performance will be one year from the date of award with four option years.</p>
<p>Level of Effort: Hours for this full-time position will be the core hours of U.S. Embassy Kabul: 8:30am to 5:30pm Sunday through Thursday with a minimum of fifty-five hours per week.</p>
<p>Travel and Position Location: The position is located within Regional Commands throughout Afghanistan. Frequent travel in and around the assigned province is likely. All movements within Afghanistan will be covered by the U.S. military and/or INL air wing and motor pool assets, and all travel outside of Afghanistan will be covered by commercial airlines.</p>
<p>Pre-deployment support for the Afghanistan-based Advisor: The advisor will be required to attend four (4) weeks of basic familiarization training at the Foreign Service Institute in Washington D.C. prior to deployment.</p>
<p>Life Support: Life support for the Advisor will be provided by other USG service providers and is not to be included in this task order proposal. INL/INL Kabul will provide the incumbent with access to the Embassy compound. The incumbent will have access to hardened and/or regular cars (exact type will be dependent on the security situation) from motor pool for transportation. Housing will be assigned through the Embassy's PRT Office in coordination with INL and the PRT Commander.</p>

<DESC>This notice is issued by NASA/MSFC to post a Request for Information (RFI) via the internet, and solicit responses from interested parties. Pursuant to FAR 52.215-3, this document is for information and planning purposes and to allow industry the opportunity to verify reasonableness and feasibility of the requirement, as well as promote competition.  It does not constitute a Request for Proposal. This RFI is open but not limited to educational, industrial and not-for-profit organizations. Prospective offerors are invited to submit their responses no later than November 4, 2013.  NASA/MSFC is interested in solar sail systems for interplanetary robotic exploration that may be deployed from a cubesat.  This RFI solicits information about solar sail systems that may be delivered for flight as soon as 2016. The solar sail system must be capable of deployment after the cubesat separates from the launch vehicle.  The solar sail system shall consist of a reflective sail membrane, a deployable sail support structure, an independent sail actuation system that may be coupled to an overall spacecraft   attitude control system to minimize or eliminate the use of propellant, and all hardware and software needed to prepare the sail for launch. The basic engineering boundary conditions for the solar sail system are: 	Deployed Sail Dimensions: ~10 meters x ~10 meters (or as large as can be packaged in the stowed volume available listed below) 	Sail System (including booms and any deployment mechanisms) Stowed Volume available: &#8804;2U (1U cubesat dimension = 10 cm x 10 cm x 10 cm) 	Effective Sail Reflectance: &gt; 0.91 in the visible spectrum 	Anti-sunward Emissivity: &gt; 0.30 	Thrust Vector Pointing Range: cone of 45 half-angle (centered on the solar vector, thrusting anti-sunward) 	The membrane shall be fabricated from a space-durable, tear-resistant or tear-tolerant material designed for an operational lifetime of at least 2 years in a deep space environment (&lt; 2 AU from the Sun) that may include operations at or near the Moon 	The support structure shall deploy the sail membrane, and keep the deployed sail flat and relatively free of wrinkles. Respondents should address the relative flatness of their sail technology and how it might be also used as a solar reflector for purposes of providing illumination, the maturity of the technology and its subsystems (i.e., what part of the system have been flight qualified, when and by whom or under what project), and near-term plans for qualification of the technology, if any.  If the sail system includes an independent sail actuation system, then please describe how it may be used with the overall attitude control subsystem to provide a propellantless or very low propellant usage method to maintain and control the pitch, yaw, and roll orientation of the sail.	The response should include the proposed technical specifications of the sail, including but not limited to, overall sail dimensions, deployment strategy, boom type, known structural mode, boom material, sail material, etc. Respondents should estimate, broken down by key sail subsystems, the cost of solar sail system development and testing, integration and accommodation in a cubesat (in FY14 dollars).  This should include an engineering development unit cost, first flight unit cost, and a second flight unit cost. Responses should include the following information: 1. Company name, point of contact name, phone number, e-mail address, and nature of interest. 2. Information regarding existing or planned instruments with respect to the above section (include written and illustrated concepts, ideas, and description of capabilities). 3. Identification of industry partnerships represented in the response (if any). When responding, reference RFI NNM142ZPS001L -- CUBESAT SOLAR SAIL SYSTEMS. Documents and attachments should be in Microsoft WORD, POWERPOINT, or PDF format.  Files should not be greater than 15 pages (no less than 10 point font except in figure captions). It is not NASA's intent to publicly disclose vendor proprietary information obtained from this RFI. To the full extent that it is protected pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act and other laws and regulations, information identified by a respondent as "Proprietary or Confidential" will be kept confidential. Responses may be forwarded to Marlyce R. Alexander via electronic transmission at Marlyce.R.Alexander@nasa.gov. This presolicitation synopsis is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government pay for the information submitted in response.	Respondents will not be notified of the results. An ombudsman has been appointed-See NASA Specific Note "B". NASA Clause 1852.215-84, Ombudsman, is applicable.

The Contractor's group performing services will be responsible for a full spectrum of direct intraoperative monitoring, analysis, and reporting of findings to surgical staff as well as documentation in the patient medical record.  

Contract will monitor and provide intraoperative feedback during the actual performance of the procedure; such 'real time' feedback, will be delineated in the Contractor's technical and logistical approach.

2.	CNIM certification from American Board of Registration of Electro-encephalographic Technologists is required. 

3.  EQUIPMENT:   

A.	The Philadelphia VA Medical Center will not procure, or provide separate compensation for Contractor's use of, any equipment required to perform services under this contract.

B.  The contractor is responsible for utilizing the Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) in Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VISTA) at the Philadelphia VA Medical Center.

<DESC>Security cooperation (SC) is defined by the Department of Defense (DoD) as the means by which the DoD encourages and enables countries and organizations to work with the United States to achieve strategic objectives. The SC operations of all DoD organizations support the objectives outlined in the National Security Strategy of the United States, the National Defense Strategy, and the National Military Strategy. SC objectives are carried out as a part of the theater strategy planning and execution function of multiple DoD agencies. Currently, each DoD Agency has an individual method by which theater security cooperation (TSC) data is collected and accessed.
The G-TSCMIS effort will make global TSC data more accessible to the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) and the Joint Staff, as well as available to the TSC community at large. The G- TSCMIS will entail the standardization of TSC data, single point aggregation and visualization of that data, and data linkages to enable assessment of the data against strategic objectives of the Secretary of Defense and Joint Chiefs of Staff.

<RESPDATE>110613
<CONTACT>Carol E. Neely, Phone 7034328049, Email carol.neely@usmc.mil
<DESC>PURPOSE: This RFI is an effort to conduct market research for use in formulating an acquisition strategy to obtain contract services to fill foundational geospatial data gaps, support rapid response to global missions, and be compliant with National System for Geoint (NSG) standards. Marine Corps Intelligence Activity (MCIA) requires Geospatial Services to extract terrain and feature data through photogrammetric engineering methods utilizing stereo and mono satellite imagery. Principal operations would be conducted at the contractor facility, up to the secret classification level. Digital Elevation Models (DEM), both reflective surface and bare earth, and Feature Data are primary datasets utilized by the MCIA, Geospatial Intelligence Division (GID) to conduct geospatial intelligence analyses in support of Marine Corps operations and training requirements. This RFI allows potential contractors to submit a non-binding statement of interest and documentation demonstrating their corporate capabilities and suggestions that will allow the Government to refine its potential course of action. The qualifying NAICS code for this effort is 541360. with a size standard of $14.0 Mil.
<p><br />BACKGROUND: These datasets are used to perform a wide range of geospatial analyses that include but are not limited to helicopter landing zone analysis, enhanced line of site visualizations, force protection viewsheds, dam break flood analysis, slope computations, cross-country mobility, cover/concealment analyses, expeditionary points of entry, and high definition urban analysis. High accuracy elevation data is also a prerequisite in orthorectification of source imagery for other supplemental products. The importance of accurate, detailed, foundational data, that supports the Marine Corps mission cannot be overstated as it is being used extensively to construct products in support of current and planned Marine operations around the world. NGA programs, like High Resolution Terrain Elevation (HRTe) and Topographic Data Store (TDS), are focused at the tactical resolutions needed, however the demand for rapid response and program flexibility cannot be met by NGA in every global situation. In order to answer hasty and specific geospatial intelligence questions, high resolution terrain and feature data is needed that supports the Marine Corps mission priorities in the urban and littoral areas, and is compliant with the National System for GEOINT (NSG) standards.</p>
<p>CORE OBJECTIVES TO BE ACCOMPLISHED</p>
<p>MCIA has made significant investments in leveraging the capabilities of commercially available software tools like SOCET SET, Next Generation Automatic Terrain Extraction (NGATE), ESRI ArcGIS and ERDAS Imagine DEM tools. This effort requires the use of a Geo Data extraction tool in automated, semi-automated, and manual environments. Accordingly, the contractor will be required to demonstrate advanced, reliable capabilities of a user configurable software tool set that can meet or exceed these softwares when performing the following:</p>
<p>1. Foundation Feature Data Extraction - 1:100,000 scale 30'x30' map sheets in Local-TDS (LTDS) attribute and collection standards.</p>
<p>2. Foundation Feature Data Extraction - LTDS scale data in a square km configuration used to fill in remaining polygon areas of square km coverage that does not meet the Urban definition when collecting item 4.</p>
<p>3. HRTe - High Resolution Terrain Elevation data (Reflective and Bare Earth) - Area coverage may be in either standard HRTe program block size (30' x 30') or square kilometer configurations for Level 3; and square kilometer only for Level 4.</p>
<p>4. Urban Foundation Feature Data Extraction - Square km collection in Specialized-Urban TDS (S-UTDS) attribute and collection standards. Used to populate a product-neutral digital database.</p>

<DESC>Central Federal Lands Highway Division (CFLHD) of the Federal Highway Administration anticipates awarding two or more Full-Service Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts for architect-engineer (A-E) services. Projects will primarily involve improvements to rural low-volume roadways in environmentally sensitive areas requiring context sensitive design solutions for work ranging from pavement preservation, to 3R (resurfacing, restoration and rehabilitation) to full reconstruction. Transportation-related engineering and surveying services will include all work needed to conduct planning, scoping, environmental compliance, preliminary and final design to prepare contract documents in support of several Federally-funded programs administered by CFLHD.
<p>TYPE OF CONTRACT: This procurement is being solicited on an unrestricted basis to A-E firms licensed and registered within one or more of the states served by CFLHD. Professional documents produced under each contract will require a Professional Engineer and/or a Registered Land Surveyor license relative to the state in which the project work is located. Each contract awarded will consist of 1 base year and options to extend the contract for 4 additional 1-year periods. Each successful A-E firm will be re-evaluated each year to determine award of options to extend the contract. The contract shall have a maximum not-to-exceed 5-year total of $10 million. Each contract will operate with individually negotiated, firm-fixed price task orders issued in accordance with the terms of the contract. Task orders may or may not be for a complete project or series of projects.</p>
<p>Selected firms must comply with Equal Employment Opportunity requirements in accordance with FAR 22.8.

<DESC><p><span style="COLOR: black">SOLE-SOURCE Notice.&nbsp; This is a notice concerning an intended SOLE-SOURCE award. The Disability Research Center (DRC), in the Office of the Secretary in the U. S. Department of Transportation (DOT), needs a reliable contractor-company to provide----for DOT employees stationed at the Volpe National Transportation Systems Center in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and for certain non-DOT employees, by agreement with the US Coast Guard, in New London, Connecticut-----interpreting services for individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing.&nbsp; DOT intends to award a Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) to some company for that purpose.&nbsp; It is estimated that the Period of Performance for that contemplated BPA would run from approximately December 1, 2013 through November 30, 2018.&nbsp; It is estimated that the BPA would have a value of about $150,000 per year. &nbsp;DOT is not planning on paying any long-distance travel-costs to the contractor in connection with the performance of that BPA, and the contractor's interpreting staff-members will need to be available to perform particular interpreting-assignments on short notice, so it is probably necessary that the contractor-company's interpreting-staff-members actually live near<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Cambridge, Massachusetts or near New London, Connecticut, and it is desirable that the contractor-<span style="text-decoration: underline;">company</span> be located near Cambridge, Massachusetts or near New London, Connecticut, as well.&nbsp; After having diligently searched for contractor-companies who are positioned to efficiently and effectively provide such interpreting services, DRC has found only one firm:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Partners Interpreters, LLC, which is located at 500 E. Washington Street, Suite 34, North Attleboro, Massachusetts 02760-6303.&nbsp; Therefore, DOT intends to award such a BPA to Partners Interpreters on a sole-source basis (i.e., without obtaining any competition), unless one or more <span style="text-decoration: underline;">other</span> firms prove their suitability for the interpreting project by submitting a convincing Statement of Qualifications to DOT in response to this Special Notice.&nbsp; Any such Statement of Qualifications shall be e-mailed to </span><a href="mailto:james.mowery@dot.gov" target="_blank">james.mowery@dot.gov</a><span style="COLOR: black"> and to </span><a href="mailto:trish.day@dot.gov">trish.day@dot.gov</a><span style="COLOR: black">,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>and to </span><a href="mailto:jonni.burnham@dot.gov">jonni.burnham@dot.gov</a><span style="COLOR: black">,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>so that it <span style="text-decoration: underline;">reaches</span> at least one of those three e-mail addresses not later than 11:59 PM Eastern Time November 8<sup>th</sup>, 2013.</span></p>

<DESC>The purpose of this notification is to inform Explosive Detection Systems Manufacturers that TSA has revised the qualification process for Explosive Detection Systems (EDS). In an effort to accelerate the process of deploying the most effective and efficient security capabilities, TSA is no longer requiring Certification Readiness Testing (CRT) as part of the EDS qualification process. However, the service will remain available for developmental purposes and vendors should work closely with the Explosives Division of DHS S&amp;T to prepare their system for certification testing. Please note that if an EDS system fails certification testing, OEMs will be required to resubmit a fully updated data package and there will be a period of time where an Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) will not be eligible to resubmit their system for certification testing. The attached EDS Competitive Procurement Industry Day presentation detailing the qualification process has been updated to remove the CRT process as a requirement for qualification of an EDS.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.   <br>  <br> The U.S. Army is interested in locating manufacturers currently cutting and sewing Army Combat Uniforms or with previous experience in manufacturing the uniform according to specifications, that would be interested in participating in a permethrin treated fabric cut and sew trial.  Ideally the facility will have an isolated production line dedicated to ACU production.  The facility must be willing to allow access for the Government and contracted environmental sampling companies to collect environmental samples during regular ACU production with standard Nylon Cotton (NyCo) material (baseline) and then while using a permethrin impregnated material (trial).  Environmental sampling will take place over at least 2 days of production for both the untreated and treated materials.  Work area samples to be taken may include air collection in and around the facility and equipment as well as surface swabs.  Additionally, employees of the facility may be asked to wear small, lightweight air sampling pumps during the manufacturing process to measure the amount of permethrin present in the air in the immediate worker area.  The air sampling pumps clip onto the employee's belt and will not interfere with the employee's ability to complete their work.  Hand swabs of employees' skin (such as hands and arms) may also be included in determining the amount of permethrin released into the work environment during the manufacturing process. Results of any personal sampling can be made available and provided to the respective employee for entry into their medical records.  Facilities must be willing to cease production of the untreated ACUs in the trial area during the permethrin fabric trial.  All treated uniforms manufactured during the study will be transferred to the Army PM for fielding.  <br>  <br> Information provided should include the manufacturer's ability to provide an operational and isolated production line, capabilities to produce first quality ACUs, facility diagrams (to include layout, square footage,  location and number of air circulation fans, types of filters etc.), number of cutting and sewing operations and personnel per operation, description of all identified activities/processes that employees will be involved in for each work area during manufacturing, shift length and number of shifts being run, facility air exchange rate, location and operational status of any local exhaust ventilation (such as an exhaust fan with flexible hose/elephant trunk attachment), the number of days required to cut and sew 3,000 full uniforms, the number of shifts per day and the length of the shifts. <br>     <br> Manufacturers should also provide a cost estimate to cut and sew 3,000 ACU coats and/or trousers. Treated fabric (and untreated fabric if ACUs are not currently being produced) will be provided by the Government.  Cost estimates should consider all aspects of the assembly process excluding the fabric.  There is an opportunity for plus-up should one be required to reach 80-100% production capacity.  Anticipated timeframe for cut and sew trial is Winter2013/Spring 2014.  <br>  <br> Information submitted shall include: 1. Company name and address. 2. Point of contact, telephone, fax, Web address, and e-mail address. 3. Relevant company background/experience (including information detailed in the FedBizOps Note 25 regarding a firm's experience, personnel, and facilities)  <br>  <br> This Market Survey is for information purposes only and does NOT bind the U.S. Government to any type of contracting action, or guarantee any purchase by the U.S. Government.  <br>  <br> Submittals: Information about a particular brand/product should be submitted in electronic (MS Word) format by 4:00 pm EST on 25 Nov 2013 by e-mail to Ms. Melynda Perry at melynda.perry.civ@mail.mil.

PLACE OF PERFORMANCE: Lima, Peru<br />8. JOB DESCRIPTION: See below</p>
<p>GENERAL STATEMENT OF THE PURPOSE OF THIS CONTRACT AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE CONTRACTOR:<br />This position is located in the U.S. Embassy, INL Section, in Lima, Peru. The INL Narcotics Control Office is the liaison between INL and the Government of Peru's manual coca eradication program. The office also oversees the Institute of Tropical Cultivation, a scientific research/training NGO. Coca eradication is handled by CORAH (Proyecto Especial de Control y Reducci&oacute;n de los Cultivos de coca en el Alto Huallaga- the Government of Peru eradication organization), which falls under the Ministry of Interior but until this year was fully funded by INL to levels as determined by the Department of State. The Narcotics Control Officer (NCO), with the help of INL Accounting, oversees the use of that money. The NCO also advises CORAH on strategy, operational needs and concerns, security measures and personnel reassignments as required. The NCO also coordinates with the INL Aviation and Police programs, and oversees CORAH logistics, financial management, and administration activities. Within CORAH is CADA (Alternative Development Support Corps) which is responsible for the Social Responsibility Program, initial small-scale development projects to benefit coca farmers immediately after eradication. The office includes the Narcotics Control Officer, a Program Specialist, and a Program Assistant.</p>
<p>This position description establishes requirements for the Narcotics Control Officer within the INL Narcotics Control Office. The NCO oversees the strategic and operational planning, programming, and execution of the coca eradication program, in all its phases. The NCO is instrumental in collaborating with the CORAH Executive Director and other Directors in producing the yearly eradication plan. The NCO also coordinates eradication operations with USAID's Alternative Development Program, the Government of Peru/Ministry of the Interior, DEVIDA (roughly the GOP equivalent of the ONDCP) and other GOP entities as necessary. The NCO also supervises CORAH's administrative matters, the Social Responsibility Program, the licit crop activities of ICT, CORAH's construction projects, and INL administrative matters, including logistical support. The position requires problem solving, written and verbal communication, and well-developed interpersonal skills, as well as a thorough knowledge of field operations and security.</p>
<p>Supervisory Relationships:<br />The Officer works under the direct supervision of the INL Director and Deputy Director. The individual exercises wide latitude for independent action, initiating projects and executing approved new programs. The Officer coordinates directly with CORAH, DEVIDA and the Peruvian National Police. Completed work is reviewed for timeliness and effectiveness. The Officer directly supervises both the Program Specialist and Program Assistant.</p>
<p>Work Environment:<br />The primary workplace is the U.S. Embassy in Lima. However, the Officer frequently travels to the field for meetings, conferences, activity reviews, field inspections, and program evaluations. Most field sites are in areas that have been declared hazardous duty locations by the Department of State due to hostile activities of narco-traffickers.</p>
<p>Duties and Responsibilities:<br />The Officer is involved in eradication policy development, budgeting, approval and implementation. The Officer receives and directs information on all matters related to eradication operations and is involved in planning of communication strategies. The Officer represents the USG in policy discussions with host government and other counter-narcotic (CN) agencies related to eradication, interdiction, monitoring and sustainable development. The Officer coordinates the host government approval process of annual eradication work plans with high-level GOP officials.</p>
<p>Specific responsibilities include:<br />1. Provides input to the development of US Embassy yearly eradication strategy and goals, including long-term, short-term and contingency plans of operations. The Officer participates in the development of objectives and budgets for other projects within CORAH (like construction and the Social Responsibility Program) and ICT, in accordance with the Integrated Country Strategy. <br />2. Meets as necessary with INL program officers and other Mission personnel to coordinate the implementation and monitoring of eradication operations and illicit crop measurement, including administrative staff.<br />3.

The NCO monitors the implementation of eradication plans, evaluates effectiveness of those operations from the field, and adapts plans/strategies/resources as required by changing situations. <br />5. Consults with all appropriate programs about security risks that could affect eradication operations; in this way the officer receives security reports and/or joins meetings to continually assess security risks during operations. At the same time, the NCO notifies the INL Director and other pertinent USG and GOP agencies about threat levels.<br />6. Exercises approval authority for commodity procurement, is involved in budget planning, and approves purchases to support eradication operations based on needs and budget allocations. Another responsibility is to monitor the procurement process to ensure purchased items are received in a timely manner and that the goods meet specification requirements.<br />7. Evaluates the work of CORAH Administration, Infrastructure, Operations, CADA Social Responsibility, and ICT activities. The NCO works with the Program Specialist to develop schedules for yearly financial audits and monthly review of project financial statements and must follow up on all corrective actions recommended in the audits. <br />8. The NCO conducts needs assessments to improve the efficiency of CORAH's administrative section, including the management of its human resources. <br />9.

(D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at subpart 32.11) for the same concern.</p>
<p>Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the SAM registration process; and</p>
<p>(4) The Government has marked the record ``Active''.</p>

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)(1)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract.

<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports.

<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>

<p>Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)(1)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract.

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks.

This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>1352.209-74, ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST (APRIL 2010)<br />(a) Purpose. The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors: <br />(1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and <br />(2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract.<br />(b) Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as "contractor") in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venturer, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both.<br />(c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest. <br />(d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract.<br />(e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms "contract," "contractor," and "Contracting Officer" shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights.<br />(f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507-1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk. <br />(g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future. Accordingly, the contractor may at any time seek a waiver from the Head of the Contracting Activity by submitting such waiver request to the Contracting Officer, including a full written description of the requested waiver and the reasons in support thereof. <br />(End of clause)</p>

<p><br />STATEMENT OF NEED<br />HYDROGEN FOR NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE GREAT FALLS</p>
<p><br />1. BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The National Weather Service (NWS) is a 24 hour, 365 day operation, and is a public safety agency. The primary mission of the NWS is the protection of life and property. The NWS in Great Falls, MT launches weather balloons routinely twice a day at 0400 and 1600 Mountain Time. Each balloon requires approximately 75 cubic feet (CF) of hydrogen. Instrumentation is attached to each balloon which provides measurements of temperature, humidity, wind speed and direction, and height. This data is transmitted worldwide and used to make weather forecasts out to 10 days.</p>
<p>2. OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>The objective of the NWS is to receive and keep on-hand an adequate supply of hydrogen (between 450 and 1,500 CF per week) to perform the weather balloon launches on schedule.</p>
<p>3. SCOPE</p>
<p>The Contractor is responsible for supplying hydrogen to the NWS office located at 5324 Tri-Hill Frontage Road, Great Falls, MT 59404. The total amount of hydrogen to be delivered for this requirement is between 1,050 and 1,500 CF per week (between 54,600 and 78,000 CF annually).</p>
<p>4. PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE</p>
<p>The base period of performance for this requirement is 12 months, beginning January 1, 2014 through December 31, 2014, with the option to extend up to four additional years.</p>
<p>5. PLACE OF PERFORMANCE</p>
<p>All deliveries are to be made to the NWS office at 5324 Tri-Hill Frontage Road, Great Falls, MT 59404. The point of delivery is at the Upper Air Inflation building, located on the Southeast side of the main building. The delivery truck is permitted to use existing driveway turn off from frontage road for delivery to the inflation building. Drop off door is located on the Northeast side of the inflation building.</p>
<p>6. REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p>Site Storage and Usage: All hydrogen must be provided in individual cylinders as the facility is not arranged to allow for other configurations. The Government has space at the delivery point to receive and store up to 15 cylinders of hydrogen at a time. It is the objective of this requirement to keep on hand between 450 and 1,500 CF of hydrogen, with a minimum of 1,050 CF being used each week, leaving approximately a three-day supply of hydrogen as backup stock in case of additional unplanned balloon launches, or other unforeseen circumstances. Actual usage will vary based on the need for additional balloon launches.</p>
<p>Delivery Schedule: The delivery schedule shall be arranged with the NWS Meteorologist-In-Charge (MIC) or Administrative Support Assistant (ASA) upon contract award (see section 8 below for contact information). All deliveries must be executed between the hours of 0800 and 1445 local time. This is a strict time slot as the balloon launches must not be delayed or interrupted in order to receive the delivery. Balloon launches occur twice a day, every day of the year, regardless of holidays. Therefore, the delivery schedule needs to be maintained regardless of holidays. If a holiday falls on a scheduled delivery day and the Contractor is not able to complete a regularly scheduled delivery, the Contractor shall make arrangements in advance for an alternative delivery date. The Contractor will contact the National Weather Service office if a delivery is going to be delayed for any other reason.<br /><br />Transition Period: If this contract is awarded to other than the incumbent Contractor, then prior to the first day of the contract, the new Contractor and one of the agency points of contact, listed in section 8 below, shall establish the delivery schedule, including coordinating the initial delivery to coincide with the pickup of cylinders by the former contractor. Likewise, upon completion of this contract, if the new follow-on contract is awarded to other than the current Contractor, the current Contractor shall participate in the transition coordination efforts in order to minimize the risk of a missed balloon launch due to the hydrogen being unavailable at the launch site. The end-of-contract transition period may include a lighter delivery in the final weeks of the contract.</p>
<p>Initial and Recurring Deliveries: For the initial delivery, the Contractor shall supply to the Place of Performance 1,500 CF of hydrogen, in accordance with the coordinated date and time schedule. Thereafter, the Contractor will replenish back to 1,500 CF of hydrogen on a weekly basis in accordance with the arranged schedule, replacing all empty hydrogen cylinders with full hydrogen cylinders. The Contractor shall pick up the empty cylinders in the same trip. If additional deliveries are required prior to the next regularly scheduled delivery, the NWS will contact the Contractor and request the additional delivery, with delivery to be completed within two business days of being contacted.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall contact NWS personnel at this location when arriving for a delivery. The loading area is located on the Northeast side of the inflation building. The loading area will remain clear of obstructions and all safety rules shall be followed. Cylinders can be rolled from a truck lift gate to its delivery point.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall ensure the bottles are securely strapped to the stand at delivery and placed in an orderly/neat and clean fashion with cap loose and nozzle facing out. The Contractor shall perform the deliveries in such a manner that there will be minimal interruption to or interference with the normal operation of Government business on the premises.</p>
<p>Evidence of Delivery: The Driver shall provide evidence of delivery by way of receipt signed by an NWS representative at the time of delivery. A copy of the signed receipt shall be left with the NWS representative, and a copy shall also be attached to the associated invoice when mailed.</p>
<p>Compliance: If any of the deliveries do not conform to contract requirements (i.e. a delivery results in less than full replenishment of hydrogen to 1,500 CF), the Government reserves the right to require the Contractor to bring the delivery into conformity with contract requirements, at no increase in contract amount (i.e. without additional delivery charges).</p>
<p>7. SAFETY AND SECURITY</p>
<p>All rules concerning safety, not smoking and the security of the property must be observed at all times.</p>
<p>Materials Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) must be provided by the Contractor to the MIC or ASA at each office, where the information will be kept on file in accordance with applicable guidelines of the OSHA Hazard Communications Standard. Requirements pertaining to recordkeeping will be strictly followed, with copy(s) provided to MIC as necessary and upon request.</p>
<p>The driver will need to contact NWS personnel for delivery. NWS personnel will remain with driver throughout the delivery unlocking and locking doors as needed. NWS personnel will not assist with loading or unloading of cylinders.</p>
<p>8. POINTS OF CONTACT</p>
<p>The Government contacts at the NWS office in Great Falls, MT are:</p>
<p>Observation Program Leader - Jerome Saucier, 406-453-2081, jerome.saucier@noaa.gov<br />Administrative Support Assistant - Shonna Larkey, 406-453-9957, shonna.larkey@noaa.gov<br />Meteorologist In Charge - Michael Mercer, 406-453-9957, michael.mercer@noaa.gov</p>

(i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ???6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ???6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ???6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) Principal, for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>In accordance with DFARS 252.232-7003, "Electronic Submission of Payment Requests and Receiving Reports", the contractor shall submit their payment request electronically using the WAWF. The WAWF website is located at https://wawf.eb.mil. There is no charge to use WAWF. Contractors must register to use WAWF at this website and ensure an electronic business point of contact (POC) is designated in the System for Award Management (SAM) site at http://www.sam.gov within ten (10) calendar days after award of this contract.

POC SFC Gloria Garside <BR> <BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal Criminal Tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks "have" the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ???6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ???6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ???6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) Principal, for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>In accordance with DFARS 252.232-7003, "Electronic Submission of Payment Requests and Receiving Reports", the contractor shall submit their payment request electronically using the WAWF.

Garside, 760) 380-8541 <BR> <BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ?have?, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ??6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ??6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ??6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>

<p><strong>DESCRIPTION OF WORK PROPOSED: <br /><br /></strong>The 772d Enterprise Sourcing Squadron/Environmental Contracting (772 ESS/PKB) at Lackland AFB, TX, has been asked to provide engineering, restoration and construction services to achieve Site Closeout (SC) through remedial action at Scott AFB, Illinois. The Contractor shall perform all necessary environmental construction and engineering activities required to meet the performance objectives identified in the corresponding Statement of Objective (SOO), dated 4 September 2013. The Period of Performance (POP) will be 120 months from date of award.<br /><br />This requirement is to provide a Performance-Based Remediation (PBR) approach for Site Closeout (SC) involving remedial action efforts at Scott AFB, IL for approximately 29 sites. The PBR initiative has an overarching goal to implement remedies as necessary to protect human health and the environment that maximizes the number of SCs or advance sites as close to SC as practicable during the Period of Performance (POP) in a cost effective manner. It is desirable to the Government that Life-Cycle Costs (LCC) be reduced. If SC with no new institutional controls is not obtainable within the POP of this effort, the Contractor shall outline the Optimization Exit Strategy (OES) that will be implemented to accomplish SC. The Contractor shall perform all necessary environmental construction and engineering activities required to meet the performance objectives identified in the Statement of Objectives (SOO). Reference the latest SOO dated 4 September 2013 and attachments posted to FEBBIZOPPS for the latest documents. <br /><br /><strong>REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL: <br /><br /></strong>The 772 ESS/PKB intends to award a single, Firm Fixed Price (FFP) PBR for remedial action efforts at Scott AFB, Illinois. Source selection procedures as prescribed in FAR Part 15 and FAR supplements thereto will be followed. The resultant contract is contemplated to be a stand-alone "C" contract with a firm-fixed price (FFP) pricing arrangement. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this Acquisition is 562910. This requirement is being issued as a Small Business Set-Aside.<br /><br />NOTE: You are hereby notified that the project owner has certified this project as a valid requirement. Firms will NOT be reimbursed for bid and proposal costs incurred. Therefore, if your firm elects to participate in the proposal process for this requirement and the projects are not funded, you shall not be entitled to submit any claim for bid and/or proposal costs. The Government reserves the right to cancel this requirement at any time.<br />The anticipated award of the resultant contract is in the third quarter of FY14. The maximum POP for this contract, if all options are exercised, is 120 months from the date of award.<br /><br />Based on executing the current Air Force environmental restoration strategy, the Air Force's ROM for this PBR is anticipated to be between $30,000,000 and $37,000,000. Offerors will not automatically be non-compliant if the proposed price exceeds the ROM.<br /><br />Proposals shall be submitted in accordance with the RFP requirements and the date indicated in this announcement. <br /><br />Copies of this solicitation are available by INTERNET ACCESS ONLY. All solicitation documents are posted with this announcement and made available for viewing in FedBizOpps (http://www.fbo.gov). Any amendments to the RFP (if required) will be posted in FedBizOpps. Interested parties are reminded that they are responsible for checking FedBizOpps for new information concerning this requirement.<br /><br />Any communications with the Government from the date of this solicitation through contract award shall be directed in writing to the Procuring Contracting Officer (PCO), Mr. Daniel Cevallos, Jr. Email correspondence shall be sent to Mr. Cevallos with a copy to the contract specialists, Ms. Laura Stewart and Ms. Rebecca Robinson. <br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">System for Award Management (SAM) Requirements</span>: Offerors must be registered in the SAM database. If registration is not complete by the required time, the Contracting Officer will proceed to award to the next otherwise successful registered Offeror. Offerors may obtain information on registration at https://www.acquisition.gov.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Environmental Insurance (EI)</span>: The Air Force is currently NOT proposing to require Cleanup Cost Cap (CCC) or any other type of Environmental Insurance (EI) for this PBR.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Bonding Capacity</span>: The Air Force is currently proposing to require performance and payment bonds for only the construction portion of this PBR. The bonding required for the construction portion of this effort is anticipated to be 52% of the total estimated contract amount if all options are exercised. An estimated bonding stream is provided to show estimated bonding amounts per year. Note: Bonding may differ from the estimated bonding stream provided based on the proposed technical approach. (Reference Presolicitation FA8903-13-R-0040 RFI documents.)<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCI)</span>: An organizational conflict of interest may result when factors create an actual or potential conflict of interest on a contract, or where the nature of the work to be performed on the contract creates an actual or potential conflict of interest on a future acquisition. Some restrictions may apply to your firm under the proposed future action. This requirements requires offerors to address OCI issues. In accordance with the parameters set forth in FAR Subpart 9.5 and 36.209, the Contracting Officer must ensure that there are no conflicting roles that might bias a contractor's judgment and must ensure that an OCI does not give rise to an unfair competitive advantage. Performance of past clean-up related work at Scott AFB may have created an OCI concerning this PBR effort. OCIs may exist in the following three ways.<br /><br />a. Unequal access to information - access to non-public information that gives a contractor an unfair competitive advantage.<br /><br />b. Biased ground rules - when a contractor has in some sense set the ground rules for another procurement action creating the potential that the contractor may have tilted the playing field in the new competition (usually toward its own strengths and away from its weaknesses).<br /><br />c. Impaired objectivity - when the contract requires exercise of judgment and the independence of its judgment may be affected (e.g., when the contractor may be required to evaluate its own work in a way that could be adverse to its economic interests). Please keep in mind OCI or potential OCI issues your firm (including all subsidiaries, legacy companies, teaming partners, and subcontractors) may have with respect to the scope of effort at these sites.<br />Proprietary Information Shall be Properly Marked by Offerors. The Government shall not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for any improperly identified proprietary information. Proprietary information will be safeguarded in accordance with the applicable Government regulations and Source Selection Procedures.</p>

<p><strong>DESCRIPTION OF WORK PROPOSED: <br /><br /></strong>The 772d Enterprise Sourcing Squadron/Environmental Contracting (772 ESS/PKB) at Lackland AFB, TX, has been asked to provide engineering, restoration and construction services to achieve Site Closeout (SC) through remedial action at Scott AFB, Illinois. The Contractor shall perform all necessary environmental construction and engineering activities required to meet the performance objectives identified in the corresponding Statement of Objective (SOO), dated 4 September 2013. The Period of Performance (POP) will be 120 months from date of award.<br /><br />This requirement is to provide a Performance-Based Remediation (PBR) approach for Site Closeout (SC) involving remedial action efforts at Scott AFB, IL for approximately 29 sites. The PBR initiative has an overarching goal to implement remedies as necessary to protect human health and the environment that maximizes the number of SCs or advance sites as close to SC as practicable during the Period of Performance (POP) in a cost effective manner. It is desirable to the Government that Life-Cycle Costs (LCC) be reduced. If SC with no new institutional controls is not obtainable within the POP of this effort, the Contractor shall outline the Optimization Exit Strategy (OES) that will be implemented to accomplish SC. The Contractor shall perform all necessary environmental construction and engineering activities required to meet the performance objectives identified in the Statement of Objectives (SOO). Reference the latest SOO dated 4 September 2013 and attachments posted to FEBBIZOPPS for the latest documents. <br /><br /><strong>REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL: <br /><br /></strong>The 772 ESS/PKB intends to award a single, Firm Fixed Price (FFP) PBR for remedial action efforts at Scott AFB, Illinois. Source selection procedures as prescribed in FAR Part 15 and FAR supplements thereto will be followed. The resultant contract is contemplated to be a stand-alone "C" contract with a firm-fixed price (FFP) pricing arrangement. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this Acquisition is 562910. This requirement is being issued as a Small Business Set-Aside.<br /><br />NOTE: You are hereby notified that the project owner has certified this project as a valid requirement. Firms will NOT be reimbursed for bid and proposal costs incurred. Therefore, if your firm elects to participate in the proposal process for this requirement and the projects are not funded, you shall not be entitled to submit any claim for bid and/or proposal costs. The Government reserves the right to cancel this requirement at any time.<br />The anticipated award of the resultant contract is in the third quarter of FY14. The maximum POP for this contract, if all options are exercised, is 120 months from the date of award.<br /><br />Based on executing the current Air Force environmental restoration strategy, the Air Force's ROM for this PBR is anticipated to be between $30,000,000 and $37,000,000. Offerors will not automatically be non-compliant if the proposed price exceeds the ROM.<br /><br />Proposals shall be submitted in accordance with the RFP requirements and the date indicated in this announcement. <br /><br />Copies of this solicitation are available by INTERNET ACCESS ONLY. All solicitation documents are posted with this announcement and made available for viewing in FedBizOpps (http://www.fbo.gov). Any amendments to the RFP (if required) will be posted in FedBizOpps. Interested parties are reminded that they are responsible for checking FedBizOpps for new information concerning this requirement.<br /><br />Any communications with the Government from the date of this solicitation through contract award shall be directed in writing to the Procuring Contracting Officer (PCO), Mr. Daniel Cevallos, Jr. Email correspondence shall be sent to Mr. Cevallos with a copy to the contract specialists, Ms. Laura Stewart and Ms. Rebecca Robinson. <br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">System for Award Management (SAM) Requirements</span>: Offerors must be registered in the SAM database. If registration is not complete by the required time, the Contracting Officer will proceed to award to the next otherwise successful registered Offeror. Offerors may obtain information on registration at https://www.acquisition.gov.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Environmental Insurance (EI)</span>: The Air Force is currently NOT proposing to require Cleanup Cost Cap (CCC) or any other type of Environmental Insurance (EI) for this PBR.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Bonding Capacity</span>: The Air Force is currently proposing to require performance and payment bonds for only the construction portion of this PBR. The bonding required for the construction portion of this effort is anticipated to be 52% of the total estimated contract amount if all options are exercised. An estimated bonding stream is provided to show estimated bonding amounts per year. Note: Bonding may differ from the estimated bonding stream provided based on the proposed technical approach. (Reference Presolicitation FA8903-13-R-0040 RFI documents.)<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCI)</span>: An organizational conflict of interest may result when factors create an actual or potential conflict of interest on a contract, or where the nature of the work to be performed on the contract creates an actual or potential conflict of interest on a future acquisition. Some restrictions may apply to your firm under the proposed future action. This requirements requires offerors to address OCI issues. In accordance with the parameters set forth in FAR Subpart 9.5 and 36.209, the Contracting Officer must ensure that there are no conflicting roles that might bias a contractor's judgment and must ensure that an OCI does not give rise to an unfair competitive advantage. Performance of past clean-up related work at Scott AFB may have created an OCI concerning this PBR effort. OCIs may exist in the following three ways.<br /><br />a. Unequal access to information - access to non-public information that gives a contractor an unfair competitive advantage.<br /><br />b. Biased ground rules - when a contractor has in some sense set the ground rules for another procurement action creating the potential that the contractor may have tilted the playing field in the new competition (usually toward its own strengths and away from its weaknesses).<br /><br />c. Impaired objectivity - when the contract requires exercise of judgment and the independence of its judgment may be affected (e.g., when the contractor may be required to evaluate its own work in a way that could be adverse to its economic interests). Please keep in mind OCI or potential OCI issues your firm (including all subsidiaries, legacy companies, teaming partners, and subcontractors) may have with respect to the scope of effort at these sites.<br />Proprietary Information Shall be Properly Marked by Offerors. The Government shall not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for any improperly identified proprietary information. Proprietary information will be safeguarded in accordance with the applicable Government regulations and Source Selection Procedures.</p>

<p>OBJECTIVE: An Architect-Engineer (A-E) firm specializing in Environmental Compliance is required for design of miscellaneous environmental compliance projects and supporting services at the Air Force Research Laboratory, Rome Research Site and various remote sites (Newport, Stockbridge, Verona, - all located in New York State). Design services required will be in conjunction with environmental compliance type projects, including preparation of drawings, specifications, estimates, and schedules.

<p>A-E services should include:</p>

The goal of this RFI is to identify vendors that can meet the specifications delineated and to understand their current technology designs and engineering tradeoffs that influences performance, size and form factor.  <br>  PROBLEM STATEMENT  <br>  In current US Army communications systems, the majority of the antennas, are single structures providing omni-directional RF coverage and are mounted in the same plane as other antennas on the top side of military platforms.  Due to this Line of Sight (LoS) placement, co-site interference can occur between systems.  In addition, current antennas are often vertical whips protruding on top of platforms creating high visibility and obstructions.    <br>  CERDEC's previous development efforts to mitigate the visual signatures and the co-site interference developed distributed antenna systems.  Previous efforts replaced the single omni-directional whip with multiple low-profile/conformal directional apertures and mounted these apertures on the sides of the terrestrial vehicle.  By distributing the RF power equally amongst the apertures and placing them out of sight from the top side, omni-directional coverage could be achieved and the visual signature and the co-site interference issues alleviated.  <br>  However, these distributed antenna systems are not without their own shortcomings.  These antenna systems are passive and, as such, do not take full advantage of the benefits of the directional capabilities of the distributed antennas.  By using directional apertures, the system resolves the intra-vehicle co-site interference issue but did not address the inter-vehicle co-site mitigation.  Through the use of a passive splitter/combiner, the distributed system directs the RF radiation in an omni-directional pattern; however, as there is no active control of the RF path, the system does not make use of the benefits that distributed directional antennas provide such as directional networking, nulling, and increased effective isotropic radiated power.  <br>  To enhance the capability of these distributed antenna systems, CERDEC intends to develop a Smart RF Switch to collect intra-vehicle information from other systems and direct the RF energy using decisions based on this information.  This new Smart RF Switch will be compliance with the VICTORY standard and provide flexibility to these antenna systems.  <br>  SCOPE OF THIS RFI  <br>  For the purpose of this RFI, CERDEC is interested in gathering information in regards to technology available from the industry for developing a Smart RF Switch for inclusion in distributed antenna systems.  The need for a Smart RF Switch has been identified in previous Army developments of distributed antenna systems and the need to gather on-platform information, process commands, and direct RF energy to a directive radiating aperture.  <br>  To improve effectiveness and enhance the capabilities provided by these distributed apertures, a RF switch needs to be developed to control the RF path.  CERDEC's vision is to build a Smart RF Switch that can receive information and provide and receive control through the VICTORY data bus.  Based on this VICTORY provided information, the Smart RF Switch shall have the on-board intelligence to make decisions and process the distribution of the appropriate RF power levels dynamically to the corresponding apertures.  For the development effort related to this RFI, CERDEC has provided the conceptual switch representation presented in Figure 1.  <br>  The Smart RF Switch is broken into these functional components:  <br>  1.      Victory Interface  <br>  1.1.    The VICTORY interface of the Smart RF Switch shall be compatible with the VICTORY architecture and in compliance with the VICTORY Specifications. (i.e. for the Smart RF Switch to be VICTORY compatible, the design of the RF switch interface must follow the design philosophy and concepts of the VICTORY architecture. For the Smart RF Switch to be compliant with VICTORY, the interface design shall follow the VICTORY Specifications).  <br>  1.2.    Inputs / Outputs  <br>  1.2.1.  A single physical port shall operate as the input/output and be compliant with the VICTORY specifications.  <br>  2.      Control Processing  <br>  2.1.    The control processing component shall have the hardware devices to support the government furnished algorithm for controlling the RF switch matrix. This algorithm software will be developed by the government and will be housed in the control processor. Based on the decision made by the algorithm, the control processing component will control the RF Switch Matrix.   <br>  2.2.    Inputs from:  <br>  2.2.1.  VICTORY: Information from the systems available on the VICTORY data bus  <br>  2.2.2.  RF Switch Matrix:  Status of the switch.  This may include but is not limited to the switch states, matrix health, and antenna health.  <br>  2.3.    Outputs to:  <br>  2.3.1.  VICTORY:  Status of the Smart RF Switch.  This may include but is not limited to the switch state, switch health, and antenna health.  <br>  2.3.2.  RF Switch Matrix:  Control for the RF switch matrix  <br>  3.      RF Switch Matrix  <br>  3.1.    The RF switch matrix provides a variable pathway between the single RF input and the four RF outputs.  The matrix shall allow any 1:N combination of input-to-output paths and operate over 100 - 6000 MHz.  It is the intent to use as many COTS sub-components within the switch matrix as possible.  The switch matrix must be able to monitor the health of antennas attached to the output port and report if an antenna deviates from its typical health or operation.  One such potential method is through voltage standing wave ratio (VSWR) monitor however presentation of other methods is encouraged.  <br>  3.2.    RF Inputs  <br>  3.2.1.  Single RF input from radio  <br>  3.2.2.  Must be a military standard interface  <br>  3.2.3.  Can not contain any proprietary interfacing  <br>  3.3.    RF Outputs  <br>  3.3.1.  Four RF ports to distributed antennas  <br>  3.3.2.  Must be a military standard interface  <br>  3.3.3.  Can not contain any proprietary interfacing  <br>  3.4.    Control Inputs/Outputs  <br>  3.4.1.  Control inputs and outputs should follow guidance provided for the Control Processing Component and may use proprietary or open standard interfaces.  <br>  The Smart RF Switch is to be used with a variety of radio systems and, as such, CERDEC intends to identify applicable technologies that operate over these conditions.  It is understood that switching speeds, power handling, and bandwidth may be limitations and CERDEC wishes to receive information and trades between these and recommendations of technologies for inclusion.  <br>  Another application of this switch that CERDEC is interested in would require multiple RF inputs able to connect to any combination of multiple RF outputs.  An explanation of the applicability of the vendor's architecture and technologies shall be provided to include this capability.  <br>  Additionally, CERDEC is interested in understanding existing sub-component level technologies (RF switch designs, low cost component manufacturing techniques, antenna tracking and control systems, etc) that can be used to develop the intended Smart Switch distributed aperture system.  <br>  DATA SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS  <br>  Interested parties are requested to respond to the RFI by describing their technical capabilities, displaying experience developing similar RF switch technologies.  Additionally, parties should have strong knowledge of VICTORY standard interface and show an understanding of design and manufacturing practices that have been used to reduce the costs of RF components.    <br>  Interested parties are requested to submit:  <br>  General:   <br>         -Statement of capability  <br>         -Statement of interest   <br>  Qualifications:  <br>  Description of Qualification: Demonstrated products, projects, and applicable experience in the design, development and manufacturing of RF switches, power level control, switching control, VICTORY-compliance, and prototyping.

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT<br /><br />Per FAR 5.203(d), Central Federal Lands Highway Division (CFLHD) of the Federal Highway Administration anticipates awarding two or more Full-Service Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts for architect-engineer (A-E) services. Projects will primarily involve improvements to rural low-volume roadways in environmentally sensitive areas requiring context sensitive design solutions for work ranging from pavement preservation, to 3R (resurfacing, restoration and rehabilitation) to full reconstruction. Transportation-related engineering and surveying services will include all work needed to conduct planning, scoping, environmental compliance, preliminary and final design to prepare contract documents in support of several Federally-funded programs administered by CFLHD.
<p>TYPE OF CONTRACT: This procurement is being solicited on an unrestricted basis to A-E firms licensed and registered within one or more of the states served by CFLHD. Professional documents produced under each contract will require a Professional Engineer and/or a Registered Land Surveyor license relative to the state in which the project work is located. Each contract awarded will consist of 1 base year and options to extend the contract for 4 additional 1-year periods. Each successful A-E firm will be re-evaluated each year to determine award of options to extend the contract. The contract shall have a maximum not-to-exceed 5-year total of $10 million. Each contract will operate with individually negotiated, firm-fixed price task orders issued in accordance with the terms of the contract. Task orders may or may not be for a complete project or series of projects.</p>
<p>Selected firms must comply with Equal Employment Opportunity requirements in accordance with FAR 22.8. Subcontracting plans will be required by the selected firms for large businesses in accordance with FAR 19.7. The subcontracting plan must show the firms intended use of small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, and women-owned small business concerns. Subcontracting Plans are not required with submission of SF 330.</p>

<DESC><p>Below please find the National Park Service's (NPS) responses to most questions submitted in regard to the Prospectus for a Concession Business Opportunity to provide lodging, retail, food and beverage and other services (CC-GRCA003-15). There are a few questions, received by the September 18, 2013 deadline, that are not answered here. Responses to the remaining questions will be provided very shortly.</p>
<p>Please note all potential Offerors should read the questions and responses for both CC-GRCA003-15 and CC-GRCA001-15, as there is some information in each that may be of assistance in preparing a proposal to either solicitation.</p>
<p>Cover Page</p>
<p>1. Proposal Due Date. Since daylight savings time ends November 3, we assume the proposals are due on November 25, 2013 at 4pm MST, not MDT. Please confirm.</p>
<p>4:00 p.m. MST is correct.</p>
<p>Business Opportunity</p>
<p>2. Page 2 of Section 1 - Historical gross revenues. Can NPS please provide historical gross revenues presented in the Business Opportunity a breakdown as presented for the projected sales Exhibit 13, 14, 15, &amp;16?</p>
<p>The NPS infers the question is asking for historical gross revenues broken out by location. If this is the case, the NPS does not provide historic gross revenues broken out by specific locations.</p>
<p>3. Can NPS please provide clarity of the discrepancy between the Historical Annual Gross Sales Revenue 2011 presented on Page 2 of Section 1 - Business Opportunity of $32,659,903 and the cumulative gross sales presented in Exhibits 13, 14, 15 &amp; 16 that equates to $29,623,000. The table below presents our method of calculation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Average Transaction Value/ADR Room Nights/<br />Covers/<br />Transactions Department Revenue Dept. Revenue as % of Total Revenue<br />Lodging $130-135 80-83,000 $10,400,000-11,205,000 35-31%<br />Retail $9-10 1,386-1,601,000 $12,474,000-16,010,000 42-45%<br />Food &amp; Beverage $9-11 641-664,000 $5,769,000-7,293,000 20-20%<br />Trailer Village $37-40 20-23,000 $740,000-920,000 3-4%<br />Camper Services n/a n/a $240,000-245,000 <br />TOTAL REVENUE -- $29,623,000-35,673,000 --</p>
<p>$32,659,903 from the Historical Annual Gross Sales Revenue 2011 presented on Page 2 of Section 1 -Business Opportunity represents an estimation of 2011 gross revenue by using the same percentages represented in the actual historic gross revenue in 2009 and 2010. The information in Exhibits 13, 14, 15, &amp;16 represents assumptions for the first stabilized year (2015) of operations under the Draft Contract. Based on your calculations, $29,623,000 is the lowest 2015 estimated amount and $32,659,903 is in the middle of the range, therefore, the NPS does not see a discrepancy.</p>
<p>4. Can NPS provide sales revenues from the Visitor Center area (bicycle rentals and the Association store) over the past 5 years?</p>
<p>Bright Angel Bicycles grossed $897,219 in 2012 its first year of operation (June 1, 2012 to December 31, 2012). The NPS does not have the revenues for the Association Store to report at this time.</p>
<p>5. Can NPS please provide Gross Revenues by segment as per Exhibit 11 in order to better understand the potential impact on revenues resulting from the Service having developed the parking areas and visitor center, resulting in change in visitor and traffic patterns?</p>
<p>The NPS does not provide gross revenues broken out by specific locations.</p>
<p>6. Are there any future plans by NPS to add additional competitive facilities in Park, construction of concession facilities that may cause business disruption or redesign of infrastructure/services that may negatively impact the services associated with the GRCA003 contract?</p>
<p>At this time, the NPS has no plans to add additional competitive facilities in the Park, redesign infrastructure, or construct additional Concession Facilities other than those described in CC-GRCA001-15 prospectus.</p>
<p>7. Are there any future plans to decommission any commercial services or facilities including lodging, retail, or food &amp; beverage facilities associated with GRCA003?</p>
<p>At this time, the NPS has no plans to discontinue any of the services or facilities associated with GRCA003 during the term of the Draft Contract.</p>
<p>8. How much impact has the NPS included in its financial models for the inefficiencies of two concessioners operating lodging within the South Rim?</p>
<p>The NPS performed financial analysis for two discrete businesses on the South Rim, as described in the two prospectuses for CC-GRCA001-15 and CC-GRCA003-15.</p>
<p>9. What assumptions were made by NPS in regard to additional operating expenses/duplication of cost resulting from the allocation of the Yavapai Lodge from the GRCA001 contract to the GRCA003?</p>
<p>The NPS performed financial analysis for two discrete businesses on the South Rim, making assumptions based on those separate opportunities, as described in the two prospectuses for CC-GRCA001-15 and CC-GRCA003-15. Offerors must make their own assumptions and determinations regarding the business opportunities as presented.</p>
<p>10. Page 3 - Estimated Initial Investment <br />Has NPS included in its estimated Personal Property Initial Investment amount all the personal property replaced by the existing concessioners over the course of the current contracts for which the concessioners requested LSI under the fixture rule but were advised by NPS that the items in question were personal property rather than fixtures?</p>
<p>Appendix M of the Prospectus contains the lists of personal property. The NPS contracted with a personal property consultant in 2010 to evaluate the furniture, fixtures, and equipment of the Existing Concessioner. The consultant's valuation and replacement schedule was included in the financial analysis associated with prospectus development.</p>
<p>11. Page 3 - Estimated Initial Investment <br />By the same token, has NPS included in its estimated Personal Property Initial Investment amount all the personal property in the facilities owned by the existing concessioners that constitute "fixtures" or "trade fixtures" under conventional real estate law but not under the narrower working definition of "fixtures" adopted by NPS?</p>
<p>Appendix M of the Prospectus contains the lists of personal property. The NPS contracted with a personal property consultant in 2010 to evaluate the furniture, fixtures, and equipment of the Existing Concessioner. The consultant's valuation and replacement schedule was included in the financial analysis associated with prospectus development.</p>
<p>12. Page 13 - Employee Housing. <br />The amount of housing removed from contract 001 and moved to contract 003 appears to be out of proportion to the number of employees who will be reassigned with the addition of Yavapai Lodge, Camper Service, and Trailer Village. Please explain the NPS rationale for these building assignments.</p>
<p>This reassignment was based on staffing plan assessments performed as part of the financial analysis associated with prospectus development.</p>
<p>13. Page 13 - Employee Housing. The contract appears to provide more housing than will be required by the number of employees the business requires. Can the concessioner make this housing available for rent to other park concessioners? If so, on what terms would NPS consider reasonable?</p>
<p>Each Offeror may make its own determination as to its staffing needs and the resulting deployment of its housing. The Concessioner must obtain NPS approval prior to renting available housing to other entities.</p>
<p>14. Page 13 - Employee Housing. When will the concessioner operating this contract receive the housing that is being reassigned from Contract 001-15?</p>
<p>All Concession Facilities become available as of the effective date of CC-GRCA003-15.</p>
<p>15. Can NPS please confirm if the employees currently living in RV accommodations in the Trailer Park own their RV's and if they are charged a rental fee for the RV spots?</p>
<p>Most of the Trailer Village residents reside in their own RVs and are charged a rental fee.</p>
<p>16. Page 15 -Proposed Operational Changes. How does NPS expect the concessioner to fund the remodel and concept change at Yavapai Cafeteria since there is no CFIP funding provision outlined in the contract? The incumbent spent over one million dollars in 2011 to remodel only the front-of-house elements in the Maswik Cafeteria.</p>
<p>The NPS envisions that much of the Yavapai renovation will consist of personal property with minimal capital expenditures.</p>
<p>17. Page 25 - Projected Future Expense Assumptions. What is the rationale behind the management positions that must be located outside of the Park given the 24x7 nature of the business? Have these positions been specifically identified? If so, please list them. Is there a proposed time frame for this move?</p>
<p>The Concessioner must make its own determination of which management positions can be located outside of the Park. The NPS anticipates the next Concessioner will begin operations under the new contract on January 1, 2015.</p>
<p>18. In the business opportunity it states "The Concessioner will house some senior and mid- level management outside the boundary of the Park." Is the expense for this assumption included in the financial return assumptions NPS used to establish if this is a viable contract? If yes, how much was the cost assumption.</p>
<p>The NPS assumed that some senior and mid-level management would live outside of Park boundaries in its financial analysis. The NPS does not release its cost assumptions. Offerors must make their own staffing and housing determinations and develop their own assumptions based upon those determinations.</p>
<p>19. Can NPS provide a breakdown by segment of Historical franchise fees paid?</p>
<p>The NPS is unclear what "a breakdown by segment" means. The NPS does not provide franchise fees paid broken out by specific locations.</p>
<p>20. Can NPS please explain the rationale of imposing a 9.4% franchise fee on GRCA 003 (Yavapai lodging) revenue and only a 6% franchise fee on lodging within Prospectus GRCA001?</p>
<p>The two business opportunities, which were analyzed separately, have significant differences in expected revenue, expenses, and investment requirements.</p>
<p>21. Given the magnitude of the impact on profitability in contract 003 in the event of a catastrophic waterline failure, how has NPS taken this into account in the formulation of this prospectus?</p>
<p>The NPS does not account for all possible catastrophic events, including natural disasters or any other event that may cause business interruption, in its financial analysis.</p>
<p>22. For the GRCA001 lodging facilities that operate in the offseason, can NPS please provide average occupancy and average daily rates by month for the GRCA001 by facility?</p>
<p>The NPS is unable to provide this information on a monthly basis. Please refer to the GRCA001 Prospectus for the annual information.</p>
<p>23. Prospectus GRCA001 Business Opportunity Page 21 "Projected Revenues" provides details of the planned improvements to Maswik South Lodge &amp; Cabins and upgrades to Bright Angel Cabins. Can NPS confirm the period of time and quantity of rooms inventory that will be impacted during this improvement period?</p>
<p>Please refer to Exhibit 8 on page 16 of the GRCA001 Business Opportunity for Project Start Year and First Year of Full Operation. Improvements to Maswik South Lodging may impact an inventory of 120 rooms. Maswik Historic Cabins will not impact any room inventory as the cabins currently are used as employee housing. The Bright Angel Lodge CFIP is a Personal Property improvement that may or may not impact an inventory of 34 cabins. Please review the CC-GRCA001-15 Business Opportunity for additional information.</p>
<p>24. Given that NPS's GRCA003 projections for lodging do not consider a year round operation for Yavapai and by 2017 the GRCA001 contract lodging projections show improvements in occupancy and rate for Maswik South and Bright Angel as a result of capital improvement, does NPS consider there is adequate off season demand from 2017 to support Yavapai opening year round?</p>
<p>The NPS believes that there is potential for adequate off-season demand for Yavapai to be open year-round. Offerors must make their own determinations regarding the opportunity and how they would maximize use of this facility.</p>
<p>25. Given the lodging revenue projections for Yavapai assumes a seasonal operation, is it correct to assume the Yavapai Cafeteria revenue projections are also provided in a seasonal basis?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>26. Can NPS please provide the historical average length of stay for Yavapai Lodge?</p>
<p>The NPS does not have this information.</p>
<p>27. Can NPS provide details of the current rent Xanterra pays for the McKee Warehouse building?</p>
<p>The McKee Warehouse is currently not assigned to Xanterra or any other concessioner.</p>
<p>28. Can NPS please explain why the approximately 6,000 square feet of space in the McKee Warehouse building required by the GRCA003 Concessioner is not included in the LSI?</p>
<p>The McKee Warehouse is not encumbered with LSI.</p>
<p>29. Can NPS please provide a comprehensive listing of the deferred maintenance associated with the $1,150,000 investment required in years 1 and 2 of the contract?</p>
<p>The NPS will provide a comprehensive list of deferred maintenance projects to the successful Offeror after contract award.</p>
<p>30. Delaware North's personal property associated with the GRCA003 contract is estimated to be worth $2 million. Is it correct to assume that Xanterra's personal property is worth $3,409,000?</p>
<p>Please reference the NPS estimates as outlined in the CC-GRCA003-15 Business Opportunity, Page 24, Personal Property section.</p>
<p>31. Will NPS please provide a comprehensive list of Xanterra's personal property it used to establish personal property value? It is currently unclear the quantity of each type of property. It would also be important to note if this property is the EXACT property that is currently in each lodge room, retail space, and food and beverage operation. We are not asking for the values to be included in the list.</p>
<p>Please review the GRCA003 Personal Property List, Appendix M in the CC-GRCA003-15 Prospectus, which includes a 2010 list of the existing GRCA003 Personal Property and a 2010 list of GRCA001 Personal Property that the Concessioner may negotiate with the incumbent GRCA001 Concessioner to purchase.</p>
<p>32. How did NPS calculate the estimated value of the personal property?</p>
<p>The NPS hired an independent contractor to complete a personal property appraisal during the 2010 site visit and adjusted the values to 2015 dollars.</p>
<p>33. Can NPS provide a complete listing of the concessioner owned personal property? A list was not provided as an Exhibit to the Prospectus.</p>
<p>See #31 above.</p>
<p>34. Can NPS please indicate if there is a plan to reinvest the franchise fees into the GRCA003 facilities as the required rent number is significantly higher than the R&amp;M reserve and the CFIP?</p>
<p>The NPS is uncertain what is meant by the "rent number." The NPS will not state how it plans to use franchise fees. The Concessioner is solely responsible for the maintenance of all Concession Facilities to the satisfaction of the NPS.</p>
<p>35. Some of the housing assigned under the new 003 contract is in fair-to-poor condition. Would NPS allow the concessionaire to use R&amp;M funds for the repair of these buildings? What is the specific process in the Grand Canyon for getting approval for an R&amp;M funded project?</p>
<p>Employee housing buildings are Concession Facilities eligible to benefit from Repair and Maintenance Reserve expenditures. Section 10 (c) of the Draft Contract describes the requirements of the R&amp;M Reserve. Exhibits F and H of the Draft Contract describe the procedures for administration of projects undertaken pursuant to the R&amp;M Reserve.</p>
<p>36. What are the locations for the mobile food trucks authorized in GRCA 001?</p>
<p>The GRCA001 Concessioner must locate the mobile food trucks within its Concession Facilities.</p>
<p>37. Can NPS please provide the competitive hotel sets used to determine room rates for Yavapai Lodge?</p>
<p>Currently the NPS uses the following set of comparables:<br />Yavapai East: Courtyard (Flagstaff), Hampton Inn (Flagstaff), Hilton Garden Inn (Scottsdale), and Hampton Inn (Prescott)</p>
<p>Yavapai West: Fairfield Inn (Flagstaff), Holiday Inn Express (Prescott), and Hilton Garden Inn (Flagstaff)</p>
<p>38. Can NPS please provide details of the number of employees currently housed in the Trailer Park are working at Yavapai Lodge?</p>
<p>The NPS does not have this information.</p>
<p>39. Is the main Yavapai Lodge licensed to sell alcohol?</p>
<p>Yes. Currently the cafeteria sells beer and wine for consumption on the premises.</p>
<p>Utilities</p>
<p>40. Since the concessioner is not able to assess the NPS utility systems, please provide clarity, absent a catastrophic failure, on whether the Utility Add-On will be allowed past the first year of the contract and whether this was factored into the NPS' prospectus financial analysis?</p>
<p>A utility add-on was factored into the NPS financial analysis. The NPS anticipates that a utility add-on will continue to be appropriate; however, this is subject to change based on changes to circumstances and NPS policy throughout the term of the Draft Contract.</p>
<p>41. We are aware of Director's Order 35-B, the intent of which appears to be to pass along both NPS Operating &amp; Maintenance costs AND capital costs associated with NPS utility systems to users. We would like to confirm how the policy direction in that order is to be applied to this concession contract. Specifically:<br />a. Has the Associate Director, Business Services reviewed the current add-on structure that NPS states will continue during year 1 of the contract? Yes.</p>
<p>b. Subject to material changes in improved business conditions or improved utility system efficiency, has there been tentative WASO approval to continue this same add-on structure during the remaining term of the contract after year 1?<br />The NPS will consider add-on charges annually, Exhibit B Page B-21 4) A) Services Provided Utilities (2).</p>
<p>c. Is the "10% cap" on annual utility rate increases assumed to apply to this concession contract? See below<br />d. If the 10% cap is presumed to not apply, has the new contract "been fully burdened with the actual cost of the utilities, including recapitalization as part of the new contract financial analysis"? See below<br />e. If the answer to (d) is yes, at what point during the contract term does NPS expect to rescind approval of the utility add-on amounts? See below<br />f. If the answer to (d) is yes, please provide the amounts of capitalization / recapitalization costs by year so the concessioner can evaluate the financial and cash flow impacts of these potentially material costs. See below</p>
<p>In accordance with NPS Policy contained in DO 35B, a "10% cap" on annual utility rate increases will not apply to the Draft Contract. The projected utility capitalization/recapitalization costs were accounted for in the Draft Contract financial analysis. In accordance with NPS policy, projected utility costs above industry norms (including projected capitalization and recapitalization costs) were anticipated as a utility add-on. The NPS will determine the actual add-on, if appropriate, based on current policy throughout the term of the Draft Contract considering actual costs and the most current industry data.</p>
<p>42. Does NPS anticipate the impact of DO35b to grow at inflation or differently? If differently, how does NPS anticipate the impact to grow?<br />Projected capitalization and recapitalization costs considered inflation. The NPS also considers inflation in the industry norms used when determining the applicability of an add-on.</p>
<p>43. Should the water utility infrastructure replacement not proceed, does NPS anticipate further impacts/restrictions on the operations of the facilities (similar to the removal of laundry facilities)? Did NPS put any assumptions of this impact into the financial model? If yes, what were the assumptions used?<br />The NPS expects the Concessioner to meet the terms and conditions of the Draft Contract for conserving water. The NPS does not plan for any further significant restrictions on facilities or operations related to water consumption and made no such assumptions in its financial model.</p>
<p>44. Can NPS please confirm how utilities will be charged at Yavapai Lodge (i.e. separately metered or an allocated lump sum fee calculated by square feet)?</p>
<p>Separately metered.</p>
<p>45. Can NPS please advise what the metered Yavapai Lodge utility charges have been for the last 3 years?</p>
<p>The Existing Concessioner has paid electrical and propane bills directly to the providers. The NPS does not have information regarding power or propane usage at Yavapai Lodge.</p>
<p>Following are estimates of usage and charges for utilities provided by the NPS to the Concessioner by the NPS at Yavapai lodge for the past three years.</p>
<p>Year FY2011 FY2012 FY13<br />Solid Waste <br />Cubic Yards 4235 4453 4172<br />Est $25.25/cy $106,934 $112,438 $105,343<br /><br />Year Fiscal Year 2010 FY2011 FY2012 FY13<br />Water in gallons 13,774,000 12,900,000 15,080,000 11,902,000<br />Water charges $489,527 $464,787 $543,332 $428,829<br /><br />Note: Water meters were not read in September 2013 due to the government shutdown. Therefore water billings for FY13 do not include September usage. We include 2010 as a convenience to Offerors.</p>
<p>Also note: these charges reflect actual usage and charges. They do not reflect utility pass-throughs applied to either sets of rates.</p>
<p>46. Could you please provide historical utility data for water, electricity, propane, and waste (trash and recycling) for all operations associated with the new 003 contract?</p>
<p>Following are historic utilities charges for the services provided under existing contract CC-GRCA003-98. The charges for Yavapai Lodge are provided in the answer to the previous question.</p>
<p>2010 2011 2012<br />Electricity $149,475 $ 151,112 $ 150,783<br />Propane $ 60,470 $ 78,145 $ 64,028<br />Water and Sewer $ 73,382 $ 71,664 $ 82,184<br />Trash $ 83,177 $ 78,486 $ 71,127<br />Total Utilities GRCA003-98 $ 366,504 $ 379,407 $ 368,122</p>
<p>Usage at Trailer Village, Camper Services, Desert View Trading Post and Desert View Service Station, which were historically assigned to GRCA001:</p>
<p>On average, solid waste charges for these four locations together for 2011-2013 were 4,700 cubic yards annually, for an average annual charge of $118,675 total. <br /><br />Annual Water readings and charges for these four locations were as follows:<br /><br />2010 2011 2012 2013<br />Trailer Village Office $ 8,000 $ 6,000 $ 6,000 $ 4,000<br />Trailer Village $ 5,710,000 $ 4,535,000 $ 6,455,000 $ 7,360,000<br />Camper Services $ 2,573,000 $ 2,180,000 $2,247,000 $1,887,000<br />Desert View Trading Post $ 117,000 $ 143,000 $ 91,000 $ 114,000<br />Total usage $ 8,408,000 $ 6,864,000 $8,799,000 $9,365,000<br />Per thousand gallon rate 35.54 36.03 36.03 36.03<br />Total charges $ 298,820 $ 247,310 $ 317,028 $ 337,421</p>
<p>Draft Operating Plan</p>
<p>47. Given the GRCA003 Operational Plan, Page B-4 &lsquo;Schedule of Operation' stipulates that the Concessioner can close some facilities seasonally subject to written approval from the Service, under what circumstances would this request be denied? Similarly, given the Service has proposed in the Business Opportunity Page 21 that the Yavapai Lodge may operate year round, does this require prior written approval and under what circumstances would approval not be granted?</p>
<p>The NPS assumes that the Concessioner will provide all services year round, unless the Concessioner requests the reduction or closure of some services. The NPS would only deny such a request if it were required to do so by Applicable Laws, or believed that visitors or park resources would be unduly and adversely impacted by such a closure.</p>
<p>48. 3) F) (4) Special Events [page B-9] Are weddings considered Special Events, or are weddings exclusively addressed under 3) F) (7) (m)?</p>
<p>Weddings are considered special events. Section 3) F) (8)(m) addresses the need for the Concessioner, as an initial part of the reservation process, to advise visitors that they need to obtain special use permits if the wedding will take place inside the Park but outside of the Concession Facilities.</p>
<p>49. 3) F) (7) Facility Reservations [General - page B-10] Can the concessioner provide estimated room rates for tour groups and FITs since they must produce their catalogs and brochures further out than 13 months in advance?</p>
<p>See requirements concerning Advance Rates in Exhibit B on page B-5. 3) C) 7) (d)</p>
<p>50. 3) F) (7) (l) Facility Reservations [page B-10] Does the Service foresee continued approval of the current policy of holding a lodging deposit for the first night's stay?</p>
<p>The Operating Plan states "The Concessioner generally may not hold a deposit for lodging unless the Service approves such a policy." The NPS would base such approval on deposit policies followed by appropriate comparable properties.</p>
<p>51. 3) F) (9) (a) Lost and Found [page B-11] DO 44 makes no reference to abandoned property. No copy of the PPMIN 05-01 was provided. Does it address abandoned property? If not, are these references appropriate in this provision?</p>
<p>Per the Operating Plan, Pages B11 &amp; 12, the Concessioner must develop a plan for handling unattended property in the Concession Facilities and present it to the NPS for review and approval within 90 days. The Concessioner must include procedures for disposing of abandoned property as part of its Lost and Found plan. See Amendment#1.<br /><br />52. 3) F) (9) (d) Lost and Found [page B-11) Will the concessioner be restricted from accepting found items that were found outside its assigned area, especially in light of the customer service impact and consideration of (9) (b)?</p>
<p>See Amendment#1 for CC-GRCA003-15 for revised requirements.</p>
<p>53. 3) F) (9) (e) Lost and Found [page B-11] "Portable electronic equipment" is a new item added to the cash requirement. What is the definition? This could include anything from space heaters to cell phones to iPods to digital cameras. What is the justification for this inclusion?</p>
<p>"Portable electronic equipment" includes hand-held electronic devices, such as cell phones, tablets, MP3 players, e-readers, and digital cameras. See Amendment#1.</p>
<p>54. 3) F) (12) Internet Access [page B-12] Is it a correct assumption that free Internet is required for registered guests at the concessioner's lodges and not for all day visitors?</p>
<p>This assumption is not correct. The requirement is for all visitors, regardless of whether they are registered guests at the lodge. The Operating Plan requires: "At a minimum, the Concessioner must provide visitors with free Wi-Fi Internet access in the Yavapai lobby, Market Plaza deli, Camper Services and at least one public facility at Desert View, either the Trading Post or the General Store."</p>
<p>55. 3) F) (14) (a) Employee Housing [page B-13] The concessioner is required to provide a recreation program for its employees. Will becoming a sponsoring member employer of the Community Recreation Center satisfy this requirement?</p>
<p>The NPS does not define specific requirements of the recreation program; however, Proposal Package Question PSF3(c)2 asks Offerors to describe how they would provide a positive living situation and support community services for the employees in Grand Canyon National Park. The NPS may incorporate elements of the best offer into the final Contract.</p>
<p>56. 3) F) (15) (o) Assigned Employee Housing [page B-15] At Desert View, it appears that the Service is not assigning the 8-plex apartment that is currently in the concessioner's land assignment to the new 003 contract, but is assigning the 6-plex apartment building. The number of employees displaced by the removal of the Desert View Watchtower is fewer than the number of employees retained at the Desert View Trading Post, thus making the number of housing units out of proportion to the number of retained employees. Please explain the NPS rationale for this building assignment.</p>
<p>The NPS based this reassignment on staffing plan assessments performed as part of the financial analysis associated with prospectus development. Offerors must make their own staffing and housing determinations.</p>
<p>57. 3) F) (15) (f)] Trailer Village Non-Concessioner Employee Sites [page B-15] Can the Operating Plan be amended to reflect a thirty day period and then prorate for partial months as per the current practice?</p>
<p>For the purposes of the Prospectus, it will remain as stated. After the award of CC-GRCA003-15, the Operating Plan is subject to modification as circumstances warrant, so the NPS could consider a request to modify this provision at a later time.</p>
<p>58. 3) F) (17) Employee Shuttle [page B-16] Is it expected that the employee shuttle will operate between the Village and Desert View?</p>
<p>No. The requirement for an employee shuttle is within the Village.</p>
<p>59. 3) F) (18) (c) Transportation Safety [page B-16] Can the language be standardized as contained in 001 and 003? They currently read as follows: 001: The concessioner must prohibit drivers from using cellular phones in any manner (including hands-free or voice activated features) while operating a vehicle. 003: The concessioner must prohibit cellular phone use by any employee driving a vehicle during working hours. Prohibited uses include hands-free use or voice activated features, as well as reading, composing or sending text messages or emails.</p>
<p>For the purposes of the Prospectus, it will remain as stated. After the award of CC-GRCA003-15, the Operating Plan is subject to modification as circumstances warrant, so the NPS could consider a request to modify this provision at a later time.</p>
<p>60. 3) F) (20) Commercial Laundry Facilities [page B-16] There is no designated linen storage and distribution area indicated. Where is the concessioner expected to store these items?</p>
<p>The Concessioner must make this determination.</p>
<p>61. 3) G) (1) Employee Identification [page B-16] To save resources, would it be possible to note an expiration date only on the cards of the concessioner's seasonal hires? If not, what is the suggested expiration date time frame to be used on the cards of the concessioner employees?</p>
<p>For the purposes of the Prospectus, it will remain as stated. After the award of CC-GRCA003-15, the Operating Plan is subject to modification as circumstances warrant, so the NPS could consider a request to modify this provision at a later time.</p>
<p>62. 3) G) (8) (e) Background Checks [page B-17] Since operations on the South Rim are year-round, is it the intent that the concessioner repeats background checks on all long-term employees every three years?</p>
<p>Yes</p>
<p>63. 3) G) (8) (e) Background Checks [Page B-17] Currently employers are only allowed to receive information on convictions. Please clarify the requirement for obtaining information on "active wants or warrants (current fugitive from justice)".</p>
<p>As stated in the Operating Plan, for prospective employees, the Concessioner must complete a background check that includes a search for any active wants or warrants.</p>
<p>64. 3) I) (1) Risk Management (Safety) [page B-20] Could the date to submit Risk Management Plan be changed to be January 31st? This would allow the concessioner to analyze calendar year data before updating the plan.</p>
<p>For the purposes of the Prospectus, it will remain as stated. After the award of CC-GRCA003-15, the Operating Plan is subject to modification as circumstances warrant, so the NPS could consider a request to modify this provision at a later time.</p>
<p>65. 3) I) (1) Risk Management (Safety) [page B-20] DO 50B details Federal Employee OSHA requirements 29 CFR 1960 Standards which are not applicable to the concessioner's operations. Concession operations fall under 29 CFR 1910. Since 29 CFR 1960 does not apply, could "as applicable" be added to the end of the Risk Management Plan requirement</p>
<p>No. The Risk management Plan requirements stem from Director's Order 50B. 50B reflects the NPS' policy guidance regarding OSHA standards. The scope of DO 50B is "the occupational safety and health of our employees and others who work in the parks as volunteers, contractors, concessions employees, or in any other capacity." The DO covers all individuals working within park service units. While 29 CFR 1960 is referenced in the DO as one of many sources of authority for the DO, it isn't the sole authority. We agree that 29 CFR 1960 is only applicable to Federal employees and that concession operations fall under 29 CFR 1910. This does not change the fact that the policies of DO 50B apply to both Federal and Concessioner employees.</p>
<p>66. 3) I) (2) Employee Accidents/Illness Analysis [page B-20] This report is best addressed by using the OSHA 300A Summary of Work Related Injuries and Illnesses. January 5th is too soon to have all the data consolidated for reporting. Could the submission date be changed to January 31st?</p>
<p>For the purposes of the Prospectus, it will remain as stated. After the award of CC-GRCA003-15, the Operating Plan is subject to modification as circumstances warrant, so the NPS could consider a request to modify this provision at a later time.</p>
<p>67. 3) I) (3) Illness and Infestation Prevention and Response [page B-20] West Nile Virus is transmitted by mosquitoes. Since there are few mosquitoes at the Grand Canyon, could this requirement be deleted? The Clinic advises that they have never come across any patient who showed symptoms or was suspected as having contracted Rocky Mountain spotted fever (spread by ticks) or relapsing fever (spread by ticks and lice). Are these references appropriate for this location?</p>
<p>There have been a number of suspected cases of West Nile Virus in Coconino County, where Grand Canyon National Park is located. There have been cases of relapsing fever identified on the North Rim of Grand Canyon National Park. Rocky Mountain spotted fever has been reported in Arizona. The NPS believes it is prudent to develop procedures for recognizing and dealing with each of these illnesses in the event they occur, and therefore considers these references appropriate for this location.</p>
<p>68. 5) D) (3) (c) Concessioner [page B-22] Inspection reports are required within 10 days of each inspection. Could this be changed to 30 days? If not, would 15 working days be acceptable?</p>
<p>No, the NPS believes that 10 days is a reasonable length of time between an inspection and sharing that information with the NPS.</p>
<p>69. 5) D) (3) (e) Post Alarm Reporting [page B-23] What is the definition of "unfounded activation"?</p>
<p>An unfounded activation is an alarm that is not the result of a fire or other event the alarm is designed to detect.</p>
<p>70. 5) D) (3) (e) Post Alarm Reporting [page B-23] The fire alarm report is required by January 10th. Could this be changed to January 31st?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>71. 5) E) (2) (c) Communication Center [page B-23] Could an exception for employee injury be added?</p>
<p>Section 5)E)(2)(d) clarifies the requirement for employees who are on-the-job. Employees who are not on-the-job must be connected with the NPS Communication Center in the event that they request medical advice or assistance or a 911-type emergency.</p>
<p>72. 5) E) (2) (c) Communication Center [page B-23 - 24] With the reporting requirement under 3) I) (2) this requirement seems excessive and redundant. Can this be deleted?</p>
<p>No. These two requirements are not redundant. One requires immediate communication of an injury or accident so that appropriate NPS resources may respond to an incident. The other requires submission of an annual summary and analysis of employee injuries.</p>
<p>73. 5) E) (4) Training [page B-24] The term "first responder" is no longer in use under Arizona Statutes. Would it be more appropriate to reference Basic First Aid?</p>
<p>No. First Responder and Basic First Aid have the same meaning.</p>
<p>74. 7) B) (3) Midscale Lodging Standards [page B-26] Is all of Yavapai Lodge to be considered mid-scale?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>75. 7) B) (3) (b) Rooms Availability [page B-26] 3 pm is one hour earlier than the current standard. What are the parameters for the 20% discount? We assume the guest must attempt to check in at or after 3pm at a time when the room is not ready. In addition, must the guest complain or is the refund automatic?</p>
<p>The Concessioner must automatically provide the 20% discount if the room is not ready by 3 p.m.</p>
<p>76. 7) B) (3) (c) General Standards [page B-27] Is a lid considered a wrap? On glass count, a room with four pillows on two queen sized beds would result in 8 required glasses. Is that the intent?</p>
<p>Yes, a lid is considered a wrap. A "pillow" refers not to the actual number of pillows but to the number of occupants. A room with two queen sized beds would require four glasses.</p>
<p>77. 7) B) (3) (e) Guest Room Condition [page B-27] Can the concessioner leave used linen in the hall for brief periods or when contained in a cart or other receptacle? How about curbs/sidewalks waiting for laundry to pick up? Will additional storage areas be provided? Otherwise this requirement may mean loss of use of revenue rooms.</p>
<p>Piles of laundry lying in hallways or on curbs/sidewalks are not acceptable for any length of time. Laundry must be in a cart or receptacle. The NPS does not intend to provide additional storage areas.</p>
<p>78. 7) B) (3) (h) Information Packet [pages B-27- 28] What is meant by "Area newspaper"? Since Park Guides are given to every visitor at the gate and available at all Front and Transportation desks, could this Area newspaper requirement be deleted in keeping with the Service's sustainability program goals?</p>
<p>See Amendment#1.</p>
<p>79. 7) C) (2) (d) Water [page B- 29] Is it the Service's intent that the concessioner provides washable glasses at quick service food locations?</p>
<p>See Amendment#1.</p>
<p>80. 7) C) (10) (d) Camper Services and 7) C) (10) (e) [page B-34] Provision (d) states prepackaged sandwiches are available while (e) seems to indicate prepared to order sandwiches are an option. Can quick service sandwiches at Camper services be pre-packaged?</p>
<p>The Concessioner may provide pre-packaged sandwiches at Camper Services.</p>
<p>81. 7) D) (11) (b) Items Not to Be Sold or Displayed [page B-39] Is it the Service's intention to change what Native American artisans use to create Jewelry and Handicrafts or will they be excluded from this statement? If Native Americans are not excluded, the concessioner would no longer be able to purchase Dream Catchers, Ghost Beads, some fetishes, and many other artifacts that are a big part of the Native American culture and creative process. Banning of Dream Catchers and Ghost beads would likely put an end to these crafts. The majority of hand crafted Native American artwork is produced using leather, feathers, cedar seeds, bone, and shed antlers. As regards to the plant exclusion, can an exception be made for cactus?</p>
<p>Handicrafts and other retail items containing non-living biological materials, such as decorative feathers, seeds, nuts or flowers embedded or affixed to the item, provided they are from legally authorized sources and are labeled as originating from outside the Park, are permissible. The Concessioner must obtain approval from the NPS in regard to the use of cactus. See Amendment#1. <br />82. 7) F) (3) Camper Services [page B-40] It may be difficult to fix all machines within 2 business days due to delays in receiving ordered equipment. Could this be changed to 5 business days?</p>
<p>It will remain as stated. The Concessioner is expected to attempt to fix machines in two business days; however, the NPS will work with the Concessioner if this is impracticable.</p>
<p>83. 7) F) (7) Camper Services [page B-40] This includes reference to both tokens and change. Does the concessioner need to provide both?</p>
<p>See Amendment#1.</p>
<p>84. 10) A) (5) (b) Operational Performance Reports [pages B-43 and B-45] The Service requires the Operational Performance Report by the 5th day of each following month, but much of that data is not completely reviewed and approved until after that. Can the date be changed until the 15th day of each following month?</p>
<p>For the purposes of the Prospectus, it will remain as stated. After the award of CC-GRCA003-15, the Operating Plan is subject to modification as circumstances warrant, so the NPS could consider a request to modify this provision at a later time.</p>
<p>Concession Facilities</p>
<p>85. At Desert View next to the Trading Post is a building not currently in use. It was the former Grand Canyon Association store. Can that building be used by the new concessioner for storage (retail) or sales, i.e. coffee?</p>
<p>No. This building is not assigned to the Concessioner in the Draft Contract.</p>
<p>86. The 1995 and 2004 Master Plans call for removal of full time employee housing at Trailer Village and moving it to Pinion Park. Is this still a desire of NPS?</p>
<p>Although the Master Plans have not yet been changed in this respect, the NPS is considering an amendment to them in the future.</p>
<p>87. Can NPS please confirm that they contractually obligate the Grand Canyon Association's operations in the Park to the same requirements as the Concessioners as it relates to setting prices, products permitted for sale, approval for seasonal operations, etc.?</p>
<p>Grand Canyon Association operates as a cooperating association under Director's Order #32 and is required to meet those requirements. Cooperating Associations are not bound by P.L. 105-391 and its regulations.</p>
<p>88. It has been noticed that the GCA stores product include logo tee shirts, coffee mugs and other souvenirs in addition to educational items. In the prospectus, it states the GCA may establish a small retail presence at the Desert View Watchtower. Can NPS please define "small retail presence" in revenues per year?</p>
<p>The NPS currently envisions that retail operations will occupy the niche where jewelry is currently sold, with the larger space used for demonstrations. Gross sales are envisioned at less than $200,000 per annum.</p>
<p>89. When a visitor receives a receipt at the gate to the Grand Canyon, the back of the receipt advertises a 10% off coupon at the Association stores. Will NPS allow other concessioners to advertise on the back of the receipts in the future? This seems like a distinct advantage to the Association and is relatively unfair to the current concessionaires under the GRCA001 and GRCA003 contracts.</p>
<p>No. Grand Canyon Association is a non-profit Cooperating Association that operates under a different contractual relationship with the NPS than concessioners do. The GCA's status as a non-profit organization creates a very different business model than that provided to concessioners.</p>
<p>90. Can NPS define who governs the product the GCA stores can sell and the process for a concessioner to dispute the sale of an item or group of items?</p>
<p>Grand Canyon Association operates under Directors' Order 32, which describes the scope of services it provides and how the NPS approves those products and services.</p>
<p>91. In GRCA001 Prospectus there is reference made to "If the successful Offeror submits a proposal to renovate and use the historic Powerhouse building, and if the Service agrees, the Concessioner also will have the opportunity to provide additional visitor services in that location." Can NPS please explain why this language is absent from the GRC003 Prospectus?</p>
<p>See Amendment#1.</p>
<p>92. The Prospectus states that the NPS will be doing an environmental assessment on the Powerhouse, and plans to remediate any environmental and life safety issues. Does the NPS have funding identified for these costs and information on timeframes?</p>
<p>The NPS is committed to funding and completing a Phase I environmental audit of the Powerhouse as soon as possible. The NPS will consider those audit findings in conjunction with any conceptual plans submitted in response to the Prospectus to determine how and when to move forward with remediation of any environmental and life safety issues.</p>
<p>93. Has a Phase I Environmental Assessment been conducted? If yes, could you please provide a copy of the report?</p>
<p>No, a Phase I has not been conducted. The NPS has a number of other environmental reports regarding this building. See Amendment#1.</p>
<p>94. Due to the scope of the current concession contracts held by Xanterra and Delaware North at the Grand Canyon South Rim and the reallocation of concession businesses, employees, buildings, LSI, and support facilities under these current contracts into two new contracts that are the subject of the solicitations GRCA001-15 and 003-15, can it be assumed that NPS will only proceed under the two proposed new contracts concurrently? For example, how would NPS proceed if it determines there is a winning responsive bid under one of the two solicitations but not under the other solicitation?</p>
<p>The NPS has alternative plans if it is only able to award one contract under the current solicitations.</p>
<p>95. On what basis, if any, would NPS be allowed to extract CC-GRCA001-02 concession assets and assign those to the winning bidder of CC-GRCA003-15 if CC-GRCA001-02 remains in effect or there is not a responsive bid to CC-GRCA001-15?</p>
<p>If GRCA003-15 is awarded and GRCA001-15 is not, GRCA001-02 will expire pursuant to its terms at the end of 2014, and the assets due to transfer from GRCA001 to GRCA003 will transfer as of the effective date of CC-GRCA003-15.</p>
<p>96. The NPS retains the option to buy down LSI during the term of the contract and offset the buy down with an increase in Franchise Fees as noted in Attachment 1, Exhibit A of the Draft Concession Contract. Using the initial LSI Values outlined in the Prospectus ($41,161,579), a minimum Franchise Fee of 9.4%, and assuming a complete buy down of LSI occurs during the first three years of the contract, this would increase the minimum Franchise Fee to 22.16% plus the required minimum Required Maintenance Reserve Fee of 2.0%. Our understanding is that this scenario would result in minimum combined government fees of 24.16% for the remaining term of the contract.<br />a. Can you confirm the accuracy of the above interpretation and calculation?<br />The above calculation is in line with the NPS interpretation.</p>
<p>b. Was this factored into the NPS calculations? Yes.</p>
<p>c. Did this fee fulfill the statutory obligation of NPS to provide concessioners with a reasonable opportunity for a profit? Yes.</p>
<p>d. To provide bidders with greater certainty and allow them to prepare the required pro-formas, can NPS provide a fixed LSI buy down schedule in the concession contract that NPS agrees will not be exceeded or accelerated? No.</p>
<p>97. Why is the RMR fee in 003 higher than the RMR fee in 001 given the significantly smaller number of facilities and related building components in 003?</p>
<p>The Repair and Maintenance Reserve is a percentage of gross receipts and reflects an estimation of the funds necessary to complete projects eligible for such funding; however, the Concessioner must expend sufficient additional monies to maintain the Concession Facilities to the satisfaction of the Director.</p>
<p>98. Can NPS please provide an indication of an approximate date they anticipate they will announce the successful Proposer?</p>
<p>The NPS cannot do that at this time.<br />99. Do any of the lodging facilities in the GRCA001 Prospectus operate seasonally and if so can NPS please provide a breakdown of the operating periods by facility?</p>
<p>All lodging facilities in the GRCA001 prospectus are expected to operate year-round, unless that Concessioner requests otherwise and the NPS approves.</p>
<p>100. During the years of the GRCA003 contract, NPS has implemented programs and completed projects that have adversely affected the performance of the business under the GRCA003 contract. Specifically: moving the Desert View Road, Building 900 parking sites away from the Market Plaza, banning bottled water, and the building and award of the "Bike Stand" that is in direct competition with Market Plaza. Does NPS plan on doing any other of these projects that are not outlined in the current master plan?</p>
<p>At this time, the NPS has no plans to add additional competitive facilities in the Park, redesign infrastructure, or construct additional Concession Facilities other than those described in CC-GRCA001-15 prospectus.</p>
<p>101. Can NPS please indicate if there is any plan to improve signage in the Visitor Center area that may help traffic flow to the GRCA003 areas?</p>
<p>The NPS will review signage on an ongoing basis and update as appropriate.</p>
<p>102. Exhibit D has the snowplowing and road maintenance map for the Village only. Is there a map for the Desert View area?</p>
<p>No. The NPS did not produce a snowplowing/road maintenance map specifically for Desert View as the Concessioner is only responsible for snowplowing and road maintenance within the boundaries shown on the Desert View maps.</p>
<p>103. Will either contract (003-15 or 001-15) be assigned the 16 Trailer Village dorm units and laundry building? This represents 96 employee bed spaces that are not accounted for in the housing assignments under either prospectus.</p>
<p>See Amendment #1. The 16 Trailer Village Dorm units are considered personal property (under the CC-GRCA001-02 Contract) that the incumbent Existing Concessioner may sell to the Concessioner. The NPS would consider use of pre-fabricated (i.e. trailer-type, personal property) dorm units as one strategy for improving employee housing. These will be added to the personal property list in the CC-GRCA001-15 Prospectus Appendix M as follows: <br />16 - 12 'X 60' singlewide modular housing buildings. Each of these buildings is divided into 4 efficiency apartments, each with baths.<br />1 - 16' X 38' doublewide modular laundry and office building.</p>
<p>Fuel Tanks</p>
<p>104. Can NPS please provide the dates the Desert View gas tanks were last installed and any reports that would give prospective bidders comfort in assuming that environmental liability, inclusive of soil contamination, etc?</p>
<p>The tanks were installed new in 2005. Since the tanks are only 8 years old, there are currently no reports associated with them. Please refer to the following question for additional detail related to these tanks.</p>
<p>105. We have the following questions regarding the Fuel Storage Tanks at the Desert View Service Station: <br />a. Are the fuel storage tanks owned by the National Park Service?<br />YES. The gas tanks are owned by the NPS and will be assigned as part of the Concession Facilities under the Draft Contract.</p>
<p>b. What is the capacity of each fuel storage tank?<br />There are three fuel storage tanks. One is a 10,000 gallon tank, and two are 6,000 gallon tanks.</p>
<p>c. What are the ages of the fuel storage tanks? The tanks were installed new in 2005.</p>
<p>d. Are the fuel storage tanks double-walled? Yes.</p>
<p>e. Are the fuel storage tanks in compliance with all state regulations? Yes.</p>
<p>f. Have there been any reportable leaks or spills associated with the fueling tanks? If yes, were the proper procedures taken to mediate the spills? No.</p>
<p>g. What are the ages of the fuel dispensing units? Installed new in 2005.</p>
<p>h. Are the fuel dispensing units required to have vapor recovery? Yes, and they do have vapor recovery.</p>
<p>i. Can you provide information regarding the results of the most recent cathodic protection, leak detection, and tank integrity tests? The NPS does not have this information. It is held by the Existing Concessioner.</p>
<p>j. Could you please provide a copy of the tanks registration? The NPS does not have this information. It is held by the Existing Concessioner.</p>
<p>106. Please provide more information for FMSS code #234652 Desert View Service Station Fuel - System, Asset Type 5700, and built in 2000. Are these tanks for the fuel dispensing system?</p>
<p>Yes. These are the fuel tanks, dispensers and associated infrastructure. See Amendment #1.</p>
<p>107. We have the following questions regarding any other Fuel Storage Tanks, above ground storage tanks AST(s) or underground storage tanks UST(s) associated with the 003 contract: <br />a. Are there other above ground storage tanks AST(s) or underground storage tanks UST(s) throughout the operation?<br />There are several above ground propane tanks throughout the operation and housing, currently operated on a lease arrangement between the Concessioner and an outside propane company. These include tanks at Camper Services and at Yavapai lodge. There are no USTs.</p>
<p>b. If yes, how many AST(s) or UST(s) are there? Where are the tanks located?<br />See response to part a. above</p>
<p>c. What are the contents in the AST(s) or UST(s)? <br />With the exception of the ASTs at Desert View Service station, which contain auto fuel, the tanks contain propane.</p>
<p>d. What is the capacity of the AST(s) or UST(s)?<br />See response(s) above</p>
<p>e. What are the ages of the AST(s) or UST(s)?<br />See response to Question 106</p>
<p>f. Have there been any reportable leaks or spills associated with AST(s) or UST(s)? No.</p>
<p>g. Are there any closed UST(s) located on the land assignment? If yes, could you please share the closure documentation? No.</p>

<DESC><p>Below please find the National Park Service's (NPS) responses to most questions submitted in regard to the Prospectus for a Concession Business Opportunity to provide lodging, retail, food and beverage and other services (CC-GRCA001-15). There are a few questions, received by the September 18, 2013 deadline, that are not answered here. Responses to the remaining questions will be provided very shortly.</p>
<p>Please note all potential Offerors should read the questions and responses for both CC-GRCA001-15 and CC-GRCA003-15, as there is some information in each that may be of assistance in preparing a proposal to either solicitation.</p>
<p>Cover Page</p>
<p>1. Proposal Due Date. Since daylight savings time ends November 3, we assume the proposals are due on November 25, 2013 at 4pm MST, not MDT. Please confirm.</p>
<p>4:00 p.m. MST is correct.</p>
<p>Business Opportunity</p>
<p>2. Page 1 (and 25) - Required Visitor Services. What is the Service's expectation of the scope of "roadside assistance service"? We did not see mention of roadside assistance in the Operating Plan.</p>
<p>See Amendment #1 for CC-GRCA001-15.</p>
<p>3. Page 2 - Authorized Visitor Services. What is meant by "limited automobile garage services" and where will these services be provided? Is this for visitor vehicles? We did not find mention of these services in the Operating Plan.</p>
<p>See Amendment #1 for CC-GRCA001-15.</p>
<p>4. No Page Reference -There is no mention of auto towing service. Is this service no longer provided in the park? We did not find mention of towing service in the Operating Plan.</p>
<p>The NPS considers auto towing service part of roadside assistance. See Amendment #1.</p>
<p>5. Page 3 - Estimated Initial Investment. Has NPS included in its estimated Personal Property Initial Investment amount all the personal property replaced by the existing concessioner over the course of the current contract for which the concessioner requested LSI under the fixture rule but was advised by NPS that the items in question were personal property rather than fixtures?</p>
<p>Appendix M of the Prospectus contains the lists of personal property. The NPS contracted with a personal property consultant in 2010 to evaluate the furniture, fixtures and equipment of the Existing Concessioner. The consultant's valuation and replacement schedule was included in the financial analysis associated with prospectus development.</p>
<p>6. Page 3 - Estimated Initial Investment. By the same token, has NPS included in its estimated Personal Property Initial Investment amount all the personal property in the facilities owned by the existing concessioner that constitutes "fixtures" or "trade fixtures" under conventional real estate law but not under the narrower working definition of "fixtures" adopted by NPS?</p>
<p>Appendix M of the Prospectus contains the lists of personal property. The NPS contracted with a personal property consultant in 2010 to evaluate the furniture, fixtures and equipment of the Existing Concessioner. The consultant's valuation and replacement schedule was included in the financial analysis associated with prospectus development.</p>
<p>7. Page 10 - Retail. What is the expected timing of the removal of the personal property at Yavapai, Desert View Service Station, Desert View Trading Post Gift Shop, and Desert View Trading Post Snack Bar?<br /><br />The NPS expects that the current concessioner will negotiate with the incoming concessioner regarding a number of transition issues, including this one. Until such negotiations occur, regard December 31, 2014 as the date when the Existing Concessioner should remove such property.</p>
<p>8. Page 10 -Retail. What is the expected timing of the removal of merchandise and personal property at the Desert View Watchtower? Does NPS intend to purchase any of the personal property at the Watchtower? Is there a specific list of the personal property that NPS requires the current concessioner to remove from the Watchtower? If so, please identify.</p>
<p>The NPS expects the Existing Concessioner to remove merchandise and non-historic personal property from the Watchtower at the end of the CC-GRCA001-02 contract, i.e., December 31, 2014. The NPS does not have a specific list of non-historic property to be removed from the Watchtower. Please refer to Exhibit J of the Existing Contract for a list of the historic personal property that must remain at the Watchtower. The NPS expects to acquire title to that historic personal property.</p>
<p>9. Page 13 - Existing Concessioner Operations. The table states that there are 70 guest trailer sites at Trailer Village when there are currently more than that. Is this an oversight or is the number of guest sites being reduced?</p>
<p>The correct number of guest sites available as of September 27, 2013 is 80. See Amendment #1.</p>
<p>10. Page 15 - Employee Housing. The amount of housing removed from contract 001 and moved to contract 003 appears to be out of proportion to the number of employees who will be re-assigned with the removal of Yavapai Lodge, Camper Service, and Trailer Village from the 001 contract, and will result in the displacement outside the park of hundreds of employees working under contract 001. Please explain the NPS rationale for these building assignments. <br /><br />The NPS based the assignment of housing for both the GRCA001 and GRCA003 Draft Contracts on an analysis of the two business opportunities and an estimate of staffing requirements for each. Offerors must make their own analysis of housing and staffing needs based on their industry knowledge and best management practices.</p>
<p>11. Page 15 - Employee Housing. With the removal of a significant number of housing units in contract 001, hundreds of employees will be forced to live outside the park. Has NPS taken into consideration the financial impact to the concessioner and employees, the environmental and financial impacts of putting more vehicles on the road, and the availability of water and other resources outside the park when writing this prospectus?</p>
<p>See the response to Question No. 10</p>
<p>12. Page 16 - Required CFIP Improvement Projects. The CFIP schedule seems very aggressive. Will the Office of Planning and Compliance (OPAC) be able to review and process the entire program as specified? Will this allow the Concessioner enough time to design, process through GRCA compliance, and develop the facilities in accordance with the timetable outlined? The Motor Lodge and Quad Cabin compliance review process is projected to take 6 months, leaving 3 months for design and 90 days to construct. Does NPS consider this realistic?</p>
<p>The NPS is committed to the CFIP schedule as outlined in the Prospectus and will work with the Concessioner regarding the timetable after Contract award.</p>
<p>13. Page 17 - Demolish Existing and Construct Maswik South Lodging. Is the intent of this new lobby space a check-in space or a public space for quick food service? Would guest registration still be handled at the main Maswik Lodge complex?</p>
<p>The new lobby space will serve as a public area where (among other appropriate activities) the Concessioner must provide a quick service food operation (Page 17 of the Business Opportunity). Guest registration may remain in the main Maswik Lodge complex, where Maswik South guests currently register, but the Offeror may propose otherwise.</p>
<p>14. Page 17 - Mobile Food Service. Will the trucks be able to go anywhere in the park as demand warrants?</p>
<p>No. The Concessioner is required to keep the trucks within its Concession Facilities.</p>
<p>&bull; Can they operate seasonally? <br />The Concessioner must provide its plan, including its proposed schedule for these operations, for NPS approval.</p>
<p>&bull; Are there any restrictions on size, fuel source, noise limitations or signage?</p>
<p>See Exhibit B Operating Plan Sec. Page 44 7) C) 11) Mobile Food Trucks <br /><br />The NPS expects that the size will be similar to typical urban food trucks (approx.7-8' wide X 25' long). The NPS expects that the Concessioner will propose best practices regarding fuel source, noise and signage.</p>
<p>&bull; Will push carts be allowed along the rim?</p>
<p>No. Push carts are not a required or authorized service. See Amendment #1.</p>
<p>&bull; How will menu pricing be determined? (CPI or comparability)</p>
<p>See Exhibit B page B-4 Sec. 2)C)(4)(a) Food and Beverage</p>
<p>&bull; Is it a correct assumption that these are only required during peak demand periods?</p>
<p>The Concessioner must provide its plan including its proposed schedule for these operations for NPS approval.</p>
<p>&bull; Has a location been identified where the trucks can be cleaned daily?</p>
<p>The Concessioner will need to determine a location for cleaning its trucks within its Concession Facilities.</p>
<p>15. Page 18 - Conversion of McKee Warehouse. The McKee Warehouse (34115 / 272) currently has a diesel-fired boiler and is reported to have a malfunctioning fire suppression sprinkler system. Will these items be replaced or repaired prior to turnover to the concessioner?</p>
<p>The NPS does not plan to replace or repair these or any other items in the building at this time.</p>
<p>16. Page 18 - Conversion of McKee Warehouse. Has a Phase I Environmental Site Assessment (ESA) or some other type of environmental assessment been completed for the McKee Warehouse? If so, could NPS distribute copies?<br /><br />The NPS has not completed a Phase I Environmental Site Assessment for the McKee building. <br /><br />17. Page 18 - Conversion of McKee Warehouse. How many underground storage tanks (USTs) are currently present in and around the McKee Warehouse?</p>
<p>There is one 10,000 gallon UST at the McKee Building, which is still in use.</p>
<p>18. Page 18 - Conversion of McKee Warehouse. What materials have historically been stored in the USTs at the McKee Warehouse?</p>
<p>Heating oil</p>
<p>19. Page 18 - Conversion of McKee Warehouse. Can NPS provide construction details for the USTs at the McKee Warehouse including capacity, date of installation and type (single-wall steel, double-walled fiberglass, monitoring systems in place, etc.)?</p>
<p>See Amendment #1 (Appendix Z) for original construction drawings for the McKee Building, which include the details of the UST installation.</p>
<p>20. Page 18 - Conversion of McKee Warehouse. A door labeled "Boiler Room" was noted on the exterior of the McKee Warehouse on the south side. This room was not opened during the walk-through. What types of boilers are located within the room? Can details be provided - size, fuel type, and date of installation?</p>
<p>The McKee Building has two diesel boilers. Both are Columbia WL140 boilers. One was installed in 1982 and one in 2010.</p>
<p>21. Page 18 - Conversion of McKee Warehouse. Besides the subsurface hoists inside the building and the underground storage tanks, are there any other subsurface features such as sumps, basins, or floor drains at the McKee Warehouse?</p>
<p>See Amendment #1 (Appendix Z).</p>
<p>22. Page 18 - Conversion of McKee Warehouse. Can NPS provide the date of installation for the existing subsurface hoists within the McKee Warehouse?</p>
<p>The NPS believes that these were original with the building's construction.</p>
<p>23. Page 18 - Conversion of McKee Warehouse. Is NPS aware of any existing asbestos-containing materials (ACM) or lead-based paint at the McKee Warehouse?</p>
<p>The NPS has an asbestos survey for this building. See Amendment #1 (Appendix Z). The NPS has no information regarding lead-based paint.</p>
<p>24. Page 18 - Conversion of McKee Warehouse. Arizona Department of Environmental Quality records show at least eight USTs belonging to NPS that have been removed from the maintenance area where the McKee Warehouse is located. Is NPS aware of any legacy subsurface contamination as a result of these USTs that have been removed?</p>
<p>The NPS is not aware of any such contamination.</p>
<p>25. Page 18 - Conversion of McKee Warehouse. Who would assume responsibility for any environmental testing and remediation needed as a result of past activities in and around the McKee Warehouse including asbestos and lead based paint remediation? If the concessioner, has NPS included in its estimated cost of the McKee Warehouse conversion these testing and remediation costs? If so, what are they?</p>
<p>The NPS will assume responsibility for environmental testing and remediation as needed including asbestos and lead paint remediation.</p>
<p>26. Page 18 - Conversion of McKee Warehouse. Are there any outstanding regulatory requirements from Arizona Department of Environmental Quality (AZDEQ) or other regulatory agencies relative to environmental remediation or contamination for which the concessioner will be responsible in the area of the McKee Warehouse?</p>
<p>There is currently no open enforcement action by AZDEQ for this building. The NPS will perform any future remediation or abatement work in conformance with both the State and Federal requirements.</p>
<p>27. Page 18 - Conversion of McKee Warehouse. Are the existing USTs registered with the Arizona Department of Environmental Quality? The date of construction for the McKee Warehouse is omitted from Exhibit D of the prospectus. Can the construction date be provided?</p>
<p>No. The tank in question is not considered a regulated underground storage tank because it is used for storing heating oil for consumptive use on the premises where stored according to Arizona statutes. The McKee Warehouse was constructed in 1964. The NPS will add the year built to Exhibit D. See Amendment #1.</p>
<p>28. Page 18 - El Tovar Valet Parking. What is the anticipated timing of the implementation of the El Tovar valet parking? The space designated for this function is currently being utilized as the concessioner's fleet maintenance and public garage facility. <br /><br />The GRCA001 Business Opportunity, Page 16, Exhibit 8, lists the project start year as 2015 with the first year of full operation in 2016. The NPS will work with the Concessioner to coordinate implementation of this project.</p>
<p>29. Page 18 - El Tovar Valet Parking. Will valet parking be limited to El Tovar only, or will Kachina also be included since guests check-in for Kachina through the El Tovar front desk?</p>
<p>The Draft Contract requires the Concessioner to provide this service with pickup and drop-off at the El Tovar. The Concessioner will provide its proposal for the specifics of the activity to the NPS for review and approval. Valet parking is not limited to El Tovar registered guests, and the Concessioner may provide it (for example) to Kachina guests, day use visitors, dinner guests, or anyone else who wishes to use the service.</p>
<p>30. Shirley Hall Page 19 - Withdrawal of Concession Facilities. This section calls for the withdrawal of Shirley Hall (the current concessioner's human resources building). The 1995 Grand Canyon General Management Plan (pg. 36) calls for this function to be relocated to the concessioner's General Office Building after the public garage function is removed. Has the necessary regulatory compliance been satisfied to allow for this change? If so, please specify in what document(s) and provide them.</p>
<p>The NPS will conduct full compliance for this change in the event that it is implemented. The 1995 General Management Plan provides the foundation for this decision.</p>
<p>31. Page 22 - Projected Lodging Operating Metrics. The Average Daily Rates appear to be overstated in several locations. How did NPS determine these rates? The Occupied Room Nights also appear to be overstated. For example, Kachina Lodge reflects 15,000 - 18,000. The maximum possible room nights if every room was sold every night of the year would be less than the top of the range. How did NPS determine the Occupied Room Nights? The same concern applies to some of the average food checks and retail average transaction amounts. Is NPS anticipating significant near-term changes to currently approved rates or economic conditions for purposes of its financial analysis?</p>
<p>See Amendment #1.</p>
<p>32. Page 23 - Retail. "As noted, retail revenues exhibited slight fluctuation between 2009 and 2011. The NPS expects this trend to stabilize and improve." What is the basis of NPS' expectation?</p>
<p>The economic downturn of 2008 caused a notable dip in economic activity. The NPS expects the gradual recovery to continue. Offerors must make their own projections and develop their own assumptions.</p>
<p>33. Page 25 - Projected Future Expense Assumptions. Will the management positions that must be located outside of the park be identified, and is there a proposed time frame for this move?</p>
<p>The Concessioner must make its own determination regarding which management positions it will move outside of the Park. The Concessioner will begin operations on the effective date of the new contract, projected as January 1, 2015.</p>
<p>34. Pages 25 and 27 - Repair and Maintenance Reserve. In setting the Repair and Maintenance Reserve in contract 001 with over 200 buildings, how did NPS come to the conclusion that an appropriate rate is 1.3%, yet the Repair and Maintenance Reserve in contract 003 with 48 buildings is set at 2%? Is NPS assuming that the 001 concessioner will wind up spending amounts significantly greater than the rate identified in the prospectus?<br /><br />The Repair and Maintenance Reserve is a percentage of gross receipts and reflects an estimation of the funds necessary to complete projects eligible for such funding; however, the Concessioner must expend sufficient additional monies to maintain the Concession Facilities to the satisfaction of the Director.</p>
<p>35. Page 27 - Estimated Initial Investment. The Service has estimated Working Capital at approximately $1.1 million in 2015 dollars to include merchandise inventory. How was this number determined since it appears to be low by at least several million dollars?</p>
<p>The Offeror must make its own determination of appropriate working capital. This number was developed through independent professional analysis.</p>
<p>36. No Page Reference - Given the magnitude of impact on profitability in contract 001 in the event of a catastrophic waterline failure, how has NPS taken this into account in the formulation of this prospectus?</p>
<p>The NPS does not account for all possible catastrophic events, natural disasters or any other event which may cause business interruption, in its financial analysis.</p>
<p>37. No Page Reference - Since the concessioner is not able to assess the NPS utility system, please provide clarity, absent a catastrophic failure, on whether the Utility Add-On was factored into the NPS' prospectus financial analysis after the first year?</p>
<p>A utility add-on was factored into the NPS financial analysis. The NPS anticipates that a utility add-on will continue to be appropriate; however, this is subject to change based on changes to circumstances and NPS policy throughout the term of the Draft Contract.</p>
<p>38. No Page Reference - Currently the concessioner is allowed to show the Utility Add-On as a percentage charge on all receipts except for lodging folios. Will this presentation technique continue to be allowed or will NPS require that the Add-On cost be included without disclosure in the cost of the products/services?</p>
<p>"The Concessioner may not show utility add-on amounts as a separate line item on Concessioner billing (receipts). The Concessioner must incorporate the add-on amount into the advertised rate or price." Exhibit B Operating Plan Page B-4.</p>
<p>39. We are aware of Director's Order 35-B, the intent of which appears to be to pass along both NPS Operating &amp; Maintenance costs AND capital costs associated with NPS utility systems to users. We would like to confirm how the policy direction in that order is to be applied to this concession contract. Specifically:<br />a. Has the Associate Director, Business Services reviewed the current add-on structure that NPS states will continue during year 1 of the contract?<br />Yes. <br />b. Subject to material changes in improved business conditions or improved utility system efficiency, has there been tentative WASO approval to continue this same add-on structure during the remaining term of the contract after year 1?<br />The NPS will consider add-on charges annually, Exhibit B Page B-22 4) B) 2.<br />c. Is the "10% cap" on annual utility rate increases assumed to apply to this concession contract? See below.<br />d. If the 10% cap is presumed to not apply, has the new contract "been fully burdened with the actual cost of the utilities, including recapitalization as part of the new contract financial analysis"? See below.<br />e. If the answer to (d) is yes, at what point during the contract term does NPS expect to rescind approval of the utility add-on amounts? See below.<br />f. If the answer to (d) is yes, please provide the amounts of capitalization / recapitalization costs by year so the concessioner can evaluate the financial and cash flow impacts of these potentially material costs. See below.</p>
<p>In accordance with NPS Policy contained in DO 35B, a "10% cap" on annual utility rate increases will not apply to the Draft Contract. The projected utility capitalization/recapitalization costs were accounted for in the Draft Contract financial analysis. In accordance with NPS policy, projected utility costs above industry norms (including projected capitalization and recapitalization costs) were anticipated as a utility add-on. The NPS will determine the actual add-on, if appropriate, based on current policy throughout the term of the Draft Contract considering actual costs and the most current industry data.</p>
<p>Draft Operating Plan</p>
<p>40. 3) F) (5) Special Events [page B-9] Are weddings considered Special Events, or are weddings exclusively addressed under 3) F) (8) (m)?</p>
<p>Weddings are considered special events. Section 3) F) (8)(m) addresses the need for the Concessioner, as an initial part of the reservation process, to advise visitors that they need to obtain special use permits if the wedding will take place inside the park but outside of the Concession Facilities.</p>
<p>41. 3) F) (8) Facility Reservations [General -page B-10] Can the concessioner provide estimated room rates for tour groups and FITs since they must produce their catalogs and brochures further out than 13 months in advance?</p>
<p>See requirements concerning Advance Rates in Exhibit B, Page B-5 2) C) 7) (d).</p>
<p>42. 3) F) (8) (l) Facility Reservations [page B-11] Does the Service foresee continued approval of the current policy of holding a lodging deposit for the first night's stay?</p>
<p>The Operating Plan states "The Concessioner generally may not hold a deposit for lodging unless the Service approves such a policy." The NPS would base such approval on deposit policies followed by appropriate comparable properties.</p>
<p>43. 3) F) (8) (p) Facility Reservations [page B-12] Will the Service allow the Phantom Ranch lottery system to be done completely on-line? Are Phantom Groups subject to the lottery system? Are there any special provisions for river trips?</p>
<p>The Concessioner must submit its draft policies for Phantom Ranch reservations for review and approval by the NPS. Exhibit B, Page B-12 3) F) (8) (p)</p>
<p>44. 3) F) (8) (p) Facility Reservations [page B-12] The last bullet point states the concessioner must "Establish a deposit and refund policy for Phantom Ranch that discourages last-minute cancellations." Would a 30 day cancellation/no refund policy be acceptable since it is difficult to sell this type of trip within less than that time period?</p>
<p>The Concessioner must present its deposit and refund policy to the NPS for review and approval.</p>
<p>45. 3) F) (10) (a) Lost and Found [page B-12] DO 44 makes no reference to abandoned property. No copy of the PPMIN 05-01 was provided. Does it address abandoned property? If not, are these references appropriate in this provision?</p>
<p>Per the Operating Plan, Page B-12, the Concessioner must develop a plan for handling unattended property in the Concession Facilities and present it to the NPS for review and approval within 90 days. The Concessioner must include procedures for disposing of abandoned property as part of its Lost and Found plan. See Amendment #1 for CC-GRCA001-15.</p>
<p>46. 3) F) (10) (d) Lost and Found [page B-12) Will the concessioner be restricted from accepting found items that were found outside its assigned area, especially in light of the customer service impact and in consideration of (10) (b)?</p>
<p>See Amendment#1 for CC-GRCA001-15 for revised requirements.</p>
<p>47. 3) F) (10) (e) Lost and Found [page B-12] "Portable electronic equipment" is a new item added to the cash requirement. What is the definition? This could include anything from space heaters to cell phones to iPods to digital cameras. What is the justification for this inclusion?</p>
<p>"Portable electronic equipment" includes hand-held electronic devices, such as cell phones, tablets, MP3 players, e-readers and digital cameras.<br />See Amendment #1.</p>
<p>48. 3) F) (12) Internet Access [page B-13] Is it a correct assumption that free Internet is required for registered guests at the concessioner's lodges and not for all day visitors?</p>
<p>This assumption is not correct. The requirement is for all visitors, regardless of whether they are registered guests at the lodge. The operating plan requires: "At a minimum, the Concessioner must provide visitors with free Wi-Fi Internet access in the El Tovar lobby and mezzanine area, the Bright Angel lobby area, the Maswik lobby area, and in the Maswik cafeteria.</p>
<p>49. 3) F) (14) (a) Employee Housing [page B- 13] Does the current concessioner's E-caf&eacute; and employee meal discount program suffice or is there a more specific "meal plan" required?</p>
<p>The Concessioner is required to provide a meal plan and operate an employee dining room. The NPS is not requiring a specific type of meal plan.</p>
<p>50. 3) F) (14) (d) Employee Housing [page B-14] Will there be an exception for Colter Hall residents? Can these spaces be designated for concessioner use only?</p>
<p>Concession employees may not park on the rim, and this includes Colter Hall employees.</p>
<p>51. 3) F) (14) (p) Employee Housing [page B- 15] When will the concessioner operating Contract 001-15 have to vacate the employee housing that is being assigned to the 003-15 contract?</p>
<p>All Concession Facilities assigned to the CC-GRCA003-15 Contract must become available as of the effective date of CC-GRCA003-15.</p>
<p>52. 3) F) (14) (p) Employee Housing [pages B-15-16] Pinyon Park - 23 sites are noted as assigned. There are currently 24 sites. Is the lost site specifically identified? Mohave East - Notes a three bedroom apartment inventory of 4. This does not appear to account for the three 3-bedroom units that the Service returned to the Concessioner in 2012. Will the Concessioner lose use of those 3 units?</p>
<p>There are 24 sites. The three 3 bedroom units the NPS allocated to CC-GRCA001-02 in 2012 will continue to be allocated to CC-GRCA001-15. See Amendment #1.</p>
<p>53. 3) F) (15) (d) and (f) Pinyon Park and Mohave East [page 16] These sections refer to a 14-day rental and billing period; however, the current concessioner bills and residents pay on a thirty-day period with proration for partial months. Can the Operating Plan be amended to reflect this current practice?</p>
<p>For the purposes of the Prospectus, it will remain as stated. After the award of CC-GRCA001-15, the Operating Plan is subject to modification as circumstances warrant, so the NPS could consider a request to modify this provision at a later time.</p>
<p>54. 3) F) (20) Commercial Laundry Facilities [page B-17] While the Main Laundry activities have been severely scaled back, the concessioner still must process several thousand pounds per day of mule blankets, biohazard waste, rags, and other miscellaneous linens. Will the concessioner be allowed to continue in this manner?</p>
<p>For the purposes of the Prospectus, it will remain as stated. After the award of CC-GRCA001-15, the Operating Plan is subject to modification as circumstances warrant, so the NPS could consider a request to modify this provision at a later time.</p>
<p>55. 3) G) (1) Employee Identification [page B-17] To save resources, would it be possible to note an expiration date only on the cards of concessioner's seasonal hires? If not, what is the suggested expiration date time frame to be used on the cards of concessioner employees?</p>
<p>For the purposes of the Prospectus, it will remain as stated. After the award of CC-GRCA001-15, the Operating Plan is subject to modification as circumstances warrant, so the NPS could consider a request to modify this provision at a later time.</p>
<p>56. 3) G) (8) (e) Employee Hiring Practices [page 18] Since operations on the South Rim are year-round, is it the intent that the concessioner repeats background checks on all long-term employees every three years?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>57. 3) G) (8) (e) Employee Hiring Practices [page B-18] Currently, employers are only allowed to receive information on convictions. Please clarify the requirement for obtaining information on active warrants. <br /><br />As stated in the Operating Plan, for prospective employees, the Concessioner must complete a background check that includes a search for any active wants or warrants.</p>
<p><br />58. 3) H) (1) Employee Recreation Program [page B-20] Please elaborate on how the Community Rec Center will be run. Currently, the concessioner provides staffing, operating expenses, and day to day maintenance and is compensated for only 15% of total cost of these services. NPS provides building capital, and the Rec Center Cooperative is a non-profit entity that collects receipts and purchases all non-operating items. Will this arrangement stay the same or does the Service foresee this changing?</p>
<p>The Employee Recreation Program will be run as described in Exhibit B, the Operating Plan, 3H, Pages 20-21, which states in part: "the Concessioner may recover its costs, but must not operate the Community Recreation Center as a profit center." The NPS expects that the Concessioner will support the Community Rec Center in a way appropriate for the number of its employees who use the center. Information about the NPS role in supporting the Recreation Center is available in Exhibit H, Maintenance Plan, Part B, 1J, page H-17. The current arrangement, in which a non-profit organization oversees some of the recreation center operations, is acceptable to the NPS.</p>
<p>59. 3) I) (1) Risk Management (Safety) [page B-21] Could the date to submit Risk Management Plan be changed to be January 31st? This would allow the concessioner to summarize and analyze calendar year data before updating the plan.</p>
<p>For the purposes of the Prospectus, it will remain as stated. After the award of CC-GRCA001-15, the Operating Plan is subject to modification as circumstances warrant, so the NPS could consider a request to modify this provision at a later time. <br /><br />60. 3) I) (1) Risk Management (Safety) [page B-21] DO 50B details Federal Employee OSHA requirements 29 CFR 1960 Standards which are not applicable to the concessioner's operations. Concession operations fall under 29 CFR 1910. Since 29 CFR 1960 does not apply, can "as applicable" be added to the end of the Risk Management Plan requirement?</p>
<p>No. The Risk Management Plan requirements stem from Director's Order 50B. 50B reflects the NPS' policy guidance regarding OSHA standards. The scope of DO 50B is "the occupational safety and health of our employees and others who work in the parks as volunteers, contractors, concessions employees, or in any other capacity." The DO covers all individuals working within park service units. While 29 C.F.R. 1960 is referenced in the DO as one of many sources of authority for the DO, it is not the sole authority. The NPS agrees that 29 C.F.R. 1960 is only applicable to Federal employees and that concessions operations fall under 29 CFR 1910; however, the policies of DO 50B apply to both Federal and concession employees.</p>
<p>61. 3) I) (2) Employee Accident/Illness Analysis [page B-22] This report is best addressed by using the OSHA 300A Summary of Work Related Injuries and Illnesses. January 5th is too soon to have all the data consolidated for reporting. Could the submission date be changed to January 31st?</p>
<p>For the purposes of the Prospectus, it will remain as stated. After the award of CC-GRCA001-15, the Operating Plan is subject to modification as circumstances warrant, so the NPS could consider a request to modify this provision at a later time.</p>
<p>62. 3) I) (3) Illness and Infestation [page B-22] West Nile Virus is transmitted by mosquitoes. Since there are very few mosquitoes at the Grand Canyon (and at Phantom Ranch) could this requirement be deleted? The Clinic advises that they have never come across any patient who showed symptoms or was suspected as having contracted Rocky Mountain spotted fever (spread by ticks) or relapsing fever (spread by ticks and lice). Are these references appropriate for this location?</p>
<p>There have been a number of suspected cases of West Nile Virus in Coconino County, where Grand Canyon National Park is located. There have been cases of relapsing fever identified on the North Rim of Grand Canyon National Park. Rocky Mountain spotted fever has been reported in Arizona. The NPS believes it is prudent to develop procedures for recognizing and dealing with each of these illnesses in the event they occur, developing policies that reduce their risk (such as minimizing standing water that allows for mosquito breeding), and therefore considers these references appropriate for this location.</p>
<p>63. 5) D (3) (c) Concessioner [page B-24] Inspection reports are required within 10 days of each inspection. Could this be changed to 30 days? If not, would 15 working days be acceptable?</p>
<p>No, the NPS believes that 10 days is a reasonable length of time between an inspection and sharing that information with the NPS.</p>
<p>64. 5) D (3) (e) Post Fire Alarm Reporting [page B-24] What is the definition of "unfounded activation"?</p>
<p>An unfounded activation is an alarm that is not the result of a fire or other event the alarm is designed to detect.</p>
<p>65. 5) D (3) (e) Post Fire Alarm Reporting [page B-24] The fire alarm report is required by January 10th. Could this be changed to January 31st?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>66. 5) D) (3) (h) Concession Structural Firefighting [page B-25] Could the words "or equivalent" between "training" and "as" be inserted so that it would read: Concession firefighters must meet the standards for training or equivalent as outlined in DO/RM-58?</p>
<p>No</p>
<p>67. 5) D) (3) (h) Concession Structural Firefighting [page B-25] It seems the "bypassing the Concessioner Switchboard" could be used to prohibit critical communication that the concessioner would need in order to properly deploy all resources in the event of a fire (such as Engineering, Risk Management and General Management). Could "bypassing the Concessioner Switchboard" be deleted?</p>
<p>The NPS will delete this. See Amendment #1.</p>
<p>68. 5) E) (2) (c) Communications Center [page B-26] Could there be an exception for employee injury?</p>
<p>Section 5)E)(2)(d) clarifies the requirement for employees who are on-the-job. Employees who are not on-the-job must be connected with the NPS Communication Center in the event that they request medical advice or assistance or a 911-type emergency. <br /><br />69. 5) E) (2) (d) Communications Center [page B-26] With the reporting requirement under 3) I) (2) this requirement seems excessive and redundant. What is the intent of this apparent double reporting?</p>
<p>No. These two requirements are not redundant. One requires immediate communication of an injury or accident so that appropriate NPS resources may respond to an incident. The other requires submission of an annual summary and analysis of employee injuries.</p>
<p>70. 5) E) (3) Automated External Defibrillator [page B-26] In the 003 Draft, this ends with: "The Concessioner must train its front desk and security personnel in use of the defibrillator." Should this sentence be added to 001?</p>
<p>Yes. See Amendment #1.</p>
<p>71. 5) E) (4) Training [page B-26] The term "first responder" is no longer in use under Arizona Statutes. Would it be more appropriate to reference Basic First Aid?</p>
<p>Yes. See Amendment #1.</p>
<p>72. 5) E) (5) Scene Operations [page B-26] What is meant by "or transport considerations"? This could mean that the concessioner's on-scene personnel could not recommend that EMS Ambulance response be called. Could the "or transport considerations" be deleted?</p>
<p>No. Concessioner personnel are required to call the NPS when there is an injury or illness.</p>
<p>73. 5) E) (6) EMS Equipment [page B-26] Who provides the authorization for this medical equipment?</p>
<p>Authorization comes from the NPS based on the Grand Canyon National Park Emergency Medical Services Protocols and Procedures, which are based on DO-51, Emergency Medical Services and its attending manual.</p>
<p>74. 7) E) (6) Scheduled Tours [page B-48] The Bright Angel Tour was discontinued over ten years ago. Can it be deleted from the list of tours? For stops on the Desert View tour, the current concessioner was granted permission to stop at Navajo Point instead of Lipan Point for safety reasons during the summer high visitor volume period. Can this accommodation be included?</p>
<p>The NPS will make these changes. See Amendment #1.</p>
<p>75. 7) B) (3) (a) Room Availability [page B-29] 3 pm is one hour earlier than the current standard. What are the parameters for the 20% discount? We assume the guest must attempt to check in at or after 3pm at a time when the room is not ready. In addition, must the guest complain or is the refund automatic?</p>
<p>The Concessioner must automatically provide the 20% discount if the room is not ready by 3 p.m.</p>
<p>76. 7) B) (3) (d) Ice Buckets &amp; Glasses [page B-29] Is a lid considered a wrap?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>77. 7) B) (3) (e) Housekeeping [page B-29-30] Can the concessioner leave used linen in the hall for brief periods or when contained in a cart or other receptacle? How about curbs/sidewalks waiting for laundry to pick up?</p>
<p>Piles of laundry lying in hallways or on curbs/sidewalks are not acceptable for any length of time. Laundry must be in a cart or receptacle. The NPS does not intend to provide additional storage areas.</p>
<p>78. 7) B) (3) (h) Information Packet [page B-30] What is meant by "Area newspaper"? Since Park Guides are given to every visitor at the gate and available at all Front and Transportation desks could this Area newspaper requirement be deleted in keeping with Service's sustainability program goals?</p>
<p>See Amendment #1.</p>
<p>79. 7) C) (2) (g) Water [page B- 35] Is it the Service's intent that the concessioner provides washable glasses at quick service food locations?</p>
<p>See Amendment #1.</p>
<p>80. 7) C) (9) Service Hours of Operations [page B- 40] Is there a defined area that Maswik Pizza Pub deliveries are restricted to? What is the definition of "all day"?</p>
<p>Pizza Pub deliveries are restricted to the boundaries of the South Rim. The NPS expects deliveries to be available during operating hours 11 a.m. to 11 p.m. See Amendment #1.</p>
<p>81. 7) C) (10) Specific Standards [page B-42] Maswik Pizza Pub is listed under Full Service Family Casual. Will host/hostess seating be required? Will table side service be required?</p>
<p>See Amendment #1.</p>
<p>82. 7) D) (7) (b) Items Not to Be Sold or Displayed [page B-46] Is it the Service's intention to change what Native American artisans use to create Jewelry and Handicrafts or will they be excluded from this statement? If Native Americans are not excluded, the concessioner would no longer be able to re-sell Dream Catchers, Ghost Beads, some fetishes, and many other artifacts that are a big part of the Native American culture and creative process. Banning of Dream Catchers and Ghost beads would likely put an end to these crafts. The majority of hand-crafted Native American artwork is produced using leather, feathers, cedar seeds, bone, and shed antlers. In regards to the plant exclusion, can an exception be made for cactus?</p>
<p>Handicrafts and other retail items containing non-living biological materials, such as decorative feathers, seeds, nuts or flowers embedded or affixed to the item, provided they are from legally authorized sources and are labeled as originating from outside the park, are permissible. The Concessioner must obtain approval from the NPS in regard to the use of cactus. See Amendment #1.</p>
<p>83. 7) E) (3) (c) Driver Requirements [page B-47] Instead of "Community First Aid" which to our knowledge is not a term in use in the U.S. (Australian and Canadian in origin), would it be more appropriate to reference Basic First Aid?</p>
<p>For this Contract, the terms "Community First Aid" and "Basic First Aid" mean the same thing.</p>
<p>84. 7) E) (7) (c) Taxi Service [page B-48] Would the complimentary transportation for guests be at any time during the day or night and for any reason? Would this only apply to each concessioner's assigned lodging? (This provision is not in the 003 draft. Should it be?)</p>
<p>The Concessioner must provide complimentary transportation for guests at all lodging facilities at any time during the day or night for any reason. This requirement is not in the GRCA 003 Draft Contract because there is parking immediately adjacent to Yavapai Lodge.</p>
<p>85. 7) E) (8) Valet Service [pages B-48 - 49] Would it be possible to move Valet Services out from the management of Transportation and into Lodging? It would seem to make better sense being managed by the front desk for the convenience of providing fluid service for checking out guests, handling their luggage, and retrieving their cars.</p>
<p>The Concessioner may manage valet services in whatever manner it finds most effective. The Operating Plan provides the standards for valet services within the transportation section, but does not require the Concessioner to administer the service by the Concessioner's transportation department.</p>
<p>86. 7) E) (8) (a) Valet Service [page B-48] Will valet parking be limited to El Tovar registered guests only, or will Kachina be included? There are 127 guestrooms with Kachina included. Guests check in for Kachina through ET front desk.</p>
<p>The Draft Contract requires the Concessioner to provide Valet Service with pickup and drop-off at the El Tovar. The Concessioner must submit its proposal for the specifics of the service to the NPS for review and approval. Valet parking is not limited to El Tovar registered guests; the Concessioner may provide the service to Kachina guests, day use visitors, and dinner guests, etc.</p>
<p>87. 7) E) (8) (c) Valet Service [page B-49] Has the following been taken into consideration for the valet parking locations? While the improvements to the Garage mandate an update on the sprinkler system, it does not address the need to include an exhaust system for engine exhaust. With office occupancies at the General Office, the concessioner will need to make sure that a proper and effective exhaust system is in place. Will the one way traffic at the base of El Tovar hill be changed to accommodate a left hand turn from El Tovar Circle Road? If not, this could cause serious delays and poor guest service.</p>
<p>The existing garage facility has equipment for ventilation of vehicle exhaust.</p>
<p>The intersection at the base of El Tovar is awkward and may be susceptible to motorists making mistakes. The NPS will review the area and determine whether signage and striping would permit a left-hand turn.</p>
<p>88. 7) F) (9) (d) Personnel [page B-50] The current concessioner personnel have been trained in the past by NPS; however, the training was made available on a limited basis. After receiving training from NPS, will one of the concessioner's managers be able to be certified to train the remainder of the staff?</p>
<p>See Amendment #1.</p>
<p>89. 7) F) (9) (h) One-Way Mule Trips [page B-51] The concessioner currently operates two types of One-Way Mule Trip service: the emergency drag-out service that is initiated only with authorization from NPS and a reserved in advance one-way service that allows for one to five mules to go in or out of the Canyon in addition to the normal string of 10 guest riders in and out of Phantom Ranch. Is it the Service's intent that both types of trips continue?<br /><br />Yes.</p>
<p>90. 7) F) (2) Kennel Service [page B-52] The ABKA discontinued their operations prior to 2005. The only active equivalent that we were able to find evidence of is the International Boarding &amp; Pet Services Association. Is it appropriate to change the reference to the IBPSA?<br /><br />See Amendment #1.</p>
<p>91. 7) G) (4) (c) Location [page B-54] Is the information contained in a Guest Service Directory satisfactory to meet this requirement?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>92. 8) A) (2) Relocation Plan [page B-54] and Exhibit D Map 09. It appears that the administrative office building 2E (Dutton Building) and the "old Cardboard Recycling" shed are not included in the McKee building site. Both buildings were part of the NPS maintenance/Engineering facility. Is this an oversight?</p>
<p>No. The Dutton building and the shed are not part of the McKee building site.</p>
<p>93. 8) A) (4) Relocation Plan [page B-54] The Business Opportunity document (pages 15 and 18) indicates that the conversion of the McKee Building is to accommodate relocation of the current concessioner's Garage and Maintenance Operations. The current public garage is approximately 12,000 square feet, plus Maintenance is 25,000 square feet for a total of approximately 37,000 square feet. How does NPS see this fitting into a space of approximately 18,000 square feet (less 1/3 being used by the 003 concessioner)? Is the concessioner expected to construct facilities outside the park to accommodate these functions? If so, were the anticipated additional costs to the concessioner factored into the prospectus and what are these costs? If not, what other options are available for concessioner maintenance use?</p>
<p>Offerors must submit proposals based on the space to be assigned under the Draft Contract. The NPS considered costs associated with this changed space, but Offerors must make their own determinations.</p>
<p>94. 10) A) (3) (5) (b) Operational Performance Reports [pages B-56 and B-60] The Service requires the Operational Performance Report by the 5th day of each following month, but much of that data is not completely reviewed and approved until after that. Can the date be changed until the 15th day of each following month?</p>
<p>For the purposes of the Prospectus, it will remain as stated. After the award of CC-GRCA001-15, the Operating Plan is subject to modification as circumstances warrant, so the NPS could consider a request to modify this provision at a later time.</p>
<p>Concession Facilities</p>
<p>95. No Page Reference - We cannot locate the current concessioner's Rooms Department "spur" storage area. Was this overlooked?<br /><br />The NPS did not assign this area to the Concessioner.</p>
<p>Maintenance Plan</p>
<p>96. 1) L) (2) (c) Corrals and Backcountry Trail Maintenance [page H-18] There is no reference to the Kaibab Trail. Please explain.<br />See Amendment #1.</p>
<p>Maswik Lodging</p>
<p>97. Regarding the replacement Maswik lodges, would it be acceptable to start with 10 units with kitchenettes, then phase in the remaining 20 to meet the total kitchenette unit requirement of 30, depending on demand? Units could be designed for easy after-the-fact installation of the kitchenettes should demand warrant this.</p>
<p>No. The Concessioner must complete 30 kitchenette units.</p>
<p>98. Would NPS consider a realignment or possible partial removal of the existing road dividing building 1 from buildings 2-6 at the Maswik South complex? <br /><br />The NPS would consider this as part of an overall design concept for review.</p>
<p>99. Regarding the individual historic cabins, no exterior wall or ceiling interstitial space currently exists. To provide insulation, all exterior walls would require further "fur-out" on the interior to accommodate insulation. These modifications would require temporary removal of interior finishes and would result in a reduction of the unit's interior floor space. Is this acceptable to NPS?</p>
<p>The CFIP relating to the historic quad cabins must meet or exceed all standards set by the NPS and the AZ State Historical Preservation Office. The stated "fur-out" alternative is currently preferred by the NPS, pending review of all specific alteration plans.</p>
<p>100. Regarding the historic quad cabins, would it be acceptable to increase the roof thickness profile so as to install rigid insulation above the roof deck to meet the requirement for winterizing these cabins?</p>
<p>Interior insulation is preferred if the structures will accommodate it; however, the NPS may consider other plans if they meet or exceed all standards set by the NPS and the AZ State Historical Preservation Office and do not interfere with the visual character of the eaves assembly.</p>
<p>101. Are additions or modifications allowed to the cabins?</p>
<p>The Concessioner may propose modifications to the cabins for NPS approval. Exterior modifications must meet the Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation.</p>
<p>102. Considering the intent to winterize the historic cabins, does the negative impact on the historic fabric of these cabins resulting from adding insulation make sense considering that the cold months generally coincide with off-peak (lower demand) periods of guest room occupancy?</p>
<p>The NPS believes that there is potential for adequate off-season demand for these historic cabins. Offerors must make their own determinations regarding the opportunity and how they would maximize use of these cabins.</p>
<p>103. Please confirm the requirements of the "new lobby space" at the Maswik lodges, beyond providing "grab and go" concessions. It is assumed that all guest relations, including check-in/out, will remain in the existing Maswik lodge building?</p>
<p>The new lobby space will serve as a public area where (among other appropriate activities) the Concessioner must provide a quick service food operation (Page. 17 of the Business Opportunity). Guest registration may remain in the main Maswik Lodge complex, where Maswik South guests currently register, but the Offeror may propose otherwise</p>
<p>104. Please clarify which units are included in the requirement to "improve historic cabin and rim unit interior finishes at the Bright Angel Lodge". Does this include all cabins, quad and single?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>105. Is there a height restriction for the new Maswik Lodges?<br />The Offeror should assume any new structures may be no more than two stories high.</p>
<p>106. Please clarify the new footprint of Maswik South. Is it contained by the current road? What is the actual size of the footprint?</p>
<p>The new footprint consists of the area encompassed by the existing buildings, parking, and drives.</p>
<p>107. Is the 120 rooms a cap? Can this be higher or lower?</p>
<p>120 rooms is the maximum. 90 rooms is the minimum.</p>
<p>108. Is ADA access required to all or some cabins? The requirements of the ADA/ABA apply to all Park projects. Certain exceptions are permitted to qualified historic buildings and facilities if compliance with the requirements would threaten or destroy the historic significance of the building or facility.</p>
<p>Although not all cabins would be required to be accessible, some may be required to be accessible.</p>
<p>109. Did NPS make any assumptions about abatement requirements and costs in calculating the costs of the Maswik South demolition work? If so, what are these abatement requirements and costs and total demolition costs?</p>
<p>The NPS did not make any assumptions about abatement requirements in the Maswik South demolition project.</p>
<p>110. Given the unusual situation in which the concessioner is required to demolish the existing Maswik South complex before replacing it, does NPS agree that the demolition costs are eligible direct or indirect costs for LSI purposes?</p>
<p>The NPS believes that some demolition costs may be eligible for LSI credit subject to review and approval.</p>
<p>111. Due to the scope of the current concession contracts held by Xanterra and Delaware North at the Grand Canyon South Rim and the reallocation of concession businesses, employees, buildings, LSI, and support facilities under these current contracts into two new contracts that are the subject of the solicitations GRCA001-15 and 003-15, can it be assumed that NPS will only proceed under the two proposed new contracts concurrently? For example, how would NPS proceed if it determines there is a winning responsive bid under one of the two solicitations but not under the other solicitation?</p>
<p>The NPS has alternative plans if it is only able to award one contract under the current solicitations.</p>
<p>112. On what basis, if any, would NPS be allowed to unilaterally modify CC-GRCA001-02 and reduce concession services and extract concession assets and assign those to the winning bidder of CC-GRCA003-15 if CC-GRCA001-02 remains in effect or there is not a responsive bid to CC-GRCA001-15?</p>
<p>If GRCA003-15 is awarded and GRCA001-15 is not, GRCA001-02 will expire pursuant to its terms at the end of 2014, and the assets due to transfer from GRCA001 to GRCA003 will transfer as of the effective date of CC-GRCA003-15.</p>
<p>113. General Question. The NPS retains the option to buy down LSI during the term of the contract and offset the buy down with an increase in Franchise Fees as noted in Attachment 1, Exhibit A of the Draft Concession Contract. Using the initial LSI Values outlined in the prospectus ($137,843,453), a minimum Franchise Fee of 6.0%, and assuming a complete buy down of LSI occurs during the first three years of the contract, this would increase the minimum Franchise Fee to 23.92% plus the required minimum Required Maintenance Reserve Fee of 1.3%. Our understanding is that this scenario would result in minimum combined government fees of 25.22% for the remaining term of the contract. Can you confirm the accuracy of the above interpretation and calculation?<br />a. Was this factored into the NPS calculations? <br />Yes.<br />b. Did this fee fulfill the statutory obligation of NPS to provide concessioners with a reasonable opportunity for a profit? <br />Yes.<br />c. To provide bidders with greater certainty and allow them to prepare the required pro-formas, can NPS provide a fixed LSI buy down schedule in the concession contract that NPS agrees will not be exceeded or accelerated? <br />No.</p>
<p>114. Can the future concessioner(s) build employee housing in the park? Will the Service be adding new housing to the park?</p>
<p>No. See Business Opportunity GRCA001 Page 15 and Business Opportunity GRCA003 Page 13.</p>
<p>115. Is it a given that the Powerhouse will be part of one or the other contract?</p>
<p>No. As stated, "If the proposed use(s) and associated costs are acceptable to the Service, it may seek to negotiate an amendment to the Draft Contract (after its effective date) to assign the Powerhouse as a Concession Facility and authorize specified services for the Concessioner to provide." (Proposal Package, Potential Additional Concession Facility and Authorized Service(s) at the Powerhouse, GRCA001 Page 24, GRCA003 Page 19.)</p>
<p>116. Could the food truck operations be awarded to a separate operator?</p>
<p>No. The Concessioner must provide all the Draft Contract required services. As stated in the Draft Contract, Sec. 19. General Provisions, "Subconcession or other third party agreements, including management agreements, for the provision of visitor services required and/or authorized under this Contract are not permitted." (GRCA001 Page 23)</p>
<p>117. Can both contracts be awarded to a single company?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>118. If the contracts are awarded to the same company, would the company be required to operate them as separate entities?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>119. Will you announce who the Offerors are after the offer period closes?</p>
<p>The NPS makes this information available after the award of a concession contract through property requested post-award debriefings. See Proposal Instruction #8 (Part II of the Prospectus).</p>

<DESC>The purpose of this notification is to inform Explosive Detection Systems Manufacturers that TSA has revised the qualification process for Explosive Detection Systems (EDS). In an effort to accelerate the process of deploying the most effective and efficient security capabilities, TSA is no longer requiring Certification Readiness Testing (CRT) as part of the EDS qualification process. However, the service will remain available for developmental purposes and vendors should work closely with the Explosives Division of DHS S&amp;T to prepare their system for certification testing. Please note that if an EDS system fails certification testing, OEMs will be required to resubmit a fully updated data package and there will be a period of time where an OEM will not be eligible to resubmit their system for certification testing. The attached EDS Competitive Procurement Industry Day presentation detailing the qualification process has been updated to remove the CRT process as a requirement for qualification of an EDS.<br /><br />&lt;&lt; File: Cert Updated TSA Industry Day Masterslide Deck V 10-24-2013 (3).pptx &gt;&gt;
<p>If you have questions about the revised process please submit them to Matt Ashurst at (Matthew.Ashurst@tsa.dhs.gov). Questions will be distributed through a question tracker.</p>
