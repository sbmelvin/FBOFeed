The Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc. ("AURA"), acting as the operator of the Gemini Observatory, is seeking a firm to fabricate components for a tip/tilt module for its secondary mirror from drawings provided by AURA.  Although this contract is mostly for the machined items needed for the complete system, some assembly of subcomponents is required to assure that the assembled components are made correctly and the pieces fit together when assembled. The vendor will be responsible for maintaining the machining tolerances and surface finishes shown on the drawings. Machining operations can involve precision on the order of ± 0.005 mm.  All electroplated coatings, anodizing, passivation, electropolishing, and other surface treatments specified on the drawings are also included.  Invar, aluminum, stainless steel and other materials and fasteners must meet the quality and heat treatments specified on the drawings.

A Request for Proposal (RFP) for this procurement will be issued by AURA in September 2008 to those that submit a request to receive the RFP by  16 September 2008. Requests to receive the RFP should be sent by email to Andrew Flach, Gemini Contracts Manager, at aflach@gemini.edu, and should reference N281650 in the subject line.  In the body of the email please give the name of your organization and the contact information (name, email, street address, and telephone) for the person who will serve as your single point of contact for this procurement.  Please do not send a proposal at this time, but wait to receive the RFP which will have a variety of additional requirements and specifications.

The use of a brand name description is essential to the Governments requirements, Department of State infrastructure commonality, as well as IRM/EOCs operational requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company.  IRM/OPS/SIO/ESOC has identified that NetIQ Application monitoring as an integral component of IRMs Data Center Consolidation initiative. The agents listed above are required for NetIQ server performance monitoring in the new department data center. The 41 USC 253(c) (1), and FAR 6.302-1 are cited at the statutory authority.  As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractors unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the defined requirements as a key component of IRMs Data Center Consolidation initiative.   The requirement will be competed as the IT community responds to price requests on FedBid.

Responses shall reference Request for Quotations No.DE-RQ26-08NT000905 the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), National EnergyTechnology Laboratory (NETL), Pittsburgh, PA, (with deliver to our site inAlbany, OR)  intends to purchase the following:The Materials Science Focus Area requires a thermographic analysis systeminorder to study energy transformations in high temperature materials.  Thefollowing text details the specifications for an DT-TGA system that wouldberequired in order to meet the strict requirements for the MSFA on thisprogram.Specification: The system should allow STA (TG, TG-DTA and TG-DSC) measurements betweenroomtemperature and 2400C. A carbon-free measurement atmosphere to avoid reduction reaction on e.g.oxide-ceramic samples or contamination of metallic samples. The system must be of vertical, top-loading design to support the naturalgaspath and avoid condensation problems caused by evolved gases at elevatedtemperatures. The system should perform real simultaneous TGA-DTA/DSC measurements ononesample during one run. This is to eliminate errors caused by samplepreparationor sample atmosphere when running two samples on independent units. The software should perform DSC and DTA scaling which is convertible anytime. The hardware should have easily user exchangeable sensors for TG, TG-DTAandTG-DSC (exchangeable in two minutes or less). True metallic plate-type TG-DSC sensors for the temperature range fromroomtemperature to 1650C must be available (exchangeable in two minutes orless). The TG-DSC type S sensors should have a sensitivity of > 1V/mW (RMSnoisebetter than 10 W) (exchangeable in two minutes or less). Type S, B, K, E and W TG-DTA sensors must be available (exchangeable intwominutes or less). Type E and K TG-DSC sensors must be available to increase the DSCsensitivityin the low temperature range (RMS noise better than 1 W) (exchangeable intwominutes or less). For heterogeneous or low density materials a user interchangeable sampleholder for TGA with a capacity of 5.0 cm should be available. The furnace must have a motorized hoist with separate safety button. The system must be expandable to accommodate a second furnace on themotorized hoist, which may be either a 2000C furnace with Skimmer massspeccoupling or an additional 2400C furnace. An auxiliary gas spring hoist must be available which can accommodate anadditional two furnaces of the following types: subambient, platinum,rhodiumor silicon carbide. The sample support must be fixed to allow easy sample loading. The DTA/DSC signal must have a temperature precision of better than +/-0.5C. The DSC signal must have a calorimetric precision of better than +/- 3%. The balance must have a loading capacity of up to 18g. The balance must have a measurement range of 18g. The balance must have a resolution of up to 5 g (over the entiremeasurementrange). The balance must have a stability of better than 10 g/h under isothermalconditions. The balance and software must be able to automatically read the sampleweight. The system must be delivered with a thermostatically controlled balancechamber (including refrigerated bath circulator) to eliminate drift due toheating from the high-temperature furnace and/or fluctuations in the roomtemperature. The combined TG-DTA/DSC software must be able to correct enthalpy valuesforweight changes during the sample run. The system must be of vacuum-tight design to allow reduced pressures forrepeatable and pure sample atmospheres. The system must be delivered with two turbo pump systems and be capableofreaching vacuum levels of 5 x 10-6 mbar. The system should have the possibility to allow automatic gas changes ifrequired. The system must be delivered with at least 6 traceable standards to allowcalibration for temperature and DTA/DSC by the user. Ceramic, graphite and metal crucibles in various sizes must be available. Operating and evaluation should be by Windows based software. The software should include calibration routines and offer thepossibilityfor baseline corrections of the TGA and DTA/DSC signals. The software must be delivered with the calculated DTA (CDTA) extension.Thisallows calculated DTA signals when using the TG sample carrier and permitstemperature recalibration of the TG, TG-DTA and TG-DSC sensors. A software package should be available for Kinetic evaluation of DTA/DSCandTG data using Arrhenius and ASTM 968, Freedman, Ozawa-Flynn Wall, singlestepreactions with multiple reaction types. Besides these old traditionalmethodsthe possibility for multiple step reaction using non-linear mathematicsshouldbe available. The system should be ready to be extended by an MS or FTIR coupling forevolved gas analysis. Heatable adapters and transfer lines for FTIR and/or QMS coupling must beavailable. Components must be interchangeable with existing laser flash, dilatometerandSTA systems. The software for the STA and our existing instruments must be compatibleandseamless, i.e. the STA, dilatometer and laser flash.DELIVERY: FOB Destination is required (all freight included).

This softwareneedsto be accessible to Pittsburgh NETL, Morgantown NETL, and Albany NETL (ifrequested) and be available to up to 40 login IDs to include researchers,technical managers, focus leaders, project managers, the patent office, thelibraries, and any other essential personnel. The software will need toprovidethe following performance / technical specifications that will best meettheneeds of the DOE:Database access is the single most important specification the current DOEprojects.o A software that will easily link the user with the CAS Registry database,allpatent records meeting CAS criteria (within 2 days of issue), allowsinfiniteaccess to reaction records and journal articles (regardless of publisher),bibliographic and abstracts for  journals updated within a week ofpublication.  Full access to all abstracts regardless of DOE subscriptionto ajournal. Software where the analysis of the records are done by CASscientistswho are experts in a variety of scientific disciplines, the CAS databasesoffervalue-added content obtained from journals and patents not availablewithouttalking to a scientist that includes the following: Concept information - important scientific concepts, e.g., diseases,processes, techniques, as well as a statement about the nature of the studywhich are added to the keywords and terms to insure the articles areretrievedwhen requested. Comprehensive substance information - specific chemical structures,generic,or Markush structures, trade names, trivial names, systematic names,synonyms,and molecular formulas allowing for the identification of a chemical withlimited information about the structure, formula, or name. Research features: Software that is designed by chemists to allow for thefastest location of an ideal reference, reaction, or safety/regulatoryinformation. The most common ways to search are identified below with theirabilities and benefits to the DOE project: Research Features: to Explore by any of the following:Research Topic(s): The ability to specify 2-3 concepts using plain English. Include prepositions and articles to connect to concepts Identify by acronyms or synonyms in parentheses Ability to exclude terms with not or except Note: Software that will automatically search related terms and considersalternate spellings and word endings when retrieving results.Author: Enables the finding of sci-tech information by entering the name of ascientist or researcher, regardless of whether the exact name under whichtheresearch was published is known. Spaces, hyphens and apostrophes are allowed as well as special characterscommon in foreign languages. The ability to enable common misspellings or alternative spellings toaccountfor name variations and typographical differences that normally make areference lost.Company: Ability to find information related to a particular company, academicinstitution, or government organization, regardless of whether you know theexact name of the organization at the time of publication. Substance name: Ability to locate a substance by Substance Identifier to find aparticularsubstance or group of substances by using a chemical name or CAS RegistryNumber.      This feature is useful for: Finding and verifying chemical names, structure, CAS Registry Numbers,molecular formulas, and other substance information Obtaining calculated and experimental property data Identifying commercial sources  all chemicals can be limited to thosecommercially available (with information on the supply company) in order toidentify easier routes to satisfy research plans. Retrieving regulatory compliance information. Obtaining articles and patents that discuss the substance.Reaction:o Reactions databased as related to all references are accessible andsearchable which includes a chemical drawing tool that can additionally beusedas a molecule draw tool for word documents, papers, and proposals.  Withthisfeature, it is possible to: Indicate the role of each participant  (Reactant, Product, Catalyst, etc)desired in the search results Draw, use, save, cut-and-paste in word, substructure drawing features Search while allowing or prohibiting additional substitution and/or ringfusion with a simple highlight Identification of all the reported involved materials in the reactions-complete with linked CAS numbers and identification tools. Ability to move from the reaction window into the journals citing thereaction, regulatory information on the chemicals involved, and all thestructures and commercial suppliers. The ability to access the above features 24 hours a day from any NETLcomputer as a user and which does not require a second point of contact.Thisrepresents a tremendous value in search speed, ability, information, andaccess.Result Manipulation:o Software which allows for the following manipulation tools for theresults: Search results (reactions, substances, or journal articles) can beexportedin all common formats (.txt, .rtf, etc) to other bibliographic softwares tosave time in citations. Imported citations can include personal remarks forthearticle and the abstract. Search results can be searched, sorted, and removed or stored to includeanycombination of the following: publication years, document types (patent,conference abstract, review article, journal article, thesis, researchstudy,report, etc), author(s), additional terms, language (English, Japanese,Chinese, etc), as well as many others. Foreign results include scientist-translated abstracts and chemicalidentifications to insure a reference that is not relevant is notrequested.Often the abstract contains all of the pertinent information regarding thereplication of the actual reaction published and the complete bibliography.These abstracts are viewable and included in the manipulation options evenifthe DOE is not a subscriber to the journal. Updates can be set to include any new articles, patents, or publicationsregarding a particular topic a researcher is interested in (eg. carbondioxideconversion).Customer support Software support that is available by phone (7am-8pm EST), email, oronline24 hours a day and can respond in less than 48 hours to any question orproblem(usually government needs responses immediately in order to meetdeadlines). Help for software download, installation, configuration, or othertechnicalproblemsSimplified Acquisition Procedures FAR Part 13 will be used.

the hormonal etiology of breast cancer including investigating the biological
mechanisms that explain the lower breast cancer risk in Asian women compared
with women in the US.
The purpose of this requirement is the research by establishing studies to
assess the variability in biomarkers in Asian populations, and in particular,
Mongolian women given their low breast cancer rates. Establishing a study in Mongolia
where currently there is little in the way of research infrastructure could be
difficult.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The purpose of this procurement is to collect questionnaire
and biological data for a study of premenopausal hormone and protein
concentrations in Mongolian women. This will be accomplished through recruiting
study subjects, collecting questionnaire and biological data and delivering it
to NCI, working with Mongolian authorities. Through evaluation of this
information, NCI hopes to collect the data necessary to address the issue of
whether Asian and in particular, Mongolian, premenopausal hormone
concentrations differ by migration status.</p>

<DESC>Introduction:The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) supports research related to the basic understanding of microbiology and immunology leading to the development of vaccines, therapeutics, and medical diagnostics for the prevention, treatment, and diagnosis of infectious diseases.  The NIAID Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID) has a requirement for the development of therapeutic agents for select biodefense pathogens.
Description: 
Through this solicitation, the NIAID, is seeking to support projects to advance the development of promising candidate therapeutics with demonstrated in vivo activity against one or more of the following NIAID biodefense priority pathogens: Bacillus anthracis, Variola major, Filoviruses: Marburg and Ebola, Influenza, Gram negative biodefense bacteria.  Note: NIAID seeks to support the development of broad spectrum antimicrobials with activity against more than one NIAID Category A, B, or C priority biodefense Gram negative pathogen, (e.g. Francisella tularensis, Yersinia pestis, Burkholderia pseudomallei, B. mallei, Rickettsia prowazeki, Coxiella burnetti, Escherichia coli, Campylobacter jejuni). Antimicrobial resistant pathogens were recently added to the NIAID Category C priority biodefense pathogens list and are defined as pathogens, excluding sexually-transmitted organisms (see http://www3.niaid.nih.gov/biodefense/anti_stis.htm for list of excluded organisms), resistant to antimicrobial agents.  Broad spectrum Gram negative candidate therapeutic agents proposed for advancement under this program should have demonstrated in vivo activity against at least one Gram negative Category A, B, or C pathogen; AND in vitro activity against at least three different genera of Gram negative Category A, B, or C pathogens.

The candidate therapeutic should be at a stage of development that is, at a minimum, within five (5) years of completion of a Phase 1 clinical trial. Support will be provided for non-clinical studies, medicinal chemistry, manufacturing, Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials, and other Investigational New Drug (IND)-, New Drug Application (NDA)-, or Biologic License Application (BLA)-enabling studies. The NIAID is particularly interested in candidate therapeutics with broad spectrum activity and that are within the regulatory purview of the Center for Drug Evaluation and Review (CDER) of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  Contracts awarded under this solicitation will not support: The design and conduct of Phase 3 clinical trials, the development of vaccines (vaccine is defined as an intervention that directly elicits a pathogen specific immune response), and the development of polyclonal antibody blood-derived products.

It is anticipated that one or more cost reimbursement, completion type contracts will be awarded for a five-year period of performance beginning on or about July 31, 2008.  It is estimated that the provision of FTEs will be approximately 5 ? 8.  Any responsible offeror may submit a proposal which will be considered by the Agency.   This RFP will be available electronically on/about July 11, 2007, and may be accessed through the NIAID Office of Acquisitions (OA) Home Page at http://www.niaid.nih.gov/contract and on FedBizOpps http://www.fedbizopps.gov/.  This notice does not commit the Government to award a contract.  No collect calls will be accepted.  No facsimile transmissions will be accepted. See Government-Wide Numbered Note 26.

<DESC>The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) supports research related to the basic understanding of microbiology and immunology leading to the development of vaccines, therapeutics, and medical diagnostics for the prevention, treatment, and diagnosis of infectious and immune-mediated diseases.  The NIAID, Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases, has a requirement to maintain Bioinformatics Resource Centers, which have become the public repository of genomics and related data generated by NIAID-supported genomics programs and grants and contracts as well as publicly available data generated by the scientific community.  

This initiative will provide for the continuation of the Bioinformatics Resource Centers (BRCs) program, as well as the expansion, to include collaboration on experimental research projects and maintenance of a central BRCs Portal. The BRCs will be established to provide the scientific community with databases that house not only genomics data, but also a variety of research data about infectious diseases caused by human pathogens in the NIAID Category A-C Priority Pathogen lists for biodefense research, as well as pathogens causing emerging/re-emerging infectious diseases (http://www3.niaid.nih.gov/research/topics/emerging/list.htm), and to make available analytical resources and bioinformatics services. 

Specifically, the Contractor shall be required to establish and maintain a Bioinformatics Resource Center that will provide scientific, web-based database resources to researchers who use in their investigations genomics and other basic research data of microbial organisms. To provide these resources, the Centers will: 1) collect and efficiently update research data for multiple pathogens; 2) establish databases that store, integrate, and annotate a large variety of experimental data types from different public and private data sources; 3) develop interfaces to the databases to allow external users to easily query, retrieve, analyze, upload, and download data; 4) develop software tools and algorithms to analyze and curate pathogen research data. Software developed by the Centers shall be made available to the scientific community with an open source license, with the appropriate tutorials and help documentation. Data generated by the Centers will also be publicly disseminated to the scientific community. Outreach activities to the scientific community, hands-on training and workshops shall be provided by the BRC.

Moreover, the expansion of the BRCs program will provide the opportunity for the BRCs to collaborate with experimental research laboratories through “Driving Biological Projects (DBPs)” to apply bioinformatics techniques to investigate and support experimental biology research in infectious diseases.  Finally, one of the BRCs shall support and maintain the BRCs Portal of information for the BRCs program (currently named BRC-Central http://www.brc-central.org/). The BRCs Portal will serve as the central data repository and analysis resource for all targeted pathogens for selected data types, and will facilitate interoperability projects among the BRCs and with other bioinformatics resources.

Upon award, the new contractors will have to ensure an effective transition of the data and software hosted by the incumbent BRCs contractors into the new BRC and BRCs Portal.

It is anticipated that multiple cost reimbursement, completion type contracts will be awarded for a five-year period of performance beginning on or about August 24, 2009.  It is estimated that the provision of FTEs will be approximately as follows:  12.4 FTE per year for the BRC and 16.4 FTE for the BRC that will also support the BRCs Portal.

Any responsible offeror may submit a proposal which will be considered by the Agency.  This RFP will be available electronically on/about September 15, 2008, and may be accessed through FedBizOpps http://www.fedbizopps.gov/.  This notice does not commit the Government to award a contract.  No collect calls will be accepted.  No facsimile transmissions will be accepted.

<DESC>The National Library of Medicine (NLM) intends to contract, on a sole source basis, with the Student National Medical Association (SNMA), 5113 Georgia Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C.   The purpose of this effort is to obtain access to a broad network of U.S. minority medical school students in order to increase knowledge about NLM online resources within the African American and other underserved communities that SNMA serves.  

This requirement will be processed in accordance with FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures (Non-Commercial).  The North American Industry Classification System Code is 813920 and the business size standard is $6.5 MIL.  

NLM anticipates that award will be made on or about September 15, 2008.  The period of performance will be for one year from date of award.  The place of performance will include NIH and offsite (including contractor facility). 

NLM’s Division of Specialized Information Services (SIS) administers a toxicology and information program, as well as other specialized biomedical information services, such as outreach and training.  Within SIS, the Outreach and Special Populations Branch’s mission states that it conducts and manages outreach programs that involve minorities and minority institutions, serves as the focal point for SIS training and outreach activities to minority populations and develops new SIS programs to reach health professionals, public health workers, and the public.  Programs with the Student National Medical Association are directly related to the fulfillment of the SIS’s mission and constitute an important benefit to the public good and to NLM’s and NIH’s efforts to address the elimination of health disparities

There are two major activities to be accomplished:  

1. Brotherhood Alliance for Science and Education (BASE) 
		
The BASE project was developed to enhance SNMA’s efforts to recruit minority males into the field of medicine.  The goal of the project is to establish a broader BASE (Brotherhood Alliance for Science and Education) to increase minority recruitment into professional careers, especially medicine.  NLM supported the pilot of this project which focused on minority males in the Baltimore school system where the high school dropout rate for Black males is 76%.  The pilot was conducted by SNMA members in the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine.  The chapter provided academic and enrichment activities and all of the participants have experienced improvement in their school grades.  NLM will provide continued support for BASE related activities and expand this pilot project to include other existing SNMA chapters.  BASE participants will receive training in how to use the NLM consumer health web based resources and are encouraged to share this information with their classmates and families. 

2. International Mission NLM Database Training
				
The SNMA conducts international medical mission trips to various parts of the world.  Missions have occurred in Ghana, Cuba, Kenya, the Dominican Republic and Guatamala.  In most of the visited countries the students combine observational experiences in clinics and hospitals with hands-on clinical care.  Also, the students participate in an educational program focused on reproductive health and HIV prevention amongst youth.  Each year mission participants receive database training from the NLM.  NLM will provide hands-on database training for SNMA students.

The contractor shall implement these tasks with minimal direction, but in close collaboration with the government.

The government shall provide the contractor access to relevant SIS and NLM information and staff.

Pursuant to 41 U.S.C. 253(c) (1) as set forth in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) at 6.302, SNMA is the only known source that is capable of fulfilling this requirement.  SNMA was established in 1964 and is the nation’s oldest and largest organization focused on the needs and concerns of medical students of color.  The SNMA works for improved health care services and education to meet the needs of minorities and underserved populations.

SUP 5252.213-9401	NOTICE TO PROSPECIVE SUPPLIERS (APR 1999)
	(a)	This procurement is subject to the Navys Red/Yellow/Green (RYG) Program.  RYG is authorized by the Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Research, Development and Acquisition) for use in the acquisition of supplies and services used to build, maintain, and operate the Fleet.
	(b)	The Government reserves the right to award to the supplier whose quote represents the best value to the Government.  As such, the basis for award will include an evaluation of each suppliers past performance history for the Federal Supply Class(s) or Service Code(s) (FSCs) of the supplies and services being purchased.  The price to be considered in determining best value will be the evaluated price after application of Technical Evaluation Adjustments (TEAs).
	(c)	The procedures described in the clause entitled, Additional Evaluation Factor for Consideration of Past Performance  Navy Red/Yellow/Green Program (APR 1999), will be used to assist in determining the best value for the Government.
SUP 5252.213-9402		ADDITIONAL EVALUATION FACTOR FOR CONSIDERATION				OF PAST PERFORMANCE-NAVY RED/YELLOW/GREEN 				PROGRAM (APR 1999)
	(a)	This procurement is subject to the Navys Red/Yellow/Green (RYG) Program, authorized by the Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Research, Development and Acquisition) for use by participating activities during the acquisition of supplies and services used to build, maintain, and operate the Fleet.
	(b)	The purpose of RYG is to assist contracting personnel during source selection to determine the best value for the Government.  The program uses accumulated supplier past performance data to classify each suppliers performance by Federal Supply Class (es) or Service Code(s) (FSCs) as either red (high risk), yellow (moderate risk), green (low risk) or neutral (no risk established).
	(c)	To assist in source selection a monetary assessment in the form of a Technical Evaluation Adjustment (TEA) is added to each suppliers quote having a red or yellow classification for the FSC involved.  The dollar amount of the red or yellow TEA assessment is based on the cost to the Government of effecting additional actions required to assure performance by a supplier with an unsatisfactory performance history for the FSCs involved.  No TEA is assessed for a supplier having either a green or a neutral FSC RYG classification.  For purposes of the RYG program, a neutral classification is assigned to suppliers who are first time quoters to the Government for the FSC(s) involved, suppliers otherwise having no past performance data in the RYG database for the FSC(s) involved, and suppliers whose past performance data in the RYG database for the FSC(s) involved are over three years old.  After consideration of any other pertinent, price-related factors (e.g., transportation charges, first article testing, discount terms), the adjusted price becomes the basis for determining award.  A suppliers FSC RYG classification may change over time as new or revised performance data becomes available.
	(d)	RYG classifications are summarized as follows:
		(1)  Green is low risk.  No performance assurance actions are considered necessary.  No TEA will be assessed.  
		(2)  Yellow is moderate risk.  Additional performance assuring actions are considered necessary.  A TEA will be applied to the prospective suppliers price to reflect the Governments estimated additional costs.
		(3)  Red is high risk.  Significant additional performance assurance requirements are considered necessary.  A TEA will be applied to the prospective suppliers price to reflect the Governments estimated additional costs.
		(4)  Neutral is no risk established.  No TEA is assessed; nevertheless, additional performance assurance requirements may be considered necessary to assure quality and on-time delivery.
	(e)	RYG classifications for all applicable FSC(s) are established monthly for each supplier and provided to them.  Suppliers may address questions about the program or their FSC RYG classifications to the Naval Sea Systems Logistics Center (NLSC), Portsmouth Detachment, Federal Building, Room 400, 80 Daniel Street,  Portsmouth, NH 03801-3884, telephone (603) 431-9460, ext. 464, FAX 603-431-9464.  Suppliers may also access their individual FSC RYG classifications through the automated vendor access program.  To obtain automated access, written request must be submitted on company letterhead to NLSC at the above address.  The request must include the requesters name, title, company name, address, telephone number and Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code.  The CAGE code is mandatory.  In response, NLSC will provide each supplier, without charge, with an individual password, all required software, and information on accessing its individual data.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>This is a market survey to locate potential sources of repair and maintenance for the AN-AVS-7(V) family HUD assemblies and subassemblies.  The HUD enables helicopter pilots to use the Aviators Night Vision Imaging System (ANVIS) goggles during flight operations.  The HUD provides critical operational information to the pilot superimposed over the ANVIS image.  The HUD minimizes the requirement for the pilot and co-pilot to look at the flight instruments, thus allowing them to concentrate on scanning outside of the cockpit.<BR><BR>  The government is seeking interested sources for the Repair and Maintenance of the AN-AVS-7(V) family of HUD systems.  The government intends to purchase these services using an indefinite quantity/indefinite delivery (IDIQ) contract over a two-year period. Respondents must have extensive knowledge of the ANVIS HUD system.   Potential offerors will be responsible for turning the nonfunctional components received from the government into ones which meet the most current operation form, fit and function as called out by applicable technical data within a repair cycle time of thirty (30) days.  This effort also requires the maintenance of a parts inventory sufficient to support the aforementioned repair cycle time.  Depot Maintenance Work Requirements (DMWRs) do not exist for this equipment.  A complete technical data package was never procured and therefore is unavailable.  The Government will not provide any test equipment or facilities for this effort.  <BR><BR>Any interested sources must send the following information, NLT 15 September 2008, to C-E LCMC IEW-S Directorate, ATTN: AMSEL-LC-IEW-N-II (Adam Butryn), Bldg. 1201, Ft. Monmouth, NJ 07703 or e-mail to adam.butryn@us.army.mil:<BR>"	Identification of the contractor as a Large or a Small Business.  If a Small Business, please identify as an 8(a), HUBZone, Disadvantaged, Women-Owned, or non-disadvantaged.   <BR>"	Past Performance for these or similar items.  The contractor shall submit their part numbers, NSN, or nomenclature and the date of the last manufacturing effort of the same or similar items for which they have production experience.  Government contract numbers, if applicable, shall be provided.<BR>"	The contractor shall cite the quality standard (either Government or Industry) that shall be in place for this effort.<BR>"	The contractor must provide information to show that they possess, or shall possess, adequate experience, knowledge, production plant facilities (equipment, tooling, and space) to enable them, or their subcontractors, to support this item.<BR>All technical questions should be addressed to Adam Butryn (732) 427-1008, email address adam.butryn@us.army.mil.<BR><BR>EMAIL adam.butryn@us.army.mil<BR>

<DESC>The Army Space and Missile Defense Command requires performance of Scope of Work entitled Advanced Thermal Management of Data Processing Systems and Electronic Enclosures. The Government intends to award this effort to Digital Fusion Solutions, Inc., under Contract W9113M-07-C-0088 Modification P00015 under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1.  Digital Fusion Solutions is currently responsible for maintenance of configuration control on the affected enclosures and is the only source with access, via teaming arrangement, to proprietary information that is required to perform this effort and is available solely from Rocky Research. The Government has determined that award of this effort to any other source would result in duplication of costs to the Government and unacceptable delays in performing the effort. The period of performance is 24 months from date of award, expected in August 2008. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals to the U. S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command, P.O. Box 1500, Huntsville, AL 35807-3801, ATTN: SMDC-RDC-AK/Koger. This notice of intent is not a request for proposal from any source other than Digital Fusion Solutions, Inc.; however, all submissions received will be considered by the Government.

<SUBJECT>Request For Information (RFI) for the WMD Aerial Collection System (WACS) Advanced Technology Demonstration (ATD)
<SOLNBR>WACS08292008
<RESPDATE>100208
<ARCHDATE>10032008
<CONTACT>Russell V Kelley, Contract Specialist, Email russell.kelley@dtra.mil
<DESC>The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) is soliciting industry for information regarding WMD aerial collection, retention, and analysis technologies capable of providing an affordable approach to successfully demonstrating WACS to the warfighter community.  

Offensive operations against an adversary's WMD research and development, production, and storage facilities, and mobile WMD targets have the potential for creating collateral damage through the release of airborne WMD materials.  In addition to traditional battle damage assessment (BDA), the warfighter needs to be able to conduct effective WMD counterforce strikes, and then perform collateral effects and impact assessments of those strikes. Currently, the assessment capabilities do not exist.  WACS ATD is intended to address this shortfall. 

The WACS program will build upon the successful Chemical Combat Assessment System (CCAS) and Biological Combat Assessment System (BCAS) programs.  These programs demonstrated the capability to locate and track a post-strike plume and collect airborne chemical and biological materials from those plumes.  Ideally WACS will leverage these programs by integrating the ability to collect, retain and analyze radiological and nuclear material with the existing capabilities for chemical and biological collection.  These capabilities will be combined in a single collection device to be integrated with an existing unmanned aerial platform (specific UAV platform for ATD to be identified by the warfighter community).  Additionally, the WACS ATD may improve the WMD locating and collection solution by adding the capability for in-flight detection and identification of collected WMD materials. 

The objectives of the WACS ATD program are: 
1.	Locate and track airborne materials released as the result of a WMD counterforce strike.
2.	Collect and retain airborne material (particulate and gas) resulting from a counterforce strike on a suspected WMD target for further laboratory analysis and exploitation.
3.	Presumptive detection and identification of airborne WMD material in WMD counterforce post-strike plumes (chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear (CBRN) dispersed material).
4.	Full compliance of WACS Concept of Operations (CONOPS) with existing Department of Defense (DoD) CBRN sample handling, transportation and analysis procedures.
5.	Integration of WACS collector/sensor design with fielded UAS technologies and user CONOPS and Operational Plans (OPLANS).  To be achieved with minimum system engineering and integration issues as well as no impact to fielded UAS Key Performance Parameters.

Ideally, objectives 1 -3 will be performed by a single unmanned aerial platform.

Key Definitions: 
Locate – ability to find a rising plume or cloud resulting from an offensive strike on a WMD facility or a mobile target. 
Track – ability to follow the dynamic path of the plume over time.
Collect – ability to extract and retain an airborne CBRN sample sufficient for laboratory “confirmatory” analysis and exploitation.
Detect – Determine the presence or absence of airborne CBRN material by class (i.e. chemical agent vs. radionuclide vs. a biological agent, etc.). 
Identify – Determine the type of CBRN material (i.e. chlorine gas)

DTRA expects that the WACS ATD contractor will have responsibility for the design, development, and assembly and/or fabrication of WMD aerial collection and sensor payload.  There is a preference for integrating commercial and/or NDI solutions with fielded UAS technologies.  

The WACS ATD contractor shall have access to government identified technologies and data for plume tracking, WMD aerial particle collection, detection, identification and UAV decontamination.  However, contractors are encouraged to recommend and demonstrate their own innovative solutions where applicable.  
   
The objectives of this RFI are to: 
•	solicit from interested industry partners appropriate technologies of interest 
•	further refine WACS system and operational concepts
•	identify threshold and objective WMD aerial collection and sensor payload performance parameters (assume an ATD schedule of 24-months from a hypothetical program start date of 01 June 2009 and culminating in a demonstration at the end of the ATD)
•	identify key milestone events and high risk challenges during the course of the 24-month WACS ATD schedule.  

Respondents to this RFI may choose to address the chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear aspects of collection, detection, and identification activities, or any combination thereof.  WMD aerial collection, sensor and analysis technology maturity should be addressed at Technology Readiness Levels (TRL) equal to or greater than 6.  Additionally, the risk that related supporting technologies are immature or incapable of allowing successful demonstration and deployment should also be addressed.  WACS ATD concepts that require significant basic research (TRL equal to 1-2) are not desired.  

RFI responses shall be limited to no more than 14 pages, not including cover letter, cover page, and table of contents.  Responses should include, but are not limited to, the following: (a) WACS system concept(s) and associated performance, cost, and risk parameters; (b) respondent's stated assumptions; (c) technology maturity and TRLs; (d) WACS ATD cost drivers (not a ROM, but activities identified to consume majority of cost and labor resources) and any other programmatic and technical information respondents deem necessary to aid the government in its program planning, decision making and execution of the WACS ATD.  

Upon review of all submissions in response to this RFI, DTRA may schedule individual meetings with any or all respondents to gain further understanding into their specific WACS ATD responses.   

Responses shall be submitted no later than 5 PM EDT on Thursday, 02 OCT 2008 to the Defense Threat Reduction Agency, WACS ATD RFI, Attn: Mr. Russell Kelley.  All responses shall be transmitted electronically and should be submitted to Mr. Kelley at:  Russell.Kelley@dtra.mil.  Submissions shall be compatible with and accessible using Microsoft Office software applications.  

Additional Information:  A successful WACS ATD shall comply with the System Requirements Document (SRD).  A draft Systems Requirements Document (SRD) is available to U.S. contractors with a DSS-approved SECRET facility clearance.  Interested U.S. contractors shall submit proof of approved facility clearance via e-mail request to Mr. Kelley.  There is no commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation, to make an award or awards, or to be responsible for any monies expended by any interested parties in support of any effort in response to this RFI.  Any information submitted in response to this RFI is strictly voluntary.  This RFI is for information planning purposes and the Government will not pay or otherwise reimburse respondents for information submitted.  It is the responsibility of potential offerors’ to monitor this site for the release of any follow-on information.  All documentation shall become the property of the Government.  Unless otherwise stated herein, no additional information is available.  Requests for the same will be disregarded.

<DESC> Sources Sought – Laser Scanning Confocal Microscope

This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE to determine the availability and capability of potential small businesses (including HUBZone firms; certified 8(a), Small Disadvantaged, veteran and service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, and women-owned small businesses) that can provide the following: 

A commercially available laser scanning confocal Microscope for the characterization of pharmaceutical solids with respect to the thickness and volume of the particles. These properties are known to be important metrics by which to estimate performance of these pharmaceutical solids (e.g., dissolution or disintegration).  In addition, the ability to obtain three dimensional (3D) profiles, make thickness measurements as well as cross sectional measurements and, in general observe the three dimensional morphology of pharmaceutical solids, will greatly increase our understanding of how morphology affects physical properties.

Requirements of requested instrumentation:
Instrumentation acquired through this request must be able to provide true color rendition with at least 3,000X magnification with no preprocessing of samples.  Instrumentation must provide diffraction-limited height measurement (Z-axis or thickness).  Instrument must be capable of making height measurements on transparent films.

Included software must provide:
•	Profile measurements (height, width, angle of any selected cross-sectional profile) 
•	Roughness measurements
•	3D measurements (volume, surface area, surface area ratios, etc.) – must be capable of controlling viewing angle, lighting angle, zoom level and Z-axis height using computer mouse; must be capable of providing “textured” images to display surface roughness.
•	Comparative measurements (profile, roughness and 3D comparative measurements for same cross-section for at least two objects on screen).
•	Image “stitching” – must be capable of combining multiple fields of view into one image for examination of larger areas. 
•	Arbitrary setting of threshold for image binarization.

Deliverables:
Complete laser scanning confocal microscope including all light sources, optics, computer controlled stage, controllers and software to satisfy requirements listed above.  Installation, IQ, OQ and training.

Projected outcomes
Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM or LSCM) is a technique for obtaining high-resolution optical images. The key feature of confocal microscopy is its ability to produce in-focus images of thick specimens, a process known as optical sectioning. Images are acquired point-by-point and reconstructed with a computer, allowing three-dimensional reconstructions of topologically-complex objects.

Firms responding to this SOURCES SOUGHT announcement should indicate whether they are small business, the name, telephone number(s), e-mail address(es) (if applicable) of the point of contact.  This information will be used to determine the appropriateness and type of small business set-aside.  The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 454390 .  A fixed price contract is contemplated.  Qualification statements should reference Sources Sought No. 1049300 and are due no later than 3PM, September 3, 2008, local prevailing time Denver, Colorado.

<DESC>This announcement constitutes a Request For Information (RFI) synopsis. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. The following information is provided to assist the Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) in conducting market research to identify potential contractors to develop, test, integrate, produce, field and support Lighter Than Air (LTA) platforms/systems. Program Executive Officer, Strike Weapons and Unmanned Aviation (PEO (U&W)), PMA-262 (U.S. Navy and Marine Corps Persistent Maritime Unmanned Aircraft Systems) is the acquisition Program Manager for this potential effort. PMA-262 has recently been established and given the Navy charter to explore LTA free flight technologies in support of Navy missions. This RFI IS NOT for sensor/communication/weapon systems.

LTA Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) (optionally manned) have the potential to provide persistent Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance and Communications (ISRC) support as well as logistical support (manned) for tactical level maneuver/decisions and unit level low altitude air defense/force protection for Naval ships (multi-ship classes) and Marine Corps land forces. A notional ISRC system may include multiple air vehicles, one ground control station, multi-mission (plug & play) payloads, and associated launch, recovery, and support equipment with a 5,000 mi radius of action. A notional logistics system may include platforms with transglobal range (2,000 mi radius of action) and outsized payloads measuring up to 500 tons. These systems will support Naval missions such as building the Recognized Maritime Picture, Maritime Security Operations, Maritime Interdiction Operations, and support of Naval units operating from sea/shore in the global war on terrorism. The systems will also support Marine Corps missions such as close range UAS enabling enhanced decision-making and improved integration with ground schemes of maneuver. NAVAIR LTA interests include but are not limited to the following: conventional airships, hybrid airships, free floating balloon systems, and other High Altitude LTA systems. Additionally NAVAIR is interested in supportive LTA technologies to include but not limited to: buoyancy control systems, advanced/alternative propulsion/power generation systems, lightweight high strength envelope materials, vectored flight control systems, weather prediction/avoidance systems, lifting gas generation systems, unconventional landing schemes, ground handling, ship interface concepts, and LTA modeling/scaling methodologies. There are currently no Navy LTA CONOPS available for review. 

The following amplifying information is provided:

1) The sensor version has a
 
a. mission radius of 5000 nm
b. 2500 lbs payload threshold
c. un-manned semi-autonomous with remote pilot take off and landing
d. 16Kw power threshold
e. 7 days loiter at mission radius at 20,000 ft MSL is desired threshold.   
 
2) The logistics version would be manned and support for “drive on – drive off” cargo movement, operating from unprepared surfaces or from water (lakes, rivers open sea).

a. mission radius of 1000 nm
b. optionally manned
c. up to 500 tons
d. aircraft cargo movement should be compatible with Navy ship operations.  
e. carrier take off and landing is not required. 

3) The aircraft should be designed for fielding near term with first flight in 28 months.  

4) Operational Concept of Operation requires the landing area at the radius of action will use only indigenous support services.  

5) The aircraft must be able to take off and land from water, snow, sand, and from un-prepared fields with up to a 1.5 degree slope. 

The development of this aircraft should use OEM airworthy systems where possible. 

Recommendations:
Industry responses should provide a general description of the aircraft for the proposed solution.  These data should include:

1) General description of the aircraft and subsystems
2) Notational propulsion and control concepts
3) Concept of Operations, take off, landing, command and control.
4) Systems support requirements
5) Design materials and other technologies needed.
6) Identification of high risk development components and long lead components 
7) Design and sizing attributes that permit the Technology Demonstrator to be scaled for useful payloads to 500 tons
8) Technology Readiness Level (TRL) levels of each system
9) Time line to develop to first flight
10)Technologies that contractor has already risk mitigated

a. Notational risk reduction and verification plan
b. Notational R&M 
c. Notational cost per ton per mile for cargo mission

Although the exact number of cases to be processed in FY2009 cannot accurately be estimated, the Government expects action taken on 12-14 cases per day per person. This expectation is dependant upon the number of SORs and other types of correspondence required, or the equivalent of 42 weighted units per day.  Within these timelines CATS and JPAS shall be updated upon approval of action by the government adjudications supervisor. All service will be provided on-site at Central Clearance Facility, Ft. George G. Meade, Maryland. TS/SCI clearnace is required or the ability to obtain a TS/SCI clearance. Please address responses to jo.m.robinson@us.army.mil by 11:00am on the date mentioned above.

<DESC>The Central Region (6, 7 & 8), a military integrated delivery network, comprised of 42 Army, Navy, Air Force Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs) in the states of Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Idaho, Kansas, Louisiana, Missouri, Oklahoma, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, and Wyoming, announces a Request for Regional Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFRIAQ) for the standardization of Diapers, Infant.<BR><BR>The primary objective of this program is to standardize the quality of care across the region based on a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source(s) at the best possible price.  It is also intended that standardized products be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program.<BR><BR>The major facilities in the region include but are not limited to Brooke Army Medical Center Fort Sam Houston TX, Wilford Hall Medical Center Lackland AFB, TX, Darnall Army Medical Center, Fort Hood, TX, Reynolds ACH Fort Sill, OK, William Beaumont Army Medical Center Fort Bliss, TX, 10th Medical Group USAF Academy, CO, Evans ACH Fort Carson CO, Fort General Leonard Wood ACH, MO, Fort Riley, KS, 99th Medical Group Nellis AFB, NV, and Bayne-Jones ACH Fort Polk, LA.<BR><BR>This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP), Directorate of Medical Materiel and facilitated by Tri-Service Regional Business Office (TRBO).  In order to participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendors for the program.  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their products.  This RFRIAQ is a supplement to the Prime Vendor Program and is not a contract.  For additional information regarding DSCPs Prime vendor program please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil.<BR><BR>The resulting Regional Incentive Agreement (RIA) will be for a base period of two year(s) (24 months) from date of selection with three 12-month option periods (not to exceed 5 years.) Anticipated selection date is November 2008.  The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors.  Clinical/performance and technical/company factors will be weighted more heavily than price.  The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  The selection of a single vendor is anticipated.  However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Region, the Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs.  A multiple vendor RIA selection may provide the best-value, lowest overall cost alternative if: 1) The requirements of the Region for Diapers, Infant product line can be met in the most clinically effective manner by more than one vendor, and 2) The requirements of the Region for Diapers, Infant product line can be met with the lowest overall cost, by more than one vendor.<BR><BR>B.	Products & Performance Required.<BR><BR>The Central Region is seeking product line items in the category of Diapers, Infant, which at a minimum includes the high volume lines below.  Within this region, this product line has an estimated annual dollar demand of $65,603.00.  This forecast is based on historical prime vendor sales during a recent 12-month period.  The top high volume usage lines for this project are shown in the Technical/Company Criteria below.<BR><BR>At the request of the Central Region MTFs, vendors will provide on-site support and in-servicing during implementation, conversion information, prime vendor order numbers, and itemization of the brands, types and packaging information of the products supplied by the vendor if deemed appropriate for the product line .<BR><BR>C.	Instructions to Vendors.<BR><BR>Vendors interested in participating in this standardization initiative should email their detailed responses to the technical/company criteria and (1) Company name and address, (2) POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address) to the enclosed POC.  Submissions must be received by 3PM CDT on the specified closing date/time of this RFRIAQ.  Vendors that fail to meet this submittal deadline will be disqualified from participating in the standardization process.<BR><BR>This process will include vendor requirements to provide electronic responses to technical criteria, no charge samples for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price quotes.  Due to the potential for email to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the Region that its initial submission, quote and literature actually arrived at the Region via email.  Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.  <BR><BR>Responses should be sent to Mrs. Sarah Allen, sarah.allen.ctr@sa-msmo.tma.osd.mil address; Tri-Service Regional Business Office, 7800 IH-10 West, Suite 220, San Antonio TX 78230.  All e-mail communication between vendors and the region should be digitally signed.  Contact Mrs. Sarah Allen at (210) 292-3287 prior to the closing date of this announcement with any further questions.<BR><BR>D.	Evaluation Criteria.  <BR><BR>The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing body of the standardization process.  This board includes clinicians and logisticians from the Military Treatment Facilities within the Central Region.  They are the deciding officials for this initiative.  <BR><BR>Phase I Technical/Company Evaluation Process.  Interested vendors are to respond to this FBO announcement by emailing their detailed responses and required documentation to the POC by the required response date.  Vendors are required to meet/provide responses to the technical/company criteria stated below.  All technical/company criteria are weighted equally.  The responses will be reviewed by the Clinical Product Team (CPT) to determine the acceptability of each vendor.  After the review of the technical/company criteria, those vendors who meet these criteria will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation.  In general, acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria is defined as follows: (1) based on the vendors responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line of products and/or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products or services; (2) the vendors information provided is factually correct.  Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.<BR>NOTE: Specific technical/company criteria will require an additional, more-specific definition of technical acceptability.  The specific standard for technical acceptability will be set forth with the individual statement of each criterion, as required.<BR><BR>The following equally weighted Technical/Company Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative:<BR><BR>1. Vendors must provide a complete line of Diapers, Infant products.  A complete line of product is defined as the MTFs requirements for usage items in the product line.  Usage items are defined in the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor contract statement of work, as DAPA items ordered at least once per month, and at least one unit per order. At a minimum, a complete product line includes: Infant Disposable Diapers (814 pounds); Infant Disposable Diapers (16-28 pounds); Infant Disposable Diapers (2237 pounds); Newborn Disposable Diapers (up to 10 pounds); Premature Disposable Diapers (up to 5 pounds); Ultra Absorbent Baby Disposable Diapers (22-33 pounds); Ultra Absorbent Baby Disposable Diapers (27-35 pounds); Ultra Absorbent Baby Disposable Diapers (33-44 pounds).<BR>2. Vendors are to provide a complete list of items supplied (catalog, etc.) and product literature in response to this RFQ.<BR>3. Vendors must have a DAPA or be in the process of applying for a DAPA number for the Diapers, Infant product line.  Provide the DAPA number or proof of the application process with the initial submittal.  (Note that vendors that fail to have a DAPA or show a lack of progress in obtaining a DAPA will be disqualified.)<BR>4. Vendors must have a separate agreement with the prime vendor (currently, Central Region (6, 7 & 8) prime vendor is Cardinal Healthcare) for distribution in the Region.  (Note that vendors whose products are not available through the regional PV will be disqualified.)  Provide documentation of agreement with Prime Vendor.<BR>5. Vendors must submit discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative. (Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Note: Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.)  Vendors are to provide quote on discounts, when requested by the TRBO. <BR>6. Vendors must have a local vendor representative available in the region.  Provide contact information, i.e. name, address, phone number, and e-mail address.<BR><BR>Phase II Clinical/Performance Evaluation Process. Following acceptability of the technical/company criteria, the TRBO, on behalf of the CPT, will request product sample sets and/or literature from the product group to be sent to select MTFs for evaluation.  Vendors are required to ship their samples directly to the designated MTFs and will be allowed 14 calendar days from the date of notification to complete the delivery.  Samples and literature must be shipped to arrive at the MTF by COB, 4PM CDT, on the (14th) calendar day after the notice to ship.  Vendors failing to deliver the literature and product sample sets by the deadline will be disqualified from this standardization initiative.  NOTE: all vendors must send the TRBO verification regarding the quantity, products, description of items, and date of shipment from the vendor, anticipated delivery date and individual who signed for literature and product sample sets.  Specific MTFs will evaluate the vendors product sample sets against the clinical/performance criteria in a clinical setting using a Likert scale, with a one to five (1-5) rating.  The scale descriptors are: one (1)-not acceptable, two (2)-minimally acceptable, three (3)-acceptable, four (4)-more acceptable and five (5)-highly acceptable.  All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally.  The clinical/performance evaluation period will last for 6 calendar days.  The CPT has established a target threshold of 3.0 for the Clinical Acceptability of products for standardization.  The CPT will determine the actual Acceptability threshold for this standardization initiative at or near 3.0 depending on the location of any break in vendors average scores (i.e., a gap between vendors average scores).  In addition, the CPT may consider how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability target threshold of 3.0, in determining the actual Acceptability threshold.  Vendors scoring below the actual Acceptability threshold will be determined to be clinically Unacceptable, and will be disqualified from further consideration for this standardization initiative.<BR>To determine acceptability, a CPT comprised of medical professionals from multiple disciplines will evaluate the products based on the evaluation criteria below.<BR><BR>The following Clinical/Performance Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative: <BR><BR>Clinical Acceptability Target Threshold:  3.0 <BR><BR>1.  The product wicks moisture away from the body.<BR>	a.  This feature is required to prevent skin breakdown<BR>b.  This criterion will be evaluated in the clinical setting by clinicians routinely involve in caring for infants<BR>c.  Products will be observed for moisture wicking ability during the evaluation.<BR>2.  The moisture-proof outer backing prevents strike through is soft and protects clothes and<BR>      bedding form being soiled.<BR>	a.  Protects patients surrounding skin, clothes and bedding from being soiled.<BR>	b.  This criterion will be evaluated in a clinical setting by clinicians routinely involve in caring for infants<BR>	c.  Products will be observed for leakage and gaps during evaluation.<BR>3.  The product allows free movement.<BR>	a.  Clinicians require the product to maintain fit and form and not gap at the leg or<BR>                  waist to keep fluids and solids contained in the diaper or pad.<BR>	b.  This criterion will be evaluated in a clinical setting by clinicians routinely involve in caring for infants<BR>	c.  Products will be observed for leakage and gaps during evaluation.<BR>4.  The product is durable<BR>	a.  Product does not tear easily.  It protects clothes/bedding/equipment from being soiled.<BR>	b.  This criterion will be evaluated in a clinical setting by use of clinicians routinely involved in caring for infants<BR>     patients in a clinical setting.<BR>c.  Products will be applied and observed for tears during evaluations.<BR><BR>Phase III Pricing Analysis Process.  The Region intends to evaluate price quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best responses to all technical and/or company questions listed in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendors DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).  (Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Note: Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.).  <BR><BR>After the clinical/performance evaluation is completed and analyzed, all vendors in the clinical evaluation group who met the minimum clinical acceptability target threshold will be contacted to submit their lowest pricing quotes (as well as product cross-reference data) based on committed volume of 80% of the total Regional requirement.  Vendors will be provided 14 calendar days to submit their price quotes in a prescribed format via email.  Price quotes must be received by 3PM CDT on the 14th calendar day.  Failure to respond within this timeframe or failure to submit incentive discounts from their DAPA prices will result in the vendor being disqualified from further consideration/ participation.  <BR><BR>Clinical/performance and technical/company factors will be weighted more heavily than price.  The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two year (24 months) from date of selection with three 12-month option periods (not to exceed 5 years).  The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis: (1) Impact of RIA prices on the Region (Post-Standardization Costs).  This represents the new estimated annual cost or the total cost post standardization and includes the vendors products, and the products that could not be matched.  It reflects the amount the Region would pay the vendor using the RIA pricing.  (2) Potential Cost Avoidance.  Cost avoidance is calculated by subtracting the RIA price from the Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) price and multiplying by 12-months of usage.  This is included as a reporting Matrix.  (3) Impact of Unmatched Lines.  The unmatched lines make it difficult to compare the prices of the various vendors, because the evaluator cannot compare similar product lines for each vendor.  Those items that are considered in the high usage category will have a higher impact to the region for the unmatched product line and the end post-standardization costs.  (4) Consideration of SKUs by each vendor.  The Region intends to reduce the number of SKUs that must be handled per period.  Vendors that can supply the complete range of clinically-required product, without unnecessary numbers of SKUs for minimally-differentiated products, will be more likely to provide the best-value solution for the Government in this standardization initiative.  THE CLOSING DATE IS 23 September 2008 3PM CST.<BR>

<a href="mailto:pam.mondrey@va.gov">Procurement Analyst</a>
<DESC>The Western States Network Consortium of the Department of Veterans Affairs is contemplating a multi-VISN contract(s) for onsite document shredding to be performed to meet the standards of VHA Directive 6371 and NIST Special Publication 800-88, Guidelines for Media Sanitization. The contract(s) will encompass the regions of VISNs 17-22.  There will be multiple awards made based on geographic location.  The contract(s)  will be for a base period with four (4) one-year option periods to extend the term of the contract(s).  The magnitude of this acquisition is between $4 to $5 million and is subject to the availability of funds.  North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 561990 and a small business size standard of 500 employees are applicable to this acquisition.  VHA Directive can be found pasted here. NIST Special Publication 800-88 can be found at the following link: http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-88/NISTSP800-88_rev1.pdfThis sources sought notice is an important component of the contracting officer's market research efforts to gauge the interests and capabilities of small business concerns to develop an acquisition strategy to acquire double depth concrete lawn crypts that provides maximum practicable opportunities to small businesses, consistent with the policy of the United States Government.  The resulting market research will be used to determine whether any type of total or partial small business set-asides may be employed in the conduct of the acquisition.  In the event the acquisition is conducted using full and open competition, the Government contemplates including non-price related evaluation factors that will provide additional scoring for Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) offerors, Veteran-Owned Small Business (VOSB), and for other firms that propose to use eligible SDVOSBs and VOSBs in performance of the contract.Public Law (P.L.) 109-461, the Veterans Benefits, Healthcare and Information Technology Act of 2006, establishes a statutory hierarchy within VA acquisitions that places SDVOSBs and VOSBs, first and second, respectively, as highest priority sources and provides VA with extraordinary authorities to conduct set-asides for both types of business and under certain circumstances make sole source awards to these firms.  In order to be eligible for awards under P.L. 109-461, firms must be registered in the Vendor Information (VIP) Database and verified as eligible by VA.  Firms may register in the VIP Database at www.VetBiz.Gov.  In addition, large businesses may only take subcontracting credit under P.L. 109-461 for SDVOSBs and VOSBs if they are registered in VIP and verified by VA as eligible.Interested firms with the requisite capabilities and resources to provide these items must notify the contracting officer by January 4, 2008 by 4:30 p.m., Eastern Standard Time.  Interested firms should respond to the following:(1)  Has your firm, as a prime contractor, whether individually or through a formal joint venture or teaming agreement, or under subcontract to a prime contractor, provided document shredding for projects of similar size and scope (Government or commercial) within the last three years as described in the brief description of project above?

  automatically pipette low volumes of reagents that can dispense liquids
  volumes from nanoliter to microliters with high accuracy and precision for
  Real Time PCR assays.<span>&nbsp; </span>The automated
  liquid handler should be of small footprint and is required to perform sample
  transfers, reagent transfers, and basic pipetting functions for Real Time PCR

  EPMotion 5075 is a liquid handling robotic instrument/automated pipetting
  system used in molecular biology applications, more specifically in DNA/RNA
  purification and in Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). The following are
  critical components of the EPMotion 5075: 1) An integrated vacuum system in
  its platform. 2) The ability to use disposable tips for a range of volumes
  from 1ul to 1000ul. 3) Uses peltier cooling/heating devices (opposed to water
  baths). To ensure integrity of the experiments the lack of &ldquo;carryover&rdquo;
  contamination from sample to sample is paramount. The ability to use
  disposable tips over a wide range of volumes, the use of a &ldquo;water free&rdquo;
  environment for cooling or heating, and all necessary apparatus enclosed and
  integrated into the system&rsquo;s computer/operational components significantly
  reduce the possibility of contamination. </span><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;; color: black;">The

<DESC>The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), Mt. Weather Emergency Operations Center (MWEOC), Mt. Weather, VA 20135-2006, intends to negotiate with Communications Laboratories, Inc., for the procurement and assembly of new National Warning System equipment, and maintain, repair and refurbish existing Government-owned terminal equipment for the National Warning System.  The existing National Warning System (NAWAS) consists of 61 separate multipoint private line systems, one for each of the 50 states, one for each of the ten FEMA regions, and one overall control circuit.  Each of these circuits normally functions on a self-contained basis, but any combination of, or all of the circuits can be linked to transmit national warning messages.  The average number of drops on the most utilized state circuits is 36, ranging from a low of 6 and a high of 96.  All locations are linked to NORAD through the National and Alternate Warning Centers.  The majority of NAWAS locations are in dispersed, rural locations, and local telephone companies provide most of the over 1,800 circuit links.  Although NAWAS circuits are leased, the actual equipment is government-owned.  The government-owned equipment provides all the network signaling and governs all circuit configurations and warning signaling using the voice channel to carry all transmissions.  
The Government will ship the items to the Contractor manufacturing site for repair or refurbishment.  The Contractor shall repair and ship the equipment back to FEMA within 14 working days of receipt of the equipment.  The Government may require the Contractor to assemble, repair or refurbish any of the following types of NAWAS terminal equipment:  Model 207, Model 208, Model 209, Model 212, Model 204, Model 205, and Model 210.  This National Warning System requirement is considered to be a non-commercial service.  Interested persons may respond by identifying their capability to provide the required service, to include descriptive literature for their proposed service AND pricing.  Responses shall be in writing and sent to the address identified above, ATTN:  Mrs. Debi Foster, or facsimile to 540/542-2631, same ATTN line, or email at the address shown at the conclusion of this announcement.  Responses must be received 15 calendar days from date of publication of this announcement.  This notice is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received by the date identified above will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<SOLNBR>SBDM-25-2008
<ARCHDATE>09282009
<CONTACT>Yvette K Hairston-Mercer, Phone 202-305-3862, Fax 202-305-7358, Email ymercer@central.unicor.gov
<DESC>On June 26, 2003, the Federal Prison Industries, Inc. (FPI)  Board of Directors passed a resolution directing FPI to limit the application of mandatory source to products for which FPI’s share of the Federal market is less than 20 percent.   With the implementation of  Section 827 of the Defense Authorization Bill of 2008, the manner in which the Department of Defense (DoD)  procures from FPI has changed.   Section 827 requires DoD to use competitive procedures when purchasing a product for which FPI has a significant market share, and requiring DoD to publish a list of product categories for which FPI’s share of the DoD market is greater than five percent.  Therefore, Section 827 supercedes the 20 percent resolution  implemented by FPI’s Board of Directors and the Board of Directors re-evaluated the need for the resolution for DoD products that have been affected.  

This notice informs the public that based on the meeting on August 14, 2008, the Board of Directors  rescinded  the application of this resolution for  the following four FSCs which now fall under the recent DoD’s competition requirements for purchases from FPI: 

FSC 5995 - Cable, Cord, and Wire Assemblies: Communications Equipment
FSC 6020 - Fiber Optic Cable Assemblies and Harnesses

<DESC>The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is seeking Architectural/Engineering firms to submit a Standard Form (SF) 330 with licensed/registered specialty disciplines for projects that may arise in the immediate future to perform constructability review on construction document packages and inspect construction on trail projects at two sites at Ash Meadows National Wildlife Refuge in Amargosa Valley, NV.  The projects consist of road paving, parking lots, vault toilets, guardrail, picnic shelter, concrete walkways, boardwalks, benches, pedestrian bridges, and viewing decks.
Interested firms are invited to submit an application consisting of a completed SF-330, Parts I and II to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service by September 5, 2008.  If a project is considered under this request, Architect/Engineering firms that submit an SF330 will be ranked under the short selection process based upon the following criteria:
(1)	Professional qualifications necessary for satisfactory performance of required services;(2)	Specialized experience and technical competence in the type of work required (i.e. familiarity with desert environments, paving, wood and metal construction, construction logistics, sensitivity to National Wildlife Refuge habitats, pollution prevention, and waste reduction);(3)	Capacity to accomplish the work in the required time;(4)	Past performance on contracts with Government agencies and private industry in terms of cost control, quality of work, compliance regarding environmental specifications, and compliance with performance schedules;(5)	Location in the general geographical area of the project and knowledge of the locality of the project; provided that the application of this criterion leaves an appropriate number of qualified firms, given the nature and size of the project.
Firms that meet the requirements described in this announcement are invited to submit an SF330 by close of business September 5, 2008 to the Contracting Officer, Karl Lautzenheiser, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 911 NE 11th Avenue, Portland, OR 97232-4181.  If a project is considered, evaluation criteria listed above would be used under the short selection process to negotiate with the most qualified firm and if a fair and reasonable price is negotiated, a single firm-fixed price contact awarded thereafter.  If a project is considered and the USFWS cannot negotiate a fair and reasonable price with the highest ranked firm, negotiations would then commence with the next firm on the short selection list.
Technical questions can be addressed to Mari Jilbert at (503) 231-6144.  Contracting questions can be addressed to Karl Lautzenheiser at (503) 231-2052.

If this contract requires that any of the contractor's personnel must submit to a National Agency Check with Inquiries (NACI) background check, the Government shall bear the expense of that background check.  Contractor employees found in violation of this process will be immediately removed from Academy grounds, are subject to barment, and will not be allowed to re-enter until completion of the CAB process.  
(ii)  Convictions.  Based on the results of the background check, any felony conviction in the past ten (10) years shall constitute indisputable grounds for the Contracting Officer (CO), with coordination from the 10th Air Base Wing Commander, to immediately require denial of access or removal of the employee from the effort under this contract.  For felony convictions more than ten (10) years ago, the contractor may recommend the employee be retained on the contract.

(iii)  Warrants.  If during the course of the CABs processing, any contractor personnel are found to have an outstanding warrant, Security Forces may detain the contractor employee and may notify the appropriate law enforcement authorities.

(iv)	Barment.  Employees removed by the CO may also be subject to barment from entering the USAFA.  
(I)	Barment appeals are processed through 10th Security Forces Squadron Commander to the 10th Air Base Wing Commander who may rescind the barment and permit the contractor employee to work on the installation. 
(II)	Individuals have 30 days from the date of the initial contractor access denial letter to submit a justification in writing to 10 SFS/S5B, along with any notarized copies of court documents or other documents they determine necessary to rebut the disqualifying information.

	(1)  Added:  The contractor shall submit a letter to the CO specifying contractor personnel authorized to sign a USAFA Form 111, Application for Personnel and Vehicle Pass to Work Under Air Force Contract.  The contractor shall submit a USAFA Form 111 on each contractor employee requiring access to the installation to perform work cited in the contract.  All contractors require issuance of a CAB from the Pass and Registration Center (PRC).  CABs will be issued to contractors performing duties on USAFA as identified on the USAFA Form 111 and who require weekly access to the installation for a period of time exceeding 7 days.  If required access is less than 7 days, contractors are issued an AF Form 75, Visitor Pass.  CABs will be issued for a performance period not to exceed one year.  
 	(2) Added:  The CO, Contract Specialist (CS) or Sponsoring Official will endorse the USAFA Form 111 and the individual requiring the badge will hand-carry the original USAFA Form 111 to the PRC for processing.  Badges processed by contractors themselves will not be accepted.  Contractor personnel are required to prominently display their CABs in a visible location above their waist while visiting or performing work on the installation. The Contracting Office may restrict the contractor’s employees from accessing the installation(s) until CABs are obtained.  The CO will maintain a copy of all USAFA Form 111s accomplished for each contract for accountability of badges issued.
(c) During performance of the contract, the contractor shall be responsible for obtaining required identification for newly assigned personnel and for prompt return of credentials and vehicle passes for any employee who no longer requires access to work site.
(1) Added:    CABs shall be returned by the contractor to the PRC within 5 calendar days after the employee no longer requires access to the work site.
(2) Added:   Contractors are required to submit a letter to the CO immediately after employee(s) being terminated or otherwise leaving their employment on a contract.  The letter shall contain the names(s) of the individuals(s) with their social security numbers. The CO will endorse the letter and forward it to PRC.  The contractors shall collect CABs and return them to the PRC within 5 days.
(3) Added: At the end of each performance period (i.e. options) and at the expiration of the contract, the contractor shall submit a letter to the CO containing the number of badges issued on each contract, the names of the individuals with their social security numbers, and identify those badges being returned.  The CO will verify the names and number of badges on the letter utilizing their copy of the USAFA Form 111.  The CO will maintain a copy of the letter and forward the contractor’s original letter to PRC.  By endorsement of the letter, the PRC will notify the CO of receipt of all badges or of any discrepancies.  
(4) Added:  Denial of Access of Contractor Employees.  The Government reserves the right to deny access of contractor employee(s) for substantiated misconduct (has the potential to jeopardize the mission, put themselves or others at risk, etc.) or security reasons.  This action does not relieve the contractor from complete and satisfactory performance of the contract tasks specified herein.
(d) When work under this contract requires unescorted entry to controlled or restricted areas, the contractor shall comply with AFI 31-101, Volume 1 Air Force Installation Security Program and AFI 31-501, Personnel Security Program Management, Paragraphs 3.24 and 3.27.  
(e) Upon completion or termination of the contract or expiration of the identification passes, the prime contractor shall ensure that all base identification passes issued to employees and subcontractor employees are returned to the issuing office.

Proposal Evaluation

The Government intends to award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose proposal represents the best value after evaluation in accordance with the factors and subfactors in the solicitation.  In addition to price, when determining best value, the NLRB will consider the proposed approach to performing Video Conferencing Services, with appropriate consideration given to the following three evaluation factors:

•	Factor 1.  Technical
•	Factor 2.  Past Performance
•	Factor 3.  Price

Relative importance of the factors, in that, the Technical and Past Performance are equal in importance and both are slightly more important than the Price factor.  To receive consideration for award, a rating of no less than “Acceptable” must be achieved for all the factors.  Contractors are cautioned that the award may not necessarily be made to the contractor with lowest cost.

The Government reserves the right to evaluate quotes and award without conducting discussions, but reserves the right to conduct discussions with one or more contractors and request revised proposals.  

FACTOR 1: TECHNICAL. 

Technical approach will be evaluated based on the extent to which the contractor concisely and accurately discusses the nature of the services being requested.

a. Technical Excellence – The degree in which the contractor understands the technical requirements of the proposed contract; that the contractor thoroughly understands nationwide video conferencing Wide Area connectivity and bridging.  

b. Management Capability – The degree to which the Contractor demonstrates the expertise and ability to effectively manage and control the program.

FACTOR 2: PAST PERFORMANCE

Past performance shall be evaluated on a measure of the Government’s confidence in the Contractors ability to successfully perform and meet the objective, based on relevant contracts the Contractor has undertaken within the last 3 years of similar size and scope.  The following sub-factors will be evaluated: 

a. Quality of Product or Service – The degree to which the Contractor can show the ability to meet all service level agreements and ensure customer satisfaction.

b. Timeliness of Performance – The degree in which the Contractor meets established schedules or milestones. The Contractor will describe how it will staff the requirements throughout the life of the contract.

c. Cost Control – The degree in which the Contractor completes projects, etc, within the established cost estimate.

d. Business Relations – The degree in which the Contractor has the ability to maintain a professional working relationship with government staff, be up front with controversial issues even if they are viewed negatively and maintain a high degree of honesty and integrity.

In the case of a contractor without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Contractor will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.

FACTOR 3:   PRICE— Price will be evaluated based on competition, and information supplied in each proposal.  In accordance with FAR 52.217-5, the Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. Evaluation of options will not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).  The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the proposed line items or bottom line price is significantly unbalanced or unjustified.  The determination of Best Value will be made by comparing the differences in the value of the non-pricing factors with the differences in the discounted prices proposed.  In making this comparison, the Government is more concerned with obtaining superior technical performance than in lowest overall price.  However, the Government will not make an award at a significantly higher overall price to the Government to achieve only a slightly superior technical performance.  Overall price may be more significant as proposals are determined to be equal based on other non price factors.

This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of Niksun (NetDetector) servers and support.  The use of a brand name description is essential to MIRDs requirements, for the DoS network, established infrastructure, and scanning and vulnerability requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company.  DS/CS/MIRD has identified Niksun servers as a key component of MIRDs infrastructure. Equipment listed in the PR is required as it part of a more complex already established network. This is an expansion of the established architecture.  The 41 USC 253(c)(1), and FAR 6.302-1 are cited at the statutory authority.  As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractors unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet MIRDs requirements as a key component of the Intrusion Detection network already in operation.  <BR><BR>

<CONTACT>Craig M James, Contract Specialist , Phone 202-283-1196, Fax 202-283-4429, Email craig.m.james@irs.gov
<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This solicitation, TIRNO-08-Q-C1F35, is being issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ). Quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. 

Provisions and clauses in effect through FAC 2005-26 are incorporated into this RFQ. This procurement is unrestricted.  The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541511. The small business size standard is $23M. 


A.	Background 

EMC is the only brand that can satisfy this AMS project requirement.  The AMS project is a large EMC Documentum environment.  Any solution must be fully compatible with EMC Documentum.  The existing IRS Tier II SAN infrastructure is built upon EMC storage and SAN switch architecture.  IRS Target Enterprise Architecture Standards Profile (EA ESP) defines EMC storage devices for Tier II applications as well as EMC ControlCenter for SAN management and monitoring.  The EA ESP also defines Symantec Veritas NetBackup for backups, and EMC TimeFinder and SRDF for data replication.  Full compatibility with these Enterprise standards must be considered to be a critical component of any solution.  The Account Management Services (AMS) project office has a requirement for their Releases 1.3 and 2.1 EITE deployments for roughly 6TB of Storage Area Network (SAN) storage for their EMC2 Documentum applications.
	
B.	Objective 

The primary objective of this request is to install, configure and integrate EMC hardware and software into the IRS EITE SAN infrastructure in the CSC Maryland Technical Center (MTC).  

C.	Scope  

The AMS project requires upgrades to existing EMC DMX storage arrays in MTC to provide the required data storage.  The EMC DMX storage upgrade will provide approximately 6TB of usable primary storage to an EMC Documentum environment.  An existing EMC DMX storage array will be leveraged.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This solicitation, TIRNO-08-Q-SIC05, is being issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ). Quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. 

Provisions and clauses in effect through FAC 2005-26 are incorporated into this RFQ. This procurement is unrestricted.  The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541511. The small business size standard is $23M. 

A.	Background 

EMC is the only brand that can satisfy this DITE project requirement.  The DITE project is a large EMC Documentum environment.  Any solution must be fully compatible with EMC Documentum.  The existing IRS Tier II SAN infrastructure is built upon EMC storage and SAN switch architecture.  IRS Target Enterprise Architecture Standards Profile (EA ESP) defines EMC storage devices for Tier II applications as well as EMC ControlCenter for SAN management and monitoring.  The EA ESP also defines Symantec Veritas NetBackup for backups, and EMC TimeFinder and SRDF for data replication.  Full compatibility with these Enterprise standards must be considered to be a critical component of any solution.  The Wintel Hardware Refresh Project has a requirement for their upgrade of roughly 15TB of Storage Area Network (SAN) storage for their VMWare Infrastructure.

B.	Objective 

The primary objective of this request is to install, configure and integrate SAN storage and VMware software into the IRS SAN infrastructure in the CSC Maryland Technical Center (MTC). 


C.	Scope  

The Wintel Hardware Refresh Project requires additional EMC DMX storage in MTC to provide the required data storage.  The EMC DMX storage addition will provide approximately 15TB of usable primary storage to the Wintel VMWare Virtual infrastructure. The additional EMC DMX storage array will be leveraged so approximately 2/3rds of the space will be for Virtual Machines, whereas the remain 1/3rd will be used for VCB - VMWare Consolidated Backup.  

Successful completion of these tasks will require extensive background with IRS Tier II SAN design and implementation standards, direct access to EMC engineering and existing IRS configuration information held by EMC, and full unfettered access to IRS facilities and personnel.  The skill levels of the personnel performing these tasks must be Subject Matter Expert for the following functional skill sets: Project Manager, Solutions Architect, Technology Consultant, Implementation Specialist, and Customer Engineer. The personnel also must have in-depth knowledge for integration between DMX storage and VMWare Virtual Infrastructure. Extensive experience in integration testing with SAN and VMWare Infrastructure is essential.  Engineers with EMC Expert Certification are required as well as Wintel Certifications.
D.	See attached Statement of Work and Spreadsheet for specific tasks, maintenance tasks and additional line items.  

E.  Key Personnel Element

It is the reasoned judgment of IRS Tier II Enterprise Operations that only EMC personnel can provide the required level of expertise, experience with the IRS, and knowledge and understanding of IRS integration and operational standards.

F.   Period of Performance is 12 months from date of award the performance sites will be CSC Maryland Technical Center, 7900 Harkins Rd., Lanham, MD 20706

<DESC>B – NIST Technical Support Services for Accessible Voting Systems-Usability Performance, July 30, 2008 

This is a solicitation for commercial services prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Parts 12 and 13, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a separate written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation Number NB894040-8-05964 is issued as a request for quotation. This solicitation is set aside exclusively for small business concerns. The North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) is 511210.  The NIST has a requirement for technical support services for accessible voting systems-usability performance.  I. Background Information -Enacted by Congress in October 2002, the Help America Vote Act (HAVA) legislation gives the Commerce Department's National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) a key role in helping realize nationwide improvements in voting systems.  NIST's Information Technology Laboratory (ITL) is coordinating the agency's HAVA efforts through its expertise in areas such as computer security, laboratory accreditation procedures, and usability.  The HAVA created an Election Assistance Commission (EAC) to oversee voting standards work. Reporting to the EAC is the Technical Guidelines Development Committee (TGDC), which makes recommendations on voluntary standards and guidelines related to voting equipment.  The Human Factors and Privacy (HFP) Subcommittee of the TGDC focused on recommendations for the development of voluntary voting system standards and guidance in the areas of human factors, usability, accessibility, and privacy.  NIST is providing technical and administrative support to the TGDC.  The EAC adopted a new set of Voluntary Voting System Guidelines (VVSG) in December 2005.  The EAC asked the TGDC and NIST to develop a more comprehensive and re-organized version of the VVSG.  A complete draft of this updated version was delivered to the EAC in the summer of 2007.   NIST will address changes to VVSG as requested by the EAC after the public comment period.  NIST will also develop test methods for the VVSG and address technical issues as they arise during discussions with the TGDC and the EAC.

The TGDC has directed NIST to develop usability performance-based requirements in addition to design requirements under the guidance of the HFP Subcommittee.  Some of these usability performance requirements for the voter interface will take the form of benchmarks based on the results of research, which have produced usability metrics, a test protocol, a standard test ballot, and a controlled set of test participants.   Initial work at NIST has shown that this test protocol, the NIST Voting Performance Protocol (VPP) is a valid usability test and is repeatable.  The NIST VPP is intended to be a repeatable, controlled experiment. The goal is not primarily to provide a “realistic” measure of voting behavior, but rather to isolate and measure the relative usability effect of various voting systems – and this requires that all other potential variables be held as constant as possible.)  Finally, it is important to note that the goal of the benchmarks is to discriminate among voting systems to identify those systems with poor usability.  The NIST VPP and the derived benchmarks are intended for use by voting system tests laboratories to certify systems as meeting the requirements in the VVSG.

Other pass/fail performance tests for usability and accessibility in the form of tightly controlled usability tests are also under development.   The benchmark tests are intended to be applied to all voting systems, including accessible systems.  Preliminary investigations of the accessible systems have uncovered additional issues specific to voters with disabilities which point out the need to look more carefully at these systems and how they are tested.

II. Objective of this Procurement -For the most part, voting systems examined thus far were NOT designated as accessible voting systems.  Accessible voting systems must meet both the usability requirements and the accessibility requirements of the VVSG.  HAVA mandates one such system per polling place.  However, it is very important that the accessible systems for voters with disabilities also meet the benchmarks and to understand what other usability performance issues occur with these systems.  NIST has some preliminary data about performance, but there are many gaps.  The overall objective of this procurement is to obtain Contractor assistance to gather additional data on the usability performance of accessible systems using the NIST VPP and other methods and to determine what changes, to ensure that the VVSG has testable usability performance requirements for accessible voting systems.

In coordination with the NIST COTR, the Contractor will accomplish the following:
•	Identify usability performance tests for accessible voting systems for the Voluntary Voting System Guidelines (VVSG).
•	Design the protocols for usability performance tests using the VPP where possible.
•	Pilot test and collect data with tests participants with a range of different disabilities
•	Analyze the usability performance data to determine the potential of the performance tests for VVSG conformance tests. 
•	Identify future research to further enhance the usability performance requirements for accessible voting systems. 
In order to conduct this research, the Contractor must have the following the qualifications: extensive experience testing systems for accessibility, performing usability testing with test participants who have disabilities, knowledge of human factors, usability, accessibility, and statistical analysis,  some knowledge and experience with usability and accessibility testing of voting systems (or similar kiosk-based systems).

<p>INTRODUCTION:<br />The purpose of this work is to continue collaboration with officers in Puerto Rico in order to educate officers regarding regulations to protect the coral reef ecosystem. The project will use field activities at locations to be determined around Puerto Rico to reach law enforcement officers. During the field activities, distribute guides containing information on intervention procedures, managed species, and regulations for their protection produced in FY07 for use in the field will be used as part of the practice session. Officers in FURA's aerial, mounted, and marine divisions, the Ranger Corps of the Department of Natural and Environmental Resources (DNER) marine and education units, maritime units of municipal police, and the U.S. Coast Guard will be targeted for the hands-on training. Specific participants will be selected in collaboration with the appropriate law enforcement agencies and in coordination with NOAA Fisheries. This project is part of a multi-year effort to improve environmental enforcement, which is a focal area of the Coral Reef Task Force, as well as the Local Action Strategy developed for Puerto Rico. The project is part of the NOAA Fisheries Southeast Regional Office's efforts as part of the NOAA Coral Reef Conservation Program (CRCP).<br /><br />BACKGROUND:<br />The project is a follow-up to workshops conducted by NOAA Fisheries with FY06 and FY07 CRCP funds. Based on workshop evaluations, there is a need to continue this effort as well as to integrate other agencies with law enforcement responsibilities. NOAA Fisheries created, during the first year of the project and through collaboration with an interagency committee, a bilingual guide for law enforcement personnel that explains the biology behind the creation of laws and regulations related to the management of coral reef fishery species and their habitats. A shorter guide for use in the field was also created. The continuing workshops proposed as part of this work assignment will be used to distribute the guides during hands-on training activities for officers. This project is being initiated as a component of NOAA Fisheries' efforts on behalf of the Coral Reef Task Force established by President Clinton in June 1998 through Executive Order #13089. The Executive Order, identified as Coral Reef Protection, seeks to "preserve and protect the biodiversity, health, heritage, and social and economic value of U.S. coral reef ecosystems and the marine environment." <br /><br />SCOPE:<br />In order to meet the objectives of this work assignment, the contractor shall complete three distinct tasks: planning and coordination, completion of field activities, and final report. Short-term results will consist of the planning and completion of activities with officers around Puerto Rico. Long-term results will consist of an increase in public awareness of the importance of coastal resources through interactions with law enforcement officers and an increase in enforcement of environmental regulations. The project operation must be conducted in order to carry out the technical tasks described in this document within the established timeframe. The contractor must report any problems or complications that may arise during the realization of each task that could affect the timetable.</p>
<p>APPLICABLE DOCUMENTS:<br />Information regarding NOAA's Coral Reef Conservation Program and the Coral Reef Task Force can be found on the internet at http://www.coralreef.noaa.gov. A copy of Executive Order #13089 can be viewed at http://www.coralreef.gov/taskforce/pdf/executive_order13089.pdf. Electronic portions of the field guide developed by NOAA Fisheries for law enforcement officers in Puerto Rico are available for review upon request.</p>
<p>TECHNICAL TASKS:<br />In order to meet the objectives of this work assignment, the contractor shall complete the work in three distinct tasks.</p>
<p>Task I. Planning and Coordination of the field activities<br />Ia. The contractor shall develop a series of hands-on activities for law enforcement officers in Puerto Rico. Through coordination with FURA's aerial, mounted, and marine divisions, the Ranger Corps of the Department of Natural and Environmental Resources (DNER) marine and education units, maritime units of municipal police, and the U.S. Coast Guard, in partnership with NOAA Fisheries, the locations and personnel for the activities will be selected. Hands-on field activities will be the focus of this effort using the field guide developed by NOAA Fisheries containing intervention procedures. It is expected that a maximum of 30 people will attend each activity. NOAA Fisheries anticipates that participating agencies will be able to assist with logistics such as transportation of participants to locations and the use of vessels if necessary. Participants will also be expected to supply their own snorkel or other gear based on the type of activity. However, it may be necessary to rent additional equipment for specific activities. Activity participants will be selected based on the need to train officers in specific skills and the ability of the officers to participate in the activity. Thus, if an activity requiring snorkeling is selected, no one who is not comfortable in the water and cannot swim will be considered as a participant. Examples of activities include a field trip to a wetland to practice wetland identification and delineation and discuss potential interventions and a field trip to the coast to learn seagrass, coral and fish identification and discuss intervention scenarios.</p>
<p>Ib. The first step in planning shall be a meeting with NOAA Fisheries and its partners to establish contacts within each agency, discuss the purpose of the project, and begin planning the activities with an emphasis on interagency cooperation and coordination. In addition to the law enforcement officers, partners from the DNER Fisheries Investigations Laboratory and the Caribbean Fishery Management Council should be included.</p>
<p>Ic. The contractor shall follow up on the initial meeting with individual meetings, telephone calls, or electronic messages with the different partners and shall provide progress reports to NOAA Fisheries on a biweekly basis. The contractor shall also consult regularly with the work assignment manager to develop an activity series plan.</p>
<p>The final product of this task will be a final schedule with dates, locations and types of activities to take place around the island of Puerto Rico, expected attendees at each event (or at least an estimate of the number of attendees), and expected inputs in terms of collaboration from each agency such as providing transportation, boats, or other equipment necessary to complete the activities as planned. The workshops must take place around the island and can be associated with regularly scheduled training events or be independent events. The activity series plan will not be considered complete until it has the approval of the work assignment manager. A copy of the activity series plan shall be distributed to each partner agency with notes highlighting dates, locations, etc. when the agency is expected to participate and what the agency has agreed to provide transportation, facilities, etc. The plan should be completed by November 2008.</p>
<p>Task II. Completion of Activity Series<br />IIa. Once the activity series plan has been finalized, it is the contractor's responsibility to complete all arrangements and confirm all equipment and other items necessary to conduct the activities for each date and at each location agreed upon in Task I. Field guides produced by NOAA Fisheries shall be distributed during the activities and the activities should incorporate the use of the field guide. NOAA Fisheries will actively participate in all activities but will not be responsible for making arrangements for conducting the activities.</p>
<p>IIb. At least one-month prior to each activity the contractor shall provide reminders, both written and verbal, to participants and reconfirm all arrangements to ensure the activities run smoothly.</p>
<p>IIc. The contractor shall complete the activities as agreed upon with our partners and as scheduled in the activity series plan developed in completion of Task 1 with the participation of NOAA Fisheries.</p>
<p>IId. As part of each activity, the contractor shall ensure that participants complete an evaluation sheet or provide verbal evaluations depending upon the activity to determine the impact of the activity, additional activities the officers believe are required, and additional educational materials the officers believe are necessary for them to perform their duties during interventions or during educational activities.</p>
<p>The final product of this task will be the completion of planned activities and the distribution of the guides produced by NOAA Fisheries. It is expected that a minimum of 6 activities will be conducted around the island, although it is hoped that more activities can be accommodated within this work assignment as funds and timing allow. The final number and type of activities will be decided in Task 1 in coordination with NOAA Fisheries. The results of the evaluations of each activity shall be used in Task 3. All activities should be completed by June 2009.</p>
<p>Task III. Final Report<br />The contractor shall complete a final report detailing the results of the activities and evaluations, including participants' rating of each activity, identified needs for additional activities, and identified needs for additional educational materials. The final report shall be submitted to NOAA Fisheries in the form of 2 electronic copies and 8 hard copies. The final report should be submitted by September 2009.</p>
<p>DELIVERABLES:<br />Timetable</p>
<p><br />Task 1-3 4-6 7-9 10-12 13-14<br />1. Planning and Coordination of the Activity Series * * <br />2. Completion of activities * * * *<br />3. Final Report *</p>
<p>The deliverables for this project include biweekly progress reports, either verbal or written, submitted to NOAA Fisheries as part of Task 1 and an activity series plan approved by NOAA Fisheries in completion of Task 1; copies of written evaluations collected during activities in Task 2 as appropriate; and a final report submitted in completion of Task 3 in the form of two electronic copies and eight hard copies.</p>
<p>SPECIAL CONSIDERATION:<br />The contractor must carry out the work described in each technical task. The project must be completed in the timeframe stipulated in this document. If it is not possible to complete the project within the allotted time, it is the contractor's responsibility to inform the work assignment manager. It is left to the discretion of the contractor to subcontract professional services as necessary to complete the required tasks.</p>
<p>If the contractor is from outside Puerto Rico, travel costs associated with planning and completing the workshop must be considered in the project budget. If the contractor is based in Puerto Rico, transportation costs associated with coordination meetings, activity logistics planning, and completion of the activities must be included in the project budget.<br />Unless the contractor can demonstrate that partners do not possess the resources necessary to complete an activity (transport, vessels, equipment, etc.), rental costs for these items will not be authorized by NOAA Fisheries as part of this work assignment. The contractor should budget for the possibility of having to supply equipment such as snorkel gear or other field equipment to up to 10 participants in each activity in case all participants cannot supply these items in order to participate in an activity. However, NOAA Fisheries anticipates that coordination with our agency partners will enable sharing of resources such that equipment for each participant for each applicable activity will be supplied by the agencies participating in the project.</p>
<p>IT SECRITY REQUIREMENT:<br />The C&amp;A requirements of clause CAR 1352.239-73 Security Requirements for Information Technology Resources (October 2003) do not apply and a Security Accreditation Package is not required.</p>
<p>PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE WILL BE FROM DATE OF AWARD THROUGH 09/30/2009.</p>
<p>NOTE: THE ABOVE ARE MIMUMUM REQUIREMENTS.</p>
<p>BID FORMAT:</p>
<p>Provide itemized pricing as follows: <br /><br />TOTAL<br />Line Item #1- Planning and facilitation <br />of Activities with Law Enforcement<br />Officers in Puerto Rico as described <br />herein.

<DESC><p>The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic &amp; Atmospheric Administration, National Environmental Satellite, Data and Information Service (DOC/NOAA/NESDIS) intends to place an award on a sole source basis pursuant to FAR Part 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source to Texas A &amp; M University (TAMU) Research Foundation for continued research for the Enhancement of the Capabilities of CRTM in Atmospheres for the period commencing from time of award and continuing for a period of twelve (12) months. This is a continuous project from 2007/2008 research. The new tasks of this continuous project will be:
<p>Task 1. Compute the optical properties for non-spherical dust aerosols. Dr. Yang has investigated the effect of non-spherical dust aerosol on radiance. He found the effect is significant in the ultraviolet and visible spectra. The JCSDA needs those optical properties to support NOAA air quality applications.<br />Task 2. Effective truncation of the phase functions. In order to speed up the aerosol radiance computation, the truncation of the phase function is necessary. The TAMU team will generate the truncated Legendre coefficients for various multiple scattering streams (e.g. 4, 8, 16 streams) to meet different applications. <br />Task 3. A fast radiative transfer (RT) model based on pre-computed look-up tables (LUTs) for atmospheres containing one-layer clouds. The LUTs will contain the bi-directional reflection and transmission functions, local (or, planetary) albedos, and spherical (global) reflectances and transmittances of both ice and water clouds. The effect of the polarization configuration associated with the multiple scattering process on the LUTs will be investigated. Specifically, the effect of the polarization configuration of scattered radiation on the simulation of the radiance will be quantified by comparing the solutions based the full phase matrix and just the phase function. Furthermore, this fast RT model will be flexible for being merged with an infrared clear-sky transmittance mode.</p>
<p>For a fast radiance calculation, a LUT-based RT model can minimize computational demand and is practical for applications to satellite-based remote sensing. Task 3 is expected to require a significant amount of efforts, as the fast RT model should be well tested and validated after it is developed.</p>
<p>3.0 Suggested Staffing <br />The level of effort required is 1.0 FTE at ~87% level for 12 months. The individuals need<br />to have experience in light scattering, radiative transfer modeling of atmosphere and remote sensing field and must be familiar with computer languages such as FORTRAN.</p>
<p>4.0 Deliverables</p>
<p>Stage one: <br />1. The bulk optical properties of non-spherical dust aerosol, which are averaged over size distributions (data delivery).<br />2. The truncated phase functions and the corresponding Legendre expansion coefficients (data delivery and a truncation code enable the JCSDA to produce the coefficients from the data for USER specific application). <br />3. Fast radiative transfer model based on look-up table.<br />4. Relevant documents for the data sets.</p>
<p>5.0 Travel <br />Attend the annual AGU conference or JCSDA workshop to present the research results<br />This procurement is being conducted per FAR Part 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures (NTE $100k) NAICS code 541712. This is not a request for a competitive proposal. It is a notice of intent to award a contract for continued research. However, if any other interested party believes that it can meet the requirements, it may submit a statement of capabilities, which if timely received, will be considered by NOAA. The capability statement and any other information furnished must be in writing, and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NOAA to determine if the party can meet all of the foregoing requirements. Responses must also be accompanied by information that demonstrates that the quote meets all of the foregoing requirements. The determination to compete or not compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. The information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. All information in relation to this notice must be submitted electronically to Yolanda Jordan at Yolanda.jordan@noaa.gov by 3:00pm on Friday September 12, 2008.</p>

Within this overall USG strategy, USAID assistance will focus on the goal of advancing democratic and market economic reforms.  This focus will promote the development of sustainable social services and work on solidifying Kazakhstan’s role as an economic reform leader in Central Asia in order to broaden the benefits of Kazakhstan’s economic growth and energy resources to the other countries of Central Asia.

<DESC>The US Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity intends to issue a sole source purchase order to the National Academy of Sciences 211 Constitution Ave NW, Washington, DC 20418-0006, to facilitate the development of national disaster public health and medicine doctrine and system design and to develop a strategy for long-term enhancement of disaster public health medical capacity. The established NAS/IOM forum is designed to provide national leadership in coordinating the many ongoing efforts sponsored by stakeholders and to develop sustainable partnerships between the public and private sector so that communities are adequately prepared for natural or man-made catastrophic events.  The Forum will convene meetings two times a year to confer on subjects of mutual interest and concern and convene public workshops as necessary. The NAS/IOM will provide an annual report to the DoD summarizing the key issues addressed by the Forum and through workshops.  The NAS/IOM will ensure that focus is placed on DoD concerns in relationship to the National Response Plan/Framework. The Forum will also allow the DoD stakeholders to discuss primary issues, make assessments, discuss policies, and review outcomes that affect the force health protection of all active duty military members and assure that DoD beneficiaries continue to have access to health care during disasters and other catastrophes here in the homeland.  Any firm that believes it can provide the stated capability is invited to submit written notification to the Contracting Officer within three (3) calendar days from the date of publication of this notice. Supporting evidence must be furnished in sufficient detail to demonstrate the firms ability to provide the stated capability.  Information can be sent to the Contracting Officer at:  USAMRAA, ATT:  MCMR-AAA-P (Justin Pickett), 820 Chandler Street, Frederick, MD 21702-5014.  No telephone or facsimile requests will be accepted.  Responses received will be evaluated; however, a determination by the Government Not to compete the proposed procurement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. If no responses are received, USDAMRAA will proceed with the sole source contract.  Note 22 applies.<BR><BR>Sole Source Justification<BR>1.)  Authority Cited:  U.S.C.2304(c)(5) as implemented by FAR 6.302-5(a)(2)(i) -- Authorized or Required by Statute; Statute expressly authorizes or requires that the acquisition be made through another agency or from a specified source.<BR>2.)  Reason for Authority Cited:  This acquisition is being made from the National Academy of Sciences as statutorily directed by Homeland Security Presidential Directive #21, 6 U.S.C. 101.  FAR 6.302-5(c)(1)(iii)(B) specifically states the limitations of paragraph (C)(iii) do not apply when the contract requires National Academy of Sciences to investigate, examine, or experiment upon any subject of science or art of significance to an executive agency and to report on those matters to the Congress or any agency of the Federal Government.  The Homeland Security Presidential Directive #21 direct that the NAS/IOM be established for the purposes to facilitate the development of national disaster public health and medicine doctrine and system design and to develop a strategy for long-term enhancement of disaster public health medical capacity.  The NAS/IOM will be funded by multiple agencies to perform this task.  This contract will provide for the Department of Defense portion of funding for this task and purchase specific analysis and reports for use in the DoD Health Care community to prepare for natural and man made disasters.<BR>3.)  Efforts to Obtain Competition:  On the basis of the Homeland Security Presidential Directive HSPD-21, no effort will be made to obtain competition for this requirement.<BR>4.)  Actions to Increase Competition:  This is a one-time requirement and no future similar acquisitions are anticipated.  <BR>

Background

The NIST Center for Neutron Research (NCNR) reactor has been in continuous operation since it achieved initial criticality on December 7, 1967. The existing nuclear instrumentation is organized as three overlapping ranges of coverage, the Source Range, the Intermediate Range and the Power Range. The Intermediate and Power ranges were modernized in late 2004, and it is now time to replace the old Source Range equipment.

The current Source Range equipment uses 50-year-old technology. As a result of the modernization of the other ranges, the Source Range electronics takes up exorbitant amounts of rack mounting space needed for future overall control room upgrades, and utilizes high-power, inefficient power supplies that formerly powered the entire three-range system. Some components are no longer even manufactured, and many assemblies were essentially custom-built for the original National Bureau of Standards Reactor (NBSR). 

Objective

Replace the present Source Range electronics and mounting hardware with new, modern design equipment that is compatible with existing reactor controls and installed neutron detectors, and meet the specific performance specifications enumerated below.

Description

The Source Range nuclear instrumentation includes:  Two (2) boron neutron detectors, and two (2) coaxial cables that supply operating high voltage to the detectors from the Source Range electronics, as well as transferring the desired pulse signals from the detectors to the electronics for processing. The Source Range electronics consists, functionally, of two (2) separate, identical processing units that:

•	Provide high voltage operating power for the detectors.
•	Collect and process the detector pulse output signals.
•	Generate analog output signals representing the logarithm of the pulse count rate from the detector and the period of the detected pulse count rate.
•	Generate digital output signals representing analog signals that exceed adjustable setpoints for high period and for low count rate.
•	Generate a digital output signal whenever the electronics is not operational.
•	Accepts a digital input signal to turn off the high voltage supplied to the detector.

Additional, external electronics provides analog signal display and recording functions, combinatorial logic that processes the setpoint trip signals and provides reactor protective functions.

It is intended that the replacement electronics must be rack-mounted, first, in an interim movable short rack, so it can be stored outside the control room when not in use, and later, in the permanent electronics rack to be installed as part of a separate overall control room modernization program.


Specifications

Electronics unit must be mountable in a standard 19-inch equipment rack, and include pull-out slides with positive locks in the open, extended position, with screw slots for retention in the closed position.

Electronics must be compatible with a Reuter-Stokes boron-10 proportional counter neutron detector, model RS-P7-0812-117. Detectors have one (1) coaxial connector, type HN, used for both high voltage input and pulse signal output.

Electronics must include a variable-threshold pulse discriminator circuit to maximize neutron sensitivity in the presence of gamma flux.

Electronics must provide analog output signals representing Log Count Rate from 1 Count Per Second (CPS) to 1 X 105 CPS, and representing Reactor Period from -30 Seconds to +3 Seconds. Output signal may be a suitable voltage or current, but the most desirable  is “Current Loop” 4 mAmps to 20 mAmps; 4mAmps to represent 1 CPS and -30 Seconds, and 20 mAmps to represent 105 CPS and +3 Seconds. Corresponding front-panel analog and digital indications must be provided. 

Electronics must generate internal test signals for functional checks by operations and maintenance personnel.

Electronics must include circuits that generate alarm indications whenever the analog signals exceed specific, adjustable setpoints; a means of monitoring the two analog alarm setpoint values must be provided, preferably via the same front-panel indicators that display the operating signal values.

Electronics must provide dry contact relay outputs of dual Form C (DPDT) type for each of the three alarm conditions, wired such that the respective relay is de-energized upon loss of power, or whenever the alarm setpoint is exceeded (i.e.:  Count Rate > N CPS and Period is a more positive number in Seconds that the setpoint. In addition, the Channel Not Operational output relay must de-energize when the electronics unit is in any internal test mode, has detected any internal failure, or has lost power. Corresponding front-panel status indicators must be provided. 

Electronics must be powered by single-phase nominal 120 VAC line.

Electronics must provide detector high voltage from an internal HV power supply; HV range must be at least from 500 Volts to 1000 Volts, regulated.

Electronics must provide for a singe dry contact relay input to shut off the high voltage power output to the detector; high voltage must be applied to the attached detector when that contact is closed. Open-circuit voltage across the external contact must be less than 30 Volts.

(ii) However, a late modification of an otherwise successful offer, that makes its terms more favorable to the Government, will be considered at any time it is received and may be accepted. 
(3) Acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the Government installation includes the time/date stamp of that installation on the offer wrapper, other documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the installation, or oral testimony or statements of Government personnel. 
(4) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that offers cannot be received at the Government office designated for receipt of offers by the exact time specified in the solicitation, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the solicitation or other notice of an extension of the closing date, the time specified for receipt of offers will be deemed to be extended to the same time of day specified in the solicitation on the first work day on which normal Government processes resume. 
(5) Offers may be withdrawn by written notice received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers. Oral offers in response to oral solicitations may be withdrawn orally. If the solicitation authorizes facsimile offers, offers may be withdrawn via facsimile received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers, subject to the conditions specified in the solicitation concerning facsimile offers. An offer may be withdrawn in person by an offeror or its authorized representative if, before the exact time set for receipt of offers, the identity of the person requesting withdrawal is established and the person signs a receipt for the offer. 
(g) Contract award (not applicable to Invitation for Bids). The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offeror’s initial offer should contain the offeror’s best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received. 
(h) Multiple awards. The Government may accept any item or group of items of an offer, unless the offeror qualifies the offer by specific limitations. Unless otherwise provided in the Schedule, offers may not be submitted for quantities less than those specified. The Government reserves the right to make an award on any item for a quantity less than the quantity offered, at the unit prices offered, unless the offeror specifies otherwise in the offer. 

(i) Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) Number. (Applies to all offers exceeding $3,000, and offers of $3,000 or less if the solicitation requires the Contractor to be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database.) The offeror shall enter, in the block with its name and address on the cover page of its offer, the annotation “DUNS” or “DUNS+4” followed by the DUNS or DUNS+4 number that identifies the offeror’s name and address. The DUNS+4 is the DUNS number plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned at the discretion of the offeror to establish additional CCR records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see FAR Subpart 32.11) for the same concern. If the offeror does not have a DUNS number, it should contact Dun and Bradstreet directly to obtain one. An offeror within the United States may contact Dun and Bradstreet by calling 1-866-705-5711 or via the internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform. An offeror located outside the United States must contact the local Dun and Bradstreet office for a DUNS number. The offeror should indicate that it is an offeror for a Government contract when contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office. 
(j) Central Contractor Registration. Unless exempted by an addendum to this solicitation, by submission of an offer, the offeror acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee shall be registered in the CCR database prior to award, during performance and through final payment of any contract resulting from this solicitation. If the Offeror does not become registered in the CCR database in the time prescribed by the Contracting Officer, the Contracting Officer will proceed to award to the next otherwise successful registered Offeror. Offerors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423 or 269-961-5757. 
(l) Debriefing. If a post-award debriefing is given to requesting offerors, the Government shall disclose the following information, if applicable: 
(1) The agency’s evaluation of the significant weak or deficient factors in the debriefed offeror’s offer. 
(2) The overall evaluated cost or price and technical rating of the successful and the debriefed offeror and past performance information on the debriefed offeror. 
(3) The overall ranking of all offerors, when any ranking was developed by the agency during source selection. 
(4) A summary of the rationale for award; 
(5) For acquisitions of commercial items, the make and model of the item to be delivered by the successful offeror. 
(6) Reasonable responses to relevant questions posed by the debriefed offeror as to whether source-selection procedures set forth in the solicitation, applicable regulations, and other applicable authorities were followed by the agency. 
(End of provision) 
The provision 52.212-2 Evaluation—Commercial Items applies to this acquisition as follows:
 
EVALUATION—COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999) 
(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: 
a. TECHNICAL APPROACH: 
Sub-factor 1: The Government will evaluate the technical capability of the item offered to determine the vendor’s ability to provide the product meeting the USCG specifications. Vendors shall provide sufficient and detailed related information to clearly demonstrate the vendor’s capability to provide products meeting these specifications. 
b. RELEVANT PAST PERFORMANCE: 
Relevant past performance includes three (03) years experience in manufacturing and maintenance support of Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometers (IRMS).

Vendors shall complete the designated section of the Contract Data Sheets (Enclosure 1) for up to three of their most recently completed Federal Government contracts (not to exceed three years since completion) in which the vendor built and supplied an Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometers (IRMS). The Contractor shall forward the Contract Data Sheet to the contract specialist listed on the document with the offeror. The Contractor is NOT to fill out the questionnaire section of the Data Sheet. The questions provided are typical of but no limited to type of questions will be asked of the past performance source. If the vendor does not have any Federal Government contracts, then list state, local, or commercial contracts, in that order. Responses shall be brief and concise. Data submitted other than that requested on the Contract Data Sheets will not be considered.  Failure to submit Contract Data Sheets shall be considered certification that the Contractor has no past performance for the Government to evaluate. A vendor’s lack of relevant past performance will be rated as neutral. The Government reserves the right to contact references other than those listed in the vendor's proposal.

c. PRICE: The Government will evaluate the total overall price to determine price reasonableness. Vendors shall provide their total proposed price to meet the requirements outline in the specifications. 

Basis of Award: This order shall be awarded to the vendor determined to represent the best value to the United States Coast Guard. Overall technical approach is considered to be more important than past performance; however, technical approach and past performance combined are more important than price. As the technical evaluation scores converge, price may become more important. 

 (b) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer’s specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. 
(End of provision)

Enclosure (1) to COMDTINST 4200.14, NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS, is included.

  Enclosure (1) to COMDTINST 4200.14A
It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

The use of a brand name description is essential to the Governments requirements, Department of State infrastructure commonality, as well as IRM/EOCs operational requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company.IRM/OPS/SIO/ESOC has identified that Avocent KVMs are an integral component of IRMs Data Center Consolidation initiative. The equipment listed above is required to provide Keyboard, Video, and Mouse capability to users who wish to manage servers in remote department data centers. This equipment is also required because it is most compatible with the current VMware virtual machine infrastructure deployed at DOS.  The 41 USC 253(c) (1), and FAR 6.302-1 are cited at the statutory authority.As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractors unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the defined requirements as a key component of IRMs Data Center Consolidation initiative.   The requirement will be competed as the IT community responds to price requests on FedBid.

<p class="MsoNormal">The Epidemiology and Biostatistics Program in the Division
of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics at NCI is pursuing a research program on
the hormonal etiology of breast cancer including investigating the biological
mechanisms that explain the lower breast cancer risk in Asian women compared
with women in the US.
The purpose of this requirement is the research by establishing studies to
assess the variability in biomarkers in Asian populations, and in particular,
Mongolian women given their low breast cancer rates. Establishing a study in Mongolia
where currently there is little in the way of research infrastructure could be
difficult.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The purpose of this procurement is to collect questionnaire
and biological data for a study of premenopausal hormone and protein
concentrations in Mongolian women. This will be accomplished through recruiting
study subjects, collecting questionnaire and biological data and delivering it
to NCI, working with Mongolian authorities. Through evaluation of this
information, NCI hopes to collect the data necessary to address the issue of
whether Asian and in particular, Mongolian, premenopausal hormone
concentrations differ by migration status.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The Harvard School of Public Health Department of Nutrition
has already successfully pilot tested many of the components of NCI&rsquo;s proposed
study of premenopausal hormone concentrations in Mongolian women by migration
status, in the course of their own work.<span>&nbsp; </span>These include subject identification and consent, blood and urine
collections, biospecimen processing and storage and shipment to the U.S.
The contractor&rsquo;s representative, Ganmaa Davaasambuu, M.D., Sc.D. is a Mongolian
physician. In addition, she received her doctoral degree in public health from
the Harvard School of Public Health. Dr. Davaasambuu and her colleagues
traveled to Mongolia
in August-September 2007 to meet with Mongolian investigators to discuss and
promote the implementation of the proposed NCI study under separate contract.</p>

this research initiative.<span>&nbsp; </span>It is a
requirement of this procurement that the contractor speak Mongolian, have the
ability to form collaborations in Mongolia,
and have experience conducting epidemiologic studies in Mongolia. The contractor is the
