<DESC>Synopsis Description The Department of Energy (DOE), Ohio Field Office, intends to issue a sole source modification for interim requirements for a period up to twelve months pending completion of a competitive acquisition to safely and economically maintain and monitor the West Valley Demonstration Project (WVDP), and perform facilities operation and site support services which include the following: operate the Remote Handled Waste Facility (RHWF); characterize, process, package and ship for disposal legacy Class A low level waste (LLW) and waste generated as a result of other activities conducted under the Statement of Work; maintain and monitor facilities; and continue to store the high level waste (HLW) canisters in the Main Plant Process Building in a manner that is safe and compliant with DOE requirements. The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is Section 303(c) of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended by the Competition in Contracting Act [41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1)], implemented under FAR 6.302-1(a) which authorizes other than full and open competition when there is only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The present contract is with the West Valley Nuclear Services Company and is due to expire on December 31, 2004.  Site services need to continue without disruption in order to assure the protection of the workers, the public, and the environment.  The shipment of legacy Class A LLW and operation of RHWF are necessary to meet the requirements of the WVDP Act and maintain the qualified and experienced workforce. Therefore, this necessitates the award of a sole source modification/extension to the incumbent contractor, West Valley Nuclear Services Company.  The intent of this sole source procurement is to provide the necessary site services from January 1, 2005 for up to 12 months until award and transition to competitive contract(s) for site services occurs.  THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS OR AN INVITATION FOR BIDS. THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT ANTICIPATE RECEIVING RESPONSES TO THIS NOTICE OF A NON-COMPETITIVE ACTION. IF PARTIES CHOOSE TO RESPOND, ANY COST ASSOCIATED WITH THE PREPARATION AND SUBMISSION OF DATA OR ANY OTHER COSTS INCURRED IN RESPONSE TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT ARE THE SOLE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE RESPONDENT AND WILL NOT BE REIMBURSED BY THE GOVERNMENT. Interested parties believing they have all the capabilities described above may submit capability statements to be received within five days of publication of this notice.

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.
The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Office of Acquisitions (OA) DERA, for the Office of Clinical Affairs (OCA Institute Review Board (IRB) intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive sole source basis to IMEDRIS Data Corporation, Integrated Medical Research Data, 621 E Carnegie Dr., Suite 180, San Bernardino, California 92408.  

The items to be purchase are: Item (1)  IMEDRIS Review Board, quantity one (1) each,  the system  consists of the following specifications: Review Board Assistant? - web-based, integrated Review Board module giving shall give the site ability to run electronic IRB-only meetings, accept electronic submissions and the ability to monitor study compliance.  Generate the IRB, outcome letters and consent form difference.  Configuration of 1 IRB review board and up 2 IRB subcommittees must be included with the proposal. Additional review boards must be allowed to be created and added to the workflow.

Study Assistant?(partial) - a web-based module which gives the OCA and IRB the ability to electronically capture and submit all study  related forms and applications for research.  Configure submission routing, key study personnel training and submission sign-off, study status, correspondence with the review boards and fellow researchers.  

Item (2) Scientific Review  web-based, integrated Review Board module giving the OCA and IRB site the ability to conduct electronic review and meetings for a scientific committee.  Accept electronic submissions via an integrated workflow.  Generate meeting minutes, and outcome letters and reviews summarize through this module.  View submission history and outcome from other review boards integrated with your application (IRB).

Item (3) Level 2:  Configuration Options: Requires an implementation team with hands on involvement with iMedRIS to walk the researchers through the process of configuring the software.  Weekly half hour team meetings are included, access to a customer server is required to check progress and help with any specific issues.

Item (4) User/Technical Support
Technical and customer service support and upgrades shall be included for the first year, with the purchase of the Site Assistant software.   The technical/customer service support contract will be 15% of the total contract price, after the first year.  This contract includes all upgrades/ enhancements, customer service and licensing agreements for a one year period from the date that the software is installed and/or made available to the customer.  Upgrades and enhancements to be no less then twice a year.  After a 24-month period, Licensor may increase the maintenance  service fee by an amount not to exceed the Consumer Price Index or 5%, whichever is less.

The sole source determinations are based on the fact that the  NHLBI Office of Clinical Affairs (OCA) and Institute Review Board (IRB) manages the involvement of patient research, which requires many levels of approval and oversight.  It is required for the investigators to create and submit a proposed protocol consent forms and an NIH study application (NIH-1195).  During the review  and approval process, they may be required to submit additional documents, such as radiation safety approval or investigational new drug forms.  Once the proposed protocol package is assembled, it is submitted for review and forward to the IRB for possible approval.  Approval is contingent upon meeting stipulations from the IRB. During this process, many people may be involved with reviewing, validation and verifying the documents which make up the protocol submission. The iRIS  Enterprise software solution has already been implemented by a number of Institutes here at NIH, NCI and NIAID.  Prior to the initial implementation the Institutes went through preliminary configurations and engaged iMedRIS to make change to the software required for it to be useful at NIH.  Institutes that implement the iRIS software in the future will be able to leverage the time and effort that NCI and NIAID have already invested in making this software compatible with patient research requirements at NIH.  While iRIS software is an ?out of the box? solution, it will require time for administrative and technical personnel to configure it to the specific business practices, and for the NHLBI specific forms that are to be used.  Based on NCI?s experience, it is estimated there would be a three (3) month configuration period before the initial implementation. The current application in use at NHLBI requires substantial amount modifications and is not compatible with software in use at NCI and NIAID. Therefore, to  
 conduct an award to any other source would result in a substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.  The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct future competitive procurement.  


The acquisition is being conducted under simplified acquisition, commercial item procedures, and is exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this requirement. Responses to this announcement, referencing synopsis number ?NHBLI-PB-(HL)-2007-009-DDC? may be submitted to the National,  Heart, Lung and Blood Institute,  Operations Acquisition, Procurement Branch, 6701 Rockledge Drive, Suite 6042,  Bethesda, MD 20892-7902,  Attention: Deborah Coulter. Fax quotations will only be accepted if dated and signed by an authorized company representative.

(B) Allow for the collection of Stormwater Runoff from the newly paved area.   The Contractor shall:  (1)  Grade and trench the site as necessary so that the pavement can be installed.  Approximately 2300 sq ft will need to be graded.  There are remnants of existing pavement under much of this area. Where possible, grading should adhere to current grade.   (2)  A 10 ft wide, 140 ft long vehicle access run of hot mix asphalt of parking lot grade is required from the end of the existing road to the greenhouse.  This should be straight as possible given the layout of the facility. In addition, asphalt shall be used to connect the concrete pavement in front of the high bay to the new strip of asphalt.  Two 4 ft walkways are required and pavement should abut ramp for handicap access by back stairs.  To connect the existing parking lot to the high bay and laboratory, additional sections of asphalt are anticipated.  The Drawing provided with the solicitation provides a proposed layout.  This drawing is only partially to scale.  Total estimated area of coverage is approximately 2300 sq ft.   (3)  Curbs or an appropriate alternative are to be provided at grade of pavement to keep asphalt from spreading and cracking.  Curbing at grade level with pavement will be required around the 20 ft section leading to the parking lot due to the change in slope.  Surface drainage shall be routed to collect in three central locations and away from walkways. Upon completion of each task identified above the EPA Project Officer will inspect the work for acceptance. A firm-fixed price contract is anticipated.  Contract award will be made using best value methodology.  Two (2) evaluation factors will be used: Past Performance and Price.  Past Performance and Price are approximately equal in importance.  The anticipated contract performance period is four (4) months after receipt of the notice to proceed.  The estimated price of the work is between $25,000 and $100,000.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by the Agency.  All prospective offerors are required to be registered in the Central Contractor Registration system in order to be eligible for contract award.  See the website www.ccr.gov for information about registration. PROPOSALS ARE DUE BY WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 22, 2006.  No hard copies of the solicitation will be provided.

<DESC>The General Services Administration (GSA) is soliciting a need to provide the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) support for IT related equipment which processes specific earth satellite data.  The equipment is referred to as the Topside Ionospheric Plasma Monitor sensor (acronym SSIES-3) aboard the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) spacecrafts S16 through S20.

The SSIES-3 measures the ion/electron density (ni and ne), variations in the ion density (ni) along the spacecraft path down to a scale size of 10m, the ion and electron temperature (Ti and Te), the portion of the thermal ion population composed of hydrogen (H+), helium (He+) and oxygen (O+) ions, and the ions bulk motion relative to Earth's surface.

The system consists of the ion retarding potential analyzer (RPA), the ion drift meter (DM), the total ion trap (SM), and the spherical electron sensor (EP), the sensor potential control system (SENPOT), the Main Electronics Package (MEP), and the DMS electronics package.  The SSIES-3 sensors have been built by University of Texas at Dallas and previously delivered to the DMSP System Program Office (SPO) and integrated onto the DMSP spacecraft.

The purpose of this acquisition is to provide the AFRL with pre-launch field support and sensor launch-readiness assessments for the Topside Ionospheric Plasma Monitor sensor (SSIES-3) aboard the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP).  Prior to DMSP launch, the SSIES-3 requires storage maintenance, calibration checking, sensor repair if necessary, and launch integration and support.  

The solicitation will issue on or about November 17, 2006 and will be issued through FedBizOpps at fedbizopps.gov.    Hardcopies of the RFP will not be available. Offerors are responsible for downloading their own copy of the solicitation and any amendments.

Veterans may be transported to and from their residence per requests received from the above listed authorized VAMC Manchester employees. Physically, this may require assistance for the veteran to get in and out of the vehicle; loading wheelchairs, personal belongings, ect. This may entail waiting and staying with a veteran who may be confused. On and off tour hours may be requested to deliver and pick up lab specimens, blood or pharmaceutical products, or other miscellaneous items. Number Of Patients-It is important that only one patient be transported on a trip unless specifically authorized by the Government. When travel beyond the city limits is involved, the longest distance over which a patient is transported may be claimed should more than one patient be transported at one time. It is the duty of the contractor to ensure that pickups and dropoffs are scheduled so that the distance traveled will result in a most economical charge to the  Government. Waiting Time-For time lost in waiting at either end or both ends of a trip due to causes beyond the drivers control, the Contractor  will be reimbursed at the rate of one-fourth the hourly rate quoted in his bid for each quarter hour from the time he reports to the designated person. If the pick up is at a place other than the VA Medical Center, the contractor can call the designated employee or travel clerk on duty as soon as they believe the pick up will be made and any waiting time involved. The sole purpose of this is to verify arrival time at these pickup points should the contractor request reimbursement for waiting time. Request For Services-It is requested that calls for service be received by a person and not an answering machine. Response Time- it is important that the contractor respond to all calls within 30 minutes after receiving a call from this station. For emergencies, it is requested that contractor respond within 20 minutes. Should the contractor fail to respond in time-the Government can call another company and charge the contractor the difference. Toll Charges-It is understood and agreed that prices quoted in the contract do not include charges for ferry, bridge, tunnels or toll charges, Any legitimate charges incurred shall be listed separately on the Contractors invoices. City Limits-For the purpose of this contract, city limits are defined as a file mile radius of this medical center Vehicles and Drivers-All vehicles used in the performance of this contract must be licensed and meet all minimum vehicle requirements as mandated by NH Dept. Of Transportation or all Federal Specifications for taxis. All units must be clean, air conditioned, heated and smoke free. All drivers must have all updated licenses and permits.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>As authorized in 49 U.S.C.  30168, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) of the U. S. Department of Transportation is authorized to procure motor vehicles for research and testing purposes.  NHTSA's Vehicle Research and Test Center (VRTC), located in East Liberty, Ohio will competitively procure vehicles from commercial motor vehicle dealers located in reasonable proximity to the VRTC to reduce transportation/delivery charges and to expedite delivery. Reasonable proximity will be determined on an individual requirement basis in order to facilitate the current requirement for vehicle research and testing being conducted by the VRTC.  Passenger motor vehicles through large heavy truck motor vehicles may be required to facilitate VRTC's needs through the end of FY 2007.  Because competitive procedures will be used to meet these requirements, no further synopsis for vehicles with a purchase price over $25,000.00 will be issued.  This announcement is for information purposes only. Commercial motor vehicle dealers in the East Liberty, Ohio area wishing to be notified when a specific requirement is identified should contact Robin Esser, Contracting Officer at (937) 666-4511, ext. 213 or robin.esser@nhtsa.dot.gov.

This requirement was previously announced under Solicitation No. 07SP408172.  The Bureau of Reclamation intends to award a construction contract to overlay the Deer Creek Dam Spillway Chute with a reinforced concrete slab.  The requirement is being procured in accordance with Part 15 of the Federal Acquisition Regulations as a Request for Proposals. Deer Creek Dam is a zoned earth and rockfill embankment with a structural height of 235 feet and a crest length of 1,304 feet.  It impounds the 152,700 acre Deer Creek Reservoir, a source of culinary, municipal, and irrigation water for both Salt Lake and Utah Counties.  The dam's 700-foot long reinforced concrete spillway is located on the right abutment and is controlled by two 21-foot wide by 20-foot high radial gates. The principal features of the work include the following: 1.  Construction of a reinforced concrete overlay within the spillway chute. 2.  Installation of grouted anchors and dowels in the chute floor slabs and walls. 3.  Installation of hydrophilic and PVC waterstops at concrete joints. 4.  Preparation of existing concrete surfaces to accept concrete overlay. 5.  Removal of existing concrete at upstream and downstream ends of overlay. 6.  Unwatering spillway chute and stilling basin to allow placement of concrete overlay. 7.  Construct and remove downstream cofferdam.  Cleaning and removal of debris from stilling basin. Critical items of work include placing a large quantity of concrete to strict Reclamation standards, and effectively removing seepage water from the stilling basin.

<DESC>PLEASE NOTE THE FOLLOWING EXTRA INFO RE: INDUSTRY DAY Oct 24 2006 9:00 -- 11:00 Gordon Conference Center:  
In the announcement for Industry Day, the instructions said the parking shuttle from the Raytheon parking lot would drop Offerors off at the LA AFB front gate.  This has been changed.  For safety reasons, the shuttle will bring you onto base to its regular parking lot drop off by Bldg 271.  There our government escorts will bring you to the Gordon Conference Center.

INDUSTRY DAY PARKING INFORMATION:     All participants in the Global Positioning System Wing (GPSW) Systems Engineering and Integration (SE&I) Industry day on 24 October 2006 at the Los Angeles Air Force base, Gordon Conference Center, Bldg 270, 483 North Aviation Blvd., El Segundo, CA 90245-2808 should park at the Government-leased parking lot located at the Raytheon facility at El Segundo Blvd. and Sepulveda Blvd.     Attendees should be at the parking lot by 0830 to allow for adequate time for shuttle transportation to Los Angeles Air Force Base.     The Raytheon facility may be accessed from any entry along El Segundo Blvd. or the west gate off of South Hughes Way and Sepulveda Blvd. (see accompanying area map at the end of this synopsis for further directions).     Once on the Raytheon facility follow the white signs that say, ?LA AFB Parking? to the Los Angeles Air Force base parking area.     Participants should take the Aerospace B route Shuttle to the Los Angeles Air Force base.     The Aerospace B route Shuttle runs continuously every 10 minutes to and from the Los Angeles Air Force base. 


INDUSTRY DAY:  An industry day will be conducted at the Los Angeles Air Force Base, Gordon Conference Center, Bldg 270, 483 North Aviation Blvd., El Segundo, CA 90245-2808 on 24 October 2006, 0900 - 1100 hours for the purpose of discussing the DRAFT Request for Proposal (RFP) [RFP # FA8807-06-R-0003] and answering questions regarding the Systems Engineering and Integration (SE&I) effort.  This industry day will be a general session for all the participants.  One-on-one sessions will not be provided.

<DESC>AMENDMENT 0002 is as follows: Crane Division, Naval Surface Warfare Center has a requirement for Laser Range Finder and Designating Systems, In Accordance With (IAW) a Statement of Work and Performance Specification.  This acquisition is for a transition product that moves the older Special Operations Forces Laser Marker (SOFLAM) technology based on “flash lamp” resonators to “diode” pump resonators technology to take advantage of energy, weight, and size improvements from that technology. This product will become the baseline for a phase approach into the next generation of SOFLAM as it becomes defined under the program name Special Operations Forces Laser Rangefinder Designator (SOFLRD). To the extent possible (without redesign of present production products) proposed product’s components (i.e. resonator, electronics, optics, etc) should be reusable for future phases of the SOFLRD as it becomes defined for repackaging and/or technology improvements. Since the systems that will be acquired through this solicitation will form the basis for a phased approach into the SOFLRD program, the Government intends to acquire data rights to the systems.  The Government will require prospective vendors to address their willingness to provide data rights to the Government.  The Government will also request that prospective vendors describe the ability of their systems to be utilized in future program phases to incorporate geo-location capabilities.   Systems that are proposed by vendors should be production ready systems.  This requirement addresses current Governments needs.  This is not an R&D effort.  Proposed systems should meet the minimum requirements of the SOFLAM/SOFLRD Performance Specification and the production goals of the SOFLAM/SOFLRD Statement of Work.     A 5-year, IDIQ contract is anticipated.     CLIN 0001 will be for a minimum quantity of 4 each Systems and a maximum quantity of 940 each, step-ladder quantity of 5, 25, 50, 100, and 200+ will be solicited.  The Government will also request that the vendor provide other price break points for quantities below 50 if available.  CLIN 0002 will be for Provision Item Orders, NTE $500K.  FOB Destination NSWC Crane, Inspection will be at Source, and Acceptance will be at Destination; UID labeling is required.     Delivery schedule will be established on individual delivery orders, delivery lead-time within 10 months of effective date of order, to continue at a rate of up to proposed maximum monthly rate.  Offerors will be required to submit a product sample, as well as technical, past performance, and price proposals.     Award will be made on a best-value basis.  All changes to the requirement that occur prior to the closing date will be posted to Crane web site, FedBizOpps and N!  ECO.     It is expected the solicitation is to be posted on or about 16 November 2006 to the NSWC Crane web site at www.crane.navy.mil.     No hard copies will be provided.     All responsible sources may submit an offer that will be considered.     It is the responsibility of interested vendors to monitor the Crane web site, FedBizOpps and/or NECO for amendments that may be issued to this solicitation.     For changes made after the closing date, only those offerors that provide a proposal will be provided any changes/amendments and considered for future discussions and/or award.     Questions should be directed to:    Marlene Siddons, Code 0565ZS, telephone 812-854-3856,  fax 812-854-5066, or e-mail marlene.siddons@navy.mil .

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS
FOR SMALL BUSINESS IN SUPPORT OF AIR FORCE RESEARCH LABORATORY SUPPORT OF TOPSIDE IONOSPHERIC PLASMA MONITOR SENSOR ABOARD THE DEFENSE METEOROLOGICAL SATELLITE PROGRAM 
                                                                  The General Services Administration, under a Memorandum of Understanding with the United States Air Force, Air Force Research Laboratory, is seeking sources to provide services supporting the Topside Ionospheric Plasma Monitor Sensor Aboard the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (SSEIS-3) The GSA is soliciting interest for a competitive acquisition from qualified contractors.  The purpose of publicizing notices for potential actions is to increase competition, to broaden industry participation in meeting Government requirements, and to assist small businesses in general in obtaining contracts and subcontracts.

This is not a Request for Quote (RFQ).  Rather, this Notice is one market research tool to determine the availability and adequacy of all potential sources, with specific interest in Small Businesses.  

The Small Business Administration (SBA) uses the NAICS Codes to establish size standards on an industry-by-industry basis.  The NAICS code for this program is NAICS 541990: All Other Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services. This size standard for this code is based on average annual receipts of $6,500,000.00 for three (3) most recent completed fiscal years.

The purpose of this announcement is to generate responses from Small Businesses under the NAICS set forth in the immediately preceding paragraph to determine whether the Request for Proposal should be amended as a Total Small Business Set-Aside in accordance with FAR Part 19. 

This Sources Sought Synopsis Notice is issued along with a DRAFT Statement of Work.  The Request for Proposal will be published in FedBizOps on or about November 17, 2006. As stated above, if a sufficient number of Small Businesses (according to the NAICS code assigned to this procurement) express an interest after reading and contemplating the DRAFT Request for Proposal, the Government may restrict competition of the procurement to Small Businesses under the NAICS assigned to this procurement. 
     
Small Business interested in this procurement should provide a response to this Notice.  The response must indicate the level of the contractor?s interest (likelihood you intend to submit a proposal as a prime contractor), potential teaming arrangement if likely to submit a proposal, and contractor qualification information relevant to the Request for Quote.  A brief description of Past Performance information as a prime contractor or a subcontractor providing details is especially important because Past Performance is a significant evaluation factor of the Request for Proposal.  

If an insufficient number of small businesses respond, or if the responses do not indicate small businesses are capable of performing, the solicitation (RFP) may issue unrestricted, i.e., under Full and Open competition.  However, small businesses are not precluded from participating in a Full and Open competition.

Instructions for Responses.  Responses should be not longer than ten (10) pages and must be submitted via email in either Microsoft Word or PDF format.  Please use standard formatting, i.e., 8.5 x 11 inch pages, one inch margins and readable font sizes (not less than 11).

<DESC>THE DUE DATE FOR RECEIPT OF PROPOSALS HAS BEEN CHANGED TO DECEMBER 1, 2006.

The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) supports research related to the basic understanding of microbiology and immunology leading to the development of vaccines, therapeutics, and medical diagnostics for the prevention, treatment, and diagnosis of infectious diseases.  The NIAID, Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID), supports a comprehensive extramural research program focused on the prevention and control of diseases caused by virtually all infectious agents (with the exception of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus).  This includes basic research, such as studies of microbial biology and physiology; applied research, including the development of vaccines, therapeutics and medical diagnostics; as well as clinical studies to evaluate experimental drugs and vaccines.

The NIAID has a requirement for the development, optimization, qualification, and validation via Good Laboratory Practices (GLP) (21 CFR Part 58) and Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) (21 CFR Part 211) of product-neutral immunological assays, potency assays, and animal efficacy models for the evaluation and assessment of plague vaccine candidates based on F1 and V antigens.  These immunoassays and animal models will be developed under GLP and GMP and in a manner that will support licensure of a plague vaccine under the FDA ?Animal Rule,? (21 CFR Part 601.90-95).  

NIAID will require that a minimum of two species of reproducible animal efficacy models shall be developed and characterized for both the pneumonic and bubonic forms of plague, one of which shall be a small animal model and the other a NHP model.  Innate and adaptive immune responses shall be analyzed and from these, correlates of protection shall be identified.  The development and subsequent validation of immunoassays associated with the correlates of protection includes the identification and provision for adequate amounts of standardized reagents for subsequent studies.  NIAID will require that potency assays be developed, characterized, and validated.  Once validated, these immunoassays, potency assays, and animal models will provide important tools for researchers and manufacturers, and therefore, reagents, methods, and procedures must be transferable.  This effort will become a crucial part of a joint Government Agency effort to develop and license a plague vaccine for both military and civilian needs.

It is anticipated that one or more cost reimbursement, completion type contracts will be awarded for a three-year period of performance beginning on or about September 10, 2007.  In addition, the contract will contain multiple options for the establishment of Central Reference Laboratories and a fourth year of performance for completion of these optional requirements if exercised.  The total estimated effort anticipated is 25.8 FTE for the base portion and a total of 15.0 FTE for the all options.

Any responsible offeror may submit a proposal which will be considered by the Government.   This RFP will be available electronically on or about September 12, 2006, and may be accessed on FedBizOpps.  This notice does not commit the Government to award a contract.   No collect calls will be accepted.   No facsimile transmissions will be accepted. See Government-Wide Numbered Note 26.

(2)      The Contractor shall perform a detailed   literature survey of all new peer-reviewed, published (or accepted for publication) articles, books, and reports that report data and information on the toxicological effects of NO2 exposure in laboratory animals and in vitro systems that were not included in the previous NO2 AQCD.  The Contractor  shall provide information on QA procedures used to conduct the comprehensive literature search, including keywords, type of search engines, and limits placed on the searches.  Emphasis should be placed on studies that approximate human exposure in terms of concentration and duration.  However,  studies outside these parameters which may shed light on mechanisms of action are also important.     Question #2:  What is the time frame that the literature survey and study summary should cover?  (From the 1993 Air Quality Criteria for Oxides of Nitrogen, or other versions) Answer:  The survey  shall cover from 1993 to present.  Occasionally, overlap may occur if late breaking information deemed critical is included after the cut off date for the last document.  Careful review of the key studies from the last document and the new literature searches will identify any possible  duplication's and can always be handled at a later date. Question #3:  A.  Does the Toxicology Section developed under this requirement only cover laboratory animal data as indicated in the Sample Outline provided in the SOW?  B.  Should human toxicity or epidemiology studies be included in the  Toxicology Section as well?  Answer:   A. Yes.  Only the lab animal and in vitro toxicology studies as provided in the SOW.   B. No.  Human toxicity and epidemiology studies are separate requirements from the toxicology section. Question #4:  Does the scope of tasks under this requirement only  cover the preparation of the Toxicology Chapter in SASD or also include the preparation of the corresponding chapter in SA? Answer:  The SOW states that the SASD development is the required tasks.  However, the development of the SA document and attendance at CASAC meetings are listed as Optional  Tasks (task 7, 8, and 9).

	SHIPMENT OF ETIOLOGICAL OR INFECTIOUS AGENTS

	(COPY OF 42 CFR, Part 72)

Department of Health and Human Services
42 CFR Part 72 | RIN 0905-AE70
Additional Requirements for Facilities Transferring or Receiving Select Agents
AGENCY: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , HHS. 

ACTION: Final rule. 

SUMMARY
On June 10, 1996, the Centers for Disease and Prevention (CDC), the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) to implement Section 511 of Public Law 104-132, "The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996," which requires the Secretary of HHS to regulate the transfer of select agents. CDC requested comments on the NPRM and provided 30 days for individuals to submit their written comments. CDC considered the comments received and is issuing this final regulation in light of those comments. Current regulations specify requirements for the packaging, labeling, and transport of select agents shipped in interstate commerce. This final rule places additional shipping and handling requirements on facilities that transfer or receive select agents listed in the rule that are capable of causing substantial harm to human health. 
EFFECTIVE DATE
April 15, 1997. Incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in the final rule is approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of October 24, 1996 . All transfers of select agents must comply with the complete documentation and registration requirements contained in this final rule on or after April 15, 1997. CDC has already begun efforts to inform and educate affected parties about the registration and transfer process for select agents. Within the next 60 days, CDC anticipates providing additional detailed information to interested parties in order to initiate the registration process.

<DESC>This amendment/modification to NIH-RFI-263-2007-01, entitled Administrative Officer Action Request Tool, extends the date for submission of responses to December 8, 2006.  All other information and specifications remain unchanged.
Issuing Institute or Center: Office of Research Services/Information Technology Branch (ORS\ITB) 
This Request for Information (RFI) is for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as either a solicitation or obligation on the part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), its Institutes or Centers.  The purpose of this RFI is to help the NIH understand the market availability, technical characteristics, and functionality of solutions, tools, or products capable of satisfying the technical, functional, and/or operational characteristics described in this RFI.  NIH will use this market research information in its evaluation of potential technical approaches for administrative workflow management. 

This request for information is for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation for quotes or proposals or as an obligation on the part of the government to issue a Request for Quotes or award of a contract.  The government will not pay for the preparation of any information submitted or for the government's use of that information. 

NIH welcomes comments from all interested parties on each or all of the questions contained in this RFI.  NIH does not intend to award a contract on the basis of responses nor otherwise pay for the preparation of any information submitted or NIH's use of such information.  Acknowledgment of receipt of responses will not be made, nor will respondents be notified of the NIH's evaluation of the information received.  
Description of Objective:
NIH seeks information on available Business Process Management solutions for an automated web-based application that allows customer entry of Administrative service requests, provides status feedback to users, and gives management the ability to track and balance staff workload.    Due to the sensitive nature of this data, NIH will host any vendor proposed solution.

Description of Environment:
The Administrative Services Branch, Office of Administrative Management, is responsible for providing specific support services related to the direction, coordination, and conduct of administrative management activities and services provided to the Office of Research Services and Office of Research Facilities.  OAM provides assistance in the areas of general administration, workforce planning and development, communications, and space management.  The Administrative Officers (AO) use an automated system to enter, manage, and report requests for administrative services.  

The ASB is looking to replace this current system with an application that provides workflow and Business Process Management functionality. 

The replacement system will be a web-based application that will enable customers to request most AO services from their desktop computers and receive timely status information on their requests.  The new application should make the process for submitting requests as electronic as possible, reducing the number of customer requests received by fax, email, walk-ins, and telephone sources. The system should provide customers with feedback on the status of their requests by email or on demand, route the request to the appropriate AO, and provide a system that is easy to use for both the AO and the customer.  In addition, the application should provide a mechanism for the non-technical system administrator to develop/deploy forms and instructions and define and modify workflows (routings).  AO/ART should also provide robust reporting capabilities such as dynamic ad hoc reporting, graphics, and dash board metrics reporting.

The new system should support the following user roles: the Program Assistant Role (PA), the Administrative Officer Role (AO), the Administrative Officer Management Role (AO Management), the Administrative Officer System Administrator Role (AO System Administrator), the Ethics Coordinator Role, and the Procurement Role.  
1  The PA Role will require the ability to enter requests and receive status updates on those requests.  
2.  The AO Role will need to have the capability to enter, process, and approve requests.
3.  The AO Management Role will need the capability to adjust workloads and review reports.  
4.  The AO System Administrator Role should have the ability to define and modify workflows.  The AO System Administrator Role will also need to be able to develop and deploy forms and instructions.   
5.  The Ethics Coordinator Role should have the ability to approve sponsored and foreign travel requests and view associated status and approval information. 
6.  The Procurement Role will require the ability to obtain statistical information related to request processing such as the number of phone calls, walk-ins, and customer contacts.

Description of Evaluation Criteria:
For the purpose of this RFI, the NIH defines the scope of this technical domain as Business Process Management capabilities required to provide a tailorable web-based application based on defined workflows which will increase productivity and provide a way to authorize, process, and manage administrative requests in an effective and efficient manner in order to meet OAM's mission.  The information gathered through this market research, combined with information gathered through other research and analysis methodologies, will provide the NIH with important decision support information in its evaluation.  NIH will base the selection of its technical standards on the following evaluation criteria:

1.  Availability - Evaluates the availability, failover and performance of the collaboration technology as it relates to server uptime, client uptime and network uptime.
2.  Cost - estimated total cost of ownership (based on market research statistics and independent research opinions).
3.  Existing federal installed base - NIH or other federal government experience with the technology and the use and adoption of the standard or product.
4.  Fit with existing NIH standards, technologies, and systems (for information about existing technologies at NIH, please refer to the NIH Enterprise Architecture website at http//enterprise architecture.nih.gov) - any known interoperability issues a potential standard may have with existing technology standards.
5.  Flexibility - the breadth of the standard?s applicability to multiple NIH stakeholder classes.
6.  Industrial installed base - the use and adoption of the standard throughout industry in general (both commercial and public enterprises).
7.  Maintainability/supportability - the effort and specialized skill sets required to support a technology standard.
8.  Product Life cycle - evaluates the expected time the product will be in use and supported by the vendor and the ability to maintain currency of its functionality and operation.  A longer life cycle is desirable from a training and hardware investment perspectives.
9.  Security - the ability and/or effectiveness and fit of the technology within the NIH security environment.
10.  Strategic value - the breadth of product capabilities in order to leverage an investment.
11.  Vendor viability (vendor viability will be determined by its financial health, position in the market place, external research sources, and any market factors that could compromise the vendor's existence) - the health of the product vendor in terms of its stability, projected longevity, and likelihood it will exist in the future to support the product and later versions of the product.
It is important to reiterate that this RFI is not intended to gather information needed to address each of the decision criteria above.  Received data will be combined with information gathered through other research and analysis methodologies to support NIH's overall evaluation.

<DESC>THE RESPONSE DATE FOR THE MARKET RESEARCH SURVEY HAS BEEN EXTENDED TO 9 NOVEMBER 2006, 4:00 PM, EASTERN STANDARD TIME (EST).  

REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ? MARKEY RESEARCH SURVEY

The Department of the Navy proposes to conduct a competitive sourcing study of the Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIRSYSCOM) Test and Evaluation Facilities and has commenced preliminary planning in accordance with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-76.   The Naval Air Warfare Center?s Aircraft and Weapons Divisions are located at Patuxent River, MD; China Lake, CA; and Pt. Mugu, CA.
  
The Department of the Navy is conducting market research to determine the existence of viable commercial source(s) capable of providing the necessary services, ascertain if there are any small businesses that are potentially capable of performing the entire function, and to determine the appropriate groupings of activities as business units in providing aircraft and weapons systems test and evaluation services. This is a request for information being issued to the private sector community. This is NOT a solicitation. There is no guarantee that a solicitation will be issued as a result of this preliminary planning effort. If the Department of the Navy determines to move forward with a solicitation, a separate document will be published. Response to this inquiry announcement is voluntary. No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information. The information collected through this process is considered to be market research as described by FAR 2.101 and in accordance with FAR 10.002(b)(2)(iii). 

Background.  The Naval Air Warfare Center operates and maintains sea, air, land, and electronic combat ranges to support aircraft and weapons systems T&E.  Range personnel provide engineering and technical services required to collect and analyze a broad spectrum of quality data ultimately to be used by the Navy acquisition community decision makers.  Land, air and sea space communications and control, time and space position measurement, and test vehicle instrumentation and prototyping are high level products.  Additionally, weapons energetic material testing and quality assurance are products of the functions under survey.  The work environment is one of externally driven, rapidly changing priorities, conflicting schedules and evolving requirements requiring a flexible, experienced workforce to accomplish the mission.  The service provider will be required to reapportion the workforce on a permanent or temporary basis and on short notice in response to these changes.  Mission failure is not an option due to the time critical nature of products and ramifications on interrelated Navy programs.

The functions under consideration are: 
Test Article Preparation (Patuxent River, MD.; China Lake, CA and Point Mugu, CA.)
Atlantic Test Range Operations (Patuxent River, MD)
Electronic Combat Range Operations (China Lake, CA)
Sea Range Communications (Point Mugu, CA)
Propulsion, Warhead, and Environmental Testing (China Lake, CA)
Optical Systems Operations (Point Mugu, CA)

A more detailed description of these functions is provided as a separate attachment.

<DESC>This Amendment/Modification extends the due date to RFI-263-2007-01 to December 8, 2006.  All other instructions and specifications remain unchanged.
Issuing Institute or Center: Office of Research Services/Information Technology Branch (ORS\ITB) 
This Request for Information (RFI) is for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as either a solicitation or obligation on the part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), its Institutes or Centers.  The purpose of this RFI is to help the NIH understand the market availability, technical characteristics, and functionality of solutions, tools, or products capable of satisfying the technical, functional, and/or operational characteristics described in this RFI.  NIH will use this market research information in its evaluation of potential technical approaches for administrative workflow management. 

This request for information is for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation for quotes or proposals or as an obligation on the part of the government to issue a Request for Quotes or award of a contract.  The government will not pay for the preparation of any information submitted or for the government's use of that information. 

NIH welcomes comments from all interested parties on each or all of the questions contained in this RFI.  NIH does not intend to award a contract on the basis of responses nor otherwise pay for the preparation of any information submitted or NIH's use of such information.  Acknowledgment of receipt of responses will not be made, nor will respondents be notified of the NIH's evaluation of the information received.  
Description of Objective:
NIH seeks information on available Business Process Management solutions for an automated web-based application that allows customer entry of Administrative service requests, provides status feedback to users, and gives management the ability to track and balance staff workload.    Due to the sensitive nature of this data, NIH will host any vendor proposed solution.

Description of Environment:
The Administrative Services Branch, Office of Administrative Management, is responsible for providing specific support services related to the direction, coordination, and conduct of administrative management activities and services provided to the Office of Research Services and Office of Research Facilities.  OAM provides assistance in the areas of general administration, workforce planning and development, communications, and space management.  The Administrative Officers (AO) use an automated system to enter, manage, and report requests for administrative services.  

The ASB is looking to replace this current system with an application that provides workflow and Business Process Management functionality. 

The replacement system will be a web-based application that will enable customers to request most AO services from their desktop computers and receive timely status information on their requests.  The new application should make the process for submitting requests as electronic as possible, reducing the number of customer requests received by fax, email, walk-ins, and telephone sources. The system should provide customers with feedback on the status of their requests by email or on demand, route the request to the appropriate AO, and provide a system that is easy to use for both the AO and the customer.  In addition, the application should provide a mechanism for the non-technical system administrator to develop/deploy forms and instructions and define and modify workflows (routings).  AO/ART should also provide robust reporting capabilities such as dynamic ad hoc reporting, graphics, and dash board metrics reporting.

The new system should support the following user roles: the Program Assistant Role (PA), the Administrative Officer Role (AO), the Administrative Officer Management Role (AO Management), the Administrative Officer System Administrator Role (AO System Administrator), the Ethics Coordinator Role, and the Procurement Role.  
1  The PA Role will require the ability to enter requests and receive status updates on those requests.  
2.  The AO Role will need to have the capability to enter, process, and approve requests.
3.  The AO Management Role will need the capability to adjust workloads and review reports.  
4.  The AO System Administrator Role should have the ability to define and modify workflows.  The AO System Administrator Role will also need to be able to develop and deploy forms and instructions.   
5.  The Ethics Coordinator Role should have the ability to approve sponsored and foreign travel requests and view associated status and approval information. 
6.  The Procurement Role will require the ability to obtain statistical information related to request processing such as the number of phone calls, walk-ins, and customer contacts.

Description of Evaluation Criteria:
For the purpose of this RFI, the NIH defines the scope of this technical domain as Business Process Management capabilities required to provide a tailorable web-based application based on defined workflows which will increase productivity and provide a way to authorize, process, and manage administrative requests in an effective and efficient manner in order to meet OAM's mission.  The information gathered through this market research, combined with information gathered through other research and analysis methodologies, will provide the NIH with important decision support information in its evaluation.  NIH will base the selection of its technical standards on the following evaluation criteria:

1.  Availability - Evaluates the availability, failover and performance of the collaboration technology as it relates to server uptime, client uptime and network uptime.
2.  Cost - estimated total cost of ownership (based on market research statistics and independent research opinions).
3.  Existing federal installed base - NIH or other federal government experience with the technology and the use and adoption of the standard or product.
4.  Fit with existing NIH standards, technologies, and systems (for information about existing technologies at NIH, please refer to the NIH Enterprise Architecture website at http//enterprise architecture.nih.gov) - any known interoperability issues a potential standard may have with existing technology standards.
5.  Flexibility - the breadth of the standard?s applicability to multiple NIH stakeholder classes.
6.  Industrial installed base - the use and adoption of the standard throughout industry in general (both commercial and public enterprises).
7.  Maintainability/supportability - the effort and specialized skill sets required to support a technology standard.
8.  Product Life cycle - evaluates the expected time the product will be in use and supported by the vendor and the ability to maintain currency of its functionality and operation.  A longer life cycle is desirable from a training and hardware investment perspectives.
9.  Security - the ability and/or effectiveness and fit of the technology within the NIH security environment.
10.  Strategic value - the breadth of product capabilities in order to leverage an investment.
11.  Vendor viability (vendor viability will be determined by its financial health, position in the market place, external research sources, and any market factors that could compromise the vendor's existence) - the health of the product vendor in terms of its stability, projected longevity, and likelihood it will exist in the future to support the product and later versions of the product.
It is important to reiterate that this RFI is not intended to gather information needed to address each of the decision criteria above.  Received data will be combined with information gathered through other research and analysis methodologies to support NIH's overall evaluation.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS FOR HEUTP TRANSLATION/INTERPRETATION SUPPORT DE-SS52-07NA28084 The Highly Enriched Uranium Transparency Program (HEUTP) implements transparency measures between the United States and the Russian Federation under the bilateral 1993 HEU Purchase Agreement.  The HEUTP provides assurance that weapons useable HEU material from dismantled weapons is eliminated from the Russian stockpile by monitoring its down blending into Low Enriched Uranium (LEU).  The HEUTP achieves these results by sending teams of experts to four Russian uranium-processing facilities, in closed cities, to monitor processing operations.  The program also maintains and staffs a Transparency Monitoring Office (TMO) in Novouralsk, Russia for ongoing monitoring operations at the Ural Electrochemical Integrated Plant.  In addition, the program supports visits by Russian delegations to monitor the US conversion of Russian LEU and fabrication of commercial reactor fuel rods. This announcement will serve as notice that the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), Office of Nonproliferation and International Security (NA-24), is seeking small business prime contractor sources.  The objective of this acquisition is to perform an analysis of capability with Basic and options, which includes the following:  analysis of technical strengths and total operational lifetime costs for current site capability. Under this contract the contractor supports critical NNSA functions and provides technical expertise, not generally available in the Federal workforce, in preparing for, conducting, and assessing results from transparency monitoring visits to Russian uranium processing facilities in closed cities located in the Urals and Siberia.  The support activities conducted by the contractor include translation, interpretation, and developing lexicons of technical terminology meeting the program requirements of the Office of Dismantlement and Transparency NA-241 and, potentially, other NNSA organizations. The work scope entails support to the Program Office in Washington, DC and to the TMO staff and the Special Monitoring teams on a recurring basis in Russia. Support encompasses: translation of documents from Russian to English and English to Russian; interpretation, both Russian to English and English to Russian for meetings, negotiations, and site visits; and, developing and maintaining Russian to English/English to Russian Lexicons of technical terminology associated with monitoring Russian Federation dismantlement and conversion of nuclear weapons materials. The contractor must be fluent in both Russian and English and a native speaker of either one or the other language.  The contractor must possess an engineering degree and be familiar with the uranium nuclear fuel cycle in order to establish agreed-upon terminology for Russian/English equivalents where none previously existed.  Contractor representatives must, therefore, be knowledgeable of uranium fuel cycle operations, down blending processes, and monitoring technologies, as well as mission requirements in order to provide the necessary level of support.  Familiarity with the plutonium or mixed oxide nuclear fuel cycles would be helpful, but is not required.  The contractor/contractor facility must be equipped to protect Foreign Government Information and DOE Official Use Only information in accordance with established requirements.  While an â€œLâ€ or higher clearance is desirable, it is not required. The preponderance (80% or greater) of the anticipated effort for this contract involves short-turnaround (several hours to several days) translations of technical and non-technical documents from English to Russian and from Russian to English.  The documents include formal agreements and correspondence, instructions on the conduct of site visits, assay instrumentation use and maintenance, Blend Down Monitoring System manuals, engineering drawings, and others. It is deemed appropriate to award a Cost Reimbursable contract on other than a full and open competitive basis. The NAICS code is 541930, size standard of $6.0 as defined in FAR 19.101. The Draft Statement of Work (DSOW) is posted as Attachment 1.  The contractual effort is contemplated as a 5 -year period of performance with one base year and four option years with an anticipated ceiling amount of $250,000.  The contract type contemplated is a Fixed Labor-Hour instrument.  Work is expected to be conducted primarily at contractorâ€™s facilities, but some work may be conducted at NA-241 offices, national laboratory sites, Russian production facilities, and other sites as appropriate.  This acquisition involves data that are subject to export control laws and regulations.  Only contractors who are registered and certified with the Defense Logistics Services Center (DLSC) shall be provided copies of the solicitation or other data subject to foreign disclosure restrictions.  Contact the Defense Logistics Services Center, 74 Washington Avenue N., Battle Creek, Michigan 40917-3084, call (1-877-352-2255) for further information on the certification process. You must submit a copy of your approved DD Form 2345, Military Critical Technical Data Agreement, with your request for the solicitation when it is issued. A statement of capability should be submitted no later than close of business 30 Nov 06 by those interested firms.  All statements of capability must include company name, mailing address, and company size.  Information submitted in the statements of capability should be pertinent and specific in the area under consideration, on each of the following qualifications: (1) Experience: An outline of previous projects, specific work previously performed or being performed; (2) Personnel: Name, professional qualifications and specific experience of technical personnel who may be assigned as well as clearance levels if applicable; (3) Facilities: A description of existing facilities in the Washington, DC area with regard to the generation, communication and protection of limited access data.  Include any other specific and pertinent information as pertains to this particular area of procurement that would enhance our consideration and evaluation of the information.  The statements of capability will be limited to 15 pages in addition to resumes and pertinent samples of documentation (e.g., copies of technical documents translated from Russian to English and English to Russian), the latter not to exceed 10 pages. An original statement of capability and two (2) copies should be sent to Ms. Dorothy D. Black, Contract Specialist. Points of Contact for this acquisition are: For contracting issues: Ms. Dorothy D.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS FOR WRITTEN INFORMATION ONLY.  THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION ANNOUNCEMENT FOR PROPOSALS AND NO CONTRACT WILL BE AWARDED FROM THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.  The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is performing a ?market search? for large and small businesses in preparation for a future procurement.  The EPA has a need for a contractor to provide the Office of Research and Development (ORD); National Center for Environmental Assessment (NCEA) technical support for conducting ecological risk assessment which provides a formal approach for estimating the likelihood of an adverse ecological effect from a stressor and causal assessments which provide formal approaches for assigning probable causes to observed ecological effects. Specific areas to be addressed in capability packages are as follows:  (1) Experience in  developing, evaluating, and refining methods, analyses, and quantitative models in support of ecological causal and risk assessments; (2) Experience in developing and enhancing web- and PC-based assessment and visualization tools; (3) Experience in managing data and information to support all NCEA assessment activities and accessibility; (4) Experience in reviewing, extracting, pre-processing and summarizing relevant literature and data and support case study assessments. The successful contractor shall provide all necessary labor, materials, facilities, and services in support of the efforts delineated by the Performance Work Statement (PWS).  A draft PWS can be obtained from the OAM website, http://www.epa.gov/oam/cinn_cmd/.  It is anticipated that the contract will be a Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) Level of Effort (LOE) starting in September 2007 with a one year Base Period and four Optional Periods of 12 months each.   Approximately 8,250 LOE hours are anticipated for each contract period for a total of 41,250 hours.  The applicable NAICS code is 541620 with a size standard of $6,500,000.  Any interested firms should submit a capability statement which demonstrates the firm?s ability to perform the key requirements described above.  Standard company brochures will not be considered a sufficient response to this Sources Sought Synopsis.   In the capabilities statements, contractors should provide their size status for the above referenced NAICS code, (i.e. large, small) and whether or not they are a certified hubzone, 8(a), women-owned, small disadvantaged and/or disabled veteran owned concern.   As a reminder, small businesses are required to perform at least 50 percent of the costs of the contract performance with their own personnel (FAR 52.219-14).  The EPA reserves the right to set this action aside for small businesses.  Responses to the above should be submitted to (Kimberli Irwin, USEPA, 26 West Martin Luther King Dr., Cincinnati, OH 45268, or Irwin.kimberli@epa.gov) no later than 15 calendar days from date of posting.  A separate synopsis will be issued for the Request for Proposal (RFP) resulting from this sources source synopsis.

15. Are there unique laws or regulations applicable to these services?

<DESC>The United Stated Environmental Protection Agency is issuing this Sources Sought and Request for Information (RFI) for planning purposes and to determine if there are GSA Schedule Contract holders interested in participating in Circular A 76 streamlined competition for conducting a financial statement audit of the EPAs consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2007.  This firm fixed price requirement may include annual options for such audits for the succeeding four fiscal years and additional options for each year for EPAs financial statements of the Pesticides Reregistration and Expedited Processing Fund (FIFRA) and of the Pesticides Registration Fund (PRIA).  

EPA has numerous appropriation accounts, revolving funds, special funds, deposit funds, trust funds, and other financing mechanisms.  Those functioning during FY 2004 and FY 2005 can be found in the Reporting Entities section of Note 1 to the Fiscal 2005 and 2004 Consolidated Financial Statements, which can be found at http://www.epa.gov/ocfo/finstatement/2005par/par05_intro_fin_stmnts.pdf .

EPA has been in a multi-year process of consolidating all regional finance offices into the four Finance Centers in Washington, D.C.; Research Triangle Park, North Carolina; Cincinnati, Ohio; and Las Vegas, Nevada.  This is scheduled to be completed in the first half of FY 2007.  The only regional finance offices continuing into FY 2007 are expected to be Region 1 (Boston, Massachusetts), Region 3 (Philadelphia, Pennsylvania), and Region 5 (Chicago, Illinois).  

Audit work for the consolidated financial statements audit will take place at the four Finance Centers and the regional finance offices with significant financial activity for the fiscal year.  For FY 2008 and beyond, no audit work in regional offices is anticipated.  Audit work for the FIFRA and PRIA audits will take place in Washington, D.C., and Arlington, Virginia (location of Office of Pesticide Programs).

This RFI is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an Invitation for Bid (IFB) and does not represent a commitment on the part of the government to ultimately issue a request for proposal or award a contract.  The government will not pay for any information provided in response to this RFI.

<CONTACT>Rosemary Hensley, (309) 782-5534
<DESC>This notice is to survey the market to determine/generate interest in the overall management of the water, steam, and electrical power requirements of the Radford Army Ammunition Plant (RFAAP), under a facilities-use contract, and to manage the poten tial construction of a new energy center at the facility that will be compliant with pending federal and state regulations.     RFAAP, a long-standing manufacturer of propellants and energetics to the US military, is situated in southwestern Virginia.  Energy facilities consist of a four-boiler, co-generation coal fired plant that provides high and low pressure steam for manufactur ing processes and building heating steam requirements of 350,000 lbs/hour with a peaking demand of 450,000 lbs/hour.  The boiler plant provides between 40-50% of the electricity requirements of the installation; supplementary electricity is provided by the  local utility. Raw, Filtered and Process Water is drawn directly from the New River and is supplied through two pumping stations and a distribution and storage network to the installation.  The design capacity is 25M gal/day of raw and 25M gal/day of filtered water. The current demand for filter and raw water averages 15M gal/day.  The drinking water plant is designed for 2M gal/day and is equipped with four equally rated rapid sand filters.  Water is supplied to both the installation and the surrounding communities. Numerous production buildings are sited on a 4080 acre, limited-access installation containing road and rail access and 60 miles of steam distribution network.  Ample coal supply storage facilities are available on site.  An ongoing multi-year program at the installation to modernize critical production facilities and infrastructure and reduce operating costs is in progress.  A new gas-fired boiler plant is being designed for potential construction at the installation. The Army is seeking parties experienced in the operations and maintenance of legacy utility generating and distribution systems with a proven track record of implementing energy conservation measures and low-cost utility management solutions to reduce oper ating and maintenance costs and facilitate upgrade of infrastructure. Interested parties can utilize the current power plant and transition to their own developed/designed means of providing the necessary power/energy requirements.  If that is the case, a transition plan will be required to ensure seamless transition/transfe r. Parties shall provide written notification of interest to the Procuring Contracting Officer no later than 30 Nov 2006.

<SUBJECT>Q -- Community Health Aide/Practitioner Services, Emergency Medical Services and Substance Abuse Treatment Services
<DESC>This is a notice the Indian Health Service, Alaska Area Native Health Service (AANHS)intends to award a contract on a sole source basis to the North Slope Borough, Barrow, Alaska. The AANHS receives annual funding to provide Community Health Aide/Practitioner Services, Emergency Medical Services and Substance Abuse Treatment and Services to Alaska Natives and American Indian beneficiaries in the arctic slope region of Alaska. This funding is available to the Arctic Slope Native Association (ASNA)as part of a Public Law 93-638 Compact between the AANHS and ASNA which provides for a broad range of healthcare services. However the ASNA has chosen not to include the Community Health Aide/Practitioner Services, Emergency Medical Services and Substance Abuse Treatment Services in their Compact at this time because the arctic slope local government, the North Slope Borough, currently provides these services and the ASNA believes it would not be cost effective or in the best interest of the north slope region residents to duplicate or compete with these services at this time. There are currrently discussion between the North Slope Borough and the ASNA to work together to provde the services. The amount of funding available to the IHS for these services is only a portion of the actual cost to provide these service to the arctic slope region. Essentially, the IHS will only be subsidizing the cost of these services currently provided by the North Slope Borough. This sole source contract is authorized by Title 41, USC 253(c)(1). There is no other source for these services and there are no business opportunitues for any private entity. The community of Barrow is located on the north slope of Alaska and is only accessible by air. Housing, other infastructure and transportation facilities are minimal. The North Slope Borough, which the IHS will contract with to provide these services is a State of Alaska chartered Borough government and has provided these services for many years. It should be noted this contract could be terminated at any time because the ASNA has the statutory authority to request the funding be transferred to their Public Law 93-638 Compact at any time. This contract will be for the period January 1, 2007 thru September 30, 2007 and will include Options to renew the contract for two additional one-year periods, in the event the ASNA does not agree to assume the services during or following the base year of this contract.

The tasks include depositions as well as administrative hearings that may be technical in nature. This announcement incorporates FAR provisions and clauses in effect through FAR FAC 2005-12 and constitutes the only solicitation; a written solicitation will not be issued.  NAICS Code 561492.

The period of performance is one base year from January 1, 2007-December 31, 2007 with four option years. The quotes not including past performance information are not to exceed 3 pages. The USPTO may solicit additional companies at any time to replace or increase the existing BPA to fulfill the USPTO?s requirements.  To be eligible for award under this solicitation, the contractor must be registered on the Central Contractor Registration website (www.ccr.gov).  As requirements occur, the USPTO, at its discretion, will either compete the actions among BPA holders using the same selection factors used to award the BPA, or rotate awards through the companies included in the BPA.

Selection Factors:
The provision at 52.212-2, Evaluation ? Commercial Items will be used to evaluate offerors.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.
