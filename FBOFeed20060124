<DESC>This is Not A Request for Quotation.  This is notification of the US Fish and Wildlife Services intent to issue a single source award for Floy Fish Tags for the Lahonton National Fish Hatchery.  In 2003, the USGS oversaw fish-tagging operations for the Lahontan Fish Hatchery and procured sequentially numbered and specifically-designed fish tags.   In 2004, the Service worked with the USGS and used the same type of tag designed and ordered by the USGS.  The tags were custom-designed for the Service in order to prevent harm to the species, but durable to remain on the fish during its life. In order to continue the project, it is in the best interest of the government to use the same product and vendor.  For 2006, tags will be .42 cents each.  If you wish to discuss this,  contact  Kathy Haluschak at kathy_haluschak@fws.gov.

<DESC>The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is soliciting research proposals in the area of recognizing improvised explosive devices and reporting. Proposed research should investigate innovative approaches that enable revolutionary advances in science, devices or systems.  Specifically excluded is research which primarily results in evolutionary improvement to the existing state of practice.  

The ultimate vision for the Recognize IED and Report (RIEDAR) program is to demonstrate a compact, robust, practical system for the remote detection of IEDs using their chemical vapor signatures and to demonstrate the ability of this system to operate from a moving vehicle with a high probability of detection of the IED and a low false positive rate.  Thus, the RIEDAR program would enable an unprecedented level of performance for IED detection.  The RIEDAR program objectives are listed below:   

	(1) Standoff detection distance of 400 meters.
(2) Detection time of 1 second or less.
(3)  Area search rate capability of 2700 square meters per second (to search a road 100 meters wide and a meter in the travel direction from a vehicle moving at 60 mph).
(4) A false positive rate, P (false positive) of less than or equal to 1E-6.
(5) Overall size of the system should be less than 1 meter cubed, not including the power source, but including control electronics and any required device packaging.

DARPA seeks innovative proposals to address the following: 

I.  Technical Area One: Direct Optical Standoff Explosive Vapor Detection Technique(s) Development.  Phases I, IIa and IIb of this program will focus on the development of optical technologies to increase standoff distance without compromising signal-to-noise ratio.  The primary means of detection in the RIEDAR program is limited to direct optical approaches such as Laser Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS) and Raman-Based Spectroscopies.  Technologies that integrate two or more of these sensing and detection techniques into an orthogonal based detection system are also of interest.  Techniques that require the pre-dispersal of sensors or materials in the targeted area are not encouraged.  Techniques that detect electronics or electronics on standby, or detect metal or metallic objects are not of interest in this program as a primary means of detection.  These techniques may be complementary to the detection of explosives but should not be the primary means of detection.  Methods that “jam” electronics or provide wide area neutralization are not part of this program.   Proposers should provide detailed descriptions regarding the choice of a particular detection scheme, the technical concepts and details of the detection scheme(s), and the technology roadmap to meet the program objectives.  

II.  Technical Area Two:  Increasing Signal-to-Noise Ratio.  Phases I, IIa and IIb of this program will focus on the development of novel technologies to increase the signal-to-noise ratio of detected chemical signatures by the optical methods proposed.   The signal-to-noise ratio is significantly reduced not only by increasing standoff distance but also by limiting the time available for scanning the target area.  Hence, novel signal-enhancement schemes are required to compensate for the orders of magnitude reduction in signal-to-noise ratio relative to that required for laboratory experiments.   Proposers should provide details of signal-to-noise ratio enhancement schemes, and proof of concept data if applicable. 

III.  Technical Area Three: Operationally-Relevant Parameters. Phase III will focus on the development of operationally-relevant technologies that can be incorporated with the chosen optical detection scheme(s) proposed.  Proposers should provide technical details of how the proposed approach can be operated with eye-safe lasers (the wavelength(s) of operation, the power needed in Watts per square meter), and schemes that allow scanning a 100 meter wide road while moving at 60 mph.

 
Additional information on these technology areas is provided in the Areas of Interest section of the BAA 06-17 Proposer Information Pamphlet referenced below.

PROGRAM SCOPE

The Recognize IED and Report (RIEDAR) program will consist of a Phase I (anticipated duration of 18 months), followed by a Phase IIa and IIb (anticipated duration of 12 months each) and a Phase III (anticipated duration of 12 months) for those efforts that appear to have the greatest potential for production, insertion, transition or overall benefit to DoD. Offerors wishing to participate in Phase II and Phase III should include them as options in their proposal. Multiple awards are anticipated. Collaborative efforts/teaming are encouraged.  A web site—http://teaming.sysplan.com/BAA-06-17 -has been established to facilitate formation of teaming arrangements between interested parties.  Specific content, communications, networking, and team formation are the sole responsibility of the participants.  Neither DARPA nor the Department of Defense (DoD) endorses the destination web site or the information and organizations contained therein, nor does DARPA or the DoD exercise any responsibility at the destination.  This web site is provided consistent with the stated purpose of this BAA. Cost sharing is not required and is not an evaluation criterion but is encouraged where there is a reasonable probability of a potential commercial application related to the proposed research and development effort.  The technical POC for this effort is Dr. Devanand K. Shenoy, fax:  (703) 248-1864, electronic mail: Devanand.Shenoy@darpa.mil.

<DESC>The Chicago Office of the Department of Energy (DOE), in support of the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), plans to contract with COGEMA, Inc., currently located at 4800 Hampden Lane, Suite 1100, Bethesda, MD 20814, to: 1) transfer certain rights of use of COGEMA S.A. proprietary intellectual property related to the design of the US MOX Fuel Fabrication Facility (MFFF) for use by the Russian Federation in designing and constructing a Russian MOX Fuel Fabrication Facility (R-MFFF); and 2) provide project management and technical services to support the design, safety, and licensing process to facilitate the design transfer to the Russian Federation. The NNSA Fissile Material Disposition Program, in accordance with the DOE Record of Decision dated April 24, 2003, and as published in the Federal Register (68FR20134), intends to dispose of 34 metric tons of U.S. surplus, weapons-grade plutonium in a safe manner.  Mixed Oxide (plutonium and uranium oxide) nuclear fuel assemblies that will be manufactured at the MFFF will be irradiated in commercial light-water reactors.  As a result, the material will be transformed to the spent fuel standard, making the plutonium as difficult to recover and as unattractive for use in weapons as the plutonium in existing commercial spent fuel.  The Department of Energy awarded a contract on March 22, 1999 to Duke COGEMA Stone & Webster, LLC, (DCS) currently located at 128 South Tryon Street, Charlotte, NC 28202, for both fuel fabrication and reactor irradiation services.  Under that contract, DCS has been developing the design for the domestic U.S. MFFF, including managerial and technical integration of all the required contract activities. The selection of DCS for the contract to design the domestic U.S. facility was the result of a competitive selection process.  The resulting contract included the application of certain limited rights data, owned by COGEMA S.A., the parent of Cogema, Inc., a DCS LLC member company.  In December 2002, the Russian Federation agreed to use the DCS design in implementing the Russian Federationâ€™s disposition program, to be reviewed and adapted as necessary in light of Russian legislation and standards, rules, and requirements applicable to similar facilities. In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulations 6.302-1, â€œOnly one responsible source and no other supplies/services will satisfy agency requirements,â€ it has been determined that Cogema Inc., a member company of DCS, is the only contractor that possesses the requisite proprietary data rights to transfer the current domestic MFFF design to the extent practicable and provide technical and regulatory assistance to the Russian Federation in the adaptation of that design for use in Russia.  The current domestic MFFF design incorporates commercially proven COGEMA S.A. limited rights data that are central to the successful design, construction, start-up, and operation of a Russian MFFF.  These data are necessary to replicate and utilize the domestic MFFF design.  Therefore, the Department intends to negotiate this contract on a sole source basis with COGEMA Inc.  A cost-plus-award-fee, level-of-effort, task order contract is anticipated to be awarded.  A two year base period of performance is anticipated, which is estimated to commence April 1, 2006. Three additional one-year option periods are also anticipated. Performance will take place primarily in Charlotte, NC; Aiken, SC; France; and the Russian Federation. Although it is anticipated that this contract will be negotiated on a sole source basis with COGEMA, Inc., all responsible sources who believe they can perform the efforts described herein may submit a proposal detailing their capabilities that will be considered by the agency.  Such capability statements may be faxed to Ms. Marlene Martinez, DOE-Chicago at fax number (630) 252-5045.  See Numbered Note 22.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City (NSWC PC) intends to issue a sole source contract to Carleton Technologies Inc., 3018 North US Highway 301 Suite 800, Tampa, Florida 33619-2226 for the acquisition of five (5) each Naval Special Warfare (NSW) MK 16 Underwater Breathing Apparatus (UBA) Digital Electronics Package.  The MK 16 Mod 0 Underwater Breathing Apparatus is used by Naval Special Warfare (NSW) divers in the Seal Delivery Vehicle (SDV).  Current electronics enables the UBA status to be shown to the diver via a primary display (worn on the left forearm) and the secondary display (worn on the right forearm).  Both displays connect to the UBA with cables.  Two pressure gauges, also connected to the UBA by cables, show the pressure remaining in each of the two breathing gas flasks.  The digital electronics package being acquired, combines four of these displays into a single unit, thereby reducing the number of cables.  This procurement is sole source for the following reasons.  Carleton Life Support Technologies is the sole manufacturer of the MK 16 Mod 0 UBA, and is the only company th!  at has a version of the digital electronics in production.  The MK 16 Mod 1 UBA, used by Explosive Ordnance Disposal divers, has been tested with the digital electronics.  Using these test results and lessons learned, Carleton Life Support is the only company that can modify the electronics for NSW MK 16 Mod 0 purposes.  NSW wishes to procure five (5) each NSW digital electronics packages for testing.   Therefore, this acquisition is unsuitable for full and open competition. Delivery will be to the Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City, Panama City, FL 32407-7001. NAICS Code 541990 applies. SBA Size Standard is 500 employees.   FSC is 4220.

The NUWC Newport intends to award a sole source Fixed Price contract to Omegadyne, Sunbury, OH for the following: repair of 12 Differential Pressure Transducers (P/N A016668) and 9 Pressure Switches (P/N A018211). The repairs are necessary to replace failed items presently installed on missile tubes of SSN 688 Class Vertical Launch System (VLS TOMAHAWK) Submarines. The basis for the sole source is that the DDPT and Pressure Switch design is proprietary and is the only design recommended for procurement by the Navy for use on the SSN688 Class VLS submarine. This supplier can meet the compatibility and interchangeability requirements of these items. In addition, the contractor has the intricate and unique equipment required to test and repair these items. The solicitation is expected to be made available no earlier than Jan 26, 2006.  The proposed action is for supplies for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source using SAP and commercial item procedures as set forth in FAR Parts 12 and 13.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received by the closing date will be considered by the Government.

<DESC>This is a BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT (BAA) as contemplated in Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) 6.102(d)(2).  The purpose of the BAA is to invite proposals regarding the “Investigation of the Factors that Influence Formation of Releasing Stepovers in Strike-Slip Systems using analog models.”  The scope of this BAA is limited to investigations in the following areas: (a) Evaluation of the effects of “weak” zones in localization of stepovers, changes in the sense of stepover direction, and segmentation of stepovers along strike in major strike-slip systems; (b) Determination of the effects of curvilinear boundaries on formation of stepovers. (c) Evaluation of the relative importance of factors that determine formation of economic-scale, fluid-bearing energy systems in stepovers.  Proposals in response to this BAA may be submitted from the time of the publishing of this announcement until 4:00 pm LOCAL TIME on 23 Jan 2007.  The Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division!   (NAWCWD) China Lake, will not issue paper copies of this announcement.  The NAWCWD reserves the right to select for award, all, some or none of the proposals in response to this announcement.  Proposals should be phased with an initial one-year study period and resulting documentation and an additional option year of research exercisable depending on the results of the initial research phase.  NAWCWD reserves the right to fund all, some, or none of the proposals received under this BAA.  NAWCWD provides no funding for direct reimbursement of proposal development costs. Technical and cost proposals (or any other material) submitted in response to this BAA will not be returned.  It is the policy of NAWCWD to treat all proposals as sensitive competitive information and to disclose their contents only for purposes of evaluation. Awards will take the form of Firm Fixed Price contracts.  All proposals submitted as a result of this announcement will fall under the purview of the !  Federal Acquisition regulations (FAR).  Questions may be directed to t he Contract Specialist, Peggy Richter 760-939-4272, fax 939-3095 or email peggy.Richter@navy.mil.  Requests should reference the solicitation number.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which will be considered by the agency.  Any awarded proposal will be incorporated into the STATEMENT OF WORK and shall include performance-based criterion.  Proposing Contractors must fill out the attached Certifications and Representations for this synopsis.  The attachment also includes clauses and terms intended for any awarded contract.  Award of the contract resulting from this solicitation will be made to the offeror OR OFFERORS whose proposal, conforming to the solicitation, offers the greatest value to the Government in terms of technical and price rather than to the proposal offering the lowest price.  The Government reserves the right to select which proposal or proposals offers the greatest value to the Government.  The criteria listed below will be the basis for propo!  sal evaluation and selection.  Technical is more important than price but where proposals are approximately equal in technical merit, a tradeoff analysis in regards to price will factor in determination of award.  The Government reserves the right to award contracts to some, all or none of the received proposals based on trade off analysis on merit vice proposed price and available funding.  1.  Relevance of the outcome of the proposed research to the Navy’s geothermal program is substantially more important than the other criteria.   2.  The following Technical factors are approximately equal in importance:  Overall scientific and technical merit of the proposed work.  Capabilities and related experience of key personnel in the technical areas being proposed.  Adequacy of facilities to support execution of the proposed work.  Familiarity with previous work performed in the technical area of interest.  3.  Price, including realism and reasonableness of proposed costs is les!  s important than relevance of the outcome of the proposed research to  the Navy’s geothermal program and approximately equal in value to the other technical criteria.  (c)  The offeror’s proposal will be in the form prescribed by this solicitation and shall contain a response to each of the areas identified herein which affects the evaluation factors for award.  (d)(1)  The degree of importance allocated to cost will increase with the degree of equality of the proposals in relation to the other factors on which selection is to be based, or decrease when the cost is so significantly high as to diminish the value of the technical superiority to the Government.  (2)  With regard to any understatement of costs, the Government reserves the right to evaluate the cost proposals on the inclusion of all necessary and verifiable item of cost.  Any proposal that is materially unbalanced as to prices may be rejected as nonresponsive.  An unbalanced proposal is one that is based on prices significantly less than cost for some work and prices that are signif!  icantly overstated for other work.  (e)  The Government intends to award a contract on the basis of initial offers received without discussions.

<SUBJECT>C--Drinking Water Exposures and Internal Doses of Trihalomethanes in Humans
<SOLNBR>RFQ-OH-06-00040
<RESPDATE>122305
<CONTACT>Point of Contact, Scott Fogle, Purchasing Agent, Phone (513) 487-2049
<DESC>NAICS Code: 541330   The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Office of Research and Development (ORD), National Center for Environmental Assessment (NCEA), intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b), with Wilkes Technologies Inc.  This sole source award will address highly technical review comments on the structure and operation of the Total Exposure Model and physiologically based pharmacokinetic models employed in the NCEA-C-1691 report; to translate concentrations of trihalomethanes disinfection byproducts into human internal doses  and target tissue concentrations; and develop three draft manuscripts for submission to peer reviewed journals; provide textual, graphic and tabular input to the three manuscripts. Based on the EPA's knowledge of this requirement, there are features covered in the statement of work  that may have  unique capabilities to particular vendors.   Statement of Work Drinking Water Exposures and Internal Doses of Trihalomethanes in Humans   Background: While most human health chemical risk assessments are based on laboratory findings in animals which were exposed only to the chemical of interest  (a single-chemical exposure), humans are not so uniquely exposed.  Human exposures to chemical mixtures are the norm, in both therapeutic treatment (solvent, diluent, formulating agents, and active ingredients), environmental exposures to pesticides (active pesticide agents, synergists,  surfactants), and through the consumption of drinking water, which may contain more than one hundred disinfectant by-products, as well as pesticides and breakdown products, and other contaminants of ground- and surface water sources not fully removed by treatment. Given the differences in exposure  scenarios (acute versus chronic; daily versus seasonal), and in anticipated exposure route (oral, dermal and inhalation), exposures may vary by several orders of magnitude.  In addition, chemical specific differences in metabolism and solubility in blood and tissues modify the internal dosimetry of  these agents such that organs and tissues will be exposed to quantitatively different amounts (concentrations) and qualitatively different chemical moieties (parent chemical versus a metabolite).  These factors are the determinants of chemical-specific pharmacokinetics (PK) among and within animal  species.   NCEA and research partners have demonstrated the feasibility of using complex modeling approaches to characterize the oral, dermal and inhalation exposure to trihalomethanes drinking water disinfection byproducts based on the concentration of the contaminants in tap water, the  physicochemical properties of the chemicals, and information on household airflow and human water use and activity patterns.  These exposures have been successfully translated into measures of internal and target tissue doses through physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling.  Recently  the EPA report on this work was subjected to internal and external review in accord with Agency peer review standards.  The work received laudatory comments from each review, but some of the comments will require an appreciable amount of additional work in order to refine the report to its most  valuable stage.  Further, dissemination of the report's findings in the open, peer-reviewed literature through the publication of a series of journal articles was highly recommended by the external peer panel review.   For the present work, NCEA-Cincinnati project 6485a is concerned with refining  the report to address external reviewer comments and developing a series of journal articles on the work.   Objective: The purpose of this acquisition is to obtain contractor support in addressing highly technical review comments (Attachment 1) on the structure and operation of the Total Exposure  Model and physiologically based pharmacokinetic models employed in the report (NCEA-C-1691) (Attachment 2); to translate concentrations of trihalomethanes disinfection byproducts into human internal doses and target tissue concentrations.  Further, this acquisition will obtain contractor support  for the development of three draft manuscripts for submission to peer reviewed journals.  A brief summary of the three manuscripts, specifically indicating contractor contributions, can be found in Attachment 3. Description of Tasks Government Provided Data: The Government will provide external  panel review comments on the NCEA report, a copy of the draft report, outlines of three draft manuscripts for contractor contributions, and a copy of the NCEA Instruction Manual for Contractors, August 2005. Task 1:  Address the review comments on NCEA Report.  In a telephone conversation  initiated by the Project Officer (PO) the Contractor shall discuss with the PO each of the comments.  The contractor shall develop a specific response to each of the comments; that response shall identify the pages, sections, and/or paragraphs of the draft report revised to address the reviewer  comments.   Task 2:  Revise the NCEA Report to reflect changes.  The contractor shall revise the report to reflect the changes made, and shall clearly indicate the modified text.  Task 3:  Develop contributions to three draft manuscripts.  The Contractor shall develop specific text that  addresses the points in the summaries of the three draft  manuscripts.  Such text shall be free from grammatical errors and be constructed in an information-dissemination style consistent with such found in top-quality professional journals devoted to toxicology and human health risk assessment.   Pending a choice for journal submission, formatting of the draft contributions should not be a priority.   Task 4:  Address journal review comments.  Once submitted to the journal and the editor's reviews returned, the Contractor shall participate in addressing journal review comments that pertain  to the manuscript contributions developed by the Contractor.  The Contractor shall revise the returned draft manuscripts to address journal reviewer comments and develop a "response to comments" document for return with resubmission of the revised journal article.   Task 5:  Address Quality  Assurance in a Narrative Statement.  The Contractor must warrant this report contains, and the conclusions are based upon, the most scientifically-defensible data and methods available.  All data that serve as the basis for computations must be obtained from the peer-reviewed literature, and  referenced as such.  When data necessary for computations are required, but not available in the peer-reviewed literature, they are to be estimated using peer-reviewed procedures developed for that purpose.  Those methods must be properly cited.  The pharmacokinetic models must have either been  developed specifically to address the chemicals of concern and the tissue doses of interest in this acquisition, or have been adapted using properly referenced and peer-reviewed procedures in their adjustment.  Concentrations of contaminants in drinking water, which were provided by the US EPA from  published sources, will be properly referenced.  Other quality issues to be addressed within this narrative and throughout the document are detailed in the following two sections on quality assurance and quality requirements. Quality Assurance: This project requires some data to be generated.  The  Contractor shall demonstrate the application of peer-reviewed techniques and methods, and the application of peer-reviewed values for blood: air partition coefficients in the derivation of tissue:air PC values for THM compounds.  All critical steps in the developed approach and information  contained in the identification and justification for the chemical mixtures shall be clearly identified as to source, with the Contractor placing an emphasis on information available in the peer-reviewed literature.  Any information not found in publicly available EPA sources or in the  peer-reviewed literature shall be additionally and uniquely identified (as simple as an asterisk and footnote) as having its origin outside of the peer-reviewed literature.  All information shall be accurately  referenced.  Any adjustments made to existing pharmacokinetic models shall be fully  described and justified, whether based on scientific best judgment from experience or based directly on information obtained from the peer-reviewed literature.   Quality Requirements: This acquisition will use additional information to refine estimates of the internal doses of trihalomethane DBP  chemicals.  It will incorporate new empirically-derived  values for partition coefficients and will refine exposure to reflect temporal patterns, rather than average daily estimates of exposure.  Published and peer-reviewed works  on these subjects, developed for this purpose will serve as  reference material (see reference section), and the Contractor shall employ only methodology which has  previously been peer-evaluated and published in the open, peer-reviewed literature.  The final report from this acquisition shall clearly communicate the methods      employed, and sources of  information and/or data employed as reference material or values for underlying key equations and data serving as the foundation for the work.   Specific attention should be given, so that the report adequately demonstrates the advantage in estimating temporally-varying measures of exposure, rather  than time- weighted exposures.  An example of this justification may be related to the toxicity of peak- versus time-averaged measures of exposures.  Additional attention should be  devoted to demonstrating the impact of uncertainty in key biological or biochemical parameters of the PBPK model  (e.g., blood:air PC values for chemicals whose hepatic  metabolism is flow-limited) on risk-related model predictions.  In this work, consideration should be given to communicating the importance of assessing metabolic interactions, and presenting the underlying concepts and considerations which  guide the determination of the likelihood of metabolic interactions among these mixture components at the anticipated exposure (see Dobrev et al., 2002). To summarize, the final report shall contain a justification (and references) for the  water concentrations of trihalomethanes employed, shall  clearly identify the  physicochemical data and methods used to predict volatility, a description of the pecifics of the inter characteristics of the simulated domicile, the water use patterns for individuals residing in the home, and the activity patterns of the individuals whose internal doses are  simulated, and information clearly describing the patterns of  exposure to the trihalomethanes during the daily cycle.  The PBPK model portion of the report shall present references for PBPK models used with or without adaptation,  the values and references for values used for biological and  biochemical parameters.  A section of the report shall identify and justify (with references) the dose metric (i.e.,  AUC, area under the concentration-time curve, of parent chemical in kidney) for each of the THM chemicals which will serve as the risk relevant PK outcome employed in  determining  sensitivity to model parameters.  Finally, the report shall contain the results of a sensitivity analysis demonstrating the degree to which the risk-relevant pharmacokinetic outcome for each of the THMs is dependent on these parameters.  The report shall be developed and formatted so that minimal  changes are required for publication in the peer-reviewed literature. Milestones and Deliverables: Task    Deliverable	                                             Due Date 1          Response to Review Comments              on NCEA Draft Report and Revised              Report Text                                75 days after award 2          Contractor contributions to the first              manuscript	                              75 days after award 3          Contractor contributions to the              second manuscript	            150 days after award 4          Contractor  contributions to the              third manuscript	            150 days after award 5          QA Narrative Statement           150 days after award Acceptance Criteria: The contractor shall provide one hard copy of each for the deliverables.  The Response to Comments document for the report  shall be formatted in the manner supplied to the Contractor, accomplished by filling in the "response" section found in Attachment 1.  The contributions to each of the manuscripts shall be formatted in the manner usual for publication in the peer reviewed literature in accordance with the NCEA  Instruction Manual for Contractors (excepting the requirement to use Microsoft Word software for word processing), August 2005 (Attachment 4).   Conflict of Interest The Contractor warrants that, to the best of the Contractor's knowledge and belief, that there are no relevant facts or  circumstances which could give rise to a conflict of interest, as defined in FAR subpart 9.5, or that the Contractor has disclosed all such relevant information. The Contractor agrees to notify the Contracting Officer immediately, that to the best of its knowledge and belief, no actual or  potential conflict of interest exists or to identify to the Contracting Officer any actual or potential conflict of interest the Contractor may have. The Contractor agrees that if an actual or potential conflict of interest is identified during the performance, the Contractor will immediately  make a full disclosure in writing to the Contracting Officer.  This disclosure shall include a description of actions which the Contractor has taken or proposes to take, after consulting with the Contracting Officer, to avoid, mitigate, or neutralize the actual or potential conflict of interest.   The Contractor shall continue performance until notified by the Contracting Officer of any contrary action to be taken. Contract Publication Review Procedures (EPAAR 1552.237-70) (ARP 1984) The Contractor may not publish, present briefings or release any material resulting directly or indirectly  from work performed under this order in any conference, presentation, forum, publication or other discussions without the prior approval of the EPA Project Officer.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

THIS IS A SYNOPSIS AS REQUIRED BY FAR PART 5.2 – THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTE/PROPOSAL.  VENDORS SHOULD NOT SUBMIT FORMAL QUOTES/PROPOSALS UNTIL THE RFQ/RFP IS POSTED TO THIS WEBSITE.  45 CONS/LGCBB has a requirement for professional structured writing skills for Defense Equal Opportunity Management Institute (DEOMI).  The Military Writing Skills Program (MWSP) is an academically structured military writing program specifically designed to improve the military writing skills of DEOMI’s Equal Opportunity Advisor Course (EOAC) students.  The course concept is designed and intended to be a freshman-level, technical writing class for military members.  This assumes some degree of proficiency/skill on the part of the students such as a fundamental grasp of grammar and sentence structure rules.  Although focus is on basic grammar, structure, and style of writing, the goal should be to adapt these lessons to the military style of writing and prepare all future Equal Opportunity Advisors to function in a staff environment.  The Writing Improvement Network (WIN) classes are intended to assist those students who need additional fundamental training.  The WIN’s focus is on re-emphasizing the basic grammar, structured, and style of writing.  It aims to be a more informal tutorial approach.  This program in its entirety shall provide students with a foundation of military writing skills to prepare them for the written communication requirements they are expected to encounter as Equal Opportunity Advisors.  This service will be conducted at Patrick AFB, Fl.  Period of Performance in  28 March 2006 thru 30 September 2006.  The government intends to make a single award to the lowest priced, technically acceptable offeror.  This proposed procurement is unrestricted.  Solicitation No. FA2521-06-T-0044 will be issued as a Request for Quote.  It is advertised with a Standard Industrial Code  (SIC) of 8200, business size of $6.0M and a North American Industry Classification System (NACIS) code of 611710.  GSA Schedule holders for this item/service are encouraged to provide us with their GSA Schedule number.  All responsible sources may submit a quotation, which shall be considered by the agency.

<DESC>1. AMENDMENT 0004 IS AVAILABLE AT https://wwwproc.redstone .army.mil/acquisition/amcom_main.html: BELOW CONTAINS THE AMENDMENT NARRATIVE. 2. GENERAL NOTE THAT SOME POTENTIAL OFFERORS HAVE FORGOTTEN: THIS ACQUISITION HAS BEEN PLANNED TO BE COMMERCIAL SERVICES FROM THE BEGINNING WITH THE INTENT OF REDUCING THE MARKETPLACE'S BID COST AND OVERHEADS THUS REDUCING THE COST TO GOVERNMENT FOR THOSE SERVICES. JUST AS THE GOVERNMENT MAY NOW USE K-MART AND WALMART AS A SUPPLIER FOR CERTAIN COMMODITIES DEFINED AS COMMERCIAL, SAVING THE GOVERNMENT THE EXPENSE OF DRAWINGS, TEST AND LONG EVALUATION PERIODS, THE GOVERNMENT CAN ALSO ACQUIRE SERVICES IN THE SA ME STREAMLINED METHOD. IT IS MEANT TO SIMPLIFY AND SHORTEN THE AWARD PROCESS. IN ALLOWING THIS METHOD OF PROCUREMENT, THE GOVERNMENT REQUIRES MINIMUM INFORMATION RATHER THAN MAXIMUM DATA.AS IN YEARS PAST. (Q - 1) Are you saying that no resumes have to be provided for two guards w/security clearances, just two individuals have to be identified who possess clearances? (A)  THE WORD RESUME IS THE PROBLEM HERE.  INFORMATION ON TWO INDIVIDUALS IS REQUIRED, BUT THE INFORMATION IS FAR BELOW THE RESUME LEVEL. SEE M-6 EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD, IN THE BASIC SOLICITIATION AND 6.3 OF THE STATEMENT OF WORK. THE MANAGERIAL PERS ON, PER 6.1 OF THE STATEMENT OF WORK, ONLY HAS TO BE DENTIFIED.  THERE IS NO REQUIRMENT TO JUSTIFY WHY THIS MANAGER OR LEAD GUARD IS BEING SELECTED FOR THE POST; JUST AS THERE IS NO RESUME REQUIRED FOR HIM/HER, UNLESS THAT INDIVIDUAL IS ONE THAT YOUR FIRM SELECTS FOR THE TWO GUARDS CAPABILITY DEMONSTRATION DISCUSSED BELOW. THE TWO GUARDS FOR WHICH YOU PROVIDE MINIMAL BACKGROUND INFORMATION AND SECRET SECURITY CLEARANCES NEED ONLY TO BE IN THE CURRENT EMPLOY OF YOUR FIRM. THIS DEMOSTRATES THAT YOUR FIRM HAS THE CAPABILITY OF FULFILLING THE GOVERNMENT'S REQUIREMENTS. NOTHING I N THE SOLICITATION REQUIRES THAT THESE PROPOSED INDIVIDUALS BE DEDICATED TO THE BRANDYWINE JOB SITE PRIOR TO GOVERNMENT EVALUATION AND CONTRACT AWARD.  TO DO SO MIGHT REQUIRE THAT SOME OF THE COMPETITORS HIRE ADDITIONAL STAFF BEFORE KNOWING THE COMPETITION 'S OUTCOME.  IT IS NOT THE GOVERNMENT'S INTENT TO HAVE BUSINESSES INCUR ADDITIONAL COSTS FOR WHICH MOST OF HAVE NO WAY OF RECUPERATING.       IT IS CAUTIONED THAT SUBCONTRACTING WITH FIRMS THAT HAVE SECRET CLEARED PERSONNEL IS ALLOWABLE, BUT THOSE OFFERORS RUN THE RISK OF NOT BEING AS COMPETITIVE AS OTHERS.  ALL OFFERORS SHOULD CHECK WITH THE BRANDYWINE AIR FORCE FACILITY, MARYLAND, SECURIT Y OFFICE TO SEE WHAT IS REQUIRED TO HAVE GUARDS RECEIVE THE NECESSARY CLEARANCES.  THE PROCESS MAY NOT BE AS COSTLY OR AS TIME-CONSUMING AS IMAGINED. DO NOT CONTACT THIS OFFICE FOR THAT INFORMATION. (Q -2) Service contract vice commercial purchase order, what regulation provides for that differential? That distinction will directly effect pricing matrixes. (A)  a.  SEE THE SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION OF COMMERCIAL SERVICES DISCUSSED ABOVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT THIS REQUIREMENT DOES NOT MEET THE MONETARY SCOPE OR THRESHOLD OF A SERVICE CONTRACT ACT COVERED CONTRACT.  IT IS ESTIMATED TO BE WITHIN THE SMALL TO SEMI-SMA LL PURCHASE REALM AND COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE.       b. THIS IS NOT A FIVE YEAR CONTRACT, THIS IS A ONE YEAR OR LESS PURCHASE ORDER, FOR WHICH THE SUCCESSAFUL OFFEROR WILL BILL IN MONTHLY HIS OR HER NEGOTIATED AND COMPETITIVELY ESTABLISHED FIRM FIXED PRICED EXPENSE. 3. QUOTE SUBMISSION DATE REMAINS JANUARY 26, 2006.

Replies to the above shall be at the VISN 12s sole discretion and nothing in this RFI shall create an obligation by the Government. Respondents are requested to provide additional information as indicated in the attached files.   Submission by respondents:  Responses to this RFI are due no later than NOON Central Standard Time (CST), on February 22, 2006 and shall be submitted electronically to the above e-mail address along with four (4) hard copies of the information to the following address: VAMC-GLAC, Building 5, ATTN:  Diane Brazale, Contracting Officer, 5000 West National Avenue, Milwaukee WI  53295.    A.	Objectives/Overview:   1.  We have been exploring the concept of a decentralized EICU for VISN 12, which is comprised of six major sites, each with several smaller divisions and clinics.  The major campuses are located in Chicago, IL, Hines IL, North Chicago IL, Madison, WI, Milwaukee, WI, Tomah, WI and Iron Mt. MI.  A comprehensive listing of sites is available at http://www.visn12.med.va.gov/. Concurrently, we have also been exploring and planning for the installation of Critical Care Unit (CCU) Clinical Information Systems (CIS) in every hospital within VISN 12.  Our intention is to optimize training, system maintenance, and data exchange throughout the VISN. The requirements for a CIS, and many of those for an EICU have been included in this document.   2.  We are utilizing this RFI to notify vendors of our intentions and to identify interested vendors that have Clinical Information and EICU Systems, which meet our needs.  3.  We have substantial interface requirements between the CIS and the VHA hospital information system (VistA).  Our intent, through this RFI, is to identify those vendors capable of_and interested in_developing such an interface. B.	Terminology  CIS:  the vendor-supplied CCU Electronic Patient Management System  CCU:  Critical Care Unit (includes ICU, MICU, SICU and Step-down Units) CCOW:  Clinical Contacts Objects Workgroup. Refers to the HL7 standard for clinical context management which entails the coordination and synchronization of applications so that they are mutually aware of the set of common things - known as the context - that frame and constrain the user's interactions with applications. EICU: Electronic ICU, a remote location where various patient parameters on multiple patients from multiple locations can be monitored and acted upon through real-time audio/visual communication with on-site staff. VISN12:   Great Lakes Health Care System VISN VHA:  Veteran_s Healthcare Administration  CAC:  Clinical Applications Coordinator  VistA:  VHA hospital information system  CPRS: Computerized Patient Record System, a graphical user interface (GUI) to display VistA patient information BCMA:  VHA Barcode Medication Administration system, a national VHA program integrated into VistA to accept provider medication orders from CPRS and record the administration of pharmaceuticals, utilizing a GUI C.	Background  VISN12 currently has several existent CIS.  At all ICU sites, a combination of traditional paper charting and VistA is being used to manage the CCU patients. All sites extensively and predominantly utilize CPRS, BCMA, and other radiological and cardiology clinical information systems for all health care documentation.  Other software for the care of our patients includes VistA Imaging, Clinical Note Templates, and Health Promotion. Other CPRS-VistA programs are likely to be developed in the future. Our present workstations and hospital networks are Windows 2000 Pro and XP. The new CIS will replace paper flow sheets used in the CCUs. Nursing and other staff will use this system to manage the patient information in the CCU, as CPRS has not been optimized for a CCU patient. The monitored vital sign information will be transferred automatically to the CIS flowsheet and displayed on a timeline correlated with all provided therapies. We anticipate that the new system will assist nursing staff in tracking one-time, as-needed, and periodic patient care tasks. Physicians will be able to use the new CIS to assess the patient, much as they use the CCU paper flowsheet now.  Hospitals will use CPRS for the permanent electronic patient record (except the information currently stored in the CCU flowsheet) and BCMA for inpatient medication delivery. It is imperative that the new CIS, and the CPRS, BCMA, and all other systems co-exist as seamlessly as possible on the same workstation. In this RFI we're going to outline the present hospitals processes not only for managing the CCU patient and the future processes, but also for how we want CIS to be part of those processes.  An important consideration is the establishment, implementation and continuity of a unified data solution throughout the VISN. In these terms, data definitions, data comparisons, clinical usage is expected to be seamlessly consistent across all VISN sites. The data warehouse solution must first encompass individual identical hospital databases, with concurrent compilation and replication at a central data repository.  Hence, changes in the database at one hospital must be automatically uploaded to the central repository as well as at all other hospitals.  An additional component of the VISN12 CCU informatics solution is the establishment of a unified, integrated analytical database. VISN12 seeks to establish analytic data stores integrating critical care clinical information system data and clinical data obtained from the VA_s electronic medical record (EMR) VistA. Such a VISN12 Healthcare Analytic Solution would provide direct clinical user access to the data and support of the data stores.  CIS data would span the entire ICU stay at each location and include all data available from the CIS database. Physiologic data, such as heart rate, blood pressure, and respiratory rate, would be captured at least once a minute.   Database design would specifically allow for the storage and analysis of all very granular data captured by the critical care CIS rather than a sample or summary of the data.  A clinician must be available to add new data elements and analyses to the installed database without loss of performance or functionality. The analytic solution would be capable of extracting value from clinical data stores, specifically addressing issues relating to clinical quality; medical errors; healthcare costs; VISN comparisons of costs, practice patterns and outcomes; and differentiating quality; in addition to clinical research endeavors. VISN12 consists of 7 acute care hospitals with a current total of 79 intensive care beds and an indeterminate number of intermediate care beds.* The final number of intermediate care beds may not be part of the CIS. See table below.  Hospital 	Intensive Care: No. beds (monitors) Hines	23 Chicago	10 Milwaukee	18 Madison	12 North Chicago	10 Iron Mountain	6 Tomah	0 *Additionally, the precise number of intermediate (telemetry) beds that could be potentially included in implementation is currently under review and unavailable.  D.	Design Philosophy  The long-term, permanent patient record will reside in VistA.  The care provider should not have to be a highly technical PC user to be able to manage the patient information in the vendor and VISN12's software applications. All systems/components shall be user friendly. The vendor's and VISN12's programs should be thoroughly integrated on the CIS workstations.  An integral part of this project requires the development of a bi-directional interface between the CIS and VistA. Computer programming resources are limited within VISN12, and the vendor will have to develop the bi-directional interfaces with some expert Mumps technical support from VISN12 (or another VISN) personnel. To provide clinical and administrative exchange of data within VISN12, a common data repository must be developed and populated for all VISN12 hospitals. This repository must consist of an open, non-proprietary design with standard, data-mining tools.  E.	Instructions  The attached documents which will contain Tables (A through P) include all the questions in this RFI. You are requested to enter your responses in the corresponding table cells. Submit a) Four (4) printed copies mailed to the Contracting Officer at the address provided and b) an electronic Microsoft Word copy to the Contracting Officer at diane.brazale@va.gov Note:  RFI submissions will not be accepted without an electronic copy. Include non-text information, illustrations, screen shots, etc., as an Exhibit to the table and identify each page with the appropriate table cell label (e.g., 'C11'). If additional pages are required for your written response, please attach additional sheets and identify as an _Exhibit_. Include the Table reference and response number with each additional response.  i.e. Exhibit A, Response A-1, Exhibit J, Response J-3, Exhibit M, Response M-4 etc). Note in space provided if your response is attached as an Exhibit.  In addition, respondents are requested to include a description of the CIS systems capacity for analytical data analysis.  This description should include the proposed solution for managing  ad-hoc user queries which encompass both data elements from the vendors CIS and from any VISTA element. Include specifics regarding existent and planned capabilities. Identify which CIS systems are commercially available product as an _off-the-shelf_ product or will require customization. If both of the above apply, estimate what percentage of your CIS system is _off-the-shelf_.  Submit and identify the above description as Exhibit Q. Include a specific implementation plan for all of the seven (7) hospitals.  This plan should encompass specific elements and a timeline for technical installation, training and go-live implementation. Submit and identify your implementation plan as Exhibit R. If you have any problems with downloading the electronic files or need a new copy of this request for information form, please contact Diane Brazale via email at diane.brazale@va.gov.  No phone calls will be accepted. Responses to this RFI are due no later than date and time previously specified on Page 1 of this RFI.

<DESC>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA)Mauna Loa Observatory located in Hilo, HI requires the re-construction of two disassembled steel frame and steel clad metal buildings. The Contractor shall provide all necessary and incidental equipment, materials, and labor to perform all work described in the statement of work.  All work shall be performed by skilled workers in compliance with all local and federal regulations and codes. Background: The Keck Observatory, Mauna Kea, surplussed 2 identical metal framed, sheet metal clad buildings and donated them to Mauna Loa Observatory. The buildings were dismantled with the view that they would be reassembled at Mauna Loa. The disassembly consisted of unscrewing the fasteners for the sheet metal wall panels, dismantling the roof sheeting and trusses, and cutting the steel metal frame at a number of points that would allow the building to be reassembled efficiently. The components of the buildings were carefully numbered and packed so as to allow for systematic unpacking and reassembly. The building components are located at the Mauna Loa Observatory site (11,140 feet ASL) and the foundations upon which the buildings are to reconstructed have been poured. Both buildings measure 16 feet long x 13 feet 6 inches wide x 6 feet, 11 ½ inches tall. The building structural members are 6 inch x 6 inch rectangular tubes of 3/16 inch thick steel. Both buildings had an elevated rail system extending 16 feet out from one end of the building at the level of the top of the side walls. The rails are supported by two vertical members on each side and cross beams that come as an integral unit. Note:  Only Building "A" will be re-assembled with the elevated rail system extending out from one end of the building to form the support for the addition of a deck at a future date.

The proposed contract is a 100% Small Business Set Aside and is being executed under the Commercial Acquisition Procedures of FAR Part 13 (NTE $100K) and FAR Part 36. The NAICS code is 238120.  The small business size standard is $12.0 million.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) Patuxent River, MD is seeking information for potential sources regarding industry technologies applicable to replace the seating systems in the E2-C aircraft.  This request is for INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY. 

CURRENT TECHNOLOGY: The current seating systems in the E-2C aircraft has five seats, two in the cockpit and three in the cabin area.  All five seats are capable of adjusting horizontally, vertically and reclining.  The current are equipped with headrests, seat cushions and are capable of accommodating the Parachute Survival Ensemble (PSE) into the seat back.
Maximum dimensions of the PSE are: 25 inches tall, 14.75 inches wide and 7.875 inches thick.  The PSE also incorporates the lap belts, the shoulder harnesses and the inertia reel.  The cabin seats are capable of rotating 90° and the seat pan tilts to counteract the affects of the nose up flying attitude of the aircraft.
All seats attach to the aircraft via track fittings.  The seats do not have an energy attenuation system and one is not required.

DEFICIENCIES OF THE CURRENT SEATING SYSTEM

1)	Mission duration has increased and ergonomics of the seat do not allow for proper seating for extended missions.
2)	Seating system not capable of accommodating 5th male through 95th male seat occupants.
3)	Current seating system causes pressure points on lower extremities, reducing blood flow.
4)	Seat does not allow for proper adjustment to attach PSE to seat occupant.
5)	Seating system has no capability to dampen vibrations transferred from aircraft to seat occupant.
6)	Seat pan tilt is not adequate to adjust seat pan properly during flight.
7)	Seat cushion degrades after minimal flying time. 

PROGRAM GOALS

Obtain a new seating system for the E2-C that:
a.	Meets anthropometric envelope requirements for the 5th through 95th percentile males 
b.	Interfaces with current aircraft track system, dimensions of which can be provided.
c.	Allows for integration of the PSE into the seat back.
d.	Does not exceed the maximum weight requirement of 50 pounds for the pilot/co-pilot seats and 60.5 pounds for the cabin seats.
e.	Integrates methods to increase endurance and minimize body fatigue.
f.	Meets dynamic, static and environmental testing requirements to show operation capabilities in a naval environment and within 20/20/10 conditions.
g.	Is a Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) or Non-Developmental Item (NDI) product.

<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI).  This is not a request for proposals and does not obligate the Government to award a contract.  The Office for Grants and Training (G&T) is conducting an end-user functionality and efficacy assessment of National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) approved air-purifying respirators.  The CDP is inviting manufacturers to provide information.  This information will be used in the market research conducted regarding air-purifying respirators and will provide support information for CDP focus group and assessment participants. 

The intent of the user assessment program will be to provide the emergency response community user feedback and evaluation of equipment based on utilization of each piece of equipment selected in scenarios that replicate, to the maximum extent possible, conditions that will be experienced in incident response.  The results of the assessment will not yield a determination of what product is best, nor shall the Center for Domestic Preparedness (CDP) endorse any product or manufacturer.
The types of air-purifying respirator equipment being assessed are ones that would be used by emergency responders while wearing Level C ensembles, and performing the necessary tasks in the isolation zones (e.g., hot, warm, and cold zones).
The assessment will be performed at the CDP by evaluators from the emergency response population, representative of all disciplines of agencies and jurisdictions across the US.  These evaluators will be actual users of the equipment in the field.  The evaluators will be presented with specific scenarios and tasks to be carried out using the equipment.  The scenarios will be tailored so that evaluated criteria can be objectively and subjectively assessed by each evaluator.  Some of the criteria could include capability, usability, affordability, deployability, and maintainability.  

If you wish to provide information about your particular brand/product for this user evaluation program, please provide in electronic (MS Word) format, your company name, address, point of contact, telephone, fax and e-mail address.  Additionally, please provide any information available such as ability to adapt accessory microphones/earpieces to the masks, adaptability of equipment to be used in hazardous environments while wearing OSHA recommended personal protective equipment, reliability, maintainability, durability, environmental limits and safety reports. 

Do not send your piece of equipment.  Selected equipment will be purchased from distributors/suppliers as the equipment is selected for the assessment.

Respond by 4:00PM CST on February 15, 2006, by e-mail to Rickey Daniel at rickey.daniel@dhs.gov or by fax to (256) 847-2323 or by mail to Rickey Daniel, Contract Specialist, Center for Domestic Preparedness, P. O. Box 5100, Anniston, AL  36205

<DESC>This announcement is for informational purposes only.  The Government intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a sole source basis to Motorola for renewal of Iridium data and voice airtime and licenses for the Sky Tracker system in Colombia for one year with four option years.   The Sky Tracker system was procured from Motorola in 2003 to provide the communication medium for sending voice and data from aircraft.  The Government requires additional  Iridium data and voice airtime in order for the Sky Tracker system to work.  This service is provided by Motorola and the data airtime service is licensed by Iridium to those data service providers which make their "own boxes" to transmit data through the system.  Motorola is the only known source for this requirement due to its proprietary nature.  Any interested parties in this requirement must provide information to support it ability to meet the above. This information must be received by 4 pm ET, February 1, 2006 to the attention of Mary Pat Hayes-Crow at hayes-crowmp2@state.gov.

<SUBJECT>A -- Development of a Final Drug Product for a Mixture of Monoclonal Antibodies for type A Botulinum Neurotoxins
<DESC>The Division of Microbiology and Infectious Disease (DMID), National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) intends to negotiate with XOMA LLC for a multiple-year contract under the Authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), as set forth in FAR 6.302-1(b)(1)(i), Unique Capabilities.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.

Inherent duplication of cost to the Government and unacceptable delays in completing the project make competition unfeasible for this requirement.  The proposed contract will permit XOMA LLC to expand the studies and services required to develop and evaluate the monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) specific for botulinum neurotoxin serotypes A1 and A2.  These mAbs are being manufactured under contract HHSN266200500004C as three separate bulk drug substances and are to be developed into a single combined and formulated final drug product to a stage that will allow for submission of an Investigational New Drug application to the Food and Drug Administration. 
XOMA LLC has an agreement with University of California in San Francisco  that gives them access to the three promising mAbs.  Also, XOMA LLC has used proprietary technology to develop the Master Cell Banks and the Master Working Cell Banks, analytical assays, a manufacturing process, and the bulk drug substances.  XOMA LLC is the only known source that possesses the  knowledge and materials required to perform the studies and services that are required under the proposed contract.  In addition, XOMA LLC has established a close and productive relationship with the inventor of the mAbs, which is crucial to the success of the proposed contract.  Interested parties may identify their ability and submit capability statements in response to this requirement and must submit the information on/before the closing date noted in this announcement.  Organizations that submit capability statements in response to this announcement must demonstrate their ability to assume the work without unnecessary delay and duplication of cost and effort.  See Numbered Note 22.  No collect calls will be accepted.

<SUBJECT>A -- Armor Challenge
<DESC>DARPA Announces “Armor Challenge,” SN06-16

The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s (DARPA) Defense Sciences Office (DSO) is continuing to invest in improving passive vehicle armor materials and systems.  To identify promising new armor systems for military vehicles, DSO is conducting an “Armor Challenge” aimed primarily at inventors and small organizations who do not have the resources to initiate full-scale armor development programs. 

DARPA’s Armor Challenge invites concept papers for novel armor designs based on the requirements and specifications described in detail on the Armor Challenge website, http://www.directedtechnologies.com/DARPA_ArmorChallenge.html.  Participants in the Armor Challenge will be selected based on the criteria listed at the website below.  Selectees will be invited to supply test samples of their novel armor designs to an independent laboratory for evaluation. Funding will NOT be provided for Research and Development, but DARPA will reimburse selectees for the cost of manufacturing and shipping of the samples.  DARPA will fund all ballistic testing at an independent laboratory to ensure that armor performance is judged consistently by an objective organization operating with recognized and objective standards.  Samples that demonstrate superior performance against one or more threats, or that incorporate a particularly innovative design feature, will be considered by DARPA for further development.

Details regarding program planning and objectives, as well as guidelines for concept paper preparation, submission and evaluation, may be found at the Armor Challenge website, http://www.directedtechnologies.com/DARPA_ArmorChallenge.html.  Concept Papers will be accepted through January 26, 2007.

Directed Technologies (DTI) has been tasked by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s (DARPA) Defense Sciences Office (DSO) to assist in the coordination and administration of the Armor challenge.  DTI is a Scientific, Engineering and Technical Advisor (SETA) contractor to the Defense Sciences Office and is bound by appropriate non-disclosure agreements.

The crane shall have a full pressure hydraulic control system with NO electric or electronic controls.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.
