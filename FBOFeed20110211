<SUBJECT>70 -- CMOS WEB SOLUTION RFI
<SOLNBR>R2732
<CONTACT>JOHN CROWELL john.crowell@gunter.af.mil

<a href="mailto:john.crowell@gunter.af.mil">E-mail the POC</a>
<DESC>(1) REQUEST for INFORMATION (RFI).
The Government is seeking small and large business contractors (as part of conducting market research) that have the ability to provide Web Development capabilities to move the Air Force Cargo Movement Operations System (CMOS) Client/Server system to a Web base application and architecture.
Respondents to this RFI should provide capability statements as qualified prospective vendors capable of providing the services that support the objectives identified in the RFI. The Transportation Branch (ESC/HGGJ), for the CMOS Program Management Office (PMO), is conducting this RFI to determine sources with core competencies and demonstrated experience in Web application development with the complexity of the Air Force CMOS legacy system. 
The area of focus for this effort is to move the CMOS system from a client/server architecture to a web based architecture. This effort is not limited to the CMOS client application and/or the database server itself. It is an effort to provide and complete a Web based solution for the CMOS system. The contractor will team with the government to work all phases of this effort. The effort is to ensure the CMOS web version is a complete web solution and is a fully integrated browser, application server and database system solution. The effort is a multiple phase effort with each phase of the effort concluding with a review and government approval to proceed (see Section 4.2 of the draft Performance Work Statement (PWS)). The first phase of the effort will be an analysis phase. The second phase will be the design phase.  The third phase will be a build phase, which will be an iterative build cycles with the last cycle being Component Validation and Integration (CV&I) testing. Th! e fourth phase will be a government test phase in which the contractor will support government testing and repair deficiencies and redeliver new code to the government for retesting. The fifth phase will be the User Expectation Test (UET) phase in which the contractor will support the deployment of the web version of software to DISA. UET is live testing with a limited number of bases. This Phase will conclude with a Field Readiness Review (FRR) and a decision to deploy the CMOS web system worldwide. The final Phase will be support for worldwide deployment and provide maintenance support.  The draft PWS provides more detail for each of the above mentioned phases.

<DESC><p>This requirement will require the&nbsp;contractor at their own expense to come to Hill AFB in Utah for&nbsp;an industry day on March 3rd at 9:00 AM Mountain time and if need be March 4th at 9:00AM.&nbsp;The industry day&nbsp;is being held so the&nbsp;contractors can come in and take measurements of the various aircraft rims.&nbsp;There are 21&nbsp;different aircraft rims which we need 33&nbsp;different custom molds created for. The molds will be used to&nbsp;create&nbsp;the paint masks.&nbsp;Various quantities of these&nbsp;paint masks will be needed over the next 5 years so we will be awarding an indefinite delivery indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract to the successful contractor. The masks are needed to cover the following areas on the rims: race guards, bearing bore areas, and tiebolt areas. The painting process uses an accelerated paint drying process that drys the parts in 1 hour. Therefore, these masks need to be able to withstand temperatures up to 200 degress in and IfraRed based over. The&nbsp;temperatures do not exceed 200 degrees. We currently do not have any&nbsp;drawings with specifications; therefore, the&nbsp;using activity will be able to make available 75 percent of the&nbsp;rims from the requirement during the industry&nbsp;day.&nbsp;Once the initial industry day is done, as part of your bid proposal we will ask you to include your expected cost for two subsequent visits by an employee of your company to come measure the remaining wheel&nbsp;rims that were not available during the initial industry day. Obviously, until your company has measurements, you would not be able to produce a mold and mask; nevertheless, in order for us to be able to award this proposal to your company we would need you to be able to estimate a cost for all wheel&nbsp;rims knowing that the use of the masks are going to be for one of three areas. Once again, these three areas are the race guard, bearing bore cover, or tiebolt area. The requirement will require the contactor to be capable of designing the mask according to&nbsp;how they feel it should be designed to function properly. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Center for Environmental Health (NCEH), Division of Laboratory Sciences, intends to award a sole source contract to Cayman Chemicals, 1180 East Ellsworth Road, Ann Arbor, MI 48108 for the purchase of deuterated internal standards: &alpha;-Linolenic Acid-d14 (300mg), Palmitoleic Acid-d14, Arachidonic Acid-d18 (800mg) and Arachidonic Acid-d8 (400 mg) for the identification and analysis of trans fatty acids in human plasma. These deuterated internal standards will increase selectivity and sensitivity of the compounds to be measured in NHANES population samples.<br /><br />The statutory authority for this sole source acquisition is 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1) in accordance with FAR Part 6.302-1- only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirement. The NAICS code for this procurement is 325199, All Other Basic Organic Chemical Manufacturing. The period of performance for this procurement is 3 months. <br /><br />Cayman Chemicals is the only certified source able to provide the deuterated isotopes needed within the required time (less than four months) and with the specified purity. Other companies could only offer Carbon-13 stable isotope internal standards. Other vendors were contacted but they were unable to provide us with the specific time and compound requirements. When compared to others, Cayman Chemicals offered the required deuterated standards as needed. The other vendors were only able to synthesize C13 standards instead of the deuterated standards; &alpha;-Linolenic Acid-d14, Palmitoleic Acid-d14, and Arachidonic Acid-d18, needed to identify specific analytes for the Trans Fatty Acid Project. C13 standards are not suitable for obtaining the most accurate results in the identification and selectivity for certain analytes. Additionally, using other internal standards will decrease the method sensitivity and would require that the method be characterized all over again. This would require additional delays for several months and the use of very expensive and valuable blood plasma. Deuterated isotope standards for fatty acids require that they be provided within the specified time and at the required specifications. The manufacturing of such compounds is a very complicated process which requires a highly skilled synthetic chemist to make these compounds. Most of the companies contacted were unable to provide the compounds in a timely manner (greater than three months) because they did not have the analytical capabilities.<br />&nbsp;
<p>These compounds (materials) are urgently needed and will allow for the use of &alpha;-Linolenic Acid, Palmitoleic Acid, and Arachidonic Acid in plasma as part of our commitment to determining the amount of trans fatty acids in NHANES samples from US population. Also, only deuterated compounds can be used for these compounds because they are more structurally similar to the corresponding trans fatty acids being quantitated for our chemical analysis. Therefore acquisition of the requested deuterated compounds will allow for more sensitivity and selectivity and continuity of ongoing CDC NHANES biomonitoring project activities.<br /><br />As a result of this synopsis, no competitive solicitation will be posted on FedBizOpps. We will issue only one solicitation to Cayman Chemicals. However, all responsible sources that believe they can meet these requirements may submit their capabilities/qualifications statement to provide the services to Vallerie Redd via email ONLY at gfj3cdc.gov with the solicitation number 2011-Q-13219 referenced in the subject line NO LATER THAN February 26, 2011. <br /><br />A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action will be based on responses to this notice and are solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>

<DESC>Solicitation D11PS30218 seeks helicopter flight services for one year consisting of a Bell 205++,  Bell 214 or similar helicopter which meets the solicitation minimum aircraft requirements and which is fully Contractor operated and maintained.  The aircraft will be used to support the Bureau of Land Management, fire management programs.  The helicopter will be based at Apple Valley, CA but may also be used nationally as may be determined by dispatch entities to support and limit wildland fire emergencies.  The exclusive use period, subject to change as permitted in the solicitation, is May 20, 2011 through September 16, 2011 (120 days).  The contract includes government unilateral options of renewal for an additional four years as well as options for extension of the exclusive use period.  Potential duration of the contract could be five years. The Contractor shall possess a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certificate issued under 14 CFR Part 135, 133, and 137. The anticipated issue date of the solicitation is February 16, 2011 with a projected closing date of March 8, 2011.  It is a requirement that the successful awardee be registered in the Central Contractor Registry (CCR). The solicitation will also be available at www.amd.nbc.gov under "Current Solicitations" under Business Opportunities.  Due to a possible lack of resources from small business concerns (1500 or fewer employees), this requirement is being solicited from both small and large business concerns using the following cascading set-aside award terms.
1 All potential offerors (small and large) may submit proposals for the requirement as specified in this solicitation.  However award consideration will be made as follows:
a)  First:  In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 19.502-2(b) any award under this solicitation will be made on a competitive basis to eligible small business concerns (1500 or fewer employees), provided that a minimum of two (2) competitive offers are received from eligible and responsible small business concerns at fair market prices.  To determine fair market prices, the Government will consider the pricing from the eligible offers of the small business concerns only, the Government estimate and the historic pricing for this specific requirement with consideration for inflation of past pricing.  In the event that sufficient small business offers are received, award will be made from those small business sources and large business offers will be eliminated from further consideration for award.b) Second:  If a minimum of two (2) competitive offers from eligible and responsible small business concerns at fair market prices are not received, any award under this solicitation will be made on the basis of full and open competition on an unrestricted basis from among all eligible and responsible business concerns (small and/or large) submitting offers.  To determine fair market prices, the Government will consider the pricing of all eligible offers (small and large), the Government estimate, and the historic pricing for this specific requirement with consideration for inflation of past pricing.
This solicitation incorporates by reference FAR 52.219-6, Notice of Small Business Set-Aside.  However, because this is a cascading set-aside, to the extent that FAR 52.219-6 states that it limits competition to small businesses, that limitation applies to only the first tier of the award consideration above.

<DESC>Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) Research Opportunity Description
The Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) is interested in White Papers for long and short term Research and Development (R&D) projects that offer potential for advancement and improvements in the implementation of shipboard Integrated Power Systems (IPS) at the major component, subsystem and system level.  IPS provides total ship electric power including electric propulsion, power conversion and distribution, combat system support and ship mission load interfaces to the electric power system.  The flexibility of electric power transmission allows power generating modules with various power ratings to be connected to propulsion loads and ship service in any arrangement that supports the ship's mission at the lowest total ownership cost (TOC).  Systems engineering in IPS is focused on increasing the commonality of components used across ship types and in developing modules that will be integral to standardization, zonal system architectures, and generic shipbuilding strategies with standard interfaces that are Navy controlled.  The modules or components developed will be assessed for applicability both to next generation shipboard electrical architectures and combat systems and to back-fit opportunities that improve the energy efficiency and mission effectiveness in the current fleet.  NAVSEA wishes to continue to improve IPS by performing analysis, modeling and simulation, life cycle cost analysis, producibility studies, module development, ship integration, architecture design, ship electric architectures and support for high power weapons systems requirements, and related efforts.  An evaluation of emerging technologies for ship applications (such as fuel cells, support for high energy weapons, support for high power radars, high-speed generators, and advanced power electronics) to determine future feasibility and development requirements will be conducted.  The approach to hardware developed under this BAA is that it fosters modularity and scalability (so that families of products may be leveraged to multiple potential applications) and shall accommodate an open system architecture where interfaces are well defined and mutually accepted.
Electric Ships Office:  The Navy has initiated the Next Generation Integrated Power Systems (NGIPS) effort with centralized leadership by the Electric Ships Office (ESO).  The mission of the ESO (PMS 320, organizationally a part of the Program Executive Office - Ships) is to develop and provide smaller, simpler, more affordable, and more capable ship's power systems for all Navy platforms by defining open architectures, developing common components, and focusing Navy and industry investments.  The ESO will provide leadership of the developments identified as part of this BAA, will direct the transition of associated technologies developed by the Office of Naval Research (ONR), and will manage the technology portfolio represented by Program Element (PE) 0603573N (Advanced Surface Machinery Systems) for transition into existing and future Navy ships.  The guiding document that will be used to define the module developments that advance the NGIPS vision is the Next Generation Integrated Power System (NGIPS) Technology Development Roadmap, Naval Sea Systems Command Ser 05D/349 of 30 Nov 2007, which is publicly available under announcement N00024! 08R4123.	NGIPS:  The areas of focus for White Papers and Proposals submitted in response to this BAA should include, but are not limited to, the analysis, development, risk reduction and demonstration of future shipboard electric power systems and components, emphasizing shipboard power generation, propulsion, conversion, distribution and control; power quality, continuity, and system stability; electric power system/component level modeling and simulation; energy storage technologies; electrical system survivability; simplicity and ruggedness.  The Integrated Power Architecture provides the framework for partitioning the equipment and software of NGIPS into modules and defines functional elements and the power/control and information relationships between them.  For power generation, high power distribution, propulsion, and large loads, the NGIPS architecture includes Medium Voltage AC power (with emphasis on affordability), High Frequency AC power (with emphasis on power density in the near term), and Medium Voltage DC power (with emphasis on power density and fault management in the far term).  For ship service electrical loads, NGIPS includes zonal electrical distribution which may be either AC or DC, depending upon the specific application.  In addition to a full IPS implementation, modules that support a paritally integrated power system, or Hybrid Electric Drive (HED) where mechanical propulsion is augmented by rotating machinery off of the propulsion train for propulsion, or additional power generation shall be considered.  Also of particular interest are technologies that result in significant energy efficiency and/or carbon footprint improvements over existing propulsion and power system technologies.  The NGIPS roadmap partitions the power system components functionally into modules.  Those modules, subsystems and systems of interest include the following.
Power Generation Module (PGM):  A Power Generation functional element converts fuel into electrical power. The electrical power is transferred to one or more Power Distribution functional elements.  An associated Power Generation module might typically consist of a gas turbine or diesel engine, a generator, a rectifier (either active or passive), auxiliary support sub-modules and module controls. Other possible technologies include propulsion derived ship service (PDSS), fuel cells, or other direct energy conversion concepts.  Power Generation concepts include 60 Hz wound rotor synchronous generator driven directly by a marine gas turbine (up to 30 MVA rating); 4 pole, 120 Hz, commercially derived or militarized design variants of the above; and higher speed, higher frequency, high power density variants of the above with high speed or geared turbine drive.  The specific design issues to be considered include fuel efficiency, machine insulation system characteristics, size, weight, cost, maintainability, availability, harmonic loading, voltage, power, fault protection, interface to main or ship service bus, and commercial availability.
Power Distribution Module (PDM):  A Power Distribution functional element transfers electrical power between other functional elements. Fault protection systems should be designed, if possible, to not require the power distribution modules to communicate control signals with any functional element other than system control. An associated Power Distribution module might typically consist of bus duct, cables, switchgear and fault protection equipment.
Power Conversion Module (PCM):  A Power Conversion functional element converts electrical power from one form to another.  An associated Power Conversion module might typically consist of a solid state power converter and/or a transformer.  Advanced topologies and technologies, such as the application of wide band gap devices, will be considered.
Power Load Module (PLM):  A Power Load functional element is a user of electrical power received from one or more Power Distribution functional elements. The area of interest for NGIPS in the Power Load is the load interface definition and the provision of specialty power to optimize that load interface.  Among the special load interfaces that would require development are support for pulsed power weapons and sensors such as radar power supplies, electromagnetic launchers (for example EM Railgun), and advanced laser systems, all of which would benefit from optimized integration with the shipboard power system.  This would enable real time data and asset management and reconfiguration based on demand.
Propulsion Motor Module (PMM):  Electric propulsion motors and propulsion motor drives are large electrical loads as well as NGIPS modules.  Candidate propulsion motor concepts include Permanent Magnet Motors (radial air gap, axial air gap, or transverse flux), Induction Motors (wound rotor or squirrel cage), Superconducting field type (homopolar DC or synchronous AC).  The drivers and issues associated with these designs include acoustic signature, noise (requirements, limitations, modeling, sources, and mitigation methods), shock, vibration, coolant temperature, manufacturing infrastructure, machine insulation system characteristics, commercial commonality, platform commonality, cost, torque, power, weight, diameter, length, voltage, motor configuration, and ship arrangements constraints.  Motor drives that may be explored include cycloconverter (with variations in control and power device types), pulse width modulated converter/inverter (with many variations in topology), switching (hard switched, soft switched), and matrix converter (with variations in control, topology, cooling, power device type).  Technologies for drives and rotating machines which allow the ability to operate both as a motor and a generator to facilitate a propulsion derived ship service (PDSS) installation or on a fully integrated power system to leverage the inherent energy storage in the ship's motion may be explored. Integrated motor/propulsor concepts may be considered either as aft-mounted main propulsion or as a forward propulsor capable of propelling a ship at a tactically useful speed.
Energy Storage Module (ESM):  An Energy Storage functional element stores energy.  A number of alternative energy storage technologies and/or configurations (location within the distribution system and capacity) may be considered for future ship applications, such as battery, capacitor-based, fuel cell, fly wheel, or superconducting energy storage. Shipboard power quality and continuity along with examination of the implications of future high power/pulse power loads on configuration/technology alternatives is critical.  Energy storage modules may consist of short term (micro/milli second) or long term (minutes/hours) energy storage applications which utilize a combination of technologies to minimize power quality and continuity impacts across the system.
Power System Control (PCON):  A System Control functional element consists of the software necessary to coordinate multiple other functional elements. A System Control Functional Element receives information from other functional elements and external (non-IPS) systems. Similarly, a System Control functional element may receive control commands from or negotiate control actions with external systems and other functional elements. System Control manages the power and energy flow within the ship to ensure power is delivered to the right load in the right form at the right time.  While various forms of power control have been implemented on commercial IPS ships, the survivability requirements for military ships combined with the pulse load characteristics for some of the loads described above will require more sophisticated algorithms than are commercially available.  A System Control functional element resides on an external distributed computer system and therefore typically does not include hardware elements (unless specialized hardware is required).

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<a href="mailto:Phyllis.L.Buerstatte@usace.army.mil">USACE District, Walla Walla</a>
<DESC>Construction Project:  Units No. 3-6 Cavitation Repair at Lower Granite Dam in Whitman and Garfield Counties, Washington.  This will be a firm-fixed-price contract.  Estimated construction magnitude is between $5,000,000 and $10,000,000.  The period of performance is approximately May 2011 through April 2013, with  2 units to be repaired during May 2011-April 2012, and 2 more units during July 2012-April 2013.  100% Performance and payment bonds will be required.<BR><BR>The work consists of providing all labor, technical expertise, materials, equipment, scaffolding and appurtenances necessary to accomplish the following turbine cavitation repairs for Units 3, 4, 5, and 6 at Lower Granite Powerhouse:<BR><BR>Cavitation damage repair shall be performed on the turbine discharge ring only. A portion of the existing discharge ring material shall be ground or milled to good metal and anchoring the discharge ring/draft tube liner to the concrete. The contractor shall install 1 inch diameter reinforcement bars into the predrilled holes with epoxy-resin cartridges.  After curing, the bars will be welded to the interior surface of the discharge ring and the ends cut off and ground flush. The discharge ring shall be spot repaired, built up with mild steel weld metal, stainless steel weld overlay placed, and the discharge ring surface ground and machined to the finished profile.  There is some removal of concrete and restoration of the concrete surfaces and architectural finishes to the required lines and grades.<BR><BR>The Contractor shall refurbish the discharge rings by removing material from the existing ring by machining, sanding, or grinding methods; repair and overlay welding; and surface finishing of the welded areas by machining and/or grinding, unless otherwise approved. No more than a 1/2 inch thickness of weld material shall be uniformly laid on the discharge ring, unless otherwise approved. Localized cavitation and surface damaged areas shall also be repaired. The contractor shall provide a procedure that describes the method of monitoring the weld interpass temperature and a detailed description of the method of protection of the turbine and generator from damage due to the repair process if that process involves unit rotation (e.g., thrust and guide bearing during machine rotation for discharge machining; weld current through the thrust or guide bearing).<BR><BR>Welder qualification shall be in accordance with one of the following codes: (1) Section 4, Part C, of AWS D1.1, or (2) Section IX of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code (ASME BPVC), or (3)AWS B2.1 (for cladding), whichever is most applicable to the work being performed.<BR><BR>Cavitation repair welding will distort the discharge ring/draft tube liner causing it to pull away from the concrete behind it. The resulting voids must be filled with epoxy to absorb vibration of the discharge ring during turbine operation. The contractor will perform drilling and washing the epoxy injection holes and air relief holes; making epoxy-injection connections; furnishing, transporting, mixing and injection of the epoxy; patching the finished epoxy injection holes; clean-up of the draft tube lining and such other operations as are incidental to the drilling and epoxy-injection. Following the repair welding, the Contractor will inject a two component low viscosity epoxy resin adhesive behind the discharge ring/draft tube liner to fill voids created by distortion.<BR><BR>Runner Blades, Runner Cone, Runner Hub Repair, Seal Retainer Segments and other Water Passage Elements are optional work items that would require excavation and deposit of mild steel or 309L stainless steel to a depth that is within 1/4 to 5/16 inch of the finished surface.  This area would be finished with a stainless steel overlay.<BR><BR>Solicitation No. W912EF-11-R-0008 will be posted to the FBO website on or about February 28, 2011.  The solicitation is a Request for Proposals.  The successful offeror will be selected through the best value trade-off source selection method.

<DESC>Notice of Intent to Sole Source Requirement

The Department of Veterans Affairs, Veterans Integrated Systems Network (VISN) 1 intends to negotiate a sole source blanket purchase agreement (BPA) under the authority of FAR Part 6.302-1, only one responsible source to RGH Enterprises, Inc. dba Independence Medical.  The Department of Veterans Affairs is required to purchase medical prescriptions off of NAC Contract V797P-4439A.  The BPA is to incorporate the shipping requirements, to allow the shipment of medical supplies direct to patient's homes.  Instead of duplicating shipments, by sending two-day shipment to the Veterans Affairs Medical Centers, then resending the same shipment by two-day to the patient's home address.  By incorporating the language to allow RGH Enterprises, Inc. dba Independence Medical to mail these prescriptions directly to patient's homes, it will allow a two-day turnaround for mandatory prescription medicine, instead of four-days or longer.  

The Veterans Affairs Medical Centers Pharmacies requires a contractor with a Federal Supply contract, as an approved health care provider for shipment of prescription medical supplies and equipment with significant knowledge and expertise as well as experience in and understanding of VA healthcare pharmacy needs.  RGH Enterprises, Inc. dba Independence Medical has extensive experience with the Veteran Affairs Medical Center Pharmacies and has demonstrated timely shipment and tracking to ensure VA patients receive their prescriptions within forty (48) hours.  This vendor has a long history and positive rating with performance for the VA pharmacies.    RGH Enterprises, Inc. dba Independence Medical continues to be
the most qualified vendor for this blanket purchase agreement. Because this is a continuation of their previous work, and the anticipation of duplication of efforts or increased costs, it is more appropriate to sole source this requirement, per FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii). 

A firm fixed price blanket purchase agreement with one option year is anticipated and shall be awarded.  It is the Government's belief that only the proposed candidate possesses the required capabilities to successfully meet this requirement in a timely and cost effective manner. It is the Government's intention to solicit and negotiate with only this source.

This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes. No solicitation documents are available and telephone requests will not be accepted. However, any firm that believes it can meet these requirements may give written notice to the Contracting Officer within five (5) days from the synopsis publication date. Supporting evidence must be furnished in sufficient detail, to demonstrate the ability to comply with the above requirements. This information can be emailed to Heather Simpson at: heather.simpson3@va.gov.  Only emailed inquires are accepted.  Responses will be evaluated; however, a determination by the Government not to compete the proposed procurement based upon responses of this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>Title: Support Services for F-15 Courseware/Curriculum Development<br />Response Date: 4:00 P.M. CST, 25 Feb 2011. <br /><br />Description: <br />The Air Education and Training Command (AETC), Contracting Squadron, LGCI is seeking sources for courseware/curriculum development for the Royal Saudi Air Force (RSAF) F-15SA in support of Foreign Military Sales (FMS) acquisition program located at Randolph AFB, TX. The REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) is being issued to help determine the availability of qualified companies technically capable of meeting the Government requirement. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP), NOR IS IT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATION (RFQ). It is not to be construed as a commitment by the requesting party to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract. Responses will not be considered as proposals or quotes. No award will be made as a result of this RFI. The Government will NOT be responsible for any costs incurred by interested parties in responding to this RFI. This FedBizOps sources sought notice is strictly for market research. Acknowledgment of receipt of response will not be made, nor will respondents be notified of Government's evaluation of the information received. As a result of this RFI, the Government may issue a RFP; however, should such requirements materialize, no basis for claims against the Government shall arise as a result of a response to the RFI (e.g. use of such information as either part of its evaluation process or in developing specifications for any subsequent requirement). All respondents are requested to identify their firm's size and type of business (e.g. large business, small business, service disabled, HUB zone, 8(a), etc.) The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 611519, size standard $7.0M.
<p>The source should be capable of supporting the requirements listed below.<br />F-15SA Courseware/Curriculum Development <br />The USAF is seeking F-15SA courseware/curriculum for the following F-15SA Maintenance Specialties:<br />2A3X1A/B/C-Avionics Systems<br />2A3X3A-Tactical Aircraft Maintenance Tech<br />2A6X1-Engines<br />2A6X6-Electric/Environmental Systems<br />2W1X1E-Aircraft Armament Systems<br />2A6X3-Aircraft Egress<br />2A6X4-Fuels Systems<br />2A6X5-Hydraulic Systems<br />1P0X1-Aircrew Flight Equipment<br />2A7X1-Metals Tech<br />2A7X2-Non-Destructive Inspection<br />2A7X3-Aircraft Structural Maintenance (Sheet Metal)<br />2A0X1-Avionics/Sensors (To Include Intermediate Level Mx)<br />2A6X4-Fuels (CFTs and Ext Tanks) (To Include Intermediate Level Mx)<br /><br />Assumptions: The curriculum developer would need to possess/obtain the technical data for the F-15SA. The specialties training will either be current RSAF F-15C/D/S technicians that are cross flowing/transitioning to the F-15SA or they will be new technicians that will have graduated from a USAF Technical Training Course for their specialty and been awarded a 3-level graduation certificate. A list of the USAF Technical Training Courses is below. As such, there will be differences courses for the current F-15 C/D/S technicians and F-15SA initial qualification courses for the new technicians. For specialties such as Metals Tech, Non-Destructive Inspection, and Aircraft Structural Maintenance the intent of the training is for only F-15SA specific tasks, not general training that will be provided by the USAF. <br /><br />The courseware/curriculum for the following courses for each specialty identified above would be needed:<br /><br />1. General F-15SA Familiarization/systems courses-all identified AFSCs<br />2. F-15SA AFSC specific difference training and tasks (academic and OJT) to enable technicians to transition from F-15C/D/S aircraft to F-15SA. <br />3. F-15SA AFSC specific training and tasks (academic and OJT) for new USAF equivalent 3-Level technicians. The OJT tasks are all of those that would, upon completion to proficiency, potentially lead to award of a USAF 5 and 7 level equivalents. OJT tasks may be conducted on a F-15C/D/S model aircraft Ground Instructional Training Aircraft (GITA) (if the systems are identical/similar), aircraft maintenance training devices, and F-15SA aircraft. The intent would be maximizing the use of GITA and aircraft maintenance training devices due to F-15SA aircraft availability. OJT tasks that could only be performed on an F-15SA would need to be identified.<br />4. Engineering plant training for the following: Systems Engineering, Aircraft Structure Engineering, Aircraft Avionics Engineering, and Aircraft Weapons System Engineering.<br />5. Senior officers' familiarization course<br />The Contractor would develop and produce F-15SA maintenance courseware/curriculum and student materials. The contractor/courseware developer would need to possess/obtain F-15SA technical data as it becomes available to ensure the courseware/curriculum reflects the latest aircraft configuration and technical data.</p>
<p>The Contractor would provide a description for each course, content (academic and OJT) and length. Also, the contractor will provide recommended instructor to student ratios for classroom and OJT training. All student materials shall be based on data available under the FMS program and developed and presented IAW the country configured equipment. Basic theory is not required. <br />The courseware/curriculum and student materials will be developed to support the objective of training to provide the necessary skills to operate and maintain aircraft systems, subsystems, and related support equipment. <br />The courseware/curriculum can be a combination of instructor led classes, computer based training, and OJT tasks using contractor format.<br />The intent of the training will be to provide the students a thorough understanding of their specialty requirements so that at the end of their training they can perform tasks unsupervised as identified in the courseware/curriculum. Courseware/curriculum will include materials to support testing procedures and Structured On-The-Job Training (SOJT).</p>

<DESC>The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI)/Sources Sought is to obtain potential small business sources that can provide system support requirements, in support of the U.S. Army Food Management Information System (AFMIS).  Tasks include analysis, design, programming, modification, hardware and software technical support, system installation, business consulting, product evaluation, customer support, operations support, and program coordination.  <BR><BR>AFMIS is the management information system that supports the Army food program.  First fielded in 1989, the AFMIS is operational at 53 Army installations throughout the world, U.S. Army Reserve centers and Army National Guard armories.  AFMIS provides automation support of menu planning, meal production, ordering and receipting food, financial accounting, headcount and capital asset reporting, inventory control, contract quality assurance, and personnel accountability.  AFMIS interfaces with the Subsistence Total Order and Receipt System and the Defense Finance Accounting Service to provide financial accountability of Army food inventories.  AFMIS includes an automated headcount service which allows for diner entitlement verification and payroll deduction for meals via the common access ID card.  AFMIS is also operational in about 500 Active Army dining facilities and at about 1,700 Army Reserve and National Guard units.  AFMIS includes a decision support system (DSS) available to food program managers and logisticians at all levels of Command.<BR><BR>AFMIS is a centralized Web-based system with separate subsystems concurrently running and interfaced together on the same platform but with separate databases.   AFMIS consists of Dining Facility Operations (DFO), Troop Issue Subsistence Activity (TISA), Food Program Management (FPM), and Automated Head Count (AHC) subsystems.  The AFMIS contractor provides at least 90 percent of the AFMIS programming support.  Generally, the US Army Software Engineering Center-Lee (SEC-Lee) releases two AFMIS interim change packages (ICPs) per year.  ICPs generally include fifteen to twenty engineering change proposals (ECPs).  An ECP represents a broadly-described functional or technical requirement.  The AFMIS software is based on approximately two million lines of source code in the following programming languages:<BR><BR> 	HTML / HTM:  About 350 thousand source lines of code (KSLOC) total with about 59 new KSLOC / month.  <BR> 	CSS:  About 27 KSLOC with about 1.5 new KSLOC / month.  <BR> 	XML:  About 38 KSLOC with about 1.5 new KSLOC / month.  <BR> 	Visual Basic .NET:  About 510 KSLOC with about 18 new KSLOC / month.  <BR> 	ASPX:  About 35 KSLOC with about 1.5 new KSLOC / month.  <BR> 	RPX:  About 8 KSLOC with about 1 new KSLOC / month.  <BR> 	RESX:  About 22 KSLOC with about 6 new KSLOC / month.  <BR> 	SQL:  About 110 KSLOC with about 29 new KSLOC / month.  <BR> 	JS:  About 161 KSLOC with about 43 new KSLOC / month.  <BR> 	BAT:  About 18 KSLOC with about 1.9 new KSLOC / month.  <BR> 	XSX:  About 8 KSLOC with about 1.9 new KSLOC / month.  <BR> 	CONFIG:  About 1.9 KSLOC.<BR> 	ASMX: About 3 KSLOC<BR> 	DISCO:  About 12 KSLOC.<BR> 	WSDL:  About 392 KSLOC.<BR> 	MAP:  About 18 KSLOC.<BR> 	CS:  About 140 KSLOC.<BR><BR>Small business vendors that are interested in possibly providing these services are asked to submit the following information on the attached Excel spreadsheet:<BR><BR>1.)

<DESC>Request for Information (RFI) for Persistent Surveillance Family of Aerostat Systems<BR><BR>This request for information (RFI) is for planning purposes only and shall not be considered as an invitation for bid, request for quotation, request for proposal, or as an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any products or services. Your response to this RFI will be treated as information only. No entitlement to payment, of direct or indirect costs, or charges by the Government will arise as a result of a contractor's submission of a response to this announcement or the Government's use of such information. This request does not constitute a solicitation for proposals or the authority to enter into negotiations to award a contract. The information provided may be used by the Government in developing its acquisition strategy and statement of work/statement of objectives and performance specifications. Interested parties are responsible for marking proprietary or competition sensitive information contained within their response.  <BR><BR>The Product Manager Robotic and Unmanned Sensors is conducting market research to determine the status of currently available products and technologies capable of providing an affordable, low cost material solution for a family of aerostat-based persistent surveillance systems. The Government is interested in two classes of aerostat system, medium and large, as described below:<BR><BR>Medium class systems must fly at least 1650 feet above ground level (AGL) given site elevation of 5500 feet above mean-sea-level (MSL), carrying two Mid-size electro-optic/infrared (EO/IR) sensors and having additional lifting capacity of 50 lb and 500 W power for integration of future payloads.  Medium class systems must be capable of maintaining continuous mission operations, without recovering the aerostat, for at least 10 days. The Mid-size EO/IR sensor must meet the following: Detection FOV > 6.5 degrees diagonal FOV - Detection of vehicle size targets with 70% probability, 9.0 Km minimum.

Eye safe laser range-finder range must be from 500 m to 10Km (mid-size), 30 Km (large size).  Laser illuminator should be compatible with NVGs and have constant and pulse capability.<BR>Additional, the aerostat systems must broadcast at least one channel of full motion video to One System Remote Video Terminals (OSRVTs).<BR>Systems must be transportable by air (C-17), road, and ship. Systems must be capable of being set-up or disassembled within 72 hours on a prepared site. Systems must be capable of operating in at least 50 knot sustained winds and surviving 70 knot sustained winds when moored.  <BR><BR>Payload Subsystem/Gondola. Systems must have a modular and flexible payload support structure that permits substituting other government-furnished equipment (GFE) payloads as required.  The payload support structure must include payload power distribution and network/data interface.  It should include 5 rack units (8.75" high) of 19" rack space for housing additional payloads.  Note that a GFE sensor may replace one EO/IR sensor depending on SWAP allocation.  Family of systems mission payload capabilities may include but are not limited to: ground/dismount moving target indicator radar (GMTI/DMTI), wide area motion imagery (WAMI) sensor, tactical communications relay (EPLRS, SINCGARS, PRC-117G), and/or broadband data links or other voice or data communications.<BR><BR>Aerostat Subsystem. The aerostat subsystem includes an aerostat envelope, tether, power distribution, navigation system and aerostat avionics. Systems must comply with Federal Aviation Regulation 101 for moored balloons. <BR><BR>Ground Control Subsystem. The ground control subsystem (GCS) must be a containerized relocatable shelter providing an environmentally controlled space for operator personnel, command and control workstations for the installed payloads, and aerostat control and monitoring components.  The GCS must be designed to handle video data classified up to the SECRET level. The GCS must include independent operator workstations for the command and control of each EO/IR sensor.  The GCS must provide storage capacity for 30 days of video from each sensor.  The GCS should include 26 rack units (45.5" high) of 19" rack space, as well as power, cooling and interface for ground equipment required to support additional payloads.  The GCS must be capable of communicating with the supported unit via chat or secure voice-over-internet-protocol (SVOIP), and must be capable of integrating SINCGARS radios for tactical communications if provided by the supported unit.<BR><BR>Ground Sensors.  Systems must be capable of interfacing with unattended transient acoustic MASINT sensor (UTAMS) and using the input from these sensors to cross-cue the EO/IR sensors.<BR><BR>Mooring Subsystem.  The mooring subsystem anchors the aerostat to the ground and contains the facilities for launching and recovering the aerostat.  <BR><BR>Power Generation and Distribution.  Because aerostat family systems must be capable of operating in a stand-alone environment, they must include equipment necessary to generate, condition and distribute power to all subsystems. The contractor may be directed to employ MEP-806B tactical quiet generators provided as GFE.  Systems should also be capable of operating off of shore power if available.<BR><BR>Site Support Equipment. Systems must be self-contained and stand-alone, meaning they must include all tools and support equipment.  Systems should contain equipment necessary to setup/deploy the system.  Systems must contain the equipment necessary to operate and maintain the system on a daily basis for an extended deployment. <BR><BR>Recommended RFI Response Format<BR>Interested parties possessing relevant qualifications are requested to provide an unclassified white paper describing the following information:<BR><BR>1.

The printers will be used to print DOD shipping documentation for DOD distribution operations operated or supported by the Defense Logistics Agency Distribution Operations Warehouse Management System (WMS) DSS. <br />The purpose of this Request for Information is to determine the next generation of laser printer to support this WMS, broaden market competition and determine the most cost effective and efficient approach to print shipping documentation at the DOD Distribution Centers. <br />CURRENTLY:<br />&bull; The current platform prints from a large IBM 390/MVS series like mainframe database using TCP/IP Line Printer Daemon (LPD) protocol from a VTAM Printer Support (VPS) system as a printer driver/spooler. The print traffic is directed to the 802.3 (100BASEX) TCP/IP net card on a printer that is separately addressable or may be connected directly to a workstation via USB.
<p>&bull; The current print traffic requires the printing of various barcode symbology to include 3 of 9, 128, PDF417 (2 dimensional), micro-PDF417(2 dimensional) and at possibly in the future data matrix (2 dimensional). Embedded in that barcode are significant unprintable characters as defined by Industry MH10 format, that are printable embedded in 2D barcodes.</p>
<p>&bull; The current print data streams originate in the mainframe system and are of PCL6 or (Kyocera Print Language) KPL format or PCL/KPL mixed. As there is no apparent simple industry standard command for linear barcode and 2 dimensional barcodes; barcodes are in KPL format embedded in PCL format. Therefore the print stream/data stream is mixed PCL/KPL on the same page.</p>
<p>SPECIFICS:<br />&bull; The recommended print system must have an Ethernet and TCP/IP ability (net card) as well as USB embedded on the printers. There is potential for a requirement to be IPv6.</p>
<p>&bull; Net cards must meet the requirements of the most recent DOD regulation for net card security. Printers must be SNMP V3 capable. DHCP capable and if necessary password protect the configuration.</p>
<p>&bull; Recommended print system must be capable of printing those 1D and 2D barcodes correctly. Recommended Print System may or may not use KPL or PCL, either or both or mixed in the same print stream/data stream/command set. It may use POSTSCRIPT or other native languages. The print stream/data stream/command set must be scalable; the print stream/data stream that works on the larger one must be able to work on the smaller.</p>
<p>&bull; No color print is anticipated at this time, but should be available with a change in print platform to a color printer and slight adjustment of the print stream/data stream/command set. Color printing would come from the different print programs.</p>
<p>&bull; Printers must support default landscape 132 column text print and be able to automatically switch between text and graphics at a page break.</p>
<p>&bull; Because of the large volume of possible print traffic, a separate server system (middleware) solution that captures the print stream/data stream and inserts into the stream the appropriate PCL, POSTSCRIPT, other native to a particular printer barcode sequence commands or actual graphics at the appropriate point may be considered only if it meets the constraints of a very large worldwide print process with no lost performance.</p>
<p>&bull; A separate but similar solution is requested that requires print through a web page to a windows workstation and prints to a physical or logically attached printer using the workstations/windows print drivers is requested. It should be the same printer(s) as defined for LPD print above.</p>
<p>&bull; The manufacturer recommended printer consumables must meet the requirements of the Buy American Acts.</p>
<p>&bull; Printers recommended in this solution must be able to meet the requirements of the Affirmative (Green) procurement initiatives.</p>
<p>&bull; Printers may meet the current print stream/data stream/command set requirements as in use today or may have their own print stream/data stream/command set or may do a conversion in an embedded or attached conversion or instruction physical electronic as long as it meets the current print requirements (text, graphics and barcodes) and provide the same print performance response.</p>
<p>&bull; A print solution that requires a conversion in a workstation software to accomplish the barcode printing will not be considered.</p>

<p>8. REASON FOR THIS REQUIREMENT:</p>
<p>Pursuant to FAR Part 36, the Forest Services is establishing data files for Architect-Engineer (AE) contractors interested in doing work in the Forest Service North East Zone which includes the states of New Hampshire, New York, Pennsylvania and Vermont. The projects awarded will be less than $150,000 and will fall within one of the NAICS descriptions shown on this notice. It is our belief that the short selection process will improve the competitive opportunity for participation by local firms in the vicinity of the individual project(s) as the requirements are known. We anticipate the need for a variety of AE services. Examples of some of the types include bridges, culvert design, low volume road design, small warehouse design, office rehabs to improve energy usage and safety, design of repairs to small dams, design of renewable energy systems, design of high efficiency replacement HVAC systems, design of electrical systems, lighting, water and waste water systems, performance of sanitary inspections for water systems and safety inspections for bridges and dams, construction inspection, drafting services, survey8ing, geotechnical investigation and environmental (RCRA, CECRLA, CWA) reviews, inventories, audits, campgrounds and small out buildings.</p>
<p>9. WHAT IS THE SHORT SELECTION PROCESS?</p>
<p>When projects come up that are estimated to cost less than $150,000 agencies may review current data files for eligible AE firms, perform a technical review and evaluation to determine the 3 most highly qualified firms and have discussion with the 3 firms to determine the best qualified firm for a particular project. A price proposal will be requested from the highest rated firm. If a reasonable price cannot be negotiated, discussions will be held with the second best qualified firm and son. The data files will be maintained by State and NAICS code. The AE's ability to provide licensed professionals in the State where the project is located and the firm's geographic proximity and knowledge of the local area as identified in the AE's SF 330 and supplemental information will be used for the preliminary screening of firms when a large list of potential firms exist.</p>
<p>WHAT DOES MY FIRM NEED TO SUBMIT TO DETERMINE ELIGIBILITY AND RECEIVE CONSIDERATION FOR FUTURE AE PROJECTS?</p>
<p>Submit one copy of each of the following documents for EACT STATE and NAICS code of interest. Each submission should be in a separate envelope with the State and NAICS clearly marked on the outside of the envelope. Failure to follow this direction may result in miss filing of your submission.</p>
<p>1. Page 1 of this Short Selection Sources Sought Solicitation: complete Item 3 and Item 6, circle NAICS Code/Description for which you are qualified.</p>
<p>2. CCR Print Out: Central Contractor Registration is required for award of federal contracts. www.ccr.gov - search database for your firm and print out results. You must be registered in CCR and accept electronic payments in order to be considered for any contract awards.</p>

<DESC>NASA/LaRC is hereby soliciting information about potential sources with thecapabilities to design, fabricate, test, calibrate, and deliver multiple Infrared (IR)Suites consisting of a Fourier Transform Spectrometer (FTS) covering 5-50 microns(2000-200 cm-1) and an on-orbit calibration and verification system in support of theClimate Absolute Radiance and Refractivity Observatory Mission (CLARREO) mission.  Seehttp://clarreo.larc.nasa.gov/  for additional information.No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If asolicitation is released it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps and on the NASA AcquisitionInternet Service.  It is the potential offerors responsibility to monitor these sitesfor the release of any solicitation or synopsis.Responses must include the following:  name and address of firm, size of business;average annual revenue for past 3 years and number of employees; ownership; whether theyare large, small, small disadvantaged, 8(a), HUBZone, and/or woman-owned; number of yearsin business; affiliate information:  parent company, joint venture partners, potentialteaming partners, prime contractor (if potential sub) or subcontractors (if potentialprime); list of customers covering the past five years (highlight relevant workperformed, contract numbers, contract type, dollar value of each procurement; and pointof contact - address and phone number).  Technical questions should be directed to:  AlanLittle at (757) 864-1656. Procurement related questions should be directed to: BradGardner at (757) 864-2525.CLARREO is a climate-focused mission. The foundation for CLARREO is its ability toproduce accurate climate records through the use of exacting traceability of theinstrument measurements to international metrology standards.  The CLARREO mission is intended to meet climate measurement needs through carefulconsideration of the instrument design, calibration traceability at all stages ofdevelopment and operation, and spectral, spatial, and temporal sampling focusedspecifically on the creation of accurate, long-term climate data records. Currentsatellite based sensors do not meet the rigorous accuracy requirements needed toestablish climate data records capable of detecting and attributing decadal change. CLARREO is one of several Decadal Survey missions defined in 2007 in a report issued bythe National Research Council (NRC). NASA Langley is implementing the CLARREO mission,one of four Tier 1 missions identified in the Decadal Survey. CLARREOs projected LaunchReadiness Date is 2018.  A key element of a successful mission will be showing thatCLARREOs measurements meet the requirements defined by the Decadal Survey for accuracyand traceability to international measurement standards, for the duration of the mission. The key characteristic of the CLARREO IR instruments is that they must be stable andcharacterizable to a level approximately an order of magnitude better than current flightsensors.  The design and fabrication of these sensors must allow for calibration to therequired absolute accuracies, without inducing artifacts or other systematic errors thatviolate these requirements. The purpose of this sources sought market survey is to identify possible instrumentproviders and potential subcontractors for the IR suite and assess their ability todeliver instruments that meet the performance requirements and constraints as follows.	The infrared instrument suite consists of an infrared spectrometer and a performanceverification system that is used to maintain Systme International (SI) traceability onorbit. The infrared spectrometer includes an internal full field blackbody calibrationsource; a single-axis scan mirror used to select between deep space, calibration, earth,and verification system views; fore and aft optics; a Fourier transform spectrometer ascurrently baselined for the spectrometer core; the detector assemblies; and associatedelectronics. The scan mirror will also provide image motion compensation of Earth scenesdue to the spacecraft orbital motion. The verification system includes a variabletemperature full-field blackbody source (VBB), a system for providing on-orbitSI-traceable calibration of the VBB temperature sensors, a system for measuring the VBBcavity emissivity, a full-field monochromatic source for verifying instrument line shape,and an alternate space view used to quantify polarization effects.The conceptual spectrometer requirements are:1) Frequency range: 200-2000 cm-1 (2760 cm-1 goal, with extended range at relaxedradiometric performance and resolution);2) Spectral resolution: 0.5 cm-1 (unapodized for FTS);3) Single spectrum precision: better than 1K in brightness temperature to enable timelyestimation of measurement bias;4) Absolute accuracy of seasonal global mean: 0.1K (coverage factor k=3) in brightnesstemperature over the range of Earth scenes.The conceptual field of view (FOV) requirements are:1) Instantaneous field of view (IFOV): 25 km, single pixel, nadir view only;2) Ground track distance between IFOV: 200 km, corresponding roughly to 30 secondsbetween Earth views.The ground sampling scheme of a single 25 km pixel every 200 km provides sampling ofnatural variability sufficient to produce meaningful global seasonal averages.The conceptual accommodation requirements are:1) Mass: 75 kg;2) Power: 125 W average, 235 W peak;3) Volume: 0.3 m3.These accommodation requirements are compatible with launch on a small to medium classlaunch vehicle such as a Minotaur IV.* Minimum Operational life: 3 years* Nominal Orbit Altitude: 609 kilometers* Orbit: Earth orbiting, 90 degree polar inclination* Risk classification of "C" should be assumed per NASA Procedural Requirement (NPR)8705.4 Risk Classification for NASA PayloadsThe tentative Instrument Development Schedule for the IR follows:Contract Award  5/2012PDR  9/2012CDR  12/2013IR #1 Delivery  10/2016IR #2 Delivery  03/2017IR #3 Delivery 04/2017Instrument Funding Constraints:The overall mission and instrument funding is highly constrained such that minimal copycosts of the instruments are required to fit within the planned budgets. Responses to this sources sought synopsis will allow NASA to assess the capabilities ofpotential vendors to design, fabricate, test, calibrate, and deliver the complete IRinstrument suites per the performance requirements and other constraints describedherein. The Project is also interested in potential suppliers of instrument subsystemssuch as spectrometers, optics, detectors, and calibration sources and ground supportequipment such as calibration facilities. Responses shall be limited to 25 pages andinclude the following:1)	Capabilities as related to workforce experience and adequacy of facilities.2)	Current vendor capacity with regard to workforce and facility availability todevelop the IR instruments within the required timeframe.3)	Ability to deliver three space flight instruments per the schedule above.4)	Vendor provided recommended approach for development of IR instrument.5)	Vendor provided cost, schedule, and workforce estimates.6)	Willingness to agree to fully expose all design aspects and details to thegovernment, transfer full intellectual property rights to the government, and deliver alldrawings, requirements, specifications, procedures, plans, and analyses to thegovernment. 7)	Willingness to have the government participate as an active member of the testand characterization team for the engineering models and flight units. 8)	Past cost, schedule, and technical performance on similar instruments.9)	Identification subcontracting opportunities for Small, Small Disadvantaged,Women-Owned small, Historically Black Colleges and Universities, HUBZone Small,Veteran-Owned Small and Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business Concerns. NASA isinterested in responses from both potential prime contractors as well as potentialsubcontractors. The NAICS Code and Size Standard are 541712 and 1500 employeesrespectively.This synopsis is for information and planning purposes and is not to be construed as acommitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for information solicited.Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation.   The Government reserves the right to consider a small business or 8(a) set-aside based onresponses hereto.

<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>
<p>The National Cancer Institute (NCI) Center for Strategic Scientific Initiatives (CSSI) Office of the Director (CSSI-OD or the Office) has as its mission the task of planning, developing, executing, and implementing rapid strategic scientific and technology initiatives that keep the Institute ahead of the scientific curve with respect to potential new highly productive areas and discoveries. This may involve the development and application of advanced technologies, synergy of large scale and individual initiated research, and/or forging novel partnerships that emphasize innovation, trans-disciplinary teams and convergence of scientific disciplines to enable the translation of discoveries into new interventions, both domestically and in the international arena, to detect, prevent and treat cancer more effectively. <br /><br />Under the leadership of the NCI CSSI-OD, several efforts are supported both within NCI and outside of NCI to carry-out its function of supporting timely execution and implementation of activities that have trans-NCI benefit. The Office is responsible for coordinating trans-NIH efforts through implementation of interagency and public private collaborations to enable progress against cancer. For example, the NCI-FDA Interagency Oncology Task Force (IOTF) focuses on the identification of scientific and process gaps in the regulatory pathways for cancer interventions and development of joint science-based approaches to addressing these barriers. Also, the Cancer Steering Committee of the Foundation for NIH (FNIH) Biomarkers Consortium is a public private partnership including NCI, FDA, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), academia, the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, and advocates which plans and implements projects to develop and qualify biomarkers for use in accelerating oncology drug development and improving cancer patient management.<br /><br />Within the Center, CSSI-OD oversees several Offices which together aims to accelerate our understanding of cancer and best practices in research and treatment via cutting edge technologies that take advantage of collaborative efforts to transfer knowledge and insights available from a spectrum of basic and applied research through programs and offices that include: (1) The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Program Office; (2) Office of Cancer Nanotechnology Research; (3) Office of Cancer Clinical Proteomics Research; (4) Office of Physical Sciences-Oncology; (5) Office of Biorepositories and Biospecimen Research; (6) Office of Cancer Genomics; (7) Knowledge Management and Special Projects Branch; (8) Center for Global Cancer Health Research. These offices support extramural research programs and lead standards and policy development initiatives with the goal of accelerating advances in biomedical technology and furthering the vision of personalized medicine.<br /><br />The increasing success and development of these strategic scientific initiatives has created a requirement for a wide and changing spectrum of expertise that can be applied to support the efforts of CSSI, including activities in such areas as drug and device development, biomarker development and validation for use in drug development, U.S. regulatory requirements for investigational new drugs and investigational new devices, standard operating procedures for clinical laboratory research, clinical considerations in imaging probe development, clinical trial design in the development of biomarkers and imaging modalities as biomarkers that can be used in drug development, treatment, and monitoring of therapeutic responses. <br /><br />Effort anticipated under this requirement could include, but not be limited to, continuation of assistance for CSSI-OD and CSSI Offices by providing scientific and project planning support for activities which require expertise in oncology, drug development, advanced technologies applied to drug and device development, biomarker science, and imaging technologies, regulatory affairs, research project management, clinical trial management, business plan development, scientific writing, meeting implementation, and general business documentation.</p>

Introduction - This is a combined Small Business Sources Sought Notice/ Notice of Availability of Request For Proposals.  The purpose of the Small Business Sources Sought Notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 541712 for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether any type of set-aside is appropriate. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.  The Government will review capability statements, which may not exceed fifteen (15) type-written pages excluding references, and will use the information to determine the basis. e.g. full and open competition or restricted competition, on which to release the RFPAlthough the Government has not yet decided the basis on which it will release the solicitation, the purpose of the Notice of Availability of Request For Proposal is to provide the opportunity to potentially qualified sources to express interest in the requirement and request a copy of the solicitation, which will be released as solicitation number NIHES2011121 on or about March 1, 2011.  Proposals will be due on or about March 30, 2011.  On or about February 25, 2011the Government will issue an amendment to this synopsis notice to convey the basis on which it will release the solicitation.Background - There has been little research of the long-term health effects from oil spills despite the fact that between 1970 and 2009, there were 356 spills of more than 700 tons from oil tankers, with approximately 38 of these spills affecting coastal populations [International Tanker Owners Pollution Federation Limited (ITOPF) 2009, Aguilera, et al. 2010]. The Deepwater Horizon disaster, with its release of approximately 5 million barrels (~680,000 tons) of crude oil into the Gulf of Mexico, is far larger than any of these tanker spills. Given the magnitude of this spill and the scope of the potential exposures  at least 100,000 workers involved in clean-up efforts and countless residents of the affected areas  study of the human health effects of this spill is urgently needed to monitor Gulf clean-up workers and to understand the adverse consequences of oil spills in general.  On April 20, 2010, the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig exploded, starting an oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. On June 15, 2010, the NIH Director announced that NIH will devote at least $10 million to support research on the potential health effects of the oil spill caused by the explosion of the Deepwater Horizon offshore drilling rig in the Gulf of Mexico.NIEHS is taking the lead in designing a large prospective health study of oil spill clean-up workers and volunteers. The NIEHS has hosted a series of community forums, stakeholder visits, webinars and instructional meetings throughout the 5-state Gulf region in order to promote awareness, participation and coordination for all these programs among local residents, state and local health departments, regional universities and researchers, and federal agency partners.Separately, NIEHS, in partnership with several NIH Institutes/Centers/Offices, issued a Request for Applications (RFA) to create community-based participatory consortia of university-community partners to address the health issues of concern to the Gulf residents.  It is anticipated that the outcomes of these programs will provide better understanding of the interplay and impact of multiple stressors on human health and well-being and the potential underlying mechanisms for effects observed. In addition, the findings will establish the evidence base needed to inform recovery and to develop strategies to prevent illness and promote the health and well-being of populations faced in this and other future man-made and natural disasters. NIEHS is also currently supporting research and outreach efforts related to the health effects of exposure to oil and dispersants. (http://www.niehs.nih.gov/about/od/programs/gulfstudygrantees/index.cfm).To expedite research on the potential health effects of the oil spill, British Petroleum (BP) contributed $10 million to a NIH gift fund.  The NIH will use some of these funds to supplement its support for the long-term study of clean-up workers.   NIEHS has initiated pilot GuLF STUDY activities which are being performed by Constella/SRA, under an NIEHS contract for Clinical Research Support Services, contract number HHSN291200555553C.  The completion date is September 29, 2011. Purpose and Objectives - The purpose of this project is to design and conduct a large, long term prospective health study of Gulf oil spill clean-up workers and volunteers. Clean-up workers are likely to be the most heavily exposed of all population groups in the Gulf coast region with adverse effects occurring earlier, and more severely than in the general population.  The study will focus on exposure to oil and dispersant products and potential health consequences such as respiratory, neurobehavioral, carcinogenic, and immunological conditions. The study will also evaluate mental health concerns and other oil spill-related stressors such as job loss, family disruption, and financial uncertainties. Project Requirements  Under the contract NIEHS will seek to enroll approximately 55,000 people studying its long-term cohort study. Building on an extensive roster of cleanup workers developed by NIOSH, the NIEHS has supplemented the roster with other lists of workers compiled by BP, contractors and community organizations by targeting Gulf community members and members of the Coast Guard and National Guard who were involved in clean-up efforts, and Gulf community members who completed the worker safety training but did not do clean-up work. All study participants will be asked to complete a telephone questionnaire about their oil-spill clean-up experience and current health. After the initial questionnaire, about 20,000 individuals will be selected and invited to participate in an Active Follow-up portion of the study and provide additional health information and participate in a clinical home visit.  This group will also complete periodic telephone interviews to update changes in health status. The study will try to enroll workers with varying levels of exposure. For example, workers involved in oil burning, skimming and booming, equipment decontamination, wildlife cleanup, and also those with lower exposure such as shore-line cleanup workers. Individuals enrolled in the Active part of this long-term study will be interviewed by local community staff. Blood and urine will be collected. Hair, toenails, saliva, and household dust samples may also be collected and stored for future analyses. Other health assessments will include blood pressure, height, weight, waist size, and lung function. NIEHS intends to follow study participants for at least ten years and will ask them to complete follow-up health questionnaires. The information that all study participants provide will be cross-referenced over time with other health records such as vital statistics and cancer registries. Some individuals will be invited to participate in more comprehensive medical examinations. Anticipated Period of Performance  The Government anticipates initiation of contract performance in mid August, 2011, with a base period of performance of five (5) years, with options for four (4) more years, for a potential of nine (9) total years of contract performance.  The Government anticipates project overlap of approximately two (2) months with the pilot study.Other Important Considerations  This is a human subject research study and will operate under a non-exempt IRB approved protocol.  The contractor will be required to hold a human subjects assurance from the NIH Office of Protection from Research Risks.  The contractor will be required to demonstrate involvement of Gulf Coast communities and institutions, preferably in the affected region.

<DESC>In accordance with FAR 6.302-1: Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Canberra Industries Inc., Meriden, CT for an Alpha Analyst.  This equipment is required in order to add additional lab analysis counting capacity for the Center for Radioanalysis and Quality Assurance (CRQA).
The primary instrument used by CRQA to detect alpha particles in samples, is the Canberra Alpha Analyst.  The Alpha Analyst has twelve chambers that can accommodate 12 samples at a time. The Alpha Analyst counts the sample using an A300-17AM ALPHA PIPS detectors. The detector intercepts the particle, records it, and categorizes it by energy value. The Alpha Analyst places the energy into a specific energy bin, which will be correlated to a specific isotope. The APEX Alpha system records the counts on the computer, into the records database, for the operators to review.
The specifics of this requirement include:1.	One (1) Alpha Analyst 12 Input Bench Top (Model 7200-12).2.	Twelve (12) A300-17AM Alpha Pips Detectors (Model PA30017).3.	Delivery and Installation of equipment.4.	Familiarization of laboratory staff with the equipment.
The lab where this detector will be installed has all Canberra counting equipment and software.  The required equipment under this solicitation must provide seamless integration into the laboratory.  Equipment that does not provide seamless integration is consider unacceptable, as funding and personnel constraints do not currently allow the retraining of staff to use new systems/software.
The intent of this notice is to determine if any additional source(s) exists and, therefore, no Request for Proposal (RFP) is available.  All responsible sources may submit a response which, if received by the due date, will be considered.  All interested parties who believe they can provide the required supplies/services should fully explain their capabilities in writing.  Any response(s) failing to provide aforementioned data but instead choosing to merely submit a routine letter, or calling and requesting a FAX copy of an RFP will be ignored.  Submit your response so that it is received no later than 28 February 2011, noon, EST to U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, RTP-POD, 109 T.W. Alexander Dr., Attn: Andrew Flynn, E105-02, Research Triangle Park, NC 27711.  Courier Delivery Address is:  Environmental Protection Agency, RTP-POD, 4930 Page Road, Attn: Andrew Flynn, E105-02, Research Triangle Park, NC 27703.  Responses may also be emailed to Andrew Flynn at flynn.andrew @epa.gov.

<DESC>NOTICE OF CONTRACT ACTION: INTENT TO AWARD SOLE SOURCE PROCUREMENT FOR ADVANCED POLYMER MATERIALS. This is an announcement that the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) intends to award a new Sole Source contract. The Materials and Manufacturing Directorate, Systems Support Division (AFRL/RXS), is contemplating the award of an indefinite delivery indefinite quantity (IDIQ) Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF) and Firm-Fixed Price (FFP) contract to The University of Dayton Research Institute for the program entitled "Advanced Polymer Materials" under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, "Only One Responsible Source". The anticipated contract NTE value is $24.5M for a period of performance of 72 months.
<p>Under the contemplated contract, University of Dayton Research Institute (UDRI) will perform test, evaluation, and integration of advanced polymer materials, including, but not limited to, pretreatments, coatings, gap filters, films, sealants, and adhesives. Test, evaluation and integration also include the evaluation of new and/or modified polymer materials, equipment and processes. UDRI will provide testing that follows the requirements of Air Force technical orders, military specifications, and commercial specifications, as well as customized testing when needed within the Coatings Technology Integration Office (CTIO) test facility. UDRI will professionally operate and maintain all the test equipment located within the CTIO test facility and use accredited processes and equipment. Along with testing and evaluation services, this contract requires a "Quick Response" capability that enables the Air Force to receive answers to their urgent technical problems quickly and accurately.<br /><br />The advanced polymer products developed (specifically coatings technologies) must comply with military and commercial specifications before use on an AF weapon system. Some of the required commercial specifications are maintained through the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) G-8, Aerospace Coating subcommittee. For a laboratory to perform testing for the purpose of qualifying to these specifications, the SAE G-8 subcommittee requires that the laboratory maintain ISO 17025 and SAE AS5505 accreditations. These accreditations are specifically associated with CTIO facility, equipment and personnel and are not transferrable. The CTIO has a unique facility not duplicated elsewhere, which is critical to the accomplishment of its mission. The CTIO paint booth, which is controllable for temperature and humidity across the complete range of environmental conditions seen in Air Force operations, is an essential asset for accomplishment of the CTIO mission. Also, the CTIO has the largest installation of xenon arc test chambers in the United States (US), giving it a unique capability for testing exterior durability of advanced polymer systems.</p>
<p>There is also a classified component of the work performed within the Special Test and Research (STAR) facility (physically located within the same building as CTIO). The facility is in support of test, evaluation, integration of advanced polymer materials, equipment, and processes involved in the support of those materials. The advanced polymer materials include, but are not limited to, coatings, sealants, gap fillers, adhesives, elastomers, composites, RAMs, films, and leveling compounds.</p>
<p>If deemed necessary, the contractor may also perform research and development of new/improved laboratory test procedures, and analytical and modeling techniques for material performance determination and characterization.<br />Vendors who are capable of providing the services stated above shall fully identify their interest and submit, in writing, information documenting their qualifications and capabilities to meet the requirements stated above no later than 3:00 PM, Eastern Daylight Time, on the fifteenth day after publication of this synopsis. Responses must be submitted to Lori Shirdon, Contract Negotiator, via email at Lori.Shirdon@wpafb.af.mil, or Louis Nyikon, Louis.Nyikon@wpafb.af.mil. Responses received after 15 days or without the required information will be considered non-responsive to the synopsis and will not be considered. Responses shall be no more than 10 pages in length. Page size shall be 8.5 x 11 inches; foldouts are permitted but will be assessed towards total page count. Pages shall be single-spaced, single-sided. The font shall be Times New Roman and the font size shall be no less than 12 point. Margins for each page shall be at least 1 inch on the top and bottom and &frac34; inch side margins. Submitting your company brochure is not an adequate response. The government recognizes that proprietary data may be submitted in response to the Notice; if so, clearly mark any such proprietary data. Responses should include the following information within the 10 page limit:</p>

<DESC>Request for Information (RFI)
Please note that RFI Number W15QKN-11-Z-A002 hereby replaces RFI Number 
W15QKN-11-Z-A001 in its entirety.  The US Army Contracting Command-Picatinny,
on behalf of the US Army Office of Project Manager (OPM) Combat Ammunition
Systems (CAS) - Technical Management Division (TMD), is requesting information
regarding mature capabilities of industry/government agencies to provide
possible cost-effective 155mm metal parts processing technologies implemented
on cannon launched artillery projectile casings resulting in controlled 
fragmentation against both personnel and materiel target sets. The metal part
processing technology must result in no degradation of IM performance nor 
reduction in the structural integrity/safety of the projectile. Capabilities 
of interest include increased effectiveness and/or enhanced lethality with 
controlled fragmentation achieved by metal part processing implemented on a 
155 mm projectile that can withstand the high cannon launch g-level (>18kG). 
This capability must be mature at a demonstrated Technology Readiness Level 
(TRL) of 6 or higher and easily/cost-effectively integrated with established 
US large caliber indirect fire munitions infrastructure without loss of 
throughput or manufacturability. TRL 6 is defined as a system/subsystem model 
or prototype demonstration in a relevant environment. TRL 6 is described as a 
representative model or prototype system that is tested in a relevant 
environment. It represents a major step up in a technologys demonstrated 
readiness. Examples include successfully testing the capability on a 155 mm 
prototype in a High-G cannon-launched relevant environment. 
The white paper should include a description of the capability addressing all the above characteristics, its technical maturity based on TRL with auditable
fact-based test results supporting this assessment, and the point of contact (POC), telephone number, and email address. Please do not include corporate 
capabilities, technologies still requiring development/maturation to achieve TRL 6, or past performance discussions. White papers must be submitted to 
Government POCs no later than 25 February 2011. Selected vendors will be 
contacted via email on or about 2 March 2011 to schedule a follow-up meeting.
Specific questions generated from the white paper will be provided and are 
required to be addressed as part of the follow up meeting. This request for information (RFI) if for planning purposes only, and does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP). It is not to be construed as a 
commitment by the U.S. Government. No award will be made because of this 
request for information. If a formal solicitation is issued at a later date, a 
solicitation notice will be published. Responses should be submitted by 4:00 p.m. (Eastern Time) on Friday, 25 
February 2011.  The subject of the mail message shall be: Request for
Information for 155mm Metal Parts Processing Technologies , Your Companys
Name. All responses must be submitted via e-mail to the attention of Renee
Prendergast at renee.prendergast@us.army.mil. Acknowledgement of receipt will
be issued.

<DESC>Introduction:  Pursuant to FAR Subpart 13.106-1(b)(1), the U.S. Army RDECOM Contracting Center, Natick Contracting Division, on behalf of the  PM SOF intends to award a firm fixed price purchase order on a sole source basis to: Armor Designs Inc. 4645 35th St, Phoenix, AZ 85045<BR><BR>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.  No solicitation document is available. <BR>1) FAR Statutory Authority cited: 13.106-1(b)(1) only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.<BR><BR>2) Nature and description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs:  PM-SOF Survival, Support & Equipment Systems (PM-SOF SSES) has an urgent need to purchase 15 body armor plates exclusively for test and evaluation in support of USSOCOM body armor requirements. The proposed body armor plates are a significant reduction in weight from similar USSOCOM body armor currently used on the battlefield. These items will not be fielded for use by operators under combat conditions. The intent is to award a Firm Fixed Price type contract for $50,000.00. <BR><BR>3) A demonstration that the proposed contractor is the only source available to provide these services or goods (i.e. unique qualifications, proprietary rights, etc.): Armor Designs, Inc. has presented an unsolicited proprietary proposal and proprietary plate design for USSOCOM evaluation that may be a significant reduction in weight from similar USSOCOM body armor currently used on the battlefield. <BR>  <BR>4) A description of the market research that was conducted and the results, or a statement of the reason a market research was not conducted:  Market research has been conducted in Oct 2010 at AUSA and Jan 2011 at The Shot Show on numerous companies and no similar items were available. The purchase is for a small quantity of plates, solely for research and development testing and evaluation.<BR>	 <BR>5) Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition: Body armor is a special purpose Life Support Clothing and Equipment (LSC&E) item that has saved the lives of numerous USSOCOM operators fighting in the Global War on Terror (GWOT). Any effort to enhance the survivability by decreasing the current weight and providing the operator better mobility and agility should be considered a top priority. The proposed material solution may meet these objectives.<BR><BR>6) A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required:  Not feasible at our level.<BR><BR><BR> <BR><BR>Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement to the U.S. Army RDECOM Contracting Center, Natick Contracting Division via e-mail to: Nathan.c.jordan@us.army.mil no later than 8:00 a.m. on  February 16, 2011.<BR><BR>Contracting Office Address: <BR>RDECOM Contracting Center - Natick<BR>CCRD-NA-SU, Natick Contracting Division<BR>Kansas Street, Building 1<BR>Natick, MA 01760-5011<BR><BR>Point of Contact:<BR>Nate Jordan, Contract Specialist<BR>Nathan.C.Jordan@us.army.mil<BR>

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention intends to award on a sole source basis, an extension modification to Computer Sciences Corporation under 200-2004-08858, in accordance with FAR Part 6.302-1. THE PURPOSE OF THIS EXTENSION IS TO ALLOW FOR CONTINUITY OF SERVICES WHILE THE RE-PROCUREMENT IS UNDERWAY.
<p>The purpose of this contract is to provide a comprehensive program of occupational medicine and preventive healthcare services. These services include management and operation of CDC clinics, provision of preventive and health promotion programs, occupational health surveillance programs, employee counseling services, and work-site health promotion activities primarily for employees in the Atlanta area. While the majority of CDC clinic patient visits are for immunizations, work-related injury and illness care, and compliance exams in support of worker protection programs, a large number of services are provided to prepare deployable teams of public health emergency responders. The Clinics have prepared teams for the domestic and international response to infectious disease outbreaks, hurricane response, as well as preparedness.</p>
<p>This contract provides for occupational health on critical worker and environmental protections related to CDC's laboratory work, field investigations, control of emerging infections, bioterrorism response and preparedness, pandemic control efforts, and similar activities. The contract is critical to assure CDC's successful completion of its mission of urgent public health intervention as well as for the promotion of a healthy lifestyle.</p>
<p>At this time the current contractor is the sole organization/provider that can deliver the specific services for such a limited time span (up to six months) to meet the health and safety needs related to CDC's critical public health mission.</p>
<p>FAR 6.302-1(a)(2) states, "when supplies or services are available from only one responsible source, full and open competition need not be provided for." As stated above, CSC is the only organization that can provide the deliverables of the project for the period required. Again, ONLY A TEMPORARY EXTENSION OF SERVICES IS ANTICIPATED WHILE A FOLLOW-ON CONTRACT IS NEGOTIATED.</p>

<DESC>DHS - Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is looking into the standardization of the fuel tank management systems required at various CBP locations in order to promote conformity in the way fuel consumption is tracked. CBP is interested in incorporating commercial and industry practices that support this type of procurement. To accomplish this, CBP intends to make industry a partner in all facets of the acquisition process, specifically by providing existing market capabilities, strengths and weaknesses for the acquisition of these supplies and services. Responses to this RFI will allow the CBP team to incorporate industry input into the initial stages of the program. Note: RFI responses will NOT be shared with other industry suppliers and will solely be used as part of the market research and acquisition planning process.
<p>In order to be clear on what the Border Patrol would like to achieve, please reference the attached spreadsheet. The spreadsheet is very specific in regards to locations (column B) and the type of fuel management system currently in place (column H) at specific locations. This column also notates a "no" if there is no system in place. We would like to install new systems where there is currently not one.</p>
<p>The column H management system tracks the amount of fuel dispensed from the bulk fuel tanks into specific vehicles. The column H fuel management system is the system that Border Patrol would like to consolidate into a single system, meaning, having the same system in use at all Border Patrol facilities.</p>
<p>Column I refers to the tank management and alarm system which keeps track of the actual fuel level in the bulk fuel tank and alerts when there is a malfunction within the tank. The two systems are totally separate and have no connection.</p>
<p>Border Patrol ultimately would like to be able to electronically retrieve the tracked data related to fuel dispensed into each vehicle in the fleet, nationwide, in a standardized format.</p>
<p>Responses Requested:</p>
<p>In an effort to assist CBP in further developing its requirements please provide responses to the following questions and requirements. CBP understands that some responses may be conceptual, while others are limited to the type(s) of technologies being considered. Responses should include the following information:</p>
<p>1. Identify your Company Name, Company Address, Point of Contact, Telephone Number, e-mail Address, and Size of your Organization (i.e. Large Business, Small Business) using NAICS Code and Classification Code as the basis for your response. In addition, identify whether your company is ISO certified and to what level.</p>
<p>2. Identify your organization's experience with and capability for providing the requested fuel dispensing system. Describe your approach to providing this type of capability. Describe the technologies and infrastructure that may be integrated that may best meet the objectives outlined above. This data should be representative for any services you currently provide. This data should be provided in accordance with the matrix, which is listed as an attachment to this RFI.</p>
<p>3. Explain your capacity for services that could be devoted to DHS.</p>
<p>4. Explain your ordering / delivery procedures?</p>
<p>5. Do you currently maintain or develop a secure web based (i.e., point and click) ordering system that can service multiple agencies/locations?</p>
<p>6. Do you allow for Government Purchase Cards as a payment mechanism?</p>
<p>7. Responses should identify any current or potential future regulatory concerns. Any response to this RFI should explain the vendor understands of this situation and action plan or company policy to address this type of situation.</p>
<p>8. Provide a Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) cost estimate for a solution, itemized to indicate: software development; infrastructure; operations. Please provide the data in accordance with the matrix that is attached to this RFI.</p>
<p>Instructions and Response Guidelines:</p>
<p>Please provide the information you deem relevant in order to respond to the specific inquiries of the RFI. To support budget and planning purposes you may also include rough cost estimates based upon the objectives outlined in the RFI. Information provided will be used solely by CBP as market research and will not be released outside of the requirements team. This RFI does not constitute an Invitation for Bid, or Request for Quotation, and it is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to enter into a contract, nor will the Government pay for the information submitted in response to this request. All information contained in this RFI is preliminary as well as subject to modification and is in no way binding on the Government. Responses shall be submitted electronically via email to the Contacting Officer no later than 11:59PM on Thursday, March 3, 2011.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), Office of River Protection (ORP) plans to award a modification to Contract No.  DE-AC27-07RV14884 by means other than full and open competition.  DOE ORP plans to award a sole source modification to EnergySolutions, LLC, located at 6100 Chevy Chase Drive, Laurel, MD, 20707. The tasks required by DOE ORP are outlined as follows:
1.	Compilation and Management of Glass Formulation Data Base 2.	Enhanced Sulfate Management in HLW Glass Formulations3.	HLW Melter Operational Strategy without Visual Feedback4.	Redox Control Testing for HLW5.	Melter Throughput Enhancements for High-Fe HLW6.	Improving Processing Characteristics of High Waste Loading HLW Glasses for High Bismuth Phosphate WastesDOE ORP has determined that these requirements can only be satisfied by the unique services offered by Energy Solutions, LLC.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to procure on a sole source basis and under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1 Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, with KT Consulting Inc., Antioch, California, for scientific and technical support services.
<p><br />NIST has a requirement for the extension of an existing bridge Indefinite-Delivery, Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) type contract, number SB1341-10-CQ-0007, with KT Consulting Inc. and the increase of the ceiling amount of the bridge contract. The current period of performance of the contract is from September 8, 2010 through April 8, 2011. NIST intends on extending the period of performance through October 31, 2011. The current ceiling amount on the contract is $8,000,000.00. NIST intends on increasing the ceiling amount from $8,000,000.00 by $3,000,000.00 to $11,000,000.00. This modification will allow for continuity of services that are critical to the NIST mission. The work to be provided is the performance of scientific and technical support services as detailed in the current Statement of Work of the contract.</p>
<p>The extension of the bridge contract to KT Consulting Inc. is needed because they are the only contractor who can continue the related services without delay of support to allow the Government enough time to properly complete a competitive 8(a) solicitation for a new contract vehicle. KT Consulting Inc. is currently providing these services, and there is no transition time available for any learning curve which would eliminate the related additional costs. The extension of the current contract is the most streamlined and efficient method possible, and is essential to the NIST mission.</p>
<p>A solicitation package will not be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, the Government will consider other responses received by the given deadline. A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement for this modification. All responses to this notice shall be submitted so that they are received electronically at michael.szwed@nist.gov and at keith.bubar@nist.gov no later than February 28, 2011 at 5:00 pm.</p>

<SOLNBR>
<CONTACT>

<a href="mailto:nevitt.tina@epa.gov">Contract Specialist</a>
<DESC>The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics (OPPT) intends to award a sole source fixed-price purchase order under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13.106-1(b), to the International Trade Center in Washington, DC to rent meeting space and purchase light refreshments for the Presidential Green Chemistry Awards to be held in June 2011.
The justification is as follows:  The awards ceremony needs to be held in close proximity to the EPA headquarters so that EPA employees and program management that are responsible for the logistics and coordination of the event are able to access their offices during the function, and for the logistics of moving the awards and all literature between EPA Headquarters and the selected venue.  
THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATION.  The purchase order to the ITC for the rental of meeting space and light refreshments is a sole source purchase made in accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b)(1).  It has been determined that the ITC is the only source that is reasonably available and can meet the Government?s needs.  All inquiries and concerns must be addressed in writing via e-mail to nevitt.tina@epa.gov by February 25, 2011 at 11:00 am EST.  Telephone inquiries will not be accepted.  The decision not to compete this requirement is within the discretion of the government.  Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government in future procurements.

<SUBJECT>A--Intention to Extend EP-D-06-003 on a Sole Source Basis
<SOLNBR>
<CONTACT>
<DESC>EPA intends to award a one-month extension to a current contract, EP-D-06-003 with Research Triangle Institute, Research Triangle Park, NC, on a sole source basis.  The current contract was previously competitively awarded and is to expire 2/28/11.  A follow-on competitive procurement is in process, however, will not be awarded before EP-D-06-003 expires.  The contract is currently in its Option IV period, which includes 8,000 base hours and ten (10) 1,000-hour increments.  The one-month extension will require no additional effort than previously negotiated.
The program relies on this contract support for cost, benefits, and economic analysis, as well as regulatory impacts and quality management for major Office of Air and Radiation rule makings.  Any interruption in this support poses a significant risk of missing statutory and court-ordered deadlines.   Many of these deadlines will occur within the next 12 months, which requires analysis support well in advance of those deadlines.  Specifically, the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS), New Source Performance Standards (NSPS), and review of National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) are some of the regulatory efforts with approaching deadlines.  RTI has been providing support for these programs since Contract EP-D-06-003 was awarded in 2006.   They are uniquely qualified to provide the additional one-month effort because timing is critical and no other contractor would acquire the knowledge and expertise pertaining to the regulatory sectors in t he time frame that is required.   
 No Request for Proposal is available and this notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  All responsible sources may respond by submitting a written narrative statement of capability within 15 days of this notice to Rodney-Daryl Jones at jones.rodney-daryl@epa.gov for consideration by the Agency.  Responses must include detailed technical information and other technical literature demonstrating the ability to meet these requirements.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract extension based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether competition is obtainable.  If no affirmative responses are received within 15 days of this notice to determine whether a qualified source is more advantageous to the government, the contract with Research Triangle Institute will be extended by a one-month period.

<DESC>On a SOLE-SOURCE basis, the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT's) Office of Facilities Management plans to award a GSA Schedule delivery order to Schneider Electric, for the purchase and installation of equipment to install advanced metering equipment throughout DOT Headquarters Building. <br />The expectation is to install 69 electrical closes and to install a HVAC interface system that will communicate with the HVAC and lighting systems through the existing card access system. This project will allow DOT to produce the necessary information regarding the facilities energy consumption which will result in measurable energy reductions, enhance operations, benefit the real property and meet agency missions. The vendor will install 480V sub-metering in 69 electrical closets and a Security System addition in 68 electrical closets at the DOT's Headquarters Facility. Each electrical closet will have 2-5 individual loads that will need to be metered for an accurate sub-metering system for the facility. These individual sub-metered loads range from 50 amps to 400 amps and are all fed by bus plugs attached to the various risers within each electrical closet. This system is also intended to provide a valid card read to trigger a low voltage dry relay so that the JBG HVAC contractor can shut down or turn on their system. The Lenel System in place at DOT will be used for software and some wire infrastructure. <br />Although the Government will continue to evaluate, on an ongoing basis, any interest shown by sources interested in competing for this requirement on subsequent acquisitions, it is not expected that any vendor other than Schneider Electric will be able to provide the software used with this particular metering system that has already been installed in DOT/FAA facilities throughout the country. <br />Nevertheless, any entity, other than Schneider Electric, which believes they can provide the needed services to DOT's Office of Facilities Management, shall submit a capability statement to Pamala.millbrook.ctr@dot.gov no later than 1:00 PM EST on March 3, 2011. <br />

<DESC>The United States Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity (USAMRAA) intends to negotiate a firm fixed price requirements-type award on a sole source basis, IAW FAR 13.501 under the authority of the test program for commercial items (section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996). Charles River Laboratories, 251 Ballardvale Stret, Wilmington, MA, has been identified as the only responsible source that can provide research animals within the conditions as described below. The requirement is for commercially available standard and modified(surgery) animals. The total estimated award amount is $3,050,000 for a Base + (2) option years firm fixed price award.<BR>Responsible firms may identify their interest and submit a capability statement to respond to future requirements. Submit email capability statements (using PDF, MS Word, Excel attachments) to Jackie McGurk at, Jacklyn.McGurk@amedd.army.mil. Fax statements may be sent to 410-436-4863; Attn: Jackie McGurk. Email statements are preferred. Statements are due no later than 5:00 P.M. EST on 28 FEB 2011. No telephone calls will be accepted. <BR>This Notice of Intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, information received within 15 days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed award is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a future competitive procurement.<BR>In many circumstances, research must be conducted on animals with a known and consistent genetic background. One method of ensuring consistency in genetic background is to purchase animals from the same vendor. Genetically speaking, a strain of animal from one vendor is very different from the very same "strain" purchased at another vendor. In fact, genetics vary significantly after twenty generations and after forty generations, genetics of animals from different locations vary to such an extent that they are designated as "substrains." In order to prevent substrain variability from impacting the quality of research at the Medical Research Institute for Chemical Defense (MRICD), certain animals must come from the same vendor location each and every time. That vendor is Charles River.<BR>Another method of ensuring consistent quality research is to purchase animals that are free of certain pathogens. The list of pathogens which makes an animal unacceptable varies by species. The species and pathogens not present for this requirement are:<BR><BR>Guinea pigs must be free of:<BR>LCMV Helicobacter species<BR>Adenovirus (GAV) All ectoparasites<BR>Sendai virus Clostridium piliforme<BR>Pneumoniavirus of Mice (PVM)<BR>Encephalitozoon species<BR>Bordatella bronchiseptica<BR>Mycoplasma pulmonis<BR>Salmonella species<BR>Streptococcus zooepidemicus<BR>Streptococcus pneumonia<BR>Streptobacillius moniliformis<BR><BR>Rats must be free of:<BR>Sendai virus<BR>Pneumonia Virus of Mice (PVM)<BR>Sialodacryoadenitis virus (SDAV)<BR>Rat parvoviruses: rat parvovirus (RPV), Toolhan's (H-1) and Kilham's rat virus (KRV)<BR>Theiler's Murine Encephalomyelitis Virus (TMEV)/GDVII<BR>Reovirus(REO)<BR>Rat Theilovirus (RTV)<BR>Hantavirus<BR>Lymphocytic Choriomeningitis Virus (LCMV)<BR>Adenoviruses (MAV)<BR>Bordatella bronchiseptica<BR>Corynibacterium kutcheri<BR>Mycoplasma pulmonis<BR>Salmonella species<BR>Streptococcus zooepidemicus<BR>Streptobacillus moniliformis<BR>Helicobacter species<BR>All ectoparasites<BR>Giardia species<BR>Spironucleus<BR>Helminths<BR><BR>Mice must be free of:<BR>Sendai virus Spironucleus<BR>Adenovirus (MAV) Helminths<BR>Pneumonia Virus of Mice (PVM) All ectoparasites<BR>Hepatitis virus (MHV) Giardia species<BR>Minute virus of Mice (MVM) Encephalitozoon species<BR>Parvovirus (MPV)<BR>Theiler's Murine Encephalomyelitis Virus (TMEV)/GDVII<BR>Reoviruses (REO and EDIM)<BR>Hantavirus<BR>Ectromeliavirus<BR>Lymphocytic Choriomeningitis Virus (LCMV)<BR>Bordatella bronchiseptica<BR>Citrobacter rodentium<BR>Corynibacterium kutscheri<BR>Mycoplasma pulmonis<BR>Salmonella species<BR>Streptococcus zooepidemicus<BR>Streptobacillus moniliformis<BR>Helicobacter species<BR><BR>Rabbits must be free of:<BR>Rabbit Hemorrhagic Disease Virus (RHDV)<BR>LCMV<BR>Reovirus (REO)<BR>Bordatella bronchiseptica<BR>CAR Bacillus<BR>Helicobacter species<BR>Lawsonia species<BR>Pasteurella species<BR>Salmonella species<BR>Treponema<BR>Clostridium piliforme<BR>Eimeria species<BR>Encephalitozoon species<BR>Helminths<BR>All ectoparasites

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation FA4877-11-Q-0247 is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ). This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-49, Defense Circular Number 20110202, Air Force Acquisition Circular 2010-1027. This procurement is being solicited as 100% small business set aside under NAICS code 423910.<br /><br />Purchase the following:

Powder coated. 2 goals, 2 nets, anchors and hooks or equal</p>
<p>(The above items must also conform to the specifications stated below.)</p>
<p>Direct Connection - All components must be fastened to the uprights using bolts and a threaded insert. These inserts must be installed into factory drilled holes in the tubing of the play structure. No clamp connectors.</p>
<p>Once this equipment is installed it will be left to the host nation for any care or maintenance. By using a direct connect system we are reducing the possibility of errors in maintenance by host nation personnel due to the simplicity of maintenance. Because this is a US DOD Mil install it is important that we use equipment that is safe, and above all will last years without regular maintenance.<br />Additionally all the equipment is predrilled and powder coated at the plant so assembly is free of any clamps with protruding bolts or bare surfaces that will rust. . Due to the pre-drilled no clamp assembly the protective powder coat will last decades even in the most severe environment.</p>
<p>Structure Coating - Parts must be coated using a method resistant to a highly humid, salt water environment. Components must be rust-proof with a warranty of at least 25 years. No PVC coatings on any surfaces.</p>
<p>Because this is a US DOD Mil install it is important that we use equipment that is environmentally friendly thus no PVC coating due to the fact that if they are vandalized and burned the units will not leave toxins and contamination as PVC's would.</p>
<p>Integrated Shade - Shade unit must feature at least a 18' x 18' breathable UV resistant shade fabric that provides 90% or more UV protection based on American Academy of Dermatology recommendations. The unit must be attached to playground equipment as to not violate the safety zone.</p>
<p>Due to the extremely limited space at some of the sites we need to integrate the shade structure into the equipment footprint. Safety is achieved by freeing up as much play space as possible as well as ensuring nothing is in the Safe Zone of either structure. One way they do this is by attaching their canopy systems to the existing playground poles eliminating additional pole obstacles in the play area.</p>
<p>Safety - Must meet safety requirements outlined in ASTM F1487-07ae1, Standard Consumer Safety Performance Specification for Playground Equipments for Public Use, dated 15 March 2007.<br />Self explanatory</p>
<p>Packaging - Equipment must be palletized, per equipment unit, on pallets no wider then 4' and no longer than 20' for shipping in SEAVAN.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PERFORMANCE PLAN (PP)</p>
<p><br />1.0. GENERAL:</p>
<p>1.1. This PP meets the requirements of AFI 63-124. It is the result of collaboration among the Multi-Functional Team responsible for AFSAT contract oversight (assigned AETC CONS/LGCI Contracting Officer and AFSAT Training Program Manager (TPM)) specific to this contracting effort. Its purpose is to identify the methods and procedures the US Government (USG) will use to insure delivery of the services identified in the performance work statement (PWS). This PP relies on the Contractor's Quality Control Program (QCP) to the maximum extent practicable. The Contractor's quality auditor will perform surveillance of all performance requirements in accordance with the Contractor's Quality Control Plan (QCP), which will encompass all performance requirements of the contract. The government will perform surveillance to the level necessary to insure the Contractor's QCP and methods of surveillance are sufficient to prevent tendering of non-conforming services. Minimum surveillance will consist of review of all student critiques, Periodic Inspection and 100% Inspection; however, the Government retains the rights listed in the services surveillance clause of this contract. Reviews disclosing actual or potential discrepancies will be followed by review of Contractor's metrics of inspection with further government surveillance as necessary.</p>
<p>1.2. The Service Summary (SS) identifies the major service requirements the USG is acquiring and provides a basis for measurement between actual Contractor performance and specific contract requirements. The TPM, in partnership with the Contractor, will verify adequacy of performance for the critical or major requirements using any of the quality assurance methods delineated in Attachment 2. The Government has the right to inspect all tasks, not just Performance Objective (PO) items.</p>
<p>PERFORMANCE OBJECTIVE <br />PWS PARAGRAPH <br />PERFORMANCE THRESHOLD <br />Method of Inspection<br />SS PO-1. Contractor shall provide training which meets content and objectives. PWS Section 1.0., Paragraphs 1.2. through 1.3.4. Training meets 100% of the content and objectives. 100% inspection at end of course. TPM validation using Performance Plan Checklist. Surveys of students or on sight inspection as required.<br />SS PO-2. Contractor shall comply with scheduled dates. PWS, Section 1.0., Paragraph 1.2.5., 1.4.1. and Exhibit A.<br />100% of all eligible students commence and be completed as scheduled, unless student is proven unable to progress in accordance with Section 1.0., Paragraph 1.4.5.2. 100% inspection at start and end of each course. Graduation Completion Documentation. TPM validation using Performance Plan Checklist.<br />SS PO-3. Contractor shall provide materials and equipment. PWS, Section 1.0., paragraph 1.4.4. Equipment is in good working order and class schedules are neither delayed nor negatively impacted 95% of training course/days. Surveys of students or on sight inspection as required. Periodic Inspection (Monthly), TPM validation using Performance Plan Checklist.<br />SS PO-4. Contractor shall provide student administration and documentation. PWS, Section 1.0., Paragraph 1.4.5. through 1.4.5.5. Documentation will be on time and in quantity required 100% of the time. 100% inspection. TPM validation using Performance Plan Checklist. Receipt of required documentation in accordance with the PWS.</p>
<p><br />1.3. The Surveillance Team consists of the following key players: Contractor's representative(s), AFSAT TPM, and subject matter experts (SMEs), as required.</p>
<p>1.4. Non-Service Summary Items. The Government has the right to inspect all tasks within this PWS not just the Performance Objectives (POs) listed in the Service Summary (table above). All other tasks required under the PWS may be inspected on a random or periodic basis at a frequency determined by the Functional Commander/Functional Director (FC/FD), CO, and/or QAP per the Inspection of Services Clause in the contract.</p>
<p>2.0. RESPONSIBILITIES:</p>
<p>2.1. The ACO has overall responsibility for all aspects of the contract administration function and is the primary focal point for formal government/Contractor interface. The ACO delegates specific surveillance responsibilities and authorities, by formal letter, to the TPM who will act as the CO's quality assurance personnel (QAP). Additionally, the ACO ensures the Master PP is used or coordinates a PP through AETC CONS/LGCI and AETC CONS/Quality Assurance Program Coordinator (QAPC) for PCO approval. The ACO is the only government representative authorized to direct the Contractor.</p>
<p>2.2. The TPM/QAP is the USG's surveillance program focal point and assesses the Contractor's surveillance efforts. The TPM/QAP will review the Contractor's Quality Control Plan (QCP), advice the CO of QCP adequacy, and may revise the government surveillance plan accordingly. The TPM/QAP is also the focal point for changes to the PWS. All proposed changes are processed through the TPM/QAP for technical evaluation of the mission impact.</p>
<p>2.2.1. The ACO will generate a letter of corrective action (commonly known as Corrective Action Requests (CARs)) or other appropriate documentation, review the Contractor's action to correct the discrepancy and prevent its recurrence.</p>
<p>2.2.2. The TPM/QAP will maintain the ACO letters of appointment, PP (with attachments), current contract and PWS, and documentation of surveillance activity (a completed Performance Plan Checklist at Attachment 1). Copies of surveillance documentation will be forwarded to the ACO upon completion of the contract performance, or as otherwise requested by the ACO.</p>
<p>2.2.3. The TPM/QAP will evaluate adequacy of all elements of the Contractor's QCP.</p>
<p>2.2.4. The TPM/QAP will monitor and evaluate Contractor tasks and system compliance with PWS.</p>
<p>2.2.5. The TPM/QAP will initiate request for and evaluate adequacy of Contractor corrective actions.</p>
<p>2.2.6. The TPM/QAP will notify the ACO of any significant performance deficiencies.</p>
<p>2.2.7. The TPM/QAP will recommend improvements to the PP and PWS throughout the life of the contract.</p>
<p>3.0. REQUIREMENTS:</p>
<p>3.1. Contractor's Quality Program. The Contractor's quality program requirements are defined in Section 1.0., paragraph 1.4.8. of the PWS.</p>
<p>3.2. Government Surveillance. The TPM/QAP will assess, document, and report Contractor's compliance in the technical areas. The TPM/QAP may request Contractor's surveillance reports, evaluate the effectiveness of the corrective actions taken, and recommend to the ACO re-performance or equitable adjustment for acceptance of non-conforming services. Should a discrepancy of performance be determined, the ACO will generate a CAR (or other appropriate documentation), to include the contract number, the PWS reference, a description of the discrepancy and an appropriate time frame for the Contractor to respond. The ACO will assure the Contractor's response includes documentation of how the discrepancy was corrected and what steps are taken to prevent the reoccurrence of the discrepancy. As appropriate, the ACO will support the Contractor to reconcile the processes used to deliver contractually accurate performance.</p>
<p>3.2.1. The intent of including the PP in the RFP is to gain confidence in the Contractor's business practices, and performance. The government retains the right to modify the PP and the oversight level to a point that maintains that confidence. Whenever a change or modification to the contract is issued which impacts the plan, the PP must be updated to reflect the change.</p>
<p>3.3. Special Quality Audits. At any time the government feels a performance objective has not been met and the technical expertise of a special auditor may be required, the TPM/QAP may request ACO consideration of a special quality audit. <br />3.4. Certification of Services. At the end of each contract payment period as defined in the resulting award of this acquisition, the QAP shall certify the services were received in accordance with contract payment terms and conditions.</p>
<p>3.5. The MFT will continue to meet after award as necessary to ensure high levels of contractor performance, foster a synergistic partnership, and support mission requirements.</p>
<p>3.6. INITIAL PERFORMANCE REVIEW (IPR). The initial evaluation of contractor performance shall take place within 30 days after the contractor assumes full performance responsibilities (i.e. after completion of transition/mobilization) to ensure the contractor has successfully started performance, completed transition, is fully operational, and is within the estimated cost, schedule, and performance parameters of the contract.</p>

<p><br />OPERATIONAL ASSESSMENT: Risk-based assessment of major tests, critical operations, etc., and assessment of Contractor work processes/procedure compliance normally driven by developing trends.</p>
<p>MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS ASSESSMENTS: System audits performed by a team of qualified Quality Assurance (QA) auditors to ensure existence of a documented quality assurance management system capable of delivering acceptable goods and services, and mitigating risks to customers.</p>
<p>PROCESS EVALUATIONS: Assigned Training Program Manager (TPM), working with Contractor personnel, determines if processes meet specifications and promote continuous improvement. Contractor metrics are validated.</p>
<p>PAST PERFORMANCE HISTORY: Objective, historical documentation of Contractor performance to assist in the analysis of their past and present performance.</p>
<p>CUSTOMER COMPLAINT RESOLUTION: Actions taken in support of a specific Contractor or government concern or problem that impacts operations. Usually results in Government-to-Contractor or Contractor-to-Contractor process deficiency resolution (feedback). NOTE: Customer complaints, once validated, are a means of surveillance and are alternative to formal surveillance methods.</p>
<p>CUSTOMER FEEDBACK (Student Critiques): Student evaluations of training assist in the analysis of Contractor's performance under contract. If critiques are unfavorable, the areas in question may require further evaluation using any of the QA methods herein.</p>
<p>TPM VALIDATION: Reviews, or other actions taken by the TPM, including the use of the Performance Plan (PP) Checklist, to insure receipt and compliance.</p>
<p>100% INSPECTION: The QAP/TPM will inspect and evaluate the contractor's performance each and every instance they are performed. The QAP will determine acceptability and compliance with the performance threshold by monitoring and tracking each deliverable service/document. Technical documents and other deliverable documents will be reviewed for technical accuracy and compliance with technical directives. The results of this inspection may be used as the basis for actions toward the contractor.</p>
<p>PERIODIC INSPECTION: These services are inspected using periodic or recurring basis. Periodic surveillance may be daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, etc. The results of periodic surveillance inspection may be used as the basis for actions (other than payment deductions) towards the service provider. In such cases, the Inspection of Services clause becomes the basis for the Contracting Officer's actions.<br />DESCRIPTION OF COURSES</p>

<DESC>The F-16 Support Group at the Ogden Air Logistics Center (OO-ALC), GHBK, plans to issue solicitation and conduct a competitive source selection under Full and Open Competition for F-16 United States Air Force Europe (USAFE) Depot Services Support. No set-aside is contemplated but NAICS Code 336411 applies. A 5 year, Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) ordering contract is contemplated to accommodate applicable annual Operation and Maintenance (O&amp;M) appropriations. The total period of ordering for the proposed contract is from 01 Oct 2011 through 30 Sep 2016 (FY16). The five (5) 12-month periods within this timeframe are described on separately priced line items. A single option, describing a period of 6 months of support will also be priced to support contingency if the anticipated follow-on source selection for this requirement is delayed, (see the FAR clause at 52.217-8, which will be included).
<p>This program defines core Depot Maintenance (scheduled) activities which will be Firm Fixed Price (FFP) and other support defined separately, for which a Fixed Rate agreement, including fully loaded composite (wrap) rates, will be priced. The intent of the core activity support is to provide a facility for induction of aircraft currently in service with operational units at Spangdalem, Germany and/or Aviano, Italy Air Bases and needing scheduled (known) depot maintenance. Over and above effort, implementation of Time Compliance Technical Orders (TCTOs), Contractor Field Team (CFT) support, and some lesser modification efforts, e.g., FS 341 lower bulkhead repair or replacement, and other minor upgrades will also be required. For efficiency of USAFE resources support, schedule and convenience, performance must be in Europe within economical proximity of Spangdalem, Germany and Aviano, Italy Air Bases where the operational F-16 aircraft for scheduled repair originate. Schedule impacts and costs incurred by the USAFE as a result of distance and other factors derived from the actual location of the proposed facility will be evaluated. The contracted effort is to be paid by the Government in U.S. Dollars. Site surveys to assess capability at proposed sites will be conducted.</p>
<p>This requirement has been defined in accordance with information from on-going market research and pre-solicitation activities including an informational source-sought synopsis published separately under pre-solicitation notice number FA8232-10-R-0816, as posted at this Fed Biz Ops public website. An "Industry Days" conference was held at Hill AFB in conjunction with these exchanges. A more detailed description of the requirement and the Source Selection methodology to be utilized, including a model contract with attachments and a Performance Work Statement (PWS) is available under the notice at FA8232-10-R-0816. The package of documentation is considered a complete representation of the solicitation but is in DRAFT form until the Agency releases the official Request for Proposal (RFP) for this requirement.</p>
<p>Final release of RFP under this FA8232-11-R-1000 notice is expected no earlier than 1 Mar 2011. The Agency reserves the right to release after that date. The Agency reserves the right to cancel or revise this notice at any time. The Agency also reserves the right to make contract award pending availability of funding, in accordance with FAR 52.232-18 and 19. There are no known Organizational Conflicts of Interest (OCI) associated with this requirement in accordance with FAR 9.505-1 and 9.507-1.</p>
<p>Ms. Sharon Porter, OO-ALC/PKC, Hill AFB UT 84056, has been appointed as Ombudsman to hear concerns from offerors, or potential offerors, during proposal development. The purpose of the Ombudsman is to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel.

<p><br />SECTION M: EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD <br />SOLICITATION REQUIREMENTS, TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br />Offerors are required to meet all solicitation requirements, such as terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as factors, subfactors to be eligible for award. Any aspect of the proposal judged to be unacceptable would render the entire proposal unacceptable. Failure to comply with the terms and conditions of the solicitation may result in the offeror being removed from consideration for award. Any exceptions to the solicitation's terms and conditions must be fully explained and justified.</p>
<p>a. Basis for contract Award<br />This acquisition will utilize Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) source selection procedures in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 15.101-2, as supplemented. Technical tradeoffs will not be made and no additional credit will be given for exceeding acceptability. Award will be made to the acceptable offeror with the lowest evaluated cost or price, which is deemed responsible in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation and whose proposal conforms to the solicitation requirements. The solicitation requirements include all stated terms, conditions, representations, certifications, and all other information required by Section L of this solicitation. The Government intends to award without discussions and reserves the right to award without discussions; therefore, each initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the government reserves the right to conduct discussions if determined necessary by the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>b. Number of Contracts to be Awarded<br />The Government intends to select one contractor. However, the Government reserves the right to award no contract at all, depending on the quality of the proposals and prices submitted and the availability of funds.</p>
<p>c. Rejection of Unrealistic Offers<br />The Government may reject any proposal that is evaluated to be unrealistic in terms of program commitments, including contract terms and conditions, or unrealistically high or low in cost/price when compared to Government estimates, such that the proposal is deemed to reflect an inherent lack of competence or failure to comprehend the complexity and risks of the program.</p>
<p>d. Correction Potential of Proposals<br />The Government will consider, throughout the evaluation, the "correction potential" of any deficiency or proposal inadequacy. The judgment of such "correction potential" is within the sole discretion of the Government. If an aspect of an offeror's proposal not meeting the Government's requirements is not considered correctable, the offeror may be eliminated from the competitive range.<br />EVALUATION FACTORS<br />(IAW FAR 13.306-2(b), 14.201-5(c))<br />a. List factors and Subfactors:<br />Government based upon an evaluation for acceptability of evaluation factors and subfactors described below:</p>
<p>1.1 FACTOR 1: Technical <br />FACTOR 2: Price<br />FACTOR 3: Past Performance</p>
<p>b. Evaluation Methodology<br />Price will be evaluated first and the proposals will be listed from lowest to highest price. After price is evaluated the technical acceptability evaluation will begin, starting with the lowest evaluated price offeror. After the technical acceptability evaluation, past performance will be evaluated. The first proposal evaluated as technically acceptable, responsible, and an acceptable past performance rating will be considered the best value proposal and all other technical evaluations will cease. Only those offerors determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions will be considered for award.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>c. Cost/Price Factor<br />(IAW 5315.305(a)(1)) <br />Price analysis will be performed to determine the reasonableness of the offeror's price proposal. Reasonableness will be based on the total evaluated price. The total evaluated price will be calculated by multiplying unit prices with the BEQ's including those for the option yeas as well. Transportation costs will also be used in the evaluation.<br />(1) Unrealistically low proposed costs or prices, initially or subsequently, may be grounds for eliminating a proposal from competition either on the basis the offeror does not understand the requirement or the offeror has made an unrealistic proposal.</p>
<p>(2) Offerors are cautioned against submitting an offer that contains unbalanced pricing. Unbalanced pricing may increase performance risk and could result in payment of unreasonably high prices. Unbalanced pricing exists when, despite an acceptable total evaluated price, the price of one or more contract line items is significantly over or understated as indicated by the applications of cost or price analysis techniques. The Government shall analyze offers to determine whether they are unbalanced with respect to separately priced line items or subline items. Offers that are determined to be unbalanced may be rejected if the contracting officer determines that the lack of balance poses an unacceptable risk to the Government.</p>
<p>d. Technical Factor<br />Each subfactor within the Technical Factor will receive one of the ratings described below. Subfactor ratings shall not be rolled up into an overall rating factor. An unacceptable subfactor assessment will determine an overall unacceptable technical rating.</p>
<p>Acceptable- The proposal meets specified minimum requirements necessary for acceptable contract performance.</p>
<p>Unacceptable- The proposal fails to meet specified minimum requirements necessary for acceptable contract performance. Proposal with unacceptable rating is not awardable.</p>
<p>e. Past Performance Factor<br />A responsibility determination IAW FAR 9.1 shall constitute an acceptable past performance rating for this award.</p>
<p>f. Discussions<br />It is the Government's intent to award without discussions; therefore, it is imperative that offeror's submit their best terms initially. However, if during the evaluation period, it is determined to be in the best interest of the Government to hold discussions, offeror responses to Evaluation Notices, and the Final Proposal Revisions will be considered in making the source selection decision.</p>
<p><br />NOTE 23: Award will be made only if the eofferor, the product/service or the manufacturer meets qualification requirement award in accordance with FAR Clause 52.209-1 and 52.206-2. The solicitation identifies the officered additional information can be obtained concerning qualification requirements and is cited in each individual solicitation.</p>

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. We have a requirement for a Culvert Replacement at Honey Creek. This Request for Quote (RFQ) will be for two proposals per SOW with the project completion by NLT 1 October 2011 subject to increment weather condition.<BR><BR>This contract has one CLIN-0001: Total cost to replace culvert and complete other tasks identified in the Scope of Work.<BR><BR>The Scope of work is as follows: <BR>Scope of Work<BR><BR>1.  The Contractor shall furnish all labor and any necessary equipment to install Government furnished; pre-cast box culverts for a tank trail crossing over Honey Creek at Fort Riley, Kansas.  Technical Exhibit 1 indicates the project site.<BR><BR>2.  The Contractor shall submit two proposals for the project.  Proposal one shall be for the installation of pre-cast culverts delivered to the construction site prior to the project commencing.  Proposal two shall be for both the transportation of the pre-cast culverts from a location on Fort Riley approximately 12 miles from the construction site and the installation of the pre-cast culverts after transport.  The Government will accept the proposal that is in its best interest.<BR><BR>3.  The Government will provide the Contractor with two paper sets of plans.  The plans are not to scale and are for general guidance.  The Contractor shall return one set of plans with "as constructed" to note any field changes to the Government within 5 business days of completion of the project.<BR><BR>4.  An electronic copy of the plans is located at Technical Exhibit 2.  Potential bidders may obtain a paper copy of the plans by contacting Mr. Mike Houck, Biologist, at 785-239-2537.<BR><BR>5.  The Government will provide basic staking of the construction site based on the plans and on-site conditions at time of construction.<BR><BR>6.  The Contractor shall remove the existing metal culvert and install pre-cast box culverts following normal industry standards at the location noted on the plans and staked at the site.<BR><BR>7.  The Contractor shall insure the new pre-cast culverts are installed in a matter that does not alter the streambed gradient.  As per drawing, the Contractor shall set one or two culverts below the natural streambed gradient to allow for natural stream flow.  The finished installation shall allow fish passage and shall not back normal water flow upstream of the structure, shall not create any measurable plunge pool on the downstream side, and shall not create a pond or pooled situation over the face of the crossing.  The Contractor shall set the additional culverts above the lower culvert(s) level to handle high flow periods.<BR><BR>8.  The Contractor shall install a concrete cap above the lower culvert(s) that shall create a level surface over the entire culvert system. <BR><BR>9.  The Contractor shall use any rock and soil material removed from the existing roadbed site  to cover the culverts.  Road surface material will be removed and used to resurface the road after construction is completed.  If additional cover is required, the Government, working with the Contractor, will designate a borrow site near the construction site.<BR><BR>10.  The Contractor shall install appropriate size rock on each culvert face or adjacent slopes to reduce future erosion potential. Trans-located rock obtained on-site may be used for this activity.  During any activities utilizing trans-located rock, extreme caution should be exercised to avoid damage to the natural stream channel and its habitat.  If rock retrieval from the downstream channel is determined likely to adversely impact habitat within the stream channel or addition rock is required, the Contractor shall obtain new rock from an off-installation quarry.  <BR><BR>11.  The Contractor shall deposit the existing culvert at a location to be designated by the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) during final staking.  The Government will be responsible for final deposition of the culvert.<BR><BR>12.  The Contractor shall not conduct construction activities below the water's surface in Honey Creek during the Topeka shiner spawning period of May 15 to July 31. inclusive.  <BR><BR>13.  The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) at least 10 days prior to construction. The COR is responsible for notifying the United States Fish and Wildlife Service Field Office  in advance of any activities which have the potential to affect any Topeka shiner habitat.<BR><BR>14.  The Contractor shall only install those roads and ramps necessary to install the pre-cast culverts.  The Contractor shall only reshape the channel is necessary to direct the natural flow to the culvert location.  The Contractor shall install erosion control structures as necessary to minimize downstream sedimentation during all activities.<BR><BR>15.  The Contractor shall clear only those trees, brush, and other debris necessary to install the culverts and access the streambed.  Trees, brush, and debris shall be piled in such a manner as not to obstruct stream flow nor block current access route.  <BR><BR>16.  The Contractor shall implement and maintain best management practices for erosion control throughout the duration of all project activities located in runoff areas to the stream.<BR><BR>17.  The Contractor shall provide seeding and/or mulching within all stream runoff areas as soon as grading allow, following the end of construction.<BR><BR>18.  The Contractor shall locate storage facilities for petroleum products, fuels, and other chemicals so that discharge and runoff into stream is not possible.<BR><BR>19.  The Contractor shall make all efforts to complete all work in a timely manner so that traffic on roadway is not closed for extended periods of time.

<p>Text pages 1, 2, 6, 18, 30, 36, 42, 56 and 63 each print as a bleeding three sides ghosted background (illustration), together with a Photoshop montage assembly of Sephia-styled illustration pictures plus a solid footer bleeding three sides of PMS 141 Yellow. All text pages print in PMS 280 and PMS 141 plus Black ink at a minimum.</p>
<p>NOTE: Traps and varnish (or coating) masks are entirely the contractor's respon&not;sibility. Heavy ink coverage is required and the contractor must take any and all necessary precautions to prevent ghosting &amp; lay a smooth, uniform ink film. This product shall be manufactured on a lithographic printing press capable of printing all the required colors with one pass through the press and the complete color bar as detailed on page 4 of these specifications.</p>
<p>Do not assume "perfecting" is acceptable to the government. The inspector shall use the following criteria to determine acceptability. If the inspector is unable to determine by examination which side is first down, then press perfecting is acceptable. Web fed printing techniques shall be on dryer equipped presses only.</p>
<p>Ghosting &amp; "in-line problems" shall not be acceptable.</p>
<p>COATING: Overall aqueous coat, satin finish, on outside covers pages 1 and 4 only. A "dry- trapped" overall varnish may NOT be substituted.</p>
<p>DISPLAY EXAMINATION: Examination of the furnished materials is an integral part of specifications. No additional payment will be allowed due to the contractor's failure to examine the copy and thoroughly understand the nature and extent of the work to be performed.</p>
<p>PRESS INSPECTION: Press sheets shall be inspected at the contractor's printing facility for quality conformance. Each press sheet form must contain one color bar, at least 3/16" in width, for each ink color placed parallel to the ink rollers. Color control bars (such as, BRUNNER, GATF or GRETAG) must contain star targets, trapping, tint and dot gain patches, process built grays, if applicable, and extend the full width of the press sheet. Ink densities shall be constant across the full width of the sheet with no deviations to exceed plus or minus 1/2 of one percent. Light and heavy inking is not allowed. The contractor shall provide the correct viewing conditions for all press sheet inspections including 5000&deg; kelvin light sources housed in a completely enclosed neutral gray-booth and functional densitometers. If the presses are equipped with automatic scanners you are NOT relieved of the requirement for the customer colorbar as detailed above.</p>
<p>PREAWARD SURVEY: In order to determine the responsibility of the prime contractor, the government reserves the right to conduct a preaward survey, or to require samples to QATAP evaluate, or other evidence of technical, managerial, financial and similar abilities to perform, prior to the award of a contract.</p>
<p>PACKING: Plastic strap or shrink wrap in units of 10 copies only, paper banding shall not be allowed. Turn the items if necessary, to form a "neat" stack.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:

UNDERSTANDING WIDE AREA WORKFLOW  READ THESE INSTRUCTIONS TO EXPEDITE ELECTRONIC PAYMENT
 
(a) This contract action for commercial items of supply incorporates DFARS 252.232-7003, Electronic Submission of Payment Requests.  For the Department of Defense, the MANDATORY method of electronic submission of payment requests is by Wide Area Workflow (WAWF.)  This means that paper invoices are not permitted and will not be processed for payment.  
 
(b) Definitions Important to the WAWF Process
 
Acceptor:  The organization or person designated in block 15 of the SF 1449 (cover page of the purchase request) who accepts the products or services tendered.  The acceptor has a unique DoDAAC (Department of Defense Activity Address Code) shown in the upper right had box of block 15 that must be used to notify the acceptor that an electronic invoice is pending.
 
DoDAAC:  As stated above, an acronym for Department of Defense Activity Address Code.  This code unique to each organization in the Department of Defense.  Knowledge of what DoDAAC codes must be input into WAWF electronic invoices is crucial to the payment process as it alerts the acceptor that an invoice is pending for acceptance and alerts the payment office that a completed action is ready to process for payment.
 
Payment Office: The location of the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) office shown in block 18a of the SF 1449 that will process your electronic invoices.  The payment office also has a unique DoDAAC.
 
(c) Options within WAWF include a combo for supply items,  a 2-in-1 invoice for service contracts and a stand-alone invoice. It is recommended that the use of , stand-alone invoices be avoided.   The matching of stand-alone invoices by DFAS offices requires invoices and receiving reports be separately or individually submitted by the vendor and the receiving activity  and can routinely cause lengthy delays and possible rejection because they do not appear together and therefore must be individually matched and then verified.  The use of the combo or 2-in-1 does not present this problem and avoids the attendant delays associated with matching.  Detailed instructions on how to create an invoice, as well as other topical issues, can be found at the WAWF training website at http://www.wawftraining.com .
 
(d) A key, important, and imperative step for vendors to take is to e-mail notification to the acceptor identified in the contract in block 15 by clicking on the Send More E-Mail Notifications link in WAWF upon submission of the electronic invoice instrument (combo or 2-in1).  This step provides notice to the acceptor of your pending invoice

STATEMENT OF WORK

1.  STATEMENT OF WORK

1.1. The Contractor shall provide to the American Forces Network-Broadcast Center (AFN-BC), formerly the Defense Media Center (DMC) and American Forces Radio and Television Service (AFRTS), the right to use six (6), twenty-four-hour radio music formats of AFN-BC choice.    

Note:  Non-Commercial used in this Statement of Work is an industry term used to describe the agency/entity to be serviced and has no relation to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) definition of a commercial or non-commercial item.  

2.  AMERICAN FORCES NETWORK-BROADCAST CENTER AND ITS OPERATION

2.1.  The term American Forces Network-Broadcast Center (AFN-BC) refers to the AFN-BC Operations Center (located in Southern California) and all Department of Defense (DoD) networks, stations, outlets, ships and locations which receive, transmit, broadcast or relay by closed-circuit systems AFN-BC program material that AFN-BC provides.

2.2. Distribution of all programming is non-commercial, non-profit, and royalty-free.  The service is intended strictly for use by the Department of Defense (DoD) personnel and their family members stationed overseas or on ships at sea.

3.  PROGRAMS AND FORMAT UTILIZATION AND DISTRIBUTION

3.1. Provider grants AFN-BC, its Army-, Navy-, Air Force-operated affiliate stations, and its contractors and sub-contractors (such as common carriers or overseas military base cable systems) authorization to record and/or distribute the programming licensed hereunder.  Distribution shall be made via satellite (preferred) and/or high-speed, reliable T1 line or comparable.  Other use, in whole or in part by the AFN-BC and the DoD, is prohibited. 

3.2.  AFN-BC satellite distribution of material will be via addressable, scrambled, encoded, encrypted or digitized transmissions.  

4.  FORMAT SELECTION AND NEWS/INFORMATION/SPORTS SERVICES 

4.1.  AFN-BC currently has six music formats described using the following music genre formats, with the more specific industry name stated in parentheses:

1)  Young Urban (Gravity)
2)  Hot Adult Contemporary in a morning show format (Hot AC with Kidd Kraddick)
3)  New Rock (Z-Rock)
4)  (Dial Globals Jack FM)
5)  Mainstream Country
6)  Trance/Techno (DriveFX)

The provider will deliver continuous music services that meet the above six music genre formats, or substantially similar formats (e.g., (2) a Hot Adult Contemporary morning show comparable to Kidd Kraddick or for (4) a format similar to JackFM).  Each format shall be hosted or imaged by an experienced professional Disk Jockey (DJ).  

4.1.1. AFN-BC may add, delete or change formats by providing 30 days notification in advance of such action(s).  However, AFN-BC agrees to carry not less than two and no more than six (6) formats at one time.  Any additions, deletions or changes will be accomplished by an appropriate contract adjustment.  Such contract adjustments may include prorated amounts, where appropriate.

5.  NON-COMMERCIAL OPERATION

Providers will assist AFN-BC in maintaining non-commercial operation.  Provider shall provide cues that allow common, state-of-the-art automation equipment to preempt any or all commercial material in each music format AFN-BC is authorized to use.  Music format commercial material and breaks shall be of specific, standardized lengths, which may be subject to change with not less than seven (7) calendar days notice to the AFN-BC.   

6.  PERFORMANCE RIGHTS

6.1.  Provider shall obtain all authorizations and clearances (including all union and guild clearances and rights to music and other properties) necessary to enable it to use the programming overseas as permitted herein.    

7.  DELIVERY OF  FORMAT MATERIAL TO AFN-BC

7.1.  Provider will provide its music formats to AFN-BC with the same quality audio programming it provides to its United States commercial affiliates via a domestic satellite or direct connection, such as a T-1 circuit or equivalent service.

7.1.1.  The Government expects 99.8% reliability and immediate response, over the 8,760 hours each year (i.e., under 17.5 hours total of interrupted service in a year) upon AFN-BC notification of technical difficulties.  AFN-BC is a motivational factor for troops, especially in combat zones or in contingency operations.  Service interruptions negatively affect morale and readiness.  

7.2.  Unless otherwise expressly stated herein, AFN-BC will be solely responsible for the acquisition, construction, operation and maintenance of all facilities and equipment (including, without limitation, satellite downlink dishes) necessary to receive programming.  Provider shall authorize AFN-BC to obtain any equipment necessary to descramble/decode/receive a broadcast quality signal and shall assure AFN-BC continues to receive any necessary authorization to access scrambled or encoded formats.
7.3.  All rights and title in and to the formats, contents, creative material and all other elements of intellectual property in the programming (other than material in the public domain) shall, except as otherwise agreed to in this contract, remain vested in provider.

7.4.  Provider shall include Radio Data System (RDS) information with each music format that includes start time, song title and artist for each song played.  The RDS information will be included as a data subcarrier in the music stream or an approved alternative method of delivery.

8.  PROMOTION AND STATION ASSISTANCE MATERIALS

<DESC>Combined Synopsis/Solicitation for Auto-Flow Anesthesia System for laboratory mice.

(i) This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation number is VA-241-10-RQ-0303. 

The VA intends to issue a sole-source contract to Euthanex Corporation, 440 Allentown Dr. Allentown PA, 18109-9122 but will entertain other qualified offers.

This requirement is not set aside; it is conducted under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The NAICS Code is 541380. The standard size is 12 Million dollars.

The VA Research Veterinary Medical Unit (VMU) at White River Junction VT. currently has one working anesthesia machine. We are requesting another anesthesia machine and for water heating circulating pumps. 
Our present anesthesia machine is used by five users. We recently had three more investigators who received funding and will need to use an anesthesia machine. Since we only have one machine our investigators must schedule its use, sometimes necessitating re-planning weeks of experimental design and treatment to accommodate that time. 
The newly funded investigators we have will be using immunodeficient mice which means they cannot fight off infections. These mice are very expensive and losing even one would compromise the PI's research. These mice must be housed and maintained in a sterile environment. The machine must be in an enclosure that captures the anesthetic gases while maintaining the sterile environment. 
We are requesting the following equipment so that we can obtain an additional anesthesia machine that will be suitable for work with these immunodeficient mice, plus would have the capability of being used with other mice strains and with other species. The anesthesia machine that we are requesting has an enclosure with a charcoal filter so it can be used in the same room where the mice are housed and does not require outside venting. 
We are requesting the following: 

1) Table - E-25000
2) Complete Auto Flow System 
3) Water heating circulating pumps with thin line heated waterbeds. (Mice and rats lose body heat fast so it is important to keep these small animals warm) 

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and no other solicitation document will be issued. Request for Quotation (RFQ) number #VA-241-10-RQ-0303 is available upon request. The incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through the current Federal Acquisition Regulations.

All responses must be received NLT Thursday, February 17, 2011 NLT Noon EST USA. E-mail: kevin.labrie@va.gov

A firm fixed-price award will be made to the responsible offeror who provides the lowest acceptable quote.  The resulting award will be a Firm Fixed Price.  THIS SOLICITATION IS BEING ADVERTISED ON AN UNRESTRICTED BASIS INVITING FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION.<BR><BR>Description:  The U.S. Army Medical Research Institute for Chemical Defense (USAMRICD) in Aberdeen Proving Ground - South, Maryland 21010 requires the use of a company that can provide histopthological services for current and on-going experimental protocols.  <BR><BR>Performance Work Statement:  "USAMRICD seeks non-personal professional service for histological preparation of tissue including cryoprotection, freezing and paraffin embedding, sectioning with a cryostat and microtome, mounting of tissue sections on slides for each guinea pig, rat, mouse, and monkey brains as well as rat peripheral organs.  The Contractor shall provide sections mounted and stained on slides with a variety of histological stains including hematoxylin and eosin, flourojade B, thionin, colorimetric immunostaining with one primary antibody or histochemical stain, and neuronal apoptosis detection with in situ DNA nick end-labeling technique for all species, golgi staining for rat or mouse brains in addition to those listed above.  Additionally, histological staining of tissue including use of proprietary stains in required.  The Government requires this service for 75 monkey brains (25 brains per contract year), 99 rat/mouse brains and peripheral tissues (33 each per contract year), and 90 guinea pig brains (30 per contract year).  The Contractor will be provided perfused tissue collected from rodents and NHPs exposed to chemical agents and will in turn provide sectioned tissue mounted on slides and stained with proprietary histological stains, including hematoxylin and eosion, flurojade B, thionin, colorimetric immunostaining with one primary antibody or histochemical stain, and neuronal apoptosis detection with in situ DNA nick end-labeling technique.  The contractor shall also collect additional sections.  The Government deserves the right to inspect the contractor's work to verify the performance and to ensure compliance with all federal, state and local regulations, laws and ordinances.  <BR><BR>Specific Tasks:  The Contractor shall provide sections mounted and stained on slides from monkeys, rats, mice, and guinea pigs with a variety of histological stains including hematoxylin and eosin, flourodage B, thionin, colorimetric immunostaining with one primary antibody or histochemical stain, and neuronal apoptosis detection with in situ DNA nick end-labeling technique, with a report at the time of completion.  The contractor shall also provide sections of mounted and stained tissues on slides from rats with golgi staining with a report at the time of completion. <BR><BR>Deliverables and Reports:  A report shall be provided to the Government with the acceptance of the stained slides.  The report shall provide a detailed summary of the service performed.  The items will be picked up by the Government upon completion.  <BR><BR>Deliverable Due Dates:  The Contractor shall provide the stains and a report within 3 months of receiving the tissue from USAMRICD.  The brain tissue will be delivered to the contractor in person with retrieval from a Government employee.  The period of performance of this contract will be 12 months from the effective date of the award with two 12-month option periods.  Total award duration will not exceed 36-months.  <BR><BR>Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan:  The acceptable quality level is delivery completion within 3 months of receipt of the tissue with a 100% surveillance method.  The report summary of services provided shall be provided within 3 months of receipt of the tissue with a 100% surveillance method.  Payments will not be approved until both performance requirements are received and approved by the Contracting Officer Representative (COR). A COR is not empowered to make any contractual commitments or to authorize any contractual changes on the Government's behalf.  The contractor shall refer any changes they deem may affect contract price, terms, or conditions to the KO for action.   A rating scale shall be used to determine a positive, neutral, or negative outcome.  The following ratings shall be used: Exceptional:  Performance significantly exceeds contract requirements to the Government's benefit.  Satisfactory:  Performance meets contractual requirements.  Unsatisfactory:  Performance does not meet contractual requirements.  When unacceptable performance occurs, the COR shall inform the contractor.  This will normally be in writing unless circumstances necessitate verbal communication.  In any case the COR shall document the discussion and place it in the COR file.  When the COR determines formal written communication is required, the COR shall prepare a Contract Discrepancy Report (CDR), and present it to the contractor's task manager or on-site representative.  A CDR template is attached to this QASP.  The contractor shall acknowledge receipt of the CDR in writing.  The CDR will specify if the contractor is required to prepare a corrective action plan to document how the contractor shall correct the unacceptable performance and avoid a recurrence.  The CDR will also state how long after receipt the contractor has to present this corrective action plan to the COR.  The Government shall review the contractor's corrective action plan to determine acceptability. Any CDRs may become a part of the supporting documentation for contract payment deductions, fixed fee deductions, award fee nonpayment, or other actions deemed necessary by the KO."

Basis for award will be based on the best overall proposal that is deemed most beneficial to the Government.  The three evaluation factors are technical, past performance and cost/price.  Technical and past performance is of equal importance.  Non-price/cost factors are significantly more important than cost.  As the collective non-price/cost factors begin to reach equality in the evaluation, price/cost becomes the more important factor in the trade-off analysis.  The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:  (A) Technical:  The narrative shall provide the Offeror's technical approach and plan to be utilized in meeting the key performance requirements outlined in the PWS, including a full explanation of proposed techniques and procedures. This narrative must be specific and detailed, and it must include the rationale behind the proposed approach.  The narrative shall demonstrate the Offeror's breadth of expertise in the ability to address issues in varying technical areas during the life of the contract.  Technical will be evaluated using the following adjective ratings:  Low Risk:  Little doubt exists, based on the Offeror's performance record, that the Offeror can perform the proposed effort.  Moderate Risk:  Some doubt exists, based on the Offeror's performance record, that the Offeror can perform he proposed effort.  High Risk:  Significant doubt exists, based on the Offeror's performance record, that the Offeror can perform he proposed effort.  Unknown Risk:  Little or no relevant performance record, equates to an unknown risk rating having no negative or positive evaluation significance.  (B) Past Performance:  Performance risk is something that both the Government and the offerors want to keep at a level that is appropriate for the given acquisition.  Past performance analysis provides insight into an offeror's probability of successfully completing the solicitation requirements based on the offeror's performance record on similar contract efforts.  (1)The offeror shall provide a narrative of services provided on the same or similar service within the last 3 years to federal, state or local Government or commercial entities.  Information shall include the following:  Name of the Organization, address of the Organization, point of contact at the Organization and the relationship to the requirements of this procurement.  In regards to the description of contract work and comparability to the proposed effort, it is not sufficient to state that it is comparable in magnitude and scope. Rationale must be provided to demonstrate that it is comparable to the performance work statement.  (2) The Offeror shall provide a Resume for all Key Personnel.  For Non-Key Personnel, the Offeror shall provide a representation of intended attributes (Education, Training, Position Description, etc.) of personnel expected to be hired to perform the associated services.  Consideration shall be given to the extent of the qualifications, capabilities, and experience of the Key Personnel and identified staffing and the extent to which the offeror has demonstrated the level of knowledge, skills, abilities and experience of the personnel they are able to provide to meet the requirements of this contract.  Past Performance will be evaluated using the following adjective ratings:  Low Risk:  Little doubt exists, based on the Offeror's performance record, that the Offeror can perform the proposed effort.  Moderate Risk:  Some doubt exists, based on the Offeror's performance record, that the Offeror can perform the proposed effort.  High Risk:  Significant doubt exists, based on the Offeror's performance record, that the Offeror can perform he proposed effort.  Unknown Risk:  Little or no relevant performance record, equates to an unknown risk rating having no negative or positive evaluation significance. (C)  Price:  Price shall be evaluated independently and is of least importance.  An analysis of the price proposal shall be conducted by the Contract Specialist to determine price reasonableness in accordance with FAR 15.305(a)(1).  No adjectival rating will be applied to the price factor of this evaluation.<BR><BR>(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the options. (c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. (End of provision)<BR> 52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certification Commercial Items<BR>52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions Commercial Items.  Addendum to 52.212-4: <BR><BR>52.217-5 Evaluation of Options<BR>52.217-8 Option to Extend Services; The Government may require continued performance of any services within the limits and at the rates specified in the contract. These rates may be adjusted only as a result of revisions to prevailing labor rates provided by the Secretary of Labor. The option provision may be exercised more than once, but the total extension of performance hereunder shall not exceed 6 months. The Contracting Officer may exercise the option by written notice to the Contractor within 60 days of award expiration. <BR><BR>52.217-9 Option to Extend the Term of The Contract; (a) The Government may extend the term of this contract by written notice to the Contractor within 60 days; provided that the Government gives the Contractor a preliminary written notice of its intent to extend at least 60 days before the contract expires. The preliminary notice does not commit the Government to an extension. (b) If the Government exercises this option, the extended contract shall be considered to include this option clause. (c) The total duration of this contract, including the exercise of any options under this clause, shall not exceed 36 months.<BR><BR>FAR 52.246-4 Inspection of Services Fixed Price; The Government retains the rights provided in this clause.<BR>52.214-34 SUBMISSION OF OFFERS IN THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE; 52.214-35 SUBMISSION OF OFFERS IN U.S. CURRENCY; THE CLAUSE 52.212-5 CONTRACT TERMS AND CONDITIONS REQUIRED TO IMPLEMENT STATUTES OR EXECUTIVE ORDERS-COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 2011) (A) THE CONTRACTOR SHALL COMPLY WITH THE FOLLOWING FEDERAL ACQUISITION REGULATION (FAR) CLAUSES, WHICH ARE INCORPORATED IN THIS CONTRACT BY REFERENCE, TO IMPLEMENT PROVISIONS OF LAW OR EXECUTIVE ORDERS APPLICABLE TO ACQUISITIONS OF COMMERCIAL ITEMS: (1) 52.222-50, COMBATING TRAFFICKING IN PERSONS (FEB 2009) (2) 52.233-3, PROTEST AFTER AWARD (Aug 1996) (3) 52.233-4, APPLICABLE LAW FOR BREACH OF CONTRACT CLAIM (Oct 2004) (B) THE CONTRACTOR SHALL COMPLY WITH THE FAR CLAUSES IN THIS PARAGRAPH (B) THAT THE CONTRACTING OFFICER HAS INDICATED AS BEING INCORPORATED IN THIS CONTRACT BY REFERENCE TO IMPLEMENT PROVISIONS OF LAW OR EXECUTIVE ORDERS APPLICABLE TO ACQUISITIONS OF COMMERCIAL ITEMS: 52.203-6 RESTRICTIONS ON SUBCONTRACTOR SALES TO THE GOVERNMENT WITH ALT I; 52.219-14 LIMITATIONS ON SUBCONTRACTING; 52.222-3 CONVICT LABOR; 52.222-19, CHILD LABOR--COOPERATION WITH AUTHORITIES AND REMEDIES; 52.222-21 PROHIBITION OF SEGREGATED FACILITIES; 52.222-26, EQUAL OPPORTUNITY; 52.222-35, AFFIRMATIVE ACTION FOR DISABLED VETERANS AND VETERANS OF THE VIETNAM ERA; 52.222-36, AFFIRMATIVE ACTION FOR WORKERS WITH DISABILITIES; 52.222-37, EMPLOYMENT REPORTS ON DISABLED VETERANS AND VETERANS OF THE VIETNAM ERA; 52.222-50 COMBATING TRAFFICKING IN PERSONS; 52.232-33 PAYMENT BY ELECTRONIC FUNDS TRANSFER-CENTRAL CONTRACTOR REGISTRATION; 52.225-13 RESTRICTIONS ON CERTAIN FOREIGN PURCHASES; 52.233-1 DISPUTES; 52.233-3 PROTEST AFTER AWARD; 52.233-4 APPLICABLE LAW FOR BREACH OF CONTRACT CLAIM; 52.237-3 CONTINUITY OF SERVICES; 52.242-13 BANKRUPTCY; 52.242-15 STOP-WORK ORDER; 52.243-7 NOTIFICATION OF CHANGES; 52.246-1 CONTRACT INSPECTION REQUIREMENTS; 52.253-1 COMPUTER GENERATED FORMS; 52.027-4005 EXPORT CONTRACT ACT COMPLIANCE - THE CONTRACTOR SHALL ASSESS THE WORK TO BE PERFORMED IN THIS EFFORT TO ASSURE THAT ALL ACTIONS ARE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE EXPORT ADMINISTRATION REGULATIONS, 15 CFR PART 730 (EAR), OF THE EXPORT ADMINISTRATION ACT OF 1979, 50 U.S.C.

The full text of a clause may be accessed electronically at this internet address: https://www.acquisition.gov/far; 52.211-15 Defense Priority and Allocation Requirements (APR 2008); 52.247-34 F.O.B. Destination (NOV 1991); 52.233-4 Applicable Law for Breach of Contract Claim (OCT 2004); 52.212-5 Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial Items (JAN 2011)(b)(4)(6)(20-29)(33)(35)(37)(42)(46) 52.209-5 CERTIFICATION REGARDING RESPONSIBILITY MATTERS. (APR 2010)<br />(a)(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that-(i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals-(A) Are &#10063; are not &#10063; presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have &#10063; have not &#10063;, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks "have", the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); (C) Are &#10063; are not &#10063; presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; (D) Have &#10063;, have not &#10063;, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. (2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect; 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect; 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

(A<br />contractor may substitute for any of the named holidays another day off with pay<br />in accordance with a plan communicated to the employees involved.) (See 29 CFR<br />4.174)</p>
<p>THE OCCUPATIONS WHICH HAVE NUMBERED FOOTNOTES IN PARENTHESES RECEIVE THE<br />FOLLOWING:</p>
<p>1) Rates are applicable only under the appropriate occupational category.<br />** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE **</p>
<p>If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract<br />(either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state<br />or local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by<br />laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by<br />an employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the<br />wage determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance<br />with the following standards as compliance:</p>
<p>The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an<br />adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the<br />actual cost of the uniforms. In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance<br />is made the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors<br />subject to this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide<br />collective bargaining agreement providing for a different amount, or the<br />furnishing of contrary affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all<br />employees for such cleaning and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67<br />cents per day). However, in those instances where the uniforms furnished are<br />made of "wash and wear" materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other<br />personal garments, and do not require any special treatment such as dry<br />cleaning, daily washing, or commercial laundering in order to meet the<br />cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms of the Government contract,<br />by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work, there is no requirement<br />that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs.</p>
<p>The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the<br />"Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations", Fifth Edition, April 2006,<br />unless otherwise indicated. Copies of the Directory are available on the<br />Internet. A links to the Directory may be found on the WHD home page at<br />http://www.dol.gov/esa/whd/ or through the Wage Determinations On-Line (WDOL)<br />Web site at http://wdol.gov/.</p>
<p>REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE {Standard<br />Form 1444 (SF 1444)}</p>
<p>Conformance Process:</p>
<p>The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which<br />is not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the<br />work to be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage<br />determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable<br />relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted<br />classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination. Such<br />conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished<br />the fringe benefits as are determined. Such conforming process shall be<br />initiated by the contractor prior to the performance of contract work by such<br />unlisted class(es) of employees. The conformed classification, wage rate, and/or<br />fringe benefits shall be retroactive to the commencement date of the contract.<br />{See Section 4.6 (C)(vi)} When multiple wage determinations are included in a<br />contract, a separate SF 1444 should be prepared for each wage determination to<br />which a class(es) is to be confirmed.</p>
<p>The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows:</p>
<p>1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed<br />occupation(s) and computes a proposed rate(s).</p>
<p>2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in<br />order proposed classification title(s), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for<br />each proposed classification(s), job description(s), and rationale for proposed<br />wage rate(s), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of<br />the authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no<br />authorized representative, the employees themselves. This report should be<br />submitted to the contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted<br />class(es) of employees performs any contract work.</p>
<p>3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a<br />report of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent<br />information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the<br />Wage and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of<br />Labor, for review. (See section 4.6(b)(2) of Regulations 29 CFR Part 4).</p>
<p>4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or<br />disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or<br />notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to<br />process the request.</p>
<p>5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour decision to the<br />contractor.</p>
<p>6) The contractor informs the affected employees.</p>
<p>Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF 1444 or bond<br />paper.</p>
<p>When preparing a conformance request, the "Service Contract Act Directory of<br />Occupations" (the Directory) should be used to compare job definitions to insure<br />that duties requested are not performed by a classification already listed in<br />the wage determination. Remember, it is not the job title, but the required<br />tasks that determine whether a class is included in an established wage<br />determination. Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or<br />subdivide classifications listed in the wage determination.</p>

<DESC>This order is modified to address questions proposed by a prospective bidder. The solicitation will be extended until 02/22/2011.
<p>1. Q: regarding the feed material (oil), it appears that it will need to be pre-heated before it can be</p>
<p>readily pumped. Could you suggest the typical preheat temperature.<br />A: The desired pre-heat temperature range (prior to pumping) is about 40 to 60&deg;C. The preheat temperature (prior to reactor) is at or near desired reactor temperature.</p>
<p><br />2. Q: The same consideration applies to the product leaving the reactor: will this be free flowing or do we</p>
<p>need to keep it warm too (and if so, typical temperature).<br />A: The product liquid must be free flowing but upon exiting the reaction tube, will be cooled sufficiently to prevent loss of product and aid in collection of product.</p>
<p><br />3. Q: You do not specify the materials of construction for the reactor and wetted parts; I would think</p>
<p>316ss will be acceptable but confirm this please.<br />A: 316ss is acceptable as long as the temperature and pressure requirements can be met.</p>
<p><br />4. Q: My understanding is that you want 3 different reactors which can be readily switched and these</p>
<p>basically vary in size. You will only be using ONE of these at any time: please confirm.<br />A: Only one reactor tube will be used at any one time.</p>
<p><br />5. Q: You specify three separate heating zones. Multiple zones are normally needed if the reactor</p>
<p>is long and hence to avoid temperature gradients along the length. Regarding your particular</p>
<p>reactors, I do not foresee that as a problem since the longest one is less than 5". It would be practically</p>
<p>difficult to have more than one heating zone in such a short length but I don't think you will need more</p>
<p>than one. Could you please comment.</p>
<p>Just to clarify this further, we will supply reactors which are much longer than 5". The front-end will typically be packed with inerts and will act to mix and preheat the reagents before they enter the catalyst bed.</p>
<p>It would also be possible to leave an inert section after the catalyst bed. There will be a cooler after the</p>
<p>reactor (normally water cooled).<br />A: We require 3 heating zones for the reactor columns. The measurements stated in #4 of the specs indicate the desired capacity of the portion of the reactor tube that will contain catalyst. The actual reactor columns will be typically three times the length of the catalyst portion to allow for the 3 heating zones.</p>
<p><br />6. Q: You mention also a co-current heat exchanger, I believe to pre-heat the liquid feed against the hot product.</p>
<p>This is of course common practice on a large scale for heat recovery but it is not economic at this small scale.</p>
<p>Remember the liquid flow you specify is only about 2.5 ml/minute and so the energy need to preheat this will be tiny. I have already commented on how we actually preheat. Therefore, with your permission we would like</p>
<p>to suggest that the co-current heat exchanger be deleted and we include just a water cooled exchanger for the product.<br />A: The counter-current pre-heater was chosen because our previous experiences dictate it to be more cost and energy efficient, especially for our desired temperatures. Other methods capable of achieving desired temperatures may be acceptable.</p>
<p><br />7. Q: You specify a manual back-pressure regulator and an air operated valve. Can you clarify the need for the air operated valve. (Normally, we would provided an automated back-pressure regulator but can supply a manual one if you prefer). <br />A: A manual back-pressure valve is sufficient for our needs and automated control is not required, but is acceptable. We desire an air operated valve on both the nitrogen and hydrogen flow controllers. As a safety precaution, the hydrogen flow may be automatically shut down to allow for nitrogen to flood the system.</p>

<DESC>Question 4:<BR>Based on (Question and Answer number 3), I would like to inquire about the possibility of extending the Response Date an additional 2 weeks.  We feel that this additional time is necessary to adequately expand our proposal from 50 to 80 pages, and to provide USACE with the best demonstrable experience and qualifications, in order for USACE to have quality information to make their determinations. <BR><BR>Answer 4:<BR>The increase in the number of pages of Part I of the SF330 from fifty to eighty was not a result of increased requirements in the synopsis as originally posted.  No additional requirements have been added to the synopsis.  The increase in number of pages is solely to allow for more room in the SF330 for firms to include resumes and other required documentation.  As this change did not add requirements for more information or documentation than was originally required by the announcement, no additional time will be added.  The response date of 11:00 a.m. Central Time on 1 March 2011 remains unchanged. <BR><BR><BR><BR>All questions should be submitted in writing ONLY to the Contract Specialist Ms. Lee Ann White at lee.ann.white@usace.army.mil.

<p>1. Evaluation of the technical feasibility of construction of two potential transmission line expansions;<br />2. Evaluation of the economic and financial feasibility, including potential risks of the construction, as well as potential funding sources of the construction of the two transmission line projects.</p>
<p>KEGOC owns and is responsible for operating the grid and all electric power high voltage (220 kilovolts and higher) transmission lines in Kazakhstan, which constitute about 24,000 kilometers (km) of transmission lines. As part of its system, KEGOC owns and operates 74 substations. The company is 100% owned by the national state holding company, Samruk-Kazyna. KEGOC invested more than $200 million in electric power transmission expansion and improvements in 2009, and over the next 15 years it plans to invest more than $3.5 billion. The company has prioritized transmission lines to Kyrgyzstan and to connect existing and future hydropower facilities with significant load centers (net consumption areas).</p>
<p>In particular, KEGOC is planning to construct a 920 kilometer (km) 500kV transmission line that will connect an existing hydropower plant at Shulbinsk (702 MW) and the planned 68 MW Bulak hydropower plant (which will also through water storage upstream allow for increased power delivery from Shulbinsk) to load centers in Aktogai (primarily to be used for electrification of a railway line) and Almaty, the largest city in Kazakhstan. A second 200km 500kV transmission line from Almaty to Kemin, Kyrgyzstan will connect Kazakhstan, which already imports some hydropower-generated electricity from Kyrgyzstan, to the expanding transmission grid in Kyrgyzstan, and potentially through Kyrgyzstan to Tajikistan.</p>
<p>The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $988,004 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).</p>
<p>A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.

<p>In addition, the Contractor calculates Medicare payment amounts and remits these payments to the appropriate party. The Contractor may also conduct redeterminations on appeals of claims; operate a Beneficiary and Provider Customer Service Program (BPCSP) that educates providers and beneficiaries about the Medicare program and responds to provider and beneficiary telephone and written inquiries and make compability of payment&nbsp;decisions nationwide.

<DESC>The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI)/Sources Sought is to obtain potential small business sources that can provide system support requirements, in support of the U.S. Army Food Management Information System (AFMIS). Tasks include analysis, design, programming, modification, hardware and software technical support, system installation, business consulting, product evaluation, customer support, operations support, and program coordination. <BR><BR>AFMIS is the management information system that supports the Army food program. First fielded in 1989, the AFMIS is operational at 53 Army installations throughout the world, U.S. Army Reserve centers and Army National Guard armories. AFMIS provides automation support of menu planning, meal production, ordering and receipting food, financial accounting, headcount and capital asset reporting, inventory control, contract quality assurance, and personnel accountability. AFMIS interfaces with the Subsistence Total Order and Receipt System and the Defense Finance Accounting Service to provide financial accountability of Army food inventories. AFMIS includes an automated headcount service which allows for diner entitlement verification and payroll deduction for meals via the common access ID card. AFMIS is also operational in about 500 Active Army dining facilities and at about 1,700 Army Reserve and National Guard units. AFMIS includes a decision support system (DSS) available to food program managers and logisticians at all levels of Command.<BR><BR>AFMIS is a centralized Web-based system with separate subsystems concurrently running and interfaced together on the same platform but with separate databases. AFMIS consists of Dining Facility Operations (DFO), Troop Issue Subsistence Activity (TISA), Food Program Management (FPM), and Automated Head Count (AHC) subsystems. The AFMIS contractor provides at least 90 percent of the AFMIS programming support. Generally, the US Army Software Engineering Center-Lee (SEC-Lee) releases two AFMIS interim change packages (ICPs) per year. ICPs generally include fifteen to twenty engineering change proposals (ECPs). An ECP represents a broadly-described functional or technical requirement.

<DESC>Q: Paragraph 2.1.1 states: "Each camera system mounts on tripod with height setting of 6 feet to 30 feet".  From this statement, it is not clear if the contractor is to provide tripods or not.  Please clarify.<BR><BR>ANSWER:  The contractor is to provide a tripod or equivalent.<BR><BR>Q: Paragraph 2.1.4 states: "The systems must plug into Solar / battery power, and operate 72 hours continuously with all cameras in scan mode...".<BR><BR>a.	Can we assume that batteries located at each of the four possible nodes is acceptable, vs transmitting power over CAT5 or Coax from a central location?<BR><BR>ANSWER:  Yes, on battery power the batteries can be at each camera location and at the control station.  On prime power, power cables can be run from a central location.  We would like for the contractor to provide their solution to the power requirements.<BR><BR>b.	When referring to "scan mode", does this mean that the pan/tilts are moving at all times (constant duty cycle)?<BR><BR>ANSWER: Yes  <BR><BR><BR>Q: Section 2.1.1 "Recognize personnel 2km day/1 km night". Recognize is often confused with Identify. Recognize is generally construed as being able to determine man vs. animal, male vs. female, soldier vs. civilian, child vs. adult etc. is this the intent, or are you expecting to be able to identify specifically who a person is?<BR><BR>ANSWER:  There are three levels of identification:  Detect, Identify, and Recognize.<BR><BR>	Detect - Something is out there.<BR>	Identify - You can tell if it is a person, animal, or vehicle<BR>	Recognize - You can tell if it is a adult/child, civilian/soldier, male/female, deer/cow, can/van.  Consideration is made for how humans may try to disguise, or hide their features,   especially at night. <BR><BR> <BR><BR>Q: Section 2.1.2 "The Kit will include a control station and the cameras will plug directly into this control station. Size of control station is a carry-on suitcase". Is the kit to include a display, and if so, what are the general display requirements. <BR><BR> <BR>ANSWER:  The monitor need to be as large as possible to be able to display all four cameras at the same time.<BR><BR><BR>Q: Section 2.1.3 "400m of cabling total for camera to plug into control station Cabling must be cat 5 or coaxial. Cabling must be divided into 100m segments". When using long lengths of cable, there is an inherent signal loss, reducing the quality of the image over length. Has there been any consideration in using a secure wireless capability vice 400m of cable and if so should we include wireless capabilities in our response? <BR><BR>ANSWER:  The Army Spectrum Management Office (ASMO) would need to provide approval for any wireless capabilities.  It is problematic that approval can be done in the time frame required.  The REF prefers cables.  The type of cables can be determined by the vendor.  The vendor needs to provide an engineering solution to meet the capability needed.  <BR> <BR>Q: Section 2.1.7 "System must have laser range finder (Threshold)". Given the ranges for detection and recognition in Section 2.1.1 (Detect range for vehicle and personnel: 4km day/2 km night Recognize personnel 2km day/1 km night), is the expected useful range of the laser range finder 4km or is the requirement something greater?<BR><BR>ANSWER:  The useful range is 4km.<BR>

<a href="mailto:lynn.m.pina@us.army.mil">RDECOM Contracting Center - Natick R&D (RDECOM-CC)</a>
<DESC>Introduction:  <BR><BR>Pursuant to FAR Subpart 13.106-1(b)(1), the U.S. Army RDECOM Contracting Center, Natick Contracting Division, on behalf of the Technology, Systems & Program Integration Directorate (TSPID) intends to award a firm fixed price purchase order on a sole source basis to: Eagle Picher Energy Products ULC., 13136-82A Avenue, Surrey, British Columbia, CANADA, V3W 9Y6.<BR><BR>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.  No solicitation document is available. <BR><BR>1) FAR Statutory Authority cited: 13.106-1(b)(1) only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.<BR><BR>2) Nature and description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs:  <BR><BR>Eagle Picher Energy Products, ULC., is the only manufacturer and distributor of the "Half Size" BA-5590 Lithium Carbon-monofluoride (LiCFx) primary battery, developed under contract W911QY-08-C-0047.   This battery was successfully demonstrated in the Army Expeditionary Warrior Experiment (AEWE), and is the only LiCFx battery with the correct dimensions, connector location, and compatibility with the SINCGARs power use profile for use in the AEWE experiment.  This battery is also the only product on the market that conforms to the required performance, safety, and transportation standards outlined in MIL-PRF-47491B and UN Transportation Standard ST/SG/AC.10/27/Add.2.  This battery is the only one to surpass the required Power ATO Wh/Kg threshold of 390.  The intent is to award a Firm Fixed Price type contract for $45,000.00. <BR><BR>3) A demonstration that the proposed contractor is the only source available to provide these services or goods (i.e. unique qualifications, proprietary rights, etc.): <BR><BR>Eagle Picher Energy Products, ULC., is the only manufacturer and distributor of the "Half Size" BA-5590 Lithium Carbon-monofluoride (LiCFx) primary battery, developed under contract W911QY-08-C-0047.  This contract was issued under the joint NSRDEC and CERDEC Army Technology Objective (ATO) "Power for the Dismounted Soldier D.LG.200S.01 ", and this BA-5590 battery has participated in previous Warfighter demonstrations, evaluations and other developmental venues. Also this BA-5590 has met all experimentation/demonstration safety requirements, a feat that cannot be accomplished with a new vendor in the limited amount of time before the AEWE is conducted.  The latest version produced by Eagle Picher has the highest energy density (WhlKg) available, which would allow the user to cany fewer batteries and successfully demonstrate an overall weight reduction.<BR>  <BR>4) A description of the market research that was conducted and the results, or a statement of the reason a market research was not conducted:  <BR><BR>Market research was not conducted because this is the only viable product to conduct our research. The "Half Size" BA-5590 was developed under the joint NSRDEC and CERDEC Army Technology Objective (ATO) "Power for the Dismounted Soldier D.LG.200S.01". Other vendors can propose developmental efforts related to LiCFx primary battery technology through the Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) hosted by the Natick Contracting Division (NCD) on their website at http://www3.natick.army.mil. As a result of this development effort and the subsequent evaluations conducted with the EPEP BA-5590 LiCFx primary battery there is no other item on the market that can satisty our requirements in the time allotted before the AEWE.<BR>	 <BR>5) Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition: <BR><BR>Eagle Picher Energy Products, ULC., has been very responsive to governmental feedback, and has been on the forefront of advancing the LiCFx battery chemistries.  They have created the highest energy densities in LiCFx batteries to date while maintaining manufacturabiIity.<BR><BR>6) A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required:  <BR><BR>Not feasible at our level.<BR><BR>Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement to the U.S. Army RDECOM Contracting Center, Natick Contracting Division via e-mail to: Lynn.M.Pina@us.army.mil no later than 8:00 a.m. on  February 18, 2011.<BR><BR>Contracting Office Address: <BR>RDECOM Contracting Center - Natick<BR>CCRD-NA-SU, Natick Contracting Division<BR>Kansas Street, Building 1<BR>Natick, MA 01760-5011<BR><BR>Point of Contact:<BR>Lynn Pina, Contract Specialist<BR>Lynn.M.Pina@us.army.mil<BR>

<DESC><p><strong>Q&amp;A/FURTHER CLARIFICATION TO REQUIREMENT:</strong>&nbsp;<br /><br /><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">This requirement does not require LPR capabilities but rather access and membership to Motor Vehicle Administrators across the United States and Canada.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">The question isn't whether LPRs can read stacked letters.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The question is whether individual states and provinces should include the stacked letters as part of the 'official' license number or not. For CBP this is an enforcement issue. If an LPR reads the number to include stacked letters but a lookout was entered by a state enforcement agency without the stacked letters, then there will not be a match (and vice-versa). One of the&nbsp;services provided for this requirement&nbsp;will be a&nbsp;published&nbsp;report that recommends standard practices - such as including stacked letters or not. The report will also make recommendations on excessive graphics and unusual fonts (making the plate harder to read), and any other issues regarding license plate readability.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">This effort started because CBP does not have a policy on stacked letters. Some officers will correct a plate which has stacked letters to show the number without the stacked letters, and vice-versa - adding the stacked letters to a read that does not include them. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>As such, there is no consistency.<br /></span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt"><br />Again, this requirement is not about the ability of LPRs to read stacked letters, as CBP recognizes that capability.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>AAMVA can provide direct access to Motor Vehicle departments in all U.S. states and Canadian provinces to answer questions on license plate issuance, etc. They also have established contacts in law enforcement agencies - users of LPRs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<DESC>The National Science Foundation (NSF) intends to procure, on a sole-source basis, access to Science Direct from Elsevier, Inc. from the date of award through December 31, 2011. Access to these publications is needed by NSF program officers in order to help them evaluate grant proposals, find possible grant reviewers, and keep up to date in their fields of scientific expertise. The NSF Library, through the National Research Library Alliance (NRLA), brokered an agreement with Elsevier to gain electronic access to full text Elsevier journals. Under the terms of this agreement, NSF gains desktop electronic access to a list of shared titles in the NRLA consortium.
<p>Elsevier is the publisher of these titles and the only source for these journals, to which it holds the copyright, this electronic access is not available through any other source.<br /><br />The proposed contract action is for services for which the government intends to sponsor with only one source under the authority of FAR 12.106. This notice is not a request for competitive proposals. This synopsis is for information purposes only.</p>

<DESC>The United States Department of Energy (DOE) has a requirement for the acquisition of expert public utility management support services for the Berkeley Site Office (BSO) of the Department of Energy's (DOE) Office of Science (SC), on behalf of DOE contractor-operated facilities in northern California.  Broadly stated, these services will relate to (a) utility requirements and sources, (b) acquisition of utility services, (c) management of utility assets, and (d) protection of utility rights and advancement of utility interests.  "Utility" is defined to primarily be electric power.
Collectively, the labs and DOE have formed an Electric Power Consortium (the consortium) with the primary objective of delivering reliable power to the laboratories at the lowest overall cost.  The BSO has overall responsibility for managing the consortium on behalf of DOE.  The consortium operates a power rebilling system among the Labs to allocate costs in an equitable manner.
Interested parties should have direct experience related to the all facets of utility management, including research; planning; technical, economic and market analyses; acquisition, including cost and price analyses, terms and conditions, and support for negotiation discussions; systems management, including preparation and maintenance of power requirements schedules, rebilling algorithms and procedures; and support for intervention with utility regulatory bodies and courts, including the preparation and presentation of testimony as expert witness.
This acquisition is set-aside for small business with an applicable North American Industry Classification Code (NAIC) of 541618 and a size limit standard of $7.0M.  
Questions can be submitted to the Contracting Officer by e-mail only at spencer.peterson@bso.science.doe.gov.  No  questions will be accepted after February 4 to allow time to prepare and transmit responses.  No questions will be accepted by phone or fax.

<DESC>Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) Research Opportunity Description
The Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) is interested in White Papers for long and short term Research and Development (R&D) projects that offer potential for advancement and improvements in the implementation of shipboard Integrated Power Systems (IPS) at the major component, subsystem and system level.  IPS provides total ship electric power including electric propulsion, power conversion and distribution, combat system support and ship mission load interfaces to the electric power system.  The flexibility of electric power transmission allows power generating modules with various power ratings to be connected to propulsion loads and ship service in any arrangement that supports the ship's mission at the lowest total ownership cost (TOC).  Systems engineering in IPS is focused on increasing the commonality of components used across ship types and in developing modules that will be integral to standardization, zonal system architectures, and generic shipbuilding strategies with standard interfaces that are Navy controlled.  The modules or components developed will be assessed for applicability both to next generation shipboard electrical architectures and combat systems and to back-fit opportunities that improve the energy efficiency and mission effectiveness in the current fleet.  NAVSEA wishes to continue to improve IPS by performing analysis, modeling and simulation, life cycle cost analysis, producibility studies, module development, ship integration, architecture design, ship electric architectures and support for high power weapons systems requirements, and related efforts.  An evaluation of emerging technologies for ship applications (such as fuel cells, support for high energy weapons, support for high power radars, high-speed generators, and advanced power electronics) to determine future feasibility and development requirements will be conducted.  The approach to hardware developed under this BAA is that it fosters modularity and scalability (so that families of products may be leveraged to multiple potential applications) and shall accommodate an open system architecture where interfaces are well defined and mutually accepted.
Electric Ships Office:  The Navy has initiated the Next Generation Integrated Power Systems (NGIPS) effort with centralized leadership by the Electric Ships Office (ESO).  The mission of the ESO (PMS 320, organizationally a part of the Program Executive Office - Ships) is to develop and provide smaller, simpler, more affordable, and more capable ship's power systems for all Navy platforms by defining open architectures, developing common components, and focusing Navy and industry investments.  The ESO will provide leadership of the developments identified as part of this BAA, will direct the transition of associated technologies developed by the Office of Naval Research (ONR), and will manage the technology portfolio represented by Program Element (PE) 0603573N (Advanced Surface Machinery Systems) for transition into existing and future Navy ships.  The guiding document that will be used to define the module developments that advance the NGIPS vision is the Next Generation Integrated Power System (NGIPS) Technology Development Roadmap, Naval Sea Systems Command Ser 05D/349 of 30 Nov 2007, which is publicly available under announcement N00024! 08R4123.	NGIPS:  The areas of focus for White Papers and Proposals submitted in response to this BAA should include, but are not limited to, the analysis, development, risk reduction and demonstration of future shipboard electric power systems and components, emphasizing shipboard power generation, propulsion, conversion, distribution and control; power quality, continuity, and system stability; electric power system/component level modeling and simulation; energy storage technologies; electrical system survivability; simplicity and ruggedness.  The Integrated Power Architecture provides the framework for partitioning the equipment and software of NGIPS into modules and defines functional elements and the power/control and information relationships between them.  For power generation, high power distribution, propulsion, and large loads, the NGIPS architecture includes Medium Voltage AC power (with emphasis on affordability), High Frequency AC power (with emphasis on power density in the near term), and Medium Voltage DC power (with emphasis on power density and fault management in the far term).  For ship service electrical loads, NGIPS includes zonal electrical distribution which may be either AC or DC, depending upon the specific application.  In addition to a full IPS implementation, modules that support a paritally integrated power system, or Hybrid Electric Drive (HED) where mechanical propulsion is augmented by rotating machinery off of the propulsion train for propulsion, or additional power generation shall be considered.  Also of particular interest are technologies that result in significant energy efficiency and/or carbon footprint improvements over existing propulsion and power system technologies.  The NGIPS roadmap partitions the power system components functionally into modules.  Those modules, subsystems and systems of interest include the following.
Power Generation Module (PGM):  A Power Generation functional element converts fuel into electrical power. The electrical power is transferred to one or more Power Distribution functional elements.  An associated Power Generation module might typically consist of a gas turbine or diesel engine, a generator, a rectifier (either active or passive), auxiliary support sub-modules and module controls. Other possible technologies include propulsion derived ship service (PDSS), fuel cells, or other direct energy conversion concepts.  Power Generation concepts include 60 Hz wound rotor synchronous generator driven directly by a marine gas turbine (up to 30 MVA rating); 4 pole, 120 Hz, commercially derived or militarized design variants of the above; and higher speed, higher frequency, high power density variants of the above with high speed or geared turbine drive.  The specific design issues to be considered include fuel efficiency, machine insulation system characteristics, size, weight, cost, maintainability, availability, harmonic loading, voltage, power, fault protection, voltage and frequency response to large dynamic loading, interface to main or ship service bus, and commercial availability.
Power Distribution Module (PDM):  A Power Distribution functional element transfers electrical power between other functional elements. Fault protection systems should be designed, if possible, to not require the power distribution modules to communicate control signals with any functional element other than system control. An associated Power Distribution module might typically consist of bus duct, cables, switchgear and fault protection equipment.
Power Conversion Module (PCM):  A Power Conversion functional element converts electrical power from one form to another.  An associated Power Conversion module might typically consist of a solid state power converter and/or a transformer.  Advanced topologies and technologies, such as the application of wide band gap devices, will be considered.
Power Load Module (PLM):  A Power Load functional element is a user of electrical power received from one or more Power Distribution functional elements. The area of interest for NGIPS in the Power Load is the load interface definition and the provision of specialty power to optimize that load interface.  Among the special load interfaces that would require development are support for pulsed power weapons and sensors such as radar power supplies, electromagnetic launchers (for example EM Railgun), and advanced laser systems, all of which would benefit from optimized integration with the shipboard power system.  This would enable real time data and asset management and reconfiguration based on demand.
Propulsion Motor Module (PMM):  Electric propulsion motors and propulsion motor drives are large electrical loads as well as NGIPS modules.  Candidate propulsion motor concepts include Permanent Magnet Motors (radial air gap, axial air gap, or transverse flux), Induction Motors (wound rotor or squirrel cage), Superconducting field type (homopolar DC or synchronous AC).  The drivers and issues associated with these designs include acoustic signature, noise (requirements, limitations, modeling, sources, and mitigation methods), shock, vibration, coolant temperature, manufacturing infrastructure, machine insulation system characteristics, commercial commonality, platform commonality, cost, torque, power, weight, diameter, length, voltage, motor configuration, and ship arrangements constraints.  Motor drives that may be explored include cycloconverter (with variations in control and power device types), pulse width modulated converter/inverter (with many variations in topology), switching (hard switched, soft switched), and matrix converter (with variations in control, topology, cooling, power device type).  Technologies for drives and rotating machines which allow the ability to operate both as a motor and a generator to facilitate a propulsion derived ship service (PDSS) installation or on a fully integrated power system to leverage the inherent energy storage in the ship's motion may be explored. Integrated motor/propulsor concepts may be considered either as aft-mounted main propulsion or as a forward propulsor capable of propelling a ship at a tactically useful speed.
Energy Storage Module (ESM):  An Energy Storage functional element stores energy.  A number of alternative energy storage technologies and/or configurations (location within the distribution system and capacity) may be considered for future ship applications, such as battery, capacitor-based, fuel cell, fly wheel, or superconducting energy storage. Shipboard power quality and continuity along with examination of the implications of future high power/pulse power loads on configuration/technology alternatives is critical.  Energy storage modules may consist of short term (micro/milli second) or long term (minutes/hours) energy storage applications which utilize a combination of technologies to minimize power quality and continuity impacts across the system.
Power System Control (PCON):  A System Control functional element consists of the software necessary to coordinate multiple other functional elements. A System Control Functional Element receives information from other functional elements and external (non-IPS) systems. Similarly, a System Control functional element may receive control commands from or negotiate control actions with external systems and other functional elements. System Control manages the power and energy flow within the ship to ensure power is delivered to the right load in the right form at the right time.  While various forms of power control have been implemented on commercial IPS ships, the survivability requirements for military ships combined with the pulse load characteristics for some of the loads described above will require more sophisticated algorithms than are commercially available.  A System Control functional element resides on an external distributed computer system and therefore typically does not include hardware elements (unless specialized hardware is required).

<DESC>This is a modification to the Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) N00024-10-R-4215 posted on 1 February 2010.  This modification extends the date for receipt of white papers and full proposals to 9 February 2012.  Priority for selection for full proposals, if any, will be given to white papers previously submitted or submitted within 45 days of this announcement.  Any white papers that have already been submitted do not need to be resubmitted.

This modification also makes changes to the Section 4 Research Opportunity Description under GENERAL INFORMATION of the original announcement.  The following is paragraph is substituted:

Power Load Module (PLM):  A Power Load functional element is a user of electrical power received from one or more Power Distribution functional elements.
 The area of interest for NGIPS in the Power Load is the load interface definition and the provision of specialty power to optimize that load interface.  Among the special load interfaces that would require development are support for pulsed power weapons and sensors such as radar power supplies, electromagnetic launchers (for example EM Railgun), and advanced laser systems, all of which would benefit from optimized integration with the shipboard power system.  This would enable real time data and asset management and reconfiguration based on demand.  The Navy has an interest in initiating the development of a capacitor based rep-rate pulsed power system with similar capabilities to that described in Office of Naval Research (ONR) announcement 10-RFI-0001.
 Concepts that align with the technology development required for the Electromagnetic (EM) Railgun and also support shipboard energy storage needs will be considered by both the Electric Ships Office and ONR for award.  As an update to the industry caucus on December 2, 2009 under ONR solicitation 10-RFI-0001, the nominal module rating of 250 kilo-joules (kJ) and an energy density of 1.3 mega-joule-per-cubic-meter (1.3MJ/m^3) is contemplated.  The energy density goal for the pulsed power component (excluding bus-work to launcher) is 1.3 MJ/m^3 or better.  Reducing system volume is important, but this has to be balanced with system fault tolerance and cost. The Electric Ships Office (PMS 320) in conjunction with ONR is interested in both near term solutions that have the potential for rapid transition to a high Technology Readiness Level (TRL) as well as longer term technology pushes that advance the science and would enable a future compact shipboard system.
  Risk reducing technology prototype demonstrations in the near term are encouraged.  

The following is paragraph is added:

Energy Efficiency Enabling Technologies (E3T):  Improving energy efficiency and energy management aboard ship by application of advanced electrical distribution and propulsion system related technologies is a Navy priority.  E3T submissions may include technologies, modifications, and/or new components to existing and future ship systems that will increase the efficiency of electrical systems or facilitate the utilization of renewable energy sources to lower fuel and energy consumption on US Navy Ships.  The areas of interest include but are not limited to propulsion, electrical distribution systems, electrical equipment, power conversion, and power generation.
  The Navy will consider approaches that modify systems and/or operations to affect quantifiable energy conservation in the Fleet. Emphasis is placed on technologies with an identified transition path capable of making near-term, measurable improvements to Navy energy conservation.  This effort will be in conjunction with the requirements provided in the Naval Surface Warfare Center announcement N00167-11-BAA-01, which looks at similar technologies for application to Military Sealift Command vessels, and ideas will be shared with sponsors in both applications.

All other information contained in the original announcement remains unchanged.

<DESC><p><br />The health care support mission will transition from the U. S. Department of Defense to the U. S. Department of State over a period of time as denoted in Attachment B. Transition Timeline, beginning on or about June 2011 with transfer completed by December 2011. After the U.S. military forces withdraw from Iraq, the U.S. Embassy and constituent posts and sites will be comprised of approximately 14,000 to 17,000 personnel under the U.S. Ambassador which includes U.S. Government civilians, military and local national employees; and supporting Contractors (U.S., third country, and local national). All U.S. and third country personnel will require medical care. Local nationals will be treated only in emergencies or for work related injuries. Extraordinary circumstances may result in treatment of some Iraqi nationals at the direction of the COM, however it is expected that this would be a rare occurrence.</p>
<p>The Department of State will establish a network of Contractor operated facilities in three regional support areas (see Attachment C for map of the facility locations and support regions) consisting of seven Health Units (HUs), one large Diplomatic Support Hospital (DSH), and three small DSHs that provide patient care. A description of the capabilities required of each of the three types of facilities may be found in the Scope of Work of this PWS. Health care facilities will be in secure compounds within each of the three geographical support regions with general logistics, utilities, and housing support provided by separate contracts</p>

<DESC>This is not an announcement of a Solicitation. The U.S. Geological Survey needs to assess industry interest and capability to provide environmental time-series-data software and software support services.In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 52.215-3, Request for Information for Solicitation and Planning Purposes (October 1997), this notice is issued solely for information and planning purposes. It does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP). The Department of the Interior (DOI)/U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) intends to assess the responses to inform its decision-making. This notice is not to be construed as a commitment by the government to contract for services. The government will not pay for any information provided as a result of this notice and will not recognize or reimburse any cost associated with RFI submission. Responses to this RFI will not affect a potential offeror's ability to respond to any RFP that might follow. Please ensure that any sensitive or protected information is marked as such and the government will ensure this information is not released externally. The overarching objective for this RFI is information gathering and not acquisition of products or services.Part of the mission of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) is to provide hydrologic information that contributes to the wise management of the Nation's natural resources and that promotes the health, safety, and well-being of the people. This information consists of databases and descriptions and analyses of the water resources of the United States. Much of the streamflow, groundwater, and water-quality data collected by the Water Mission Area of the USGS are time-series data measured at a frequency of as much as 12 times per hour. The USGS currently stores and processes its time-series water data in an internally developed and maintained system. Recent evaluations of the efficiencies of our time-series data processes have identified our greatest need to be a modern, powerful set of software tools to increase the efficiency of our time-series data collection, processing, review, and dissemination. The immediacy and scope of this need requires that we look beyond our normal software development process.Consequently, we are performing market research on a data-processing system that supports these needs for our surface-water, groundwater, and water-quality time-series data. For this, we are issuing a general request for information to vendors of time-series water-data processing software. The ideal software system should include the following features and characteristics:&nbsp;<br />A. Software System functionality<br />- Allows for full support of any type of time-series data and meta-data (e.g.<br />groundwater, surface water, water quality, atmospheric). <br />- Includes an intuitive graphical user interface<br />- Not tied to a specific data model/database but adaptable to read other<br />data and meta-data structures.<br />- Allows for different user-level privileges to maintain access to data<br />editing, data approval, and site and database administrative functions.<br />- Provides the ability to ingest historical data from legacy systems<br />- Functions under the most recent versions of Windows (7, XP, 2003, Vista,<br />etc ).<br />- Allow for implementation on a portable PC and its operation in standalone<br />mode in the field.<br />- Used in a network environment where data is replicated over multiple<br />nodes<br />- Allows for integration of external, user written, scripts or modules for<br />data processing or display.
<p>B. Data acquisition<br />- Includes system for time-series data acquisition using GOES satellite,<br />modem, and other telemetry systems.<br />- Allows for manual uploading of time-series logger files.<br />- Includes ability to manually and automatically process files containing<br />discrete measurements, site inspections, calibrations, and other site<br />visit data.<br />- Supports loading and use of site metadata information such as surveying<br />data, cross-sections, photos, etc.<br />- Includes the capacity to apply automated QA/QC procedures to screen and<br />flag real-time data, to monitor site and sensor conditions, and to issue<br />automated reporting/alerts.</p>
<p>C. Data processing<br />- Includes the ability to display and manage site visit data (discrete <br />measurements, inspections, calibrations, etc.)<br />- Includes a computation module to generate discharge and other parameters<br />both manually and automatically, applying relevant data corrections,<br />ratings, and shifts.<br />- Includes a module to develop other user-selected models for the<br />computation of parameters from one or more time-series data sets and a<br />computation module to apply those models both manually and automatically.<br />- Includes a module for the graphic creation and maintenance of<br />stage-discharge ratings and rating shifts.<br />- Includes a module for the graphical development of data corrections for<br />sensor fouling, sensor drift or other corrections that integrates time<br />series and site visit data.<br />- Includes a module for graphical and tabular editing of time-series data<br />and daily summary statistics (e.g. daily mean values)<br />- Includes the ability to automatically compute and apply data corrections<br />and rating shifts based on entered site visit data. <br />- Includes methods to develop regression models and to estimate missing<br />time-series data from regression equations or other means.<br />- Includes the ability to automatically apply data grades or uncertainty to<br />time-series data.<br />- Stores an audit trail of data editing, corrections and processing steps.<br />- Includes the ability to store comments related to all processing steps <br />(edits, corrections, rating application, estimates, etc.) and to compile <br />those comments into a site analysis history.<br />- Includes the ability to generate daily, monthly, and annual statistics<br />- Includes the ability to analyze time-series data for peak events and <br />other period of record extremes.</p>
<p>D. Data review<br />- Maintains levels of data processing to track the status of the<br />time-series data review up to data approval.<br />- Includes a comprehensive data review module supporting displays and<br />reports of multi-parameter data plots and tables, integrated time-series <br />and site visit data, automated QA/QC checks, and other data review tools.<br />- Includes the ability to track revisions to approved data</p>
<p>E. Output and dissemination<br />- Includes module to manage the dissemination of data to the web. Provides<br />alerts when data acquisition or dissemination processes fail.<br />- Ability to output data in various formats (graphical, tabular, and flat<br />file) in manual and batch processes<br />o Instantaneous data<br />o Daily statistics<br />o Processing instructions (corrections, models, ratings, shifts)<br />o Site visit data</p>

<a href="mailto:jacklyn.mcgurk@amedd.army.mil">US Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity</a>
<DESC>The United States Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity (USAMRAA) intends to negotiate a firm fixed price requirements-type award on a sole source basis, IAW FAR 13.501 under the authority of the test program for commercial items (section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996). Charles River Laboratories, 251 Ballardvale Street, Wilmington, MA, has been identified as the only responsible source that can provide research animals within the conditions as described below. The requirement is for commercially available standard and modified (surgery) animals. The total estimated award amount is $3,050,000 for a Base + (2) option years<BR>firm fixed price award.<BR>Responsible firms may identify their interest and submit a capability statement to respond to future requirements. Submit email capability statements (using PDF, MS Word, Excel attachments) to Jackie McGurk at, Jacklyn.McGurk@amedd.army.mil. Fax statements may be sent to 410-436-4863; Attn: Jackie McGurk. Email statements are preferred. Statements are due no later than 5:00 P.M. EST on 28 FEB 2011. No telephone calls will be accepted. This Notice of Intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, information received within 15 days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed award is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a future competitive procurement.<BR>In many circumstances, research must be conducted on animals with a known and consistent genetic background. One method of ensuring consistency in genetic background is to purchase animals from the same vendor. Genetically speaking, a strain of animal from one vendor is very different from the very same "strain" purchased at another vendor. In fact, genetics vary significantly after twenty generations and after forty generations, genetics of animals from different locations vary to such an extent that they are designated as "substrains." In order to prevent substrain variability from impacting the quality of research at the Medical Research Institute for Chemical Defense (MRICD), certain animals must come from the same vendor location each and every time. That vendor is Charles River. Another method of ensuring consistent quality research is to purchase animals that are free of certain pathogens. The list of pathogens which makes an animal unacceptable varies by species.<BR>The species and pathogens not present for this requirement are:<BR><BR>Guinea pigs must be free of:<BR>LCMV Helicobacter species<BR>Adenovirus (GAV) All ectoparasites<BR>Sendai virus Clostridium piliforme<BR>Pneumoniavirus of Mice (PVM)<BR>Encephalitozoon species<BR>Bordatella bronchiseptica<BR>Mycoplasma pulmonis<BR>Salmonella species<BR>Streptococcus zooepidemicus<BR>Streptococcus pneumonia<BR>Streptobacillius moniliformis<BR><BR>Rats must be free of:<BR>Sendai virus<BR>Pneumonia Virus of Mice (PVM)<BR>Sialodacryoadenitis virus (SDAV)<BR>Rat parvoviruses: rat parvovirus (RPV), Toolhan's (H-1) and Kilham's rat virus (KRV)<BR>Theiler's Murine Encephalomyelitis Virus (TMEV)/GDVII<BR>Reovirus(REO)<BR>Rat Theilovirus (RTV)<BR>Hantavirus<BR>Lymphocytic Choriomeningitis Virus (LCMV)<BR>Adenoviruses (MAV)<BR>Bordatella bronchiseptica<BR>Corynibacterium kutcheri<BR>Mycoplasma pulmonis<BR>Salmonella species<BR>Streptococcus zooepidemicus<BR>Streptobacillus moniliformis<BR>Helicobacter species<BR>All ectoparasites<BR>Giardia species<BR>Spironucleus<BR>Helminths<BR><BR>Mice must be free of:<BR>Sendai virus Spironucleus<BR>Adenovirus (MAV) Helminths<BR>Pneumonia Virus of Mice (PVM) All ectoparasites<BR>Hepatitis virus (MHV) Giardia species<BR>Minute virus of Mice (MVM) Encephalitozoon species<BR>Parvovirus (MPV)<BR>Theiler's Murine Encephalomyelitis Virus (TMEV)/GDVII<BR>Reoviruses (REO and EDIM)<BR>Hantavirus<BR>Ectromeliavirus<BR>Lymphocytic Choriomeningitis Virus (LCMV)<BR>Bordatella bronchiseptica<BR>Citrobacter rodentium<BR>Corynibacterium kutscheri<BR>Mycoplasma pulmonis<BR>Salmonella species<BR>Streptococcus zooepidemicus<BR>Streptobacillus moniliformis<BR>Helicobacter species<BR><BR>Rabbits must be free of:<BR>Rabbit Hemorrhagic Disease Virus (RHDV)<BR>LCMV<BR>Reovirus (REO)<BR>Bordatella bronchiseptica<BR>CAR Bacillus<BR>Helicobacter species<BR>Lawsonia species<BR>Pasteurella species<BR>Salmonella species<BR>Treponema<BR>Clostridium piliforme<BR>Eimeria species<BR>Encephalitozoon species<BR>Helminths<BR>All ectoparasites

<DESC>A request was received from several companies to extend the closing date for the solicitation by two (2) weeks. Due to the recent process change in determining offers fair and reasonable caused by the DPAP Memorandum dated 14 Sep 2010, 700 CONS internal process requires the contracting officer to decide whether to post solicitations for a full 30 days or whether market research indicates that sufficient responses will be received to comply with the definition of competition in FAR 15. For this project, numerous vendors have indicated interest, but are attending the industry Expo and have requested extensions to the original two (2) week return date for offers. Therefore, doubt exists that sufficient offers will be received without the full 30 day posting that will qualify as competition and the determination is made to allow the solicitation to remain open until the full 30 day posting period is complete. The new closing date for offers will be <br /><strong>Monday 28 February 2011, 1100hrs CEST.</strong>

<DESC><p>UPDATE 17 (11 February 2011)</p>
<p>The purpose of this update is to provide the TABSS Q+A Addendum Matrix.  It is located in the lower-right hand side of this page.</p>
<p>The Q+A Addendum Matrix has two parts.  The first part consists of questions that were received before the TABSS question due date but were accidentally left off of the original TABSS Q+A Matrix.  The second part consists of clarifications regarding certain questions from the original TABSS Q+A Matrix.</p>
<p>The government will accept no further questions.  Neither the TABSS Q+A Matrix nor the Q+A Addendum Matrix will be updated in the future.  In the event of a discrepancy between either matrix and the amended RFP, the amended RFP governs.</p>
<p>Neither the TABSS Q+A Matrix nor the Q+A Addendum Matrix are included in any of the TABSS amendments.  They are provided as guidance to offerors.</p>
<p>Thank you for your time and your support of the TABSS procurement.</p>
<p>UPDATE 16 (10 February 2011)</p>
<p>The purpose of this update is to provide the amended RFP and RFP attachments. Of particular note is the amended Attachment 10, "Labor Category Descriptions and Qualifications Matrix," along with the new Attachment 11, "Annual Small Business Subcontracting Compliance Report."</p>
<p>Two copies of the RFP are being provided, an "informational" copy with highlighting and a "conformed" copy without highlighting. In the informational copy, all new changes to the RFP have been highlighted in turquoise. Changes made via Amendment 4 are highlighted in yellow. The content of the two RFPs (both informational and conformed) is identical. Please use the conformed copy in the future.</p>
<p>Attachments that have been changed since Amendment 4 are updated per the descriptions on the Standard Form 30 in Amendment 5. Any attachment not mentioned in the Standard Form 30 in Amendment 5 is unchanged. However, all attachments are included with this update for offerors' reference.</p>
<p>Regarding the amended RFP, to reiterate:</p>
<p>(1) Paper copies of proposals are required. Please see Sections L-5 and L-6 of the amended RFP for more information.</p>
<p>(2) Labor category descriptions are provided in the amended Attachment 10. Offerors should meet those stated requirements</p>
<p>(3) For offerors' acknowledgement of amendments, please see Section L-8 of the RFP.</p>
<p>(4) Evaluation Factor 3, "Socio-economic Considerations," has been significantly amended. Please see Sections L and M of the RFP for more information.</p>
<p>(5) For the $250 contractual minimum, this amount will be obligated to each contract at the time of award. It will not be provided as consideration for the contractor's requirement to attend the post-award conference. Travel expenses for post-award conferences are the responsibility of the contractor.</p>
<p>(6) The proposal due date is extended until 3 PM Eastern Standard Time on 03/02/2011.</p>
<p>With regard to the TABSS email box, it is sporadically experiencing technical difficulties; the government is working to resolve the issue. Offerors should advise all their references to continue sending their past performance questionnaires to TABSS@uscg.mil, but references may also copy Nathan Dolezal (nate.dolezal@uscg.mil) and Katherine Powers (Katherine.Powers@uscg.mil) on emails containing completed questionnaires.</p>

The acquisition and resulting multiple award contracts will be collectively referred to as TABSS (Technical, Acquisition and Business Support Services). The United States Coast Guard (USCG) is conducting this department-wide acquisition with on behalf of DHS and all of its components. Use of this contract vehicle will be limited to all DHS components.</p>
<p>The technical, acquisition and business support services to be acquired can be categorized into three domains: (1) Program Management, Engineering and Technology Support Services, (2) Business, Financial Management and Audit Support Services and (3) Contract Management Support Services. These domains comprise the professional services necessary to support a wide-range of Departmental requirements, to include DHS component organizations as well as those more specific in meeting the programmatic needs of the United States Coast Guard Acquisition Directorate (CG-9).</p>
<p>The objectives for this acquisition include:<br />a) Providing a comprehensive range of support services for use throughout the DHS.<br />b) Providing a continuous alignment between business strategy, business processes, and various management support services while simultaneously maintaining an acquisition approach based on flexibility and efficiency.<br />c) Leveraging the DHS spend in acquiring essential support services in an effective, economical, and expedient manner consistent with the DHS mission through the use of this enterprise-wide contract.<br />d) Promote and support DHS socio-economic goals and initiatives.</p>
<p>This acquisition is intended to replace numerous disparate contracts at USCG, as well as 3 multiple-award Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs) awarded by the DHS Strategic Sourcing Program Office. Said multiple-award BPAs consist of those for Acquisition Support Services, Financial Management Support Services and Program Management Support Services, which are scheduled to expire between May and June 2011. TABSS will also serve in companion to the Program Management, Administrative, Clerical and Technical Services (PACTS) contract. Although PACTS may appear to provide similar services as the TABSS Program Management, Engineering and Technology Support Services domain, the PACTS services are more generalized in nature. Under the TABSS vehicle, program management services are intended to meet a full range of specialized Program, Business, and Acquisition support services across multiple domains ensuring business continuity and integration. In the case of requirements overlap for a specific task order, PACTS will remain DHS' preferred vehicle.</p>
<p>This acquisition will utilize both unrestricted and small business set-aside award tracks. DHS intends to award a sufficient number of contracts to maintain effective competition in each of the domain tracks. There will be multiple unrestricted and Small Business award tracks, as shown below. The number of awardees per track will be determined later, and may not be uniform among tracks.<br />1. Program Management, Engineering and Technology Support Services Domain; Unrestricted Track<br />2. Program Management, Engineering and Technology Support Services Domain; Small Business Track<br />3. Program Management, Engineering and Technology Support Services Domain; preferred 8(a) Track<br />4. Business, Financial Management and Audit Support Services Domain; Unrestricted Track<br />5. Business, Financial Management and Audit Support Services Domain; Small Business Track<br />6. Business, Financial Management and Audit Support Services Domain; preferred SDV Track<br />7. Contract Management Support Services Domain; preferred 8(a) Track</p>
<p>The resulting IDIQ contract will have an ordering period of five (5) years from award.</p>
<p>A draft solicitation for this acquisition is currently planned to be released in May 2010. Interested parties will have 1-2 weeks to submit questions and comments related to this draft. These questions and comments will be addressed at an Industry Day/Pre-solicitation Conference in late May or early June 2010. DHS anticipates release of a final solicitation shortly following this event. Contractors will be provided sufficient time after solicitation relaserelease to develop and submit proposals.</p>
<p>An email address has been established for this acquisition - TABSS@USCG.MIL. Due to the large number of parties interested in this acquisition, use of email communication (sent to this address) is strongly encouraged to ensure timely response to questions.</p>
<p>This synopsis corresponds to Advance Acquisition Plan (AAP) 62889, which is posted on the DHS AAP website (https://www.fido.gov/dhs/aap/publicview.asp).</p>

DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS

Justification and Approval

For

Other Than Full and Open Competition


1.	Contracting Activity:  Department of Veterans Affairs, VISN XX,  XXXX Medical Center
Fully identify the contracting agency and organizational activity responsible for the proposed contracting action. Specifically identify as a "Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition."  Identify purchase request (i.e. 2237) number, if applicable.

2.	Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Processed:  Describe the action being reviewed and approved and state whether the action will be awarded as a new contract or by modification to an existing contract (identify contract number) and identify the type contract planned (e.g., firm-fixed-price, time and materials, labor hour, etc.)

An individual J&A cannot be used to support more than one contract, irrespective of the quantities or the dollar value stated therein.  If a proposed contract will contain unpriced options (including NTE prices), those options must be supported by a separate J&A prior to option exercise or the J&A supporting the basic contract must be a Class J&A.  For Class J&A situations where the number of contracts in the class can be identified:  (1) Provide brief general description of actions, (2) identify the document as a Class J&A, (3) identify the supplies and services that are being acquired, and (4) for each contract in the class identify the contractor; estimated value; type of contract and rationale for contract length; and estimated award date.  Where the same information applies to more than one contract within the class, it need only be stated one time.

3.	Description of Supplies/Services Required to Meet the Agency's Needs:  Specifically describe the supplies and/or services to be acquired including the estimated value (including options) and quantity of each item, the total estimated value of the acquisition, and the estimated delivery dates/periods of performance.  If there is a national authority, the document must be cited and either a web link included or a copy of the requiring document attached.  Include the requirement delivery date or period of performance.

4.	Statutory Authority Permitting Other than Full and Open Competition:  41 USC 253(g), as implemented by FAR 6.302.  The specific paragraph must be cited.  Most likely, only the -1 or -2 authorities will be cited.  Please be aware that failure to adequately plan for future requirements does not constitute appropriate use of the unusual and compelling urgency statutory authority.

	(  )  (1) Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy 
		      Agency Requirements per FAR 6.302-1;
	(  )  (2) Unusual and Compelling Urgency per FAR 6.302-2;
	(  )  (3) Industrial Mobilization, Engineering, Developmental or Research Capability
		       or Expert Services per FAR 6.302-3;
	(  )  (4) International Agreement per FAR 6.302-4
	(  )  (5) Authorized or Required by Statute FAR 6.302-5;
	(  )  (6) National Security per FAR 6.302-6;
	(  )  (7) Public Interest per FAR 6.302-7;

5.	Demonstration that the Contractor's Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority):   Provide, in narrative form, a detailed explanation supporting and clearly relating to the conditions described by the FAR for using the particular authority cited.  This section is normally the most detailed part of the justification as the essence of the justification is presented here.  Keep in mind that this document is posted and that your judgment may be formally questioned and protested if your justification is insufficient or not valid.    

Contracting without providing for full and open competition shall not be justified on the basis of lack of advance planning by the requiring activity or concerns related to the amount of funds available (e.g., funds will expire)(See FAR 6.301(c)).  To assist you, the following information is provided:

a.  Only One Responsible Source (FAR 6.302-1) - In the case of a follow-on contract for continued development or production of a major system or highly specialized equipment/services, the rationale must first justify the supplies/services as being a "major system" or "highly specialized."  The rationale must then justify "either" substantial duplication of cost to the government that is not expected to be recovered through competition, or unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements, whichever situation applies.  If both of these situations apply, the rationale can be based on either of these two situations, or both.

Note: Discuss the use of restrictive brand name descriptions in requirements documentation here under Part V.   An acquisition that uses a brand name description or other purchase description to specify a particular brand name, product, or feature of a product, peculiar to one manufacturer does not provide for full and open competition regardless of the number of sources solicited. If there is going to be a brand name used, you will need to justify it and clearly explain why a specific brand produced by a single company is required as opposed to allowing free and open competition. The justification should indicate that the use of such descriptions in the acquisition is essential to the Government's requirements, thereby precluding consideration of a product manufactured by another company. 

(Brand-name or equal descriptions, and other purchase descriptions that permit prospective contractors to offer products other than those specifically referenced by brand name, provide for full and open competition and do not require justifications and approvals to support their use.)

When using this exception, the contracting officer should include one of the following sentences, whichever is applicable:  "Accordingly, XYZ Corporation is the only firm capable of providing the supplies and services described in Section III above without the Veteran's Health Administration experiencing substantial duplication of cost that could not be expected to be recovered through competition," or "Accordingly, XYZ Corporation is the only firm capable of providing the supplies and services described in Section III above without the Veteran's Health Administration experiencing unacceptable delays in fulfilling its requirements," or "Accordingly, XYZ Corporation is the only firm capable of providing the supplies and services described in Section III above without the Veteran's Health Administration experiencing substantial duplication of cost that could not be expected to be recovered through competition and unacceptable delays in fulfilling its requirements." 

b.  Unusual and Compelling Urgency (FAR 6.302-2, 6.303-2(a)(9)(ii)) - Contracting Officers shall contact SAO East as soon as practicable when contemplating an award under the authority cited in FAR 6.302-2 for J&As requiring HCA or DSPE approval.  Provide an explanation why (1) the supplies or services are needed at once because of fire, flood, explosion, or other disaster, or (2) essential equipment or repairs to that equipment are needed at once, e.g., to preclude impairment of healthcare delivery capabilities or mission performance.  In other words, identify the anticipated serious injury to the Government, the nature of the urgency, the reasons for it occurring and why it is "urgent and compelling" to preclude adverse impact to Veteran care.  Merely citing adverse impact to Veteran care is not in and of itself sufficient reason to use this exception from the requirement to obtain full and open competition.  Note that only the minimum quantity required to satisfy the unusual and compelling urgency qualifies for this exception; thus, this exception might not suffice to justify option quantities.  

c. Industrial Mobilization; or Engineering, Developmental, or Research Capability (FAR 6.302-3) - The most important part of justifications citing this authority is demonstrating the need to maintain the capability possessed by the identified source(s). Some form of market survey may be critical in demonstrating the uniqueness of this capability.

d. Authorized or Required by Statute (FAR 6.302-5) - It is imperative to identify what is being acquired and the applicable statute authorizing other than full and open competition. Note: Some statutes do not require a written J&A. 

e. National Security (FAR 6.302-6) - Provide the minimum essential information needed to establish validity of the justification. This information will make the J&A a classified document. Special handling procedures are required for processing such documentation to the approval authority. Only parties with a "need to know" and the proper level of security clearance should be permitted access to the documentation. Such acquisitions are also exempt from synopsis under FAR 5.202(a)(1). 

f. Public Interest (FAR 6.302-7) - This authority may only be used when none of the other authorities is appropriate and may not be made on a class basis. Provide detail addressing the reasons full and open competition is not in the public interest and why no other authority is appropriate for use.  Approval to use this statutory exemption may only be made by a written determination by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, and with Congressional notification not less than 30 days before award of the contract. 

6.	Description of Efforts Made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as deemed practicable:  Describe all efforts taken (or to be to be taken) to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as practicable under the circumstances.  The following issues should be addressed in this paragraph:

Sources Sought Synopsis: If a sources sought synopsis was issued, state the date the synopsis was issued, the synopsis number, and a brief description of its content.  If any responses were received, describe in detail the results of the screening process and the rationale for determining the unacceptability of any synopsis respondents.  This is particularly important when citing the authority of 10 USC 2304(c)(1), "Only one (or a limited number of) responsible source(s)", since it is this survey of the market place that confirms our assumptions regarding the capability of industry to meet our needs. (See FAR 6.303-2(a)(6)).  If the proposed action was not or will not be synopsized, cite the specific authority for not doing so (per FAR 5.202) and the rationale for the synopsis exception.  Note that although synopsis of proposed contract actions initiated pursuant to FAR 6.302-2 may not be required, use of this authority is not an automatic exemption from synopsis. (See FAR 5.202(a)(2)).

Other Actions: In this paragraph, discuss any other actions taken or planned to facilitate competition for this acquisition.  The discussion should include actions tried or considered even if the actions were unsuccessful.  If the efforts were unsuccessful, so state and describe why.

7.	Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable:  Include a statement by the contracting officer that the anticipated cost will be considered fair and reasonable and provide the basis for this determination.  The steps that will be taken to ensure the final contract price will be fair and reasonable are also described here.  Describe the extent of cost or price analysis anticipated including the requirements for certified cost or pricing data, technical evaluations, and audits (FAR 6.303-2(a)(7)). 

8.	Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results, or a Statement of the Reasons Market Research Was Not Conducted:  Discuss any market research conducted pursuant to FAR Part 10 and describe results of that research.  Market research is any effort undertaken to determine if sources capable of satisfying the agency's requirements exist and to determine if commercial items or non-developmental items are either available or can be modified so that they will satisfy the agency's needs.    Market research should be focused not only on identifying alternate sources, but also on alternate equipment or substitutes that might fill the government needs with only minor modification.  Regardless of the approach used, the results should provide a high level of confidence that no other qualified sources exist. 

Generally, some form of market research should be conducted, but it is most critical when citing the authority of FAR 6.302-1, only one (or a limited number of) responsible source(s).  Under such circumstances, use the following sentence:  "As described in Section VI above, market research, in accordance with FAR Part 10, was conducted by synopsis of the proposed acquisition, advising industry of the pending acquisition and soliciting inquiries from interested parties."

When other exceptions from the requirement to obtain full-and-open competition are relied upon, the market research might be limited to an examination of the acquisition history and experience with the marketplace under previous acquisitions for the same or similar items. 

If no market research was conducted, so state and provide the rationale.  

9.	Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition:  Provide any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition, including an explanation of why specifications, engineering descriptions, statements of work, statements of objectives, or purchase descriptions suitable for full and open competition have not been developed, are not being developed, are not being used, or are not available.  (see FAR 6.302-1(b)(2) and 6.303-2(a)(9)(i)).

10.	Listing of Sources that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition:  State "See Section VI above."

11.	A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome any Barriers to Competition before Making subsequent acquisitions for the supplies or services required:  Describe any actions taken or to be taken to foster competition for future acquisitions of the supplies or services being acquired.  Describe potential actions that could be undertaken to remove the barriers to competition that have been identified in the justification and include a milestone schedule for accomplishing these actions.  For example, if a follow-on competitive acquisition is planned, so state and give planned award date.
				
If no actions are planned, so state and provide reasons. If approval is sought for more than one year, explain why a sole source effort is required for the planned time duration.

12.	Requirements Certification:  I certify that the requirement outlined in this justification is a Bona Fide Need of the Department of Veterans Affairs and that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in the justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

	San Juan, PR	
	     	
                                                                          VISN:	8-NCA 8	

(2)  NATURE AND/OR DESCRIPTION OF ACTION BEING APPROVED:
Leasing of MRI Mobile Unit for additional six (6) months, in order to avoid payment of transportation from 
the USA of new equipment.  Unit is already installed at the Facility and all electrical components in 	
place for continuation of radiology services.	
     	
     	

(3)	(a)	A DESCRIPTION OF THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES REQUIRED TO MEET THE AGENCY'S NEED:
MRI Mobile Unit Trailer 1.5T Symphony	
     	
     	
     	
     	
     	

	(b)	ESTIMATED DOLLAR VALUE:  $257,700.00	

	(c)	REQUIRED DELIVERY  DATE:   February 1, 2011- Delivery not required, but new contract	

(4)	IDENTIFICATION OF THE JUSTIFICATION RATIONALE (SEE FAR 8.405-6), AND IF APPLICABLE, A DEMONSTRATION OF THE PROPOSED CONTRACTOR'S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS TO PROVIDE THE REQUIRED SUPPLY OR SERVICE.  (CHECK ALL THAT APPLY AND COMPLETE)

0	Specific characteristics of the material or service that limit the availability to a sole source (unique features, function of the item, etc.).  Describe in detail why only this suggested source can furnish the requirements to the exclusion of other sources.
     	
     	
     	
     	
     	
     	
     	
     	
     	
     	

0	A patent, copyright or proprietary data limits competition.  The proprietary data is:  
     	
     	
     	
     	
     	

0	These are "direct replacements" parts/components for existing equipment.  
____________________________________________________________________________
____________________________________________________________________________

0	The material/service must be compatible in all aspects (form, fit and function) with existing systems presently installed/performing.  Describe the equipment/function you have now and how the new item/service must coordinate, connect, or interface with the existing system.
     	
     	
     	
     	
     	

1	The new work is a logical follow-on to an original Federal Supply Schedule order provided that the original order was placed in accordance with the applicable Federal Supply Schedule ordering procedures. The original order must not have been previously issued under sole source or limited source procedures. 
The equipment had been in the Facility for more than a year, but the contract was awarded prior to GS	
Contract obtained by current contractor on March 2010.  This Contractor provides the best value for the 
Facility because it will provide continuation of current services on leasing for MRI Mobile Unit stationed	
at the Hospital since  August 2009.  This award to GS-30F-0024W is necessary to continue the services of 
leasing for this radiology equipment because the Facility has not completed the construction of the VA-
owned property for the required MRI system.  The continuation with the same Contractor will save money
to the Government because it will save on transportation charges for new equipment.  Besides, this 
Contractor is a SDVOSB.  Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements per FAR 6.302-1.

0	An urgent and compelling need exists, and following the ordering procedures would result in unacceptable delays. 
     	
     	
     	
     	
     	
     	
     	
     	
     	

(5)  DESCRIBE WHY YOU BELIEVE THE ORDER REPRESENTS THE BEST VALUE CONSISTENT WITH FAR 8.404(d) TO AID THE CONTRACTING OFFICER IN MAKING THIS BEST VALUE DETERMINATION:  
Only this source will save money and will provide continuation of this necessary services to the patients	
because the Contractor has been given services for more than a year.  The equipment is in the premises	
until January 31, 2011 with current contract VA248-P-1134.  This Contractor has had an excellent	
performance during the past year (2009-2010); and will truly satisfy the Facility needs for this coming	
six (6) months; until the Hospital completes the construction to install the VA-owned equipment.	
     	
     	
     	
     	

(6)  DESCRIBE THE MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED AMONG SCHEDULE HOLDERS AND THE RESULTS OR A STATEMENT OF THE REASON MARKET RESEARCH WAS NOT CONDUCTED:
Two more SDVOSB's found in the USA, but none in the Island or nearby the Island.  The transportation	
of this huge equipment will increase the cost, and may not be on time to assure continuity of services.	
This equipment, when delivered, was stopped by Customs, and some additional documentation was	
submitted in order to avoid additional charges because it was for the Federal Government.	
     	
     	
     	
     	
     	

(7)  ANY OTHER FACTS SUPPORTING THE JUSTIFICATION:
None.	
     	
     	
     	
     	
     	
     	

(8)  A STATEMENT OF THE ACTIONS, IF ANY, THE AGENCY MAY TAKE TO REMOVE OR OVERCOME ANY BARRIERS THAT LED TO THE RESTRICTED CONSIDERATION BEFORE ANY SUBSEQUENT ACQUISITION FOR THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES IS MADE:
The Facility is saving money to the Government in keeping the same Contractor, and this Contractor 	
fully complies with the First Contracting Program because the Contractor is a SDVOSB one.	
     	
     	
     	

(9)  REQUIREMENTS CERTIFICATION:  I certify that the requirement outlined in this justification is a bonafide need of the Department of Veterans Affairs and that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in the justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge.  I understand that processing of this limited sources justification restricts consideration of Federal Supply Schedule contractors to fewer than the number required by FAR Subpart 8.4.

<DESC>DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS
Justification and Approval
For
Other Than Full and Open Competition
1. Contracting Activity: Department of Veterans Affairs, Network Contracting Activity 8, North Florida/South Georgia Veterans Health System (NF/SG VHS). Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition in response to Purchase Request VA 2237 573-11-1-50300005.
2. Nature and/or Description of Action Being Approved: Approval to limit competition to an item peculiar to one manufacturer in accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b) and 6.302-1(d). Approval is for a new, single award, Firm-Fixed Price purchase of commercially available, off the shelf items.
3. Description of the Supplies or Services Required to Meet the Agency's Needs: NF/SG VHS has stated a requirement for the Zeiss Cirrus HD Optical Coherence Tomography instrument (HD-OCT). This instrument is used to perform real-time spectral domain, exquisite micrometer resolution with 3D and 2D cross-sectional tomographic images of the posterior segment of the eyes. It tracks progressive retinal nerve fiber layer loss for enhanced glaucoma management. The items requested are as follows:
a) Required Items:
1. Zeiss Cirrus HD-OCT (model 4000), New, Version 5 (Qty 3)
i.	Assy SD-OCT Accy Kit, Generic
ii.	Kit SD-OCT 5.0 System Software
iii.	Printer, Color, HP Officejet 6000
iv.	Power Cord, Hospital Grade, Gray, 120V
v.	Table, Cirrus-Visante, 120V ASSE
vi.	Cirrus 13D-OCT Anterior Segment Imaging License
vii.	User Manual, SD-OCT, 5.0, English
b) Estimated Dollar Amount: $193,850.00
c) Requested Delivery Date: Immediate'y upon award
4. Statutory Authority Permitting Other than Full and Open Competition: 41U.S.C  253(c), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1. Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.
 
5. Demonstration that the Contractor's Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the use of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority : The Zeiss Cirrus HD-OCT instrument possesses the following unique and essential features that justify brand name justification and warrant the usage of authority granted in FAR 6.3021-1:
"	The Cirrus HD OCT does a full glaucoma analysis (RNFL and Optic Nerve) with one scan in 1.8 seconds.
o	The Cirrus has a FDA Cleared Normative Database for RNFL and the Optic Nerve
o	RNFL Repeatability is 1.2 microns
o	The Cirrus has FDA Cleared RNFL Progression Analysis. RNFL is based on automatic vessel recognition software to ensure precise analysis from visit to visit.
o	The Cirrus does a 6 mm x 6 mm cube scan which can detect minor defects around the nerve.
o	The Cirrus can image angles and is a standard feature.
"	The Cirrus does 65,536 A-scans in 2.4 seconds or 40,000 A-scans in 1.8 seconds for evaluation of the Retina.
o	The Cirrus has FDA Cleared Normative Database for the Macula,
o	The Cirrus has Macular Change Analysis. Macular Change Analysis is based on automatic vessel recognition software to ensure precise analysis from visit to visit.
o	The Cirrus comes standard with Advanced Visualization and 3D Volume Rendering for enhanced analysis of Epiretinal Membranes, CME and the Choroid for example.
o	The Cirrus is used to reliably measure drusen.
o	The Cirrus has an Automatic Fovea Finder to help with difficult patients
"	The Cirrus has Anterior Segment capabilities.
o	The Cirrus has standard Anterior Segment Analysis to evaluate the cornea and angles
"	The Cirrus OCT has a smaller design allowing for usage in smaller working spaces.
"	Its software is already compatible with our current VISTA/CPRS imaging software (OIS)
"	90 degree orientation facilitates observation of patient throughout exam
"	Auto Patient Recall TM assures patient position and instrument setting are repeated from previous visit
"	Advanced optics aid in the examination of patients with cataracts. Dilation is not required even for pupils as small as 2.5 mm
Accordingly, Carl Zeiss is the only firm capable of manufacturing the Cirrus OCT diagnostic instrument described in Section III above without the Veteran's Health Administration experiencing substantial duplication of cost that could not be expected to be recovered through competition and unacceptable delays in fulfilling requirements.

6.	Description of Efforts Made to Ensure that Offers are Solicited from as Many potential  Sources as Deemed Practicable: Sources Sought Notice VA-248-11-IU-0077 was published to the GPE on December 14, 2010 to determine any small business entities capable of providing this requirement. On January 12, 2011, RFQ VA248-11-RQ-0084 was posted to the GPE as a 100 percent small business set-aside. Metro Medical was the sole respondent.
7.	Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable: The anticipated cost to the government is determined to be fair and reasonable through competition solicited by RFQ VA-248-11-RQ-0084.
8.	Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results, or a Statement of the Reason: Market research has been done by the requesting service, to identify sources capable of meeting NF/SG VHS's patient care requirements. Additional research conducted by the Contracting Officer revealed a very small market for the commodity identified in Section III. A Sources Sought Notice was published to the GPE to identify small business sources capable of supplying the items described in Section III, and only one small business entity, Metro Medical, responded.
9.	Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition: The requesting service has two existing Zeiss OCT machines that are antiquated and need to be traded in or sold. The value of these trade-in units are approximately $40,000. The usage of Carl Zeiss HID-OCT instruments will facilitate the trade-in process and will reduce the overall price by the Government in meeting NF/SG VHS's patient care requirements.
10.	Listing of Sources that Expressed, in Writing, and Interest in the Acquisition: See Section VI above.
11.	A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency to Remove or Overcome any Barriers to Competition before Making subsequent acquisitions for the Supplies or Services Required: Available actions to be taken are limited due to the narrow field of competition inherent in the HD-OCT instrument market.
12.	Requirements Certification: I certify that the requirement outlined in this justification is a bonafide need of the Department of Veterans Affairs and that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in the justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.
