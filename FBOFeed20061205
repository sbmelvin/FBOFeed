<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO ISSUE PURCHASE ORDER.  The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), Atlanta, GA, hereby announces its intent to issue a purchase order to Dr. Horace M. Stiles, Maypearl, TX (small business set aside)for a 7 month effort to review activity, plan, and execute site visits to three Education and Research Centers (ERC) at different locations throughout the country.

Task One:  ERC Site Visits (Three)
Working with the Assistant Director, OEP, and the Co-Scientific Review Administrator (Co-SRA) for the FY2007 Education and Research Centers (ERCs) review activity, plan and execute site visits to three ERCs.  Specific activities will include discussions with the Directors of three ERCs concerning securing date(s) and locations for the site visits. Coordinate site visit activities of the three ERCs with four ERC site visits conduced by the Co-SRA.  Recruit a panel of appropriate reviewers for the component programs of each ERC site visit, as well as three Principal reviewers for the Overall Review of the ERCs at the final ERC Special Emphasis Panel (SEP).  Organize and conduct three site visit meetings using standard SRA techniques and IMPAC software tools.

Task Two:  Final SEP for the ERCs
Working with the Assistant Director, OEP, and the Co-SRA, plan and secure a date and location for the final ERC SEP for the seven ERC applications.  Assemble and collate the reviews of the individual panelists who were reviewers at the site visits of the three ERCs. Attend the final ERC SEP and support and advise the Assistant Director, OEP, and the Co-SRA regarding the final reviews for the three ERCs at the SEP. 

Task Three:  Post ERC SEP Meeting. 
Enter final scores resulting from the SEP for the three ERC applications.  Prepare draft summary statements for the three ERCs in a timely manner. This activity will be coordinated with the Co-SRA to provide consistency and uniformity of summary statements.
 
Task Four:  SEP for TPG Applications
Working with the Assistant Director, OEP, conduct a SEP for the review of Training Program Grant (TPG) applications submitted to NIOSH for possible Funding.  Activities include the establishment of a panel of reviewers appropriate to the content of the individual applications; serving as the SRA for the actual review of the applications; entering the resultant scores from the review panel; preparing and releasing resulting summary statements in a timely manner.  The TPG meeting schedule and selection of reviewers will be coordinated with the overall ERC review activities.

  Dr. Stiles has unique qualifications to undertake work for the Office of Extramural Research (OEP) at NIOSH as described in the Statement of Work. NIOSH OEP conducts peer review of complex multi-component applications related to the 20-year NIOSH-sponsored Education and Research Centers, which provide primary training for most occupational health professionals in the country. Dr. Stiles plays a key role in conducting the annual review of these complex applications. Conducting these reviews requires advanced experience and training in the NIH model of peer review, knowledge of the areas of expertise and of the specific experts related to the ERC training community, and a track record in conducting reviews of ERC grant applications. Dr. Stiles held a senior position as manager of epidemiology study sections at NIH for more than 10 years. He also holds a Ph.D from Johns Hopkins in epidemiology. Dr. Stiles has previously managed the ERC reviews at NIOSH for the last three years and so has unique experience in identifying and working with key experts who are qualified to review ERC grant applications. His prior experience also provides unique knowledge of the complex review model and procedures that NIOSH has developed in managing the ERC reviews.

This project is currently supported by justification for other than full and open competition to Dr. Stiles under authority of 41 U.S.C.253.  Consideration of an alternate source  requires the submission of a capabilities statement which demonstrates in writing that  the organization possesses th expertise to perform ERC site visits and prepare summary statements for the SEP.  Submit capabilities statement by December 13, 2006 to Denise Rains Centers for Disease Control NIOSH, 315 East Montgomery Avenue, Spokane, WA 99207 or email dgr8@cdc.gov.  Telephone (509)354-8111 or fax (509)354-8099.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  If no affirmative responses are received by December 20, 2006, a purchase order will be issued to Dr. Stiles.  All responses shall be considered by the agency.  All potential contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (www.ccr.gov) prior to award.

<DESC>The Naval Explosive Ordnance Disposal Technology Division (NAVEODTECHDIV) has a need to develop and demonstrate alternative technologies for data transmission to support EOD operations. BACKGROUND: As the RF spectrum becomes more and more crowded, the data transmission frequencies used for directing and controlling EOD tools and equipment is being impinged upon. This has resulted in a marked increase in RF interference and an unacceptable decrease in personnel security/safety in hostile operational environments. Currently, there are no alternatives to the use of RF, or a tether connection, to transmit and receive data. EOD technicians need an alternative means of remotely exchanging data with EOD tools that does not rely on RF; is not a tether; has the potential to be used for non-line-of-sight signal propagation; and has the potential to provide data exchange over distances of 300 to 700 meters. WHITE PAPERS: Interested offerors are requested to submit a white paper, the purpose of which is to preclude unwarranted effort by the offeror in preparing a full technical and cost proposal not considered to be responsive. Each white paper is limited to five pages in length a!  nd may address only one technology area. The white paper will consist of three primary sections: Technical, Management, and Cost. The Technical section shall state the technology area being addressed and shall consist of clear descriptions of objectives, technical issues which must be resolved to accomplish objectives, approach to resolving these issues, and particular prior experience of offeror in the targeted technology area. The Management section shall include key personnel (include curriculum vitae), experience, facilities and a plan of action with milestones. The Cost section shall include a cost breakdown of the effort being proposed.  The effort should not exceed three years in length and the total cost should not exceed $1,200,000.  White papers are due NLT January 31, 2007.  After evaluation of white papers, full proposals will be requested based on the merits of the information received. It is anticipated that the evaluation of the white papers will be completed!   and the results disseminated to offerors by March 5, 2007. FULL PROPO SALS: Full proposals will not be limited as to the number of pages and shall consist of three separate sections, Technical, Management, and Cost. All sections shall reference the BAA number and include the Offeror’s project title. Proposals submitted shall include the following sections: (a) cover page including unique title and both technical and administrative points of contact; (b) statement of work (SOW) detailing the scope of the project and a detailed description of each task; (c) list of Government furnished information (GFI) and Government furnished equipment (GFE) required; (d) the cost proposal shall include a detailed cost breakdown by task including labor categories, labor rates, labor hours, labor overhead rate and total labor cost. If subcontractors are involved, include a cost breakdown for each subcontractor exhibiting the same parameters.  Subcontractors may send their details separately or they may provide them along with the prime in a sealed envelope. Als!  o include material cost, travel, and any other direct or indirect costs. If the Offeror has an approved purchasing system, provide the source and date of latest review. If the Offeror does not have an approved purchasing system, state what processes are used for purchases of such items as material, travel, and training;  (e) a description of deliverables; (f) a schedule including milestones and a time/cost profile; (g) a description of the Offeror's facilities, key personnel, and experience in the area of interest.  The due date for receipt of full proposals will be thirty (30) days after the Government formally request the proposal from the Offeror. The Government reserves the right to select for award some portion(s) of the proposals received in response to this BAA. In that event, the Government may select for negotiation all, or portions, of a given proposal. The Government may incrementally fund any award issued under this BAA. EVALUATION: White papers and full proposa!  ls will be evaluated using the following selection criteria, which are  listed in descending order of importance: (1) overall scientific and technical merits; (2) understanding of EOD requirements and the technical/scientific innovation and risk to solve the requirement; (3) Potential for transition to fleet/field capability; (4) the Offeror's capabilities, related experience, facilities, techniques or unique combinations of these which are integral factors for achieving the proposal objectives; (5) potential capability gained by EOD operations; (6) Proposed cost and fees.  The socio-economic merits of each proposal seeking a procurement contract will be evaluated in the context of the requirements described in this announcement. The evaluation process will consider the extent of commitment in providing meaningful subcontracting opportunities for small businesses, HUB Zone small businesses, small disadvantaged businesses, woman-owned small business concerns, veteran-owned small businesses, historically black colleges and universities, and minor!  ity institutions. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this solicitation, 541710 (which corresponds with the standard industrial classification code of 8731), specifies a small business size standard of 500 employees or less. A Small Business Subcontracting Plan prepared in accordance with FAR 52.219-9 must accompany contract proposals (full proposals) that exceed $500,000 submitted by all but small businesses. Entities that must submit a Small Business Subcontracting Plan for contract proposals that exceed $500,000 include universities/colleges, nonprofits, and large businesses. Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) and Minority Institutions (MI) are encouraged to submit proposals and/or join others in submitting proposals. However, no portion of this BAA will be set-aside for HBCU and MI participation due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or functionally separable areas of this technology for exclusive competition amon!  g these entities.

The Urban Challenge is the third Grand Challenge autonomous vehicle technology demonstration, a program  in which teams from the technical community will enter self?navigating vehicles designed to negotiate a complex urban course without human drivers.  Successful offerors will provide the necessary support to ensure the success of a series of events that lead up to a timed race of unmanned, robotic vehicles over a high traffic, urban-environment obstacle course. This program was announced in May, 2006, and will culminate in November 2007 with the Urban Challenge Final Event (UCFE).  As part of the Urban Challenge program, a series of qualifying events will be conducted leading to the National Qualification Event (NQE) in October, 2007 at a location to be announced (TBA) in the western U.S.  At the 10-day NQE, finalist teams are chosen to participate in the UCFE, scheduled to take place on November 3, 2007, also at a location to be announced in the western United States.  Both events are multi-faceted, complex, and involve the coordination of a large number of staff, spectators, members of the media, and participants.

DARPA intends to issue one or more time and material contracts to fulfill its requirement to provide support for both the NQE and UCFE.

<DESC>The NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) proposes to contract with Lockheed Martin Space Systems Company (LMSSC) of Denver, Colorado, to continue the spacecraft design effort for a mission to Venus called Vesper, in response to a NASA Headquarter (HQ) Announcement of Opportunity (AO) for the Discovery Program. The Vesper team is led by a Principal Investigator from the GSFC and utilizes the unique expertise of LMSSC for the spacecraft design. This team was selected by NASA HQ under the Discovery Program 2006 AO to perform a 7-month Phase A concept study, to further define the mission design and overall programmatic requirements. At the conclusion of this study, HQ intends to down-select to one Discovery mission to continue into the implementation phase. LMSSC is exclusively qualified to perform the necessary work. LMSSC has contributed extensively to the Vesper Mission concept through prior teaming arrangements, and therefore has developed unique detailed knowledge of the Vesper concept that cannot be duplicated by any other source to meet the Discovery program requirements.  In addition, LMSSC's unique experience in designing and developing spacecraft and systems for a previous mission to Venus called Magellan, as well as other interplanetary missions that are comparable to Vesper make them uniquely qualified to perform this work. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See Note 26. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on December 22, 2006.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>Subject to final approval, the Bureau of the Public Debt, Administrative Resource Center intends to issue an order to The Madison, a Loews Hotel, for the Board Meetings of the Access Board.     In accordance with Access Board policies, Board Meetings must be held  at certain times during the year.  There are four service periods for the required meetings.  They will be: March 21 through March 14, 2007; May 30 through June 1, 2007; September 5 through  September 7, 2007; and November 12 through November 14, 2007.     The Access Board is a Federal Agency that develops and maintains accessibility requirements that entities with responsibilities under the American with Disabilities Act must meet.     The Board, both because of its members some with disabilities and because it must set a perfect example, can only use hotel space, including individual rooms and meeting rooms that meet or exceed the Board's accessibility guidelines.     Given the sensitivity of this issue, the Board will only use a hotel for meeting and rooms after the Boards staff has checked the hotel for accessibility compliance.     After checking several hotels in the Washington, DC area for accessibility compliance and availability, Access Board staff concluded that The Madison is the only hotel available that meets the unique needs of the Access Board for their meeting and individual room service requirements for this meeting.     Specifically, the hotel has meeting rooms of the size and with accessibility options needed by the Board and sleeping rooms available on the dates needed by the Board as mentioned above.     The hotel has the required number of accessible rooms and most importantly, accessible rooms with roll-in showers.

<DESC>National Institute on Drug Abuse, Office of Acquisitions- Neurosciences, Station Support/Simplified Acquisition, on behalf of the National Institute on Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) intends to negotiate on a FAR Part 13 basis and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive basis to Sandy Jackson, 8410 Clay Drive, Fort Washington, Maryland 20744 for 480 hours of support to the NINDS Division of Extramural Services (DER) in preparation of automated data products that expedite and facilitate the review of grant applications being reviewed at NANDS Council.  This automated support is provided to the DER/OD during three cycles per year.  The established business process between the DER/OD office and IRMB requires specific business knowledge of the NIH grants process and the eRA enterprise database schema to provide ?electronic books? with required turn around times as short as 4 hours.  There are currently over 40 books produced for each round.  Each of the queries that support the creation of an electronic product requires maintenance, modification, testing and quality review for each round.  Each of the data products will be updated multiple times in the workflow up to their final presentation/use at the NANDS Council.  

Her knowledge of the NINDS Council business process and enterprise data sources allows her to perform the creation of electronic Council books with minimal input from the DER/OD.  She is able to initiate the modifications to the underlying queries and begin testing months before they are due.  This business knowledge reduces the burden of interaction that the DER/OD office must have to provide requirements during their busiest times of the year.  Sandra has intimate knowledge of the enterprise data repository (IMPAC II), the meaning and location of required attributes in the appropriate tables (Oracle database instances) and the structure of the data being processed (which tables to link and how).  This allows her to extract and format the data products to meet the very tight turnaround deadlines required by the Council process, while maintaining extremely high data quality.  She also has expert knowledge of the NINDS standard desktop, Oracle, MS Access and ODBC that enable her to perform her function.

Delivery and acceptance will be at the NIH Campus in Bethesda, Maryland. The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 541690 and the Size Standard is $6.5 million.  Period of performance is 12 months.

The acquisition is being conducted under simplified acquisition using FAR 13 procedures and is exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6, Competition Requirement.     This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.     Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this synopsis.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>SUBJECT: NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD A SOLE SOURCE PROCUREMENT DESC: Under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, it is the Governments intent to award a sole source to USB Corporation, 26111 Miles Road, Cleveland OH 44128 for the purchase of test reagents.  The Armed Forces DNA Identification Laboratory (AFDIL) is an America n Society of Crime Laboratory Directors (ASCLD) accredited forensic lab, which means that we follow the FBIs Quality Assurance Document.  With the accreditation, our strict guidance is to adhere strictly to established Quality Assurance (QA) and Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) to include consistency and continuity of test procedures.  After validating a product, it is set to be used exclusively throughout the forensic identification.  Validation and using various products in not possible from this point  because it violates the consistency and continuity of obtaining accurate test results.  This is not a formal solicitation.  This synopsis is not considered a Request for Quotation or Proposal.  No solicitation document is available and telephone requests will not be honored.  No contract will be awarded on the basis of offers received in response to this notice.  Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government.  If no affirmative written response is received, the purchase will be awarded without further notice.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based on this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Detailed capabilities must be submitted to the following email address no later  than 4:00 p.m., Eastern Standard Time, 20 December 2006.   EMAIL:  elayne.seiler@amedd.army.mil  Please see below for Justification for other than Full and Open Competition  Justification for other than Full and Open Competition 1.	Contracting Activity:  The Contracting Activity responsible for this action is the US Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity. 2.	Description of Action:  This Justification and approval is being requested for a 5-year requirement contract using R & D funds.   3.	Description of Supplies and Services, include estimated value:  The required supplies and reagents are used to support the DNA identification mission with the removal of primers, unincorporated dNTPs and unused polymerase chain reaction chemicals from Hypervariable regions HV1, HV2 and Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) amplified products.  See the Statement of Work for individual description and specification of each reagent.  The estimated value of this requisition is $55,550.00 for the base year wi th 4, 1-year priced options for an aggregate total of $289,084.00. ExoSAP-It (78205) This is a combination enzyme mix containing Exonuclease 1(removes single stranded DNA) and Shrimp Alkaline Phosphatase (removes terminal phosphate groups from unincorporated dNTPs) and is used in the purification of HV1 and HV2 amplified products. US Bioc hemical is the only manufacture of this chemical. This reagent is used for all mtDNA forensic amplification purifications except SNP assays. Exonuclease 1 (70073X) This is the single enzyme version of the Exonuclease 1 found in the ExoSAP-it and is used to remove single stranded primers from SNP amplification reactions. During the validation of the SNP panels, it was determined that more Exonuclease was needed than f ound in the ExoSAP-it reaction mix.  Shrimp Alkaline Phosphatase (70092) and Dilution Buffer (726761) This is the single enzyme version of the Shrimp alkaline phosphatase found in the ExoSAP-IT buffer and is used to remove the phosphate groups from dNTPs, thereby increasing the efficiency of post amplification extension reactions. During the validation of  the SNP panels, it was determined that more SAP was needed than found in the ExoSAP-it reaction mix. 4.	Authority Cited:  The statutory authority permitting other than open competi tion is 10 U.S.C. 2340c (1).  The FAR citation is 6.302-1 citing that only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. 5.	Reason for Authority Cited:    There are other vendors who have comparable products for the Exonuclease and Shrimp Alkaline Phosphatase.  No other vendor, however, carry  the combination of the three reagents above that made up the Exosap-iT that will m eet our requirement.    6.	Efforts to obtain Competition:  Efforts to obtain competition have not been practical since there is only one source to meet mission requirement. 7.  Actions to Increase Competition:  Any future competition requires various validation procedures involving significant man-hours and efforts lasting approximately 6 to 8 months.   This procedure at times, involves consulting other laboratories and the f orensic community.  AFDIL is an American Society of Crime Laboratory Directors (ASCLD) accredited forensic lab, which means that we follow the FBIs Quality Assurance Document.   With the accreditation, our strict guidance is to adhere strictly to establis hed Quality Assurance (QA) and Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) to include consistency and continuity of test procedures.  After validating a product, it is set to be used exclusively throughout the forensic identification.  Validation and using various products is not possible from this point because it violates the consistency and continuity of obtaining accurate test results.   8.	Market Research: Prior to the decision to implement a product into the laboratory at AFDIL, extensive validation studies are performed to determine which product possesses the desired properties.  Reagents and consumables are compared and tested for sen sitivity, ease of use, consistency, cost, and compatibility with the existing instrumentation used in the lab.  Since AFDIL not only works on identification cases but also on evidence to be presented in criminal trials in courts nationwide, as well as inte rnationally, all the reagents and consumables used in the laboratory need to be approved for use in processing forensic casework based on Fry and Dalbert Hearings.  Although similar comparable products may be on the market, not all products have the abilit y to be upheld in the courts and have the general acceptance of the forensic community.   9.  Interested Sources:   Not Applicable 10:  Other Facts:  The primary mission of the Armed Forces DNA Identification Laboratory (AFDIL) is to support the Office of the Armed Forces Medical Examiner in their role to properly identify and return fallen US service members throughout the world, to include missing service members of World War II, Korea, and Vietnam.   With this mission, the AFDIL is an accredited forensic lab.  All identification results are supported by consistency of test procedures, compatibility of reagents and equipment through measured standards and validations. 11.	Technical Certification:  I justify that the supporting data under my cognizance which are included in the justification are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief. __________________________________________              _______________________ Marjorie Q. Bland                                                               Date DNA Program Coordinator 12.	Requirement Certification:  I justify that the supporting data under my cognizance which are included in the justification are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.     ________________________________________                ____________________      Linda S.Korbol                                                                      Date      Program Manager 13.  Fair and Reasonable Cost Determination:  I hereby determine that the price for this contract will be fair and reasonable.  Fair and reasonable prices will be assured through comparison of current prices for similar testing reagents. 14.  Procuring Contracting Officer Certification:  I certify that this justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief. Name:   Pamela L.

SUBPART 5301.91 -- OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM
5301.9101 Purpose.
The purpose of the Air Force ombudsman program is to foster communication between government and industry. The primary function of the ombudsman is to consider concerns about specific issues in acquisitions, to communicate these concerns to senior management personnel responsible for oversight, and to assist in the resolution of the concerns. 
5301.9102 Policy.
(a) MAJCOM and DRU commanders shall appoint an experienced senior official who is independent of the contracting officer and program manager as the ombudsman at their MAJCOM/DRU. For AFMC and AFSPC Centers, an ombudsman is required at each Center, instead of at the MAJCOM. 
(b) The ombudsman will have the authority to call upon other resources of the activity to assist in resolving acquisition issues or concerns (e.g. administrative support, independent review teams). 
(c) Contracting officers shall identify the ombudsman in the initial announcement of the acquisition as well as in the draft and final RFP. 
(d) The ombudsman shall: 
(1) Act neutrally to facilitate resolution of issues or concerns raised by concerned parties; 
(2) Act in a manner that does not compromise the concerned party, and, if requested, maintain anonymity of the parties
(3) Avoid any appearance of usurping normal procurement authority (e.g., program manager, contracting officer, and source selection authority); 
(4) Ensure all affected or knowledgeable offices and officials are consulted as part of any resolution process;
(5) Inform the commander, as required, of issues raised and actions taken; for AFMC and AFSPC centers, report only to the Center Commander, Laboratory Commander, or PEO; and for other MAJCOM/DRUS, report only to the MAJCOM CC or PEO;
(6) Review complaints relative to multiple-award task and delivery order contracts awarded under 10 U.S.C. 2304a(d)(1)(B) or 2304b(e) to ensure that all contractors are afforded a fair opportunity to be considered for task and delivery orders in excess of $2,500, consistent with the procedures in the contract; 
(7) Consistent with security requirements, have access to the appropriate offices and be allowed to collect all facts relevant to the resolution of issues raised by concerned parties. Ombudsmen are granted access to proprietary information. Source selection information must be obtained through the source selection authority.
(e) The Ombudsman Program does not replace the agency level protest, GAO bid protest or disputes processes. 
(f) The Air Force ombudsman is the Associate Deputy Assistant Secretary (ADAS) (Contracting), who may take action to assist in resolving issues, concerns, disagreements, and recommendations that cannot be resolved at the MAJCOM/DRU level, or those having Air Force wide implications. 
(g) Government personnel may use the Ombudsman Program as a way to express concerns about an acquisition.
5301.9103 Solicitation provision and contract clause.
Insert a clause substantially the same as the clause at 5352.201-9101, Ombudsman, in all solicitations (including draft solicitations) and contracts.
*****
5305.207 Preparation and Transmittal of Synopsis 

(20) In all synopsis announcing competitive or sole source acquisitions, the contracting officer shall indicate that the clause at 5352.201-9101, Ombudsman, is applicable.
*****
5316.505 Ordering. (Deleted)
*****
5352.201-9101 Ombudsman. 

As prescribed in 5301.9103, insert the following clause: 
OMBUDSMAN (AUG 2005)

(a) An ombudsman has been appointed to consider and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition. When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official. Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern. The ombudsman may not serve as an advocate for any party. 

(b) Before consulting with an ombudsman, concerned parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution. Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMB Circular A-76 competition performance decisions).

(c) If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the Center/MAJCOM ombudsmen, [Insert names, addresses, telephone numbers, facsimile numbers, and e-mail addresses]. Concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations that cannot be resolved at the MAJCOM/DRU level, may be brought by the concerned party for further consideration to the Air Force ombudsman, Associate Deputy Assistant Secretary (ADAS) (Contracting), SAF/AQC 1060 Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC 20330-1060, phone number (703) 588-7004, facsimile number (703) 588-1067.
(d) The ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds the agency.
(e) Do not contact the ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical requirements. Such inquiries shall be directed to the Contracting Officer.
(End of clause)

<DESC>This notice is for information and planning purposes only as a final decision on this matter is pending and does not constitute an RFP or commitment by the government.  This will be our only notification of our intent to award a non-competitive contract for this effort.  The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) anticipates awarding a sole source contract to the Boeing Company to support locating, designing, and establishing a Ground Based Interceptor (GBI) missile complex in Europe. A European-based missile defense is part of the Ground-Based Midcourse Defense (GMD) Program Element of the Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS).  The European GBI Missile Complex continues the MDA development and extension of necessary Engagement Sequence Groups (ESGs) critical to the spiral development of the BMDS. The Boeing Company provided the design, construction and integration of the current GMD/BMDS Missile Launch Complexes at Fort Greely, AK and Vandenberg AFB, CA.  The design, integration, build, check-out, and standup of the missile launch complex is scheduled to be completed by 4th quarter 2012, and support initial missile complex capability by 2011. The GMD segment of the BMDS is a highly complex, integrated system, comprised of sensors, launch equipment, Ground Based Interceptors, and tactical and non-tactical communications equipment integrated through software and hardware that allows for the real-time communications, weapons solutions development, weapons task plan hand-off and launch/intercept of incoming ballistic missiles. The BMDS European GBI Missile Complex will face a range of dynamic and technically complex system integration issues.  The tactical components will not only be integrated to work together as a site but will require integration into the overall GMD Weapon System and the BMDS. The BMDS European Site Missile Complex must be compatible with the current system architecture (sensors, communications, and fire control infrastructure) as well as future plans for system upgrades, expansion, or deployment of new BMDS components. Future versions include equipment for which requirements have not yet been defined (adjunct sensor), nor contracts awarded.  . The planned European GBI Missile Complex contract will be awarded while the GMD program is conducting flight tests on the Block 04 configuration.  Blocks 06 and 08, both system upgrades under the spiral development concept, will be fully integrated into the European Complex.  Development efforts for Block 10 will be in process when the European GBI Missile Complex is complete and activated.

The European GBI Missile Complex is inclusive of maintenance and other support buildings buildings, silo design/build, security and force protection features and accommodations, flight and/or missile control facilities, temporary or permanent housing, and necessary related infrastructure such as power, water, sewers, storm drainage and secure communication links.  Element integration activities will include the integration of all Government and Contractor Furnished Equipment such as Silos, Silo Interface Vaults (SIVs), Command Launch Equipment, commercial communications systems and other related tactical/non-tactical communications and launch equipment into the design, development, and installation of necessary hardware and software to support the European GBI Missile Complex activation/operation. Site Planning and Design shall ensure facility/GBI-Launch Equipmen/-Communication Component interfaces are coordinated, and the interfaces provide traceability to the component requirements.  These requirements will flow from the GMD development program through the GMD Capabilities Document into the facility design requirements. Planned period of performance for this effort is January 2007 through May 2008.  The Development/Site Activation and Integration portion of the contract establishes and implements procedures to ensure consistency and synchronization with the evolving GMD developmental efforts.  Due to the complexity of the overall BMDS mission and the GMD System Element, the integration portion is crucial to the success of this project. The BMDS European GBI Missile Complex will face complex integration issues with tactical components that must not only be integrated to work together as a site, but will require the GMD Element to work with the overall BMDS.  In this context, the European GBI Missile Complex must also be compatible with existing Sensors BMDS components and Communications System architecture, as well as future plans for upgrades, expansion, or deployment of new BMDS elements - to include AEGIS and FBX-T.  The European Complex will also require development to be fully interoperable  with future GBI variants such as the Multiple Kill Vehicle (MKV) and Kinetic Energy Interceptor (KEI). The delivery, installation and integration of hardware provided under other GMD or other contracts must be coordinated into the design and construction activities to ensure synchronization across all contracts.  Hardware procurements from various MDA element programs must be acquired and delivered in accordance with specific construction schedule timelines and in accordance with other program requirements against those manufacturing lines. This effort will require considerable engineering, software and other expert technical effort to integrate the European missile defense complex with ongoing GMD and BMDS development programs. Development and Site Activation Integration efforts will be ongoing throughout the period of performance of this contract. Site Build Out and Activation includes site development, build out of the tactical and non-tactical facilities and related infrastructure, communications links, equipment emplacement and activation, facility commissioning, and installation and checkout to include subsystem and system level tests (SSCO/SICO).  The planned period of performance for this effort is June 2008 through September 2012.  

The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all responses received within fifteen days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>This synopsis is being posted to both the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) page located at http://www.fbo.gov  and the Navy Electronic Commerce on Line (NECO) site located at http://www.neco.navy.mil.  While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable.  Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the NSWC Division Crane. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPACT 2005) requires aggressive actions throughout the Department of Defense (DOD) and Department of Energy (DOE) to reduce the existing dependency on fossil fuels and to initiate the transition toward alternative fuels and alternative fuel power sources.  EPACT 2005 goals require the DOD to reduce existing oil consumption rates 20% between 2006 and 2015, increase the use of renewable energy sources more than 7.5% by 2013, and explore unconventional fuel alternatives (synfuels and biofuels) to initiate the transition towards a future hydrogen economy.  Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division (NSWC Crane) and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) are conducting research and development (R&D) and experimentation to advance the state of the art in manufacturing technologies and processes to increase the knowledge of and to help DOD meet EPACT 2005 goals and to complement the President’s hydrogen initiative.   DOD can contribute to the President’!  s initiative by being a ”first adopter” of hydrogen fuel cell technology when a strong case can be made that the technology benefits DOD militarily.  The funding allocated to this program is approximately $10 million.  Each program award is anticipated to be between $750,000 and $1.5 million excluding any proposed industry cost sharing.  The goal of this program is to conduct a DOD hydrogen (H2) fuel cell Materiel Handling Equipment (MHE) pilot program.   NSWC Crane is interested in receiving R&D proposals for scientific study and experimentation in the form of pilot projects directed toward advancing the state of the art or increasing knowledge or understanding in H2 powered MHE and the associated infrastructure. While this BAA will involve delivery of equipment and technology pilot testing for the purpose of data collection, the focus of this BAA is on the collection of operational data.  Successful proposals will include installation, maintenance and training associated with all equipment and hydrogen infrastructure needed to produce the required data for increasing DOD’s knowledge and understanding of the maturity of the technology. 1.	Conduct a DOD hydrogen (H2) fuel cell MHE pilot program –  1.1.	Background: DLA is DOD’s largest combat support agency, providing worldwide logistics support in both peacetime and wartime to the military services, civilian agencies and foreign countries. If America’s forces eat it, wear it, maintain equipment with it, or burn it as fuel…DLA probably provides it.  The Defense Distribution Center (DDC), a field organization of DLA, operates warehousing and cross-docking facilities for DOD.  The DDC’s 26 Distribution Depots, located throughout the United States and around the world, store items having 4 million different stock numbers in 327 million square feet of storage space and process more than 26 million transactions annually.   In total, DLA operates over 3,000 forklifts, of which approximately half are electric-powered.  DLA has identified some of these electric-powered forklifts as targets of this pilot program.  Proposers are expected to offer at a minimum a complete power unit that is equivalent in form, fit, and function an!  d equal or superior in performance to the lead acid or nickel metal hydride (NiMH) battery system currently used in these forklifts.  Other new and innovative approaches, including new forklifts designed for H2 fuel cell power, will be considered based on their contribution to the overall goals of this BAA.   1.2.	Goal Objectives:  The overarching objectives of this goal are to significantly increase the Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs) and Manufacturing Readiness Levels (MRLs) associated with the fuel cell systems and components and to produce business case data for future retrofitting or replacement of the existing forklift fleet with H2 fuel cell powered forklifts. For definitions of TRLs see http://akss.dau.mil/dag/GuideBook/IG_c10.5.2.asp and for MRLs see https://acc.dau.mil/CommunityBrowser.aspx?id=18231.   1.2.1.1.	Any award made at any phase must demonstrate a number of contributions to the maturation of H2 fuel cell or infrastructure technology.   H2 Fuel cell technology includes fuel cell sub-systems and components (e.g., Membrane Exchange Assembly, power electronics, thermal management sub-system), and on-board H2 storage.  H2 infrastructure includes hydrogen delivery or onsite production, onsite storage, and dispensing technology or off-board H2 generation systems. Use of solid hydrogen storage medium is one specific area of interest for technology maturation efforts.  The improvements must be associated with the deployment and use schedule at the site of the proposed business data collection.  1.2.1.2.	The general nature of the improvements and the associated results obtained from the program will be documented and shared with selected industry and government personnel, subject to appropriate protections for proprietary information and other intellectual property.   1.2.2.	Business Case.  Additional sites may be included in the pilot program to generate business case data.  The business case will be built on data collected during the use of the H2-powered MHE in daily warehousing operations by in-place government personnel.   1.2.3.	This BAA initially solicits proposals for the first phase of this effort, a turnkey operation providing, and maintaining for two years, at least twenty H2-powered forklifts, including hydrogen consumed and the associated hydrogen support infrastructure, at the Defense Depot Susquehanna, PA (DDSP), located in New Cumberland, PA.  It is expected that DDSP personnel will, after appropriate training, operate the forklifts, including fueling them from a local H2 storage facility using a hydrogen dispenser located within the warehouse facility.  Proposals must address how the MHE will be provided, either by retrofit of existing equipment with H2 fuel cells that are form, fit and function replacements for sealed lead-acid batteries or by replacement with MHE specifically designed to be H2 powered, and how the H2 will be provided, stored, and dispensed to the MHE.  The contractor or contractor team will also need to obtain the necessary approvals and permits for all aspects o!  f the infrastructure and associated applications.  Proposals must also provide a plan for operator training for both MHE operation and refueling and for initial emergency response training for operators and local firefighting personnel related to MHE and infrastructure equipment.   1.2.4.	Subsequent phases of the effort will seek to establish a similar capability at additional DOD locations.  Additional pieces of H2-powered MHE will be retrofitted or supplied.   1.2.4.1.	Generation (either on- or off-site) of the H2 from renewable, non-hydrocarbon based sources is an additional topic of interest and encouraged in these later phases.   1.2.4.2.	Subsequent phases are expected to be at defense depots located in Tracy, CA, Norfolk, VA, San Diego, CA, Albany, GA, and Anniston AL.  Awards will be made in accordance with paragraph 2. below.   1.2.5.	Business case data will be collected by Government personnel or their representatives using, to the extent practical, automated capabilities provided by the company or companies supplying the fuel cells or the hydrogen fuel equipment for the pilot program (for example, using built-in test data collection capability for the H2 fuel cell).  This data will be used by the Government to decide the timing and extent of later phases of this project, and to what extent H2-powered MHE will be used in DDC operations.  The data will also be made available to other researchers and businesses, subject to appropriate protections for proprietary information and other intellectual property.   2.	Proposals will be evaluated and selections will be made in phases over the period of time the BAA is open.  Proposals for DDSP will be first and are due no later than 12/13/2006.  Additional locations will be identified as they become appropriate and will be announced by amendment to this BAA identifying the specific location.  Proposals for these additional locations will be due roughly 30 days from the date of each such BAA amendment with precise dates being set at the time the amendment is issued. Proposal selections are planned to be made over the subsequent 12 months at intervals of approximately 60 days as additional sites are identified and added by amendment to this BAA.  Offerors do not need to submit for DDSP if they are only interested in other locations/sites.  Due to the fast pace of H2 technology development, a separate proposal and selection will be conducted for each subsequent location.  Any and all awards are subject to availability of funding.   3.	There will be a pre-proposal conference and site visit for potential offerors on the below date. This pre-proposal conference and site visit will explain and clarify the objectives of this program and allow prospective offerors to view the DDSP site.  Government personnel will also respond to questions, but the information contained within this BAA or amendments to it take precedence over verbal responses.  Any questions or clarifications that result in material changes to this BAA will be addressed by a written amendment to the BAA.   4.

This notice constitutes a combined synopsis and Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) as contemplated in FAR Part 6.102(d)(2). It is intended that this BAA be open until one year from its initial publication.  Proposals may be submitted by any non-governmental entity, including commercial firms, institutions of higher education with degree-granting programs in science or engineering (universities), or by consortia led by such concerns. NSWC Crane encourages participation by small businesses, small disadvantaged businesses, HUBZone small businesses, woman-owned small businesses, veteran-owned small businesses, and historically black colleges and universities and minority institutions. However, no part of this BAA is specifically reserved for these entities.  The following guidelines apply to all proposals. Typically each proposal may be funded incrementally for periods up to two years subject to the availability of appropriations.  Awards are expected to be between $750,000 and $1,500,000, with the size of each dependent upon the topic(s) (although NSWC Crane reserves the right to entertain larger proposals based on the availability of funds). More than one effort may be funded for an individual topic area, and deliverables should demonstrate the results of scientific study and experimentation.  Proposals for non-innovative, marginal improvements are inappropriate under BAA authority and cannot be considered for funding.  Additionally, studies and theoretical concepts that do not lead to implementation are specifically excluded.  All criteria set forth in FAR Part 35.016 are applicable. Proposals should be submitted in two sections: full technical and cost.  Technical and cost sections should be submitted as separate files.  Each proposal is limited to 35 pages, including attachments and supplementary material.  Proposals will be evaluated by select Government representatives with non-Government (contractor) support used in an advisory role.  Contractor support companies used for the Defense Depot Susquehanna site are: a.	Institute for Defense Analysis (FFRDC) b.	Logistics Management Institute (LMI) c.	Male Duck Incorporated Proposals will be evaluated using the following evaluation criteria: a.	Overall relevance and scientific and technical merits of the proposed effort, including the plan and schedule for implementing the pilot programs, completeness of the data collection and comparison, turnkey solutions, and expected improvements in H2 fuel cell capability at the pilot program’s completion; b.	Degree to which new and creative solutions to technical issues important to the area of interest are proposed and the comprehensiveness of the technical data produced from the proposed effort are to be delivered with unrestricted rights;  c.	The qualifications, capabilities and experience of the organization or consortia with H2 implementations and the offeror's capabilities, related experience, facilities, techniques or unique combinations of these critical to achieving the BAA objectives;  d.	The degree to which the proposed costs are reasonable and realistic and the quality, amount and extent of proposed cost share in the pilot programs. These criteria are listed in descending order of importance, and the non-price factors, when taken together, are significantly more important than price, but evaluated prices or costs must be reasonable and realistic to enable the Government to make an award. THE GOVERNMENT RESERVES THE RIGHT TO SELECT FOR FUNDING ANY, ALL, PART, OR NONE OF THE RESPONSES RECEIVED. Any responsible business may submit a proposal.   Please send proposals via e-mail to LogR&D@navy.mil. Please refer to BAA number N00164-07-R-6685 in all correspondence and communications.

<DESC>Description of Future Requirements:

The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) is seeking contractors that are capable of providing an integrated time and attendance processing system that meets the requirements outlined in Attachment A - USAID Time and Attendance System Requirements and Vendor Questions. 

BACKGROUND

In recent years significant changes in work place habits and technological advances have affected the manner in which time and attendance (T&A) reporting is accomplished. For example, more flexible work schedules and places, and the trend in government to streamline operations have provided a major impetus for changes in T&A systems.  However, perhaps the most significant influence on these changes is advancing technology and the increased use of automation. The Government Paperwork Elimination Act (GPEA) encourages the movement toward paperless applications and the use of electronic signatures. Although GPEA focuses on electronic systems regarding information obtained from and provided to sources outside the government, it provides an additional impetus to agencies to seek further applications of paperless systems and use of electronic signatures. 

Trends toward increased automation and workplace flexibility have changed the operating environment. However, the need for good internal control continues to exist. 

The primary objective of a T&A system is to ensure that hours worked, hours in pay status, and hours absent are properly reported. Reliable data are important to accurately compute and account for computed pay, leave, and allowances. To achieve this objective, management should have in place an internal control system that provides reasonable assurance that (1) T&A transactions are properly authorized and approved and (2) T&A data are completely and accurately recorded and retained.

THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION. Conducting market research and determining the most uniquely capable schedule contractors for a future competition does not constitute a contract award. It is a business decision of the Contracting Team to determine the most uniquely capable schedule contractors through market research for a future competition. The USAID reserves the right to terminate this process and change its requirements if the needs of the USAID change. Responding to this notice does not guarantee participation in future USAID activities. USAID is not obligated to and will not pay for any information received from potential sources as a result of this Sources Sought Notice.

<DESC>RFI #YTCRFI-07-0001 Amendment 1. Yakima Training Center Aerial Fire Suppression Services. This is not a solicitation.  It is a Request for Information only. The PWS was not able to be posted. Please contact Tricia Allen, Contract Specialist at tricia .allen1@us.army.mil or (253) 966-3500 to request the PWS and/or Request for Information (RFI) with questionaire. A brief description of the aerial fire suppression services is provided below. 1.2  Scope.   The contractor shall provide exclusive use aerial wildland firefighting capability to include one rotary wing aircraft capable of delivering a minimum of 1000 gallons of water in a single trip to fight wildland fires within the confines of Ya kima Training Center (YTC), WA and fires that threaten to enter or pass through the training center. There will be an optional period of performance from 1 April 2007 thru 14 May 2007.  The Government has the unilateral right to exercise the two optional p eriods. The base period of performance will be from 15 May 2007 to 30 September 2007. Another optional period of performance will be from 1 October 2007 thru 31 October 2007. 1.3  Background.  These services are required to meet fire fighting demands during the high fire danger season and comply with a 1991 Record of Decision (ROD) requiring the Army to provide aerial fire suppression as a mitigation measure for increased use o f training lands at the Yakima Training Center, WA.  With the realignment of Army aviation units and equipment, the Armys commitment to the Global War on Terror prevents dedication of limited resources to support the fighting of wildland fires.  The 1991 ROD defines the high fire danger season as 1 April through 31 October each year.  The Government is trying to redefine the high fire danger season as 15 May through 30 September each year.  The use of the 2 optional periods is included in the event that th e high fire danger season is not redefined.    1.4 Intent. The contractor, as an independent contractor and not as an agent of the Government, shall provide the materials, equipment, and labor necessary to provide exclusive use, aerial Wildland fire suppression support to YTC.  The Contractor shall pro vide all equipment (except for that equipment listed as GFP in this PWS), labor, and support necessary to perform the functions and provide deliverables included in this PWS.  The minimum requirement is to provide delivery of at least 1000 gallons of water  by helicopter in a single trip.

<ARCHDATE>12052007
<CONTACT>Susie Kramer Contracting Officer 2083785156     skramer@pn.usbr.gov;
<DESC>The Bureau of Reclamation, Pacific Northwest Regional Office, intends to negotiate two sole-source contracts for Integrated Pest Management services on Reclamation lands in the state of Oregon.  One contract will be negotiated with Crook County Weed Control, Prineville, Oregon, and one contract will be negotiated with the Oregon Department of Agriculture, Salem, Oregon.  The NAICS code for this requirement is 926140 and the small business size standard is not applicable as Reclamation has determined, under the authority of FAR 6.302, that only Crook County Weed Control and Oregon Department of Agriculture possess the unique qualifications for these services for Bureau of Reclamation lands in Oregon.  It is the Department of Interior's policy to use IPM concepts and practices for control of undesirable plants.   Interior policy also mandates that agencies coordinate their IPM activities concerning weed control operations, research, and technology transfer with related programs and goals of private, local, State, and other Federal agencies where such cooperation is feasible and mutually advantageous.  The State of Oregon has developed the Oregon Noxious Weed Strategic Plan and passed the State Pesticide Control Act.  The State Pesticide Control Act provides for a strong partnership with the County Weed Control organizations and the Counties are required to develop and conduct effective pest management programs within the State guidelines.  In order for Reclamation to develop IPMs which are consistent with ongoing programs within the State and County jurisdictions, it is imperative that technical personnel from both the State and County be part of the interdisciplinary team.  The Oregon Department of Agriculture has been assigned the responsibility for regulation and enforcement of the Act and possesses unique knowledge and perspective on the regulatory aspects essential to the success of the IPM program in Oregon.  Equally as crucial to the success of the IPM,  Reclamation needs input from the local County Weed Control Office (Crook County) in order to develop effective management plans for local noxious weed control.  The Oregon Department of Agriculture best provides State leadership and County programs best provide local organization and direction.    Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals to Susie Kramer via email at skramer@pn.usbr.gov or fax 208/378-5108. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within 15 days after date of publication of this announcement will be considered by Reclamation. A determination by Reclamation not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of Reclamation. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>Notice of intent to award a sole source contract. The General Service Administration Federal Technology Service (GSA/FTS) on behalf of the Indian Health Service (IHS) intends to award a sole source contract for the annual license renewal for IMM/Service Software and customization support services to Medical Decision Associates (MDA).  This is a 100% Small Business Set-Aside. The Immunization package in the Resource and Patient Management System (RPMS) supports clinical decisions related to immunizations, in addition to providing functions to improve patient care and public health.  The clinical decision-making support is provided by a proprietary software program called IMM/Serve, owned by Medical Decision Associates (MDA). IMM/Serve software package is a computer program which implements the clinical guidelines for childhood immunization. IMM/Serve accepts as input a child?s immunization history. It indicates which vaccinations are due and which vaccinations should be scheduled next. The clinical guidelines for immunization are quite complex and are modified quite frequently. As a result, it is important that IMM/Serve's knowledge be represented in a format that facilitates the maintenance of that knowledge as the field evolves over time. To achieve this goal, IMM/Serve uses four representations for different parts of its knowledge base. 1) Immunization forecasting parameters that specify the minimum ages and wait-intervals for each dose are stored in tabular form. 2) The clinical logic that determines which set of forecasting parameters applies for a particular patient in each vaccine series is represented using if-then rules. 3) The temporal logic that combines dates, ages, and intervals to calculate recommended dates, is expressed procedurally. 4) The screening logic that checks each previous dose for validity is performed using a decision table that combines minimum ages and wait intervals with a small amount of clinical logic. A knowledge maintenance tool, IMM/Def, has been developed to help maintain the rule-based logic. In addition to the annual license renewal, approximently 100 hours of software customization support will also be required.  MDA is believed to be the only source for this software. Any small businesses other than MDA, who can provide the above software and support must indicate their interest and capability no later 19 December 2006, 4:00 (central) to Bill Lively, bill.lively@gsa.gov and  Pat Molina, patricia.molina@gsa.gov. Offers or quotations from other than small business concerns will not be considered and shall be rejected.  This notice of intent is NOT a request for competitive proposals. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>Request for Information INTRODUCTION    Pursuant to FAR 5.201(e), Marine Corps Systems Command (MCSC) is releasing a Request for Information (RFI) to survey the commercial market for camera and monitor systems that can be installed on a High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS) launcher to aid the driver’s visibility in the front, sides and rear view of the launcher.  The HIMARS launcher is mounted on a Family of Medium Tactical Vehicle (FMTV) 5-ton truck.  The visibility from the HIMARS launcher is adequate but once a Low Signature Armored Cab is mounted, visibility is severely restricted from all angles due to the fact that the front and side windows are reduced in order to provide a greater level of protection from ballistic threats.  The program office ultimately intends to resolve the blind spot with a camera and monitor system that can be installed to provide the driver nearly 360° visibility during day and night operations from inside the vehicle.  The results of this RFI will assist w!  ith the development of the technical requirements for the camera and monitor system. DISCLAIMER    This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a solicitation.  Responses to this notice are not offers and will not be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  Respondents are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI.    Responses to this RFI will not be returned and respondents will not be notified of the result of the review.  Responses are due no later than 27 December 2006 and can be e-mailed to crystal.paine@usmc.mil.  Any questions regarding this RFI shall be submitted electronically to the Contracting Officer at crystal.paine@usmc.mil.

Complete responses to this RFI should be submitted no later than January 8, 2007.  If you need additional information please contact the above mentioned contracting officer, Brenda Wishart.   Meridian Hill Park is located in Washington, D.C. approximately one and one-half miles north of the White House.  It is one of Washington's most important and historic parks in the tradition of the monumental, federal parks of the Mall. Bounded by 16th Street on the west, Euclid Street on the north, 15th Street on the east and "W" Street on the south, Meridian Hill Park is located within a diverse and changing neighborhood. Originally envisioned as "a classical villa landscape at the center of a vibrant and interesting residential neighborhood", the park continues to play an important role in the physical as well as social landscape of the neighborhood. Meridian Hill Park was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1994, as "an outstanding accomplishment of early 20th-century Neoclassicist park design in the United States".  A current construction project involving the repair and restoration of deteriorated exposed aggregate retaining walls, paving, steps, decorative fountains and pump replacement is nearing completion. A second construction project involving the repair of the storm drainage system and restoration of park plantings, the Lodgehouse and site lighting is ongoing. Despite being the object of several years of repair and restoration, the mechanical systems servicing the site's extensive decorative fountains system remain only partially operable. The NPS seeks input from the fountain industry on how to bring the fountain system to a fully-functioning state. NPS inspections to-date have revealed several remaining issues with the fountain, including pump cavitation (and corresponding lack of pump capacity), debris clogging the fountain system, and leakage from several of the fountain pools. The fountain covers a large area (approximately one quarter) of the park and consists of the following components: 1.	Two Great Terrace fountains at the upper end of the fountain above the Great Wall (large retaining wall separating the north end of the park from the south end) fed by pressurized water from the system pump. 2.	Two Niche fountains in the Great Wall fed by gravity water from the Great Terrace Fountains. 3.	A Niche fountain facing 16th Street. This fountain is non-functional due to drainage issues - the valve feeding pressurized water from the system pump to this fountain has been closed indefinitely. 4.	Three Great Wall Pool Niche fountains fed by pressurized water from the system pump. These fountains drain immediately into the Upper Receiving Pool at the base of the Great Wall. 5.	Thirteen Cascade Basins fed by gravity water from the Upper Receiving Pool. Each cascade basin spills into the next lower cascade basin with the last cascade basin spilling into the Lower Receiving Pool. 6.	Four Reflecting Pool fountains fed by pressurized water from the system pump. The Reflecting Pool and the Lower Receiving Pool are connected with two 6" equalizer lines so that they maintain the same water level. 7.	A pump reservoir that is fed with an eight-inch return water (gravity water) line from the upper fountain features, a 12" return water line from the Lower Receiving Pool, and an eight-inch return water line from the Reflecting Pool. A box-type strainer has been provided on the return water from the Lower Receiving Pool and the Reflecting Pool but no strainer has been provided on the eight-inch return water line from the upper fountain features. The water level in the reservoir is maintained by a probe-type level control system that operates a solenoid valve to introduce city water for make-up. The level control system also has a function that shuts the system pump down on low water level in the reservoir. The pump reservoir has an overflow weir that discharges to the city sewer and it also has a sump pump to completely drain the reservoir and fountain. 		Picture No. 01 (See FTP site) 		Picture No. 02 (See FTP site) 		Picture No. 03 (See FTP site) 8.	A variable frequency drive (VFD) for the system pump. The VFD can be operated manually or can be controlled by water pressure downstream of the system pump (although the automatic control function of the VFD has not yet been successfully demonstrated). The pump is also equipped with a pressure switch downstream of the pump that will shut the pump down if the discharge pressure gets too low. 		Picture No. 04 (See FTP site) 9.	A system pump. The pump characteristics are as follows: Aurora Model 411, 5x6x17, 100 HP, 1750 RPM, 1600 GPM @ 180' (78 psi) total dynamic head, 225' (97.4 psi) shut off head, 17.3' (7.5 psia) net positive suction head required (NPSHR). Further information on the system pump can be found at: http://www.aurorapump.com/pdf/410/Curves_410.pdf (pump curves) http://www.aurorapump.com/pdf/410/411_Dim_Eng.pdf (dimensions and engineering data). 		Picture No. 05 (See FTP site) The centerline of the pump is above the pump reservoir high water level (approximately 18 inches - this is not an accurate measurement, but only an estimate), so the pump does not have a flooded suction condition. The pump prime is held by an 8-inch check valve in the pump reservoir - the suction line is eight-inch ductile iron, with an original portion that runs under the floor of the pump room, elbows up above the floor and then elbows over toward the pump suction. An eight-inch inline basket strainer has been installed in the suction line, with an eight-inch OS&Y gate valve. As you can see from the photo above, the pump suction line turns 90 degrees through a short radius elbow and then connects to the pump suction flange with a concentric reducer - this is not an ideal configuration. Experimentation with pump speed by the contractor indicates that when the pump is run at 50 Hz (approximately 1,460 RPM), the discharge pressure is approximately 59 psig and there is no cavitation.  However, this does not provide enough pressure (or flow) to properly operate the fountain. Running the system at 60 Hz makes the pump cavitate - the discharge pressure fluctuates rapidly around 60 psig and the cavitation noise in the pump room is quite loud. Using a Hazen Williams C value of 80 (conservative for the old underfloor section of suction line), an eight-inch suction line, and a clean inline basket strainer, calculations indicate that the net positive suction head required (NPSHR) exceeds the net positive suction head available (NPSHA) by about 0.3 psi at full pump speed. This indicates that the pump should cavitate, which is what appears to be happening. Performing the same calculation at 50 Hz, the NPSHA exceeds the NPSHR by about 2.6 psi, which indicates that the pump should not be cavitating, and this also accords with experience. All of the above is assuming a clean strainer. However, experience has shown that the inline basket strainer quickly clogs with debris, exacerbating the cavitation problem. This leads into the second major issue - debris clogging. There are strainers located at the drains in all of the fountain pools and basins and there is also the box strainer in the pump reservoir. As mentioned above, there is no strainer located where the eight-inch return line from the upper fountain features enters the pump reservoir. Even with all of the strainers located at drains, a large amount of sizeable debris, such as leaves, seeds, and grass clippings (and linear debris, such as sticks and twigs) ends up in the pump reservoir, where it gets pulled into the pump suction line. The inline basket strainer has 1/16-inch holes in it, which appears to be sufficient to protect the pump, but the strainer clogs frequently, causing the pump to shut down on low discharge pressure. At one time, the contractor ran the pump with the strainer basket removed - the pump impeller became clogged with debris and caused considerable damage to the pump. Picture No. 06 (See FTP site) Several of the fountain pools (Upper Receiving Pool, Lower Receiving Pool, and Reflecting Pool being the major ones) leak out onto the walkways around the pools, causing a slipping hazard for visitors to the park. The leakage also impacts the aesthetics of the fountain. It appears that the floor-to-wall joints are leaking, but this issue needs further investigation to determine where the main leaks are occurring. As a consequence of information gained from responses to this Request for Information, the government may develop a scope of work for a future five-year IDIQ contract for repair and long-term maintenance of the fountain system. This Design/Build Repair/Maintenance contract is anticipated to be solicited in the Spring of 2007.  If pursued, the solicitation will be issued electronically, on the Department of Interior's National Business Center (NBC) web site, at http://ideasec.nbc.gov.   Paper copies of this solicitation will not be made available. Prospective offerors desiring to conduct business with DOI are requested to register at the National Business Center. Any available informational resources, such as historic drawings, historic photographs, reports, as-constructed drawings, specifications, shop drawings, etc. will be made available by the NPS upon request.  Please contact Brenda Wishart (303) 987-6747 with those requests. All available requested information will then be posted upon the NPS FTP site as directed below.

<SUBJECT>B -- Defense Acquisition Challenge (DAC) Program FY08, Broad Agency Announcement
<DESC>The Defense Acquisition Challenge (DAC) Program was established by Congress (Chapter 139 of Title 10 USC, 2359b) to increase the introduction of innovative and cost-saving technologies and products into existing Department of Defense (DoD) acquisition programs. The DAC Program is managed through the Office of Secretary of Defense (Acquisition Technology & Logistics), Deputy Undersecretary of Defense (Advanced Systems & Concepts), Comparative Testing Office. DAC provides any person or activity within or outside the DoD the opportunity to propose alternative technologies and product improvements. Opportunities known as 'Challenge Proposals' proposed at the component, subsystem, or system level of an existing DoD acquisition program, will be evaluated for resulting improvements in performance, affordability, manufacturability, or operational capability of that acquisition program.  DAC Proposals will be evaluated under the guidelines and criteria outlined in Title 10 USC Section 2359b, Defense Acquisition Challenge Program.  Evaluations and awards under this BAA will be in compliance with applicable FAR, DFARs and agency regulations.  This Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) is open to any technologies, products, or processes demonstrating a near-term potential to improve existing DoD acquisition programs that address the specific operational areas outlined below. Preference will be given to those technologies and products that 'challenge' an incumbent and have the potential to be evaluated in less than 24 months from project selection, with near-immediate transition to operations/production at the completion of evaluation. To meet this time-line the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of proposed technologies or processes must be at least TRL 7 (prototype demonstrated in a relevant or operational environment) at time proposed, and at TRL 8 or 9 (qualified through testing or ready for production) by completion of DAC testing. The following operational areas will be considered by DAC for US Army, US Air Force, US Navy and Marine Corps, US Special Operations Command, or other Defense Agencies: 1). Warfighter enhancements that specifically address improved warfighter effectiveness (e.g., lethality, accuracy, endurance, et al); improved warfighter survivability (e.g., protection, agility, stealth, medical, et al); improved warfighter force protection (e.g., defensive systems, detection, armoring, chem-bio defense, et al); and improved warfighter sustainability (e.g., lighter equip, combined equip, longer missions, better batteries, et al). 2). Direct warfighter support that specifically addresses logistics (e.g., supply chain management in the field, equip reliability, et al); teaming (e.g., Net/Information Centric Operations at the tactical/operational level, et al); surveillance; and tagging and tracking (e.g., blue and hostile forces tracking, friendly identification, et al). 3). Warfighter employment that specifically addresses planning capabilities (e.g., large unit employment); coordinating capabilities (e.g., Net/Information Centric Operations at the strategic level, et al); transport capabilities (e.g., getting to/from the fight, et al); and operational readiness (e.g., equip availability, maintainability, training, et al).  Proposals that specifically address solutions for acquisition programs experiencing a Nunn-McCurdy breach will be given special consideration if they address the reason for the breach and satisfy all other legislative requirements identified in Title 10.  Additionally, appropriate priorities will be given to those proposals from businesses that are not major contractors with the DoD.  The evaluation of proposals will be conducted in two phases. In the FIRST PHASE, any person or activity within or outside the DoD interested in participating must submit a proposal via the website: https://cto.acqcenter.com  and attach a Quad Chart using the most current Quad Chart format under 'Reference Materials' on the website. Although not required in this first phase, a letter of support/endorsement from the Service/USSOCOM Program Management Office or Program Executive Office responsible for the acquisition program can be electronically submitted with the proposal. All proposals received will be subjected to peer and scientific review panels. Evaluation criteria for selection in this phase include at a minimum: (A) whether the proposal has merit; (B) whether the proposal is likely to result in improvements in performance, affordability, manufacturability, or operational capability at the component, subsystem, or system level of an acquisition program; (C) whether the proposal could be implemented in the acquisition program rapidly, at acceptable cost and acceptable disruption to the acquisition program. Proposals that meet the requirements as outlined above, and any additional evaluation criteria deemed appropriate for source selection, will be prioritized based on potential for providing innovative and cost-saving technologies or products into existing DoD acquisition programs and ability to meet warfighter needs. If not identified in the proposal, the acquisition program of record (POR) that can be identified as the most likely to benefit from the proposed technology or product will be asked to conduct a review of the proposal submitted in this First Phase. The associated DoD Program Manager, in collaboration with the prime system contractor on the program as appropriate, will decide whether to accept the proposal and further refine/develop the proposal for submittal as a Final Proposal. The acquisition program manager who reviews and accepts the initial submittal is responsible for submittal of the Final Proposal during the SECOND PHASE. The acquisition program manager will determine the scope of the DAC project to include action as a validation test or a comparative test based on market evaluation, acquisition best practices and program need.  In this second phase the Final Proposals submitted by program managers compete for DAC funding to test the proposed technology. In addition to the required areas on the initial proposal, the Final Proposal must include: key performance parameters (those the technology/product/process must meet); test concept and schedule for the test planning, administration, and data analysis; a plan for integration (to include cost and schedule) of the technology or product into the acquisition program; estimated vendor support costs; test article cost; projected facility/laboratory/test range costs; Quad Chart and a Project Chart with cost profile for the test and evaluation of the technology/product/process for the intended application. The integration plan must include all applicable certifications (safety, flight worthiness, insensitive munitions, operational utility, etc.) required to insert the product/technology/process into the acquisition program. Letter(s) from the acquisition authority expressing intent to procure, or the weapon system prime expressing intent to incorporate, pending successful testing, are required with the Final Proposal. By law, DAC funds cannot be used to implement/field the technology or product.  At the completion of the Second Phase a Government-led evaluation team will review all competing Proposals and assess each against the evaluation criteria set forth in Title 10, USC Section 2359b and those criteria deemed appropriate for source selection. The Second Phase Government review of the Proposals will include all criteria listed above, as well as: (A) an assessment of the cost, ease, and likelihood of adopting the challenge proposal and implementing it in the acquisition program; and (B) consideration of any intellectual property issues associated with the Challenge Proposal. Proposals will be selected for funding based on their assessment rating and the availability of Government funding. Selection for funding is highly competitive. Every attempt will be made to ensure that all submitters are notified of the outcome of their proposal(s). Final FY2008 selections are expected to be finalized NLT 1 October, 2007. All submissions into the Defense Acquisition Challenge website must be UNCLASSIFIED. Classified submissions, up to SECRET, can be accepted through the mail. Classified responses must be appropriately marked, sealed and mailed in accordance with classified handling procedures. Classified proposals must adhere to the same Proposal and Quad Chart formats provided on the website. For classified submittals, send an email to defensechallenge@osd.mil . Mailing instructions will be provided at that time. Classified documents must be mailed and received by the applicable due date and time. Classification does not in any way eliminate the offeror requirement to comply with all instructions in the BAA. Notification of rejections will be emailed to the Proposal submitter. It should be generally assumed that the reason a proposal was not considered for further review was due to failure to meet the requirements for DAC. This should not be construed as a commitment by the Government, and any information submitted by industry will not constitute an offer that could be accepted by the Government to create a binding contract. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this Request for Information or otherwise compensate/ reimburse for the information solicited. Persons submitting proposals are advised that only a Contracting Officer may obligate the government to any agreement involving expenditure of government funds. While this BAA and evaluation process meet the requirements for fair and open competition, the final determination will reside with the DoD contracting officer from the Sponsoring organization. Proposals must be received/ submitted via the DAC website NLT 2400 hours EST, 2 February 2007. Proposals submitted after the deadline will have to be submitted as an UNSOLICITED PROPOSAL and may result in the proposal not being considered for funding during the initial selection cycle. All Proposal submissions must comply with the Submission Guidelines and use the FY2008 templates provided on the website. Failure to comply with the above instructions may result in the rejection of the proposal during the administrative review.  The agency posting this announcement, Washington Headquarters Services/ Acquisition and Procurement Office, is not responsible for the DAC program and therefore will not answer any questions and/ or accept proposals.  Questions regarding DAC should be directed to defensechallenge@osd.mil  or 703-602-3740.

<SUBJECT>--Industry Day - Exploring the Feasibility of Contracting for Health Care Services on a Military Installation
<DESC>Introduction The Department of Defense will sponsor an Industry Day to solicit information from industry on the structure of a pilot program to provide stand-alone contracted health care services on military installations.  This announcement is not a formal solicitatio n or a request for proposals.  Invitees include all interested and available health care vendors, including small businesses.  The Government will use information gained during the Industry Day to assess the feasibility of undertaking a small number of pil ot operations in which the Department of Defense contracts for health care and health care management services on military installations.  This initiative has two phases: a study and the implementation phase.  The feasibility study will continue from now u ntil September 30, 2007.  It may, depending upon the studys findings, be followed by contract solicitations at pilot sites. The Government does not anticipate awarding contracts to work on the feasibility study phase of the initiative. Background The Military Health System (MHS) is a large enterprise that provides operational medicine, training, research and Force Health Protection support across the full range of military operations.  It also delivers health care for the systems 9.2 million eligi ble beneficiaries through TRICARE direct care and private sector managed care programs.  The direct care programs are conducted, for the most part, in military treatment facilities (MTFs) on military installations.  In fiscal year 2006 the budget for opera ting the MTFs was approximately 5.2 billion dollars.  To remain a good steward of these taxpayer funds, DoD must continually seek ways to transform its MTF business and clinical operations to deliver health care more efficiently and effectively.  The MHS t ransformation effort defined in the Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) Roadmap for Medical Transformation will enhance this process. Objective The objective of this QDR initiative is to assess the potential for DoD to contract for health care and health care management overhead on a military installation. By implementing pilot programs, the DoD will be able to determine whether it is more cost ef fective to have a government-owned, contractor-operated (GOCO) organization, using all of their own business systems, perform ambulatory care or ancillary services either within government facilities or in freestanding facilities on military installations.   These contractor-operated entities may be able to operate with reduced management overhead (compared to a government-run organization) and would use private sector business practices.  A pilot study could involve ambulatory care delivery or ancillary ser vices (e.g. pharmacy, lab, radiology, physical/occupational therapy) and would probably be under a GOCO use of a facility on an installation.  Depending on the application, the contractor could either build and operate a new facility or operate from an exi sting government facility. Agenda In order to facilitate industry participation, the Government will provide a set of briefings during Industry Day that presents an overview of the MHS and MTF operations and outlines objectives, timelines and constraints for the initiative. The Government will then host a discussion to get industry input on the following areas: 	a)  Provide feedback on current, successful Government initiatives of the same or similar nature. 	b)  Where does industry see duplication and inefficiency in the current model that could potentially save money? 	c)  What types of practices in commercial industry are best suited to implementation within the Department of Defense? 	d)  What is the best way to measure the potential savings from a pilot project? 	e)  What are the best incentives for the Government to use to reward excellent performance of a potential contractor in the pilot programs? 	f)   What do you think is the best means of structuring payments and reimbursement under a  potential contract? 	g)   The Government will want to have a permanent record of any patient care recorded in its clinical information system, AHLTA. What recommendations do you have to enable efficient interface between contractor medical records systems and AHLTA? You will also have the opportunity to provide input in these areas before or after Industry Day, at the website MHSIndustryDay.lmi.org.   This website will be open until 17 February 2007 (30 days after Industry Day).  Any information you provide on the web site in response to these Government questions is for Government use only and will not be disclosed.  The Government will not open a one-on-one dialogue with any vendor in response to this confidential input. You may also use the website before Industry Day to ask questions that will be answered on January 18.   The final agenda item for Industry Day is an open forum for Industry questions and public answers.   Date and Location The Industry Day will be held on January 18, 2007 at the LMI corporate facilities, 2000 Corporate Ridge, McLean, VA 22102-7805.  The forum will commence promptly at 8:30 am and is scheduled to end at 12:30 PM EST.   Attendance is limited to prime vendors w ith no more than two representatives from each vendor.  Only those who register before the Industry Day will be allowed access.  To register, vendors should go to website at MHSIndustryday.lmi.org If you have any questions about registering for Industry Day, please contact the Industry Day registrar, Ms Kim Murray at kmurray@lmi.org

(4) Description of requirements for the items to be acquired. 
The United States Agency for International Development (Agency) seeks to acquire a time and attendance (T&A) system and a payroll processing system.  These two systems must be fully integrated and seamlessly function together.  Because our U.S. personal service contractors (employees) operate worldwide and in often unusual working environments, the T&A and payroll systems must allow the flexibility to adapt to the different and ever changing needs of the employees as well as meet U.S. regulations regarding salary payments and reporting.  Due to the sensitivity of payroll, timing, and an effort to reduce the Agency's management burden, the Agency seeks to acquire services from one service provider with proprietary T&A and payroll systems.  Therefore, the Agency prefers that these systems are not subcontracted to a third party or parties as : (a) dealing only with the prime and not subcontractors would represent the "best value" for USAID and (b) given the low dollar amount of the contract, we do not see a need for subcontracting.

Potential Time and Attendance and Payroll service provider must meet all of the following requirements:

1.	The payroll system must be entirely web based and accessible via the internet.  Proposals which require the Agency to install hardware or software onto its computer systems will not be considered.
2.	On a biweekly basis, the service provider's time and attendance system must be capable of recording all time and attendance information via the Internet.  The system should also have the flexibility to allow authorized staff from overseas offices (Missions) to enter time and attendance for other Missions whose internet connection may not be available or functioning.  There are 26 pay periods per calendar year.
3.	The service provider must upload the information from their T&A system into their payroll system.  Time and attendance information will be entered by the Missions, and the service provider will process the payroll.  The Agency must be able to access the service provider's system to generate payroll reports after all payroll calculations have been made.
4.	The service provider must be intimately familiar with the US tax system (local, state, and federal).  The payroll system must be able to deduct the required taxes from the gross salary payment, maintain a running balance of the taxes deducted each pay period based on the calendar year, and generate reports reflecting the amounts deducted for each employee and the overall total deducted for the year.  The payroll system must also be able to generate Forms 941 "Employer's Quarterly Federal Tax Return" on a monthly and quarterly basis as well as yearly W-2 reports for each employee.
5.	The service provider must produce all necessary reports required by the IRS.  These reports must be sent to the Agency, preferable via email in PDF format.  W-2 reports must be printed on a standardized form acceptable to the IRS and must reflect the employee's gross salary, federal income tax deductions, social security deductions, Medicare deductions, any and all other income or deductions made on behalf of the employee.  
6.	Bi-weekly pay stubs must contain all relevant payroll information.  All income and deduction items must be displayed separately.  Federal taxes paid by the employer must be displayed as a separate line item from federal taxes paid by the employee.
7.	The payroll system must provide the flexibility for the Agency and Missions to log on to a password protected web based system and access standard and create customized reports to download and print.  The system must allow for each Mission and the Agency to have specific passwords, and access must be able to be restricted.  The system must allow specific Missions to run reports for their specific employees.  For example, the Mission in Egypt must be able to log onto the system and run a report showing specific payment categories paid to each of its employees for a specific time period.
8.	Due to the changing political, economic, and social environments USAID operates in, the payroll system must have to the flexibility to record all pay categories that USAID uses.  All different pay categories must be tracked and maintained by the service provider.  Frequent changes to employee salaries, benefits, and location demand that the system be user friendly and easily updated via the Internet with the latest employee information.
9.	Employees are eligible for different leave categories such as sick leave and annual leave.  Because these leave categories accrue at different rates based on years of service, the system must be able to track leave at different rates as well as maintain running balances of both used and unused leave.  Annual leave accrues at 4 hours, 6 hours, or 8 hours per pay period depending on the employee?s length of service.  Sick leave accrues at 4 hours per pay period regardless of length of service.  The system must also be able to be easily updated to incorporate any changes in accrual rates for employees.
10.	Employees may contribute a portion of their salary to an individual retirement plan.  The payroll system must be able to deduct employee contributions by either a percentage of salary basis or by a specified dollar amount, and it should not allow retirement contributions to exceed limits set by US government regulations.  Because contribution limits vary based on a variety of factors such as age and gross salary amount, the system must be flexible enough to easily accommodate changing contribution amounts.  The system must also maintain running deduction balances for employees and generate bi-weekly and yearly reports reflecting per period and cumulative total balances.
11.	The service provider must submit an electronic file containing all payroll activity for each particular pay period that the Agency will use for payment and posting.
12.	The service provider must be able to demonstrate that their system complies with the Privacy Act requirements with respect to safeguarding all sensitive data from unauthorized access and use.
13.	The service provider must provide 24 hour per day technical support for its system.
14.	The service provider must have a toll free customer service number.  The toll free number must be accessible from anywhere within the United States.
15.	The Agency plans to begin using the payroll system at a pilot Mission or Missions prior to implementing the payroll system agency wide.  The service provider must be able to accommodate the Agency's implementation plan.

FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation-Commercial Items applies.  The following specific evaluation criteria is to be included in paragraph (a) of that provision. 
(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:
I- Technical ability:  Must accomplish the technical requirements set forth in the Statement of Work and protect personal information.
1)  The Offerors must provide a detailed description of all the training and customer service they provide for their Time and Attendance and Payroll System; for example, web based training, dedicated account manager, etc.
2)  The Agency will not install any hardware and/or software onto its computer systems.  Therefore, proposals requiring the Agency to install hardware and/or software will not be considered.
3)  The Offerors must demonstrate how they are in compliance with the Privacy Act.
4)	The Offerors should describe the level of internet and system security they provide.
5)	The services to be provided to the Agency must be explicitly written in their proposals.  Should the Agency be directed to an Offerors website for additional information, the Offeror must make it clear in their written proposals which services are being offered.  The Agency will not evaluate any product or service which is not explicitly stated in the Offeror's written proposal.
6)  The Offerors must provide an online demo version of their entire web based Time and Attendance and Payroll System.  The demo version must be accessible via the internet, preferably through the Offeror's website.  Using the online demo version, the Agency must be able to simulate all transactions as described in the Statement of Work.  The Agency will use the demo version to evaluate the following criteria.
a.	The demo version should provide a clear picture of the time and attendance system and how it operates.
b.	The Offerors will be evaluated on the flexibility of their payroll system to create customized reports.
c.	The Offerors' software should be user-friendly and require minimal supervision and support to operate.  The software should be intuitive to the users in the Agency.
d.	The Offerors will be evaluated on the flexibility of the system to incorporate changes to an employee's payroll information, i.e. changes in pay rates and leave accrual rates.
7) Due to the sensitivity of payroll and an effort to reduce the management burden, the Agency seeks to acquire services from one service provider with proprietary T&A and payroll processing systems.  Therefore, the Agency prefers that these systems are proprietary and not subcontracted to a third party or parties as : (a) dealing only with the prime and not subcontractors would represent the "best value" for USAID and (b) given the low dollar amount of the contract, we do not see a need for subcontracting.

II- Past performance: 
1)	The Offeror shall submit a list of all past or current grants, contracts and subcontracts awarded within the last three years for efforts which are similar in scope, magnitude and complexity to that which is detailed in the Statement of Work (SOW).  The list shall include the name, telephone number, and e-mail of at least three contacts.  If the contractor had any previous USAID awarded contracts, please provide the names of USAID CTOs  (Cognizant Technical Officer) for that contract.  Names of CTOs submitted will count toward satisfying the minimum requirements for three contacts required.  It is recommended that the Offeror alert the contacts that their names have been submitted and that they are authorized to provide past performance information when requested
2)  Offerors shall describe any quality awards or certifications that indicate exceptional capacity to provide the service or product.
3)  USAID may use past performance information obtained from other than the sources identified by the Offeror.  Past performance information will be used for both the responsibility determination and best value decision. 

Offerors are required to fill the Unit Price (UP) for each line item for the different number of employees ,as indicated above, for the base year and for each year of the 4 (one) option year.
 
All evaluation factors other than cost or price when combined are approximately equal to cost or price.  

The Government intends to award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose proposal represent the best value after evaluation in accordance with the factors and subfactors as  set forth in this solicitation.

The USG reserves the right to reject any and all offers received.  Final award of any resultant contract cannot be made until funds have been fully committed through internal USAID procedures.  USAID shall not be liable for any costs incurred by offerors in the preparation and submission of an offer.
This program is authorized in accordance with the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended.  Any resulting award from this RFQ will be administered in accordance with applicable FAR and AIDAR provisions and clauses.

HSAR 3052.209?70  PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE 
                                   EXPATRIATES (JUNE 2006). 

    (a) Prohibitions. 
    Section 835 of Public Law 107?296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause or with any subsidiary of such an entity. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
    (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
    Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting ?more than 50 percent? for ?at least 80 percent? each place it appears. 
    Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107?296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
    Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)? 
    (1)  The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
    (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity 
is held? 
    (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
    (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
    (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
    Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
    (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
    (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
    (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign 
incorporated entity; or 
    (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107?296. 
    (2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
    (3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purpose of this section.
    (d) Special rule for related partnerships.  For purposes of applying section 835(b) of Public Law 107?296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 
    (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
    (1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
    (i) Warrants; 
    (ii) Options; 
    (iii) Contracts to acquire stock; 
    (iv) Convertible debt instruments; 
    (v) Others similar interests. 
    (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of section 835. 
    (f) Disclosure. The offeror under this solicitation represents that {Check one}:

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  
The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  
The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

NOTE:  Offerors must acknowledge receipt of all Amendments with submission of proposal.

1.Is there any information on the estimated quantity of line items to be ordered by DHS?

The following figures are estimates from the most recently completed contract which was for a period of 1 year.  Note that these are estimates only and the Government does not guarantee any volumes/quantities for this requirement. 

(1)	8x10 prints, to include 6x8 image with signature border and DHS Logo:  400-450 
(2)	5x7 prints, to include 4x6 image with signature border and DHS Logo:  900-1000
(3)	20x30 prints, mounted protective spray finish, framed and wired for hanging: 85-100
(4 )8x10 montages consisting of 5-20 images/jpeg files and trip documentation: (Included within figure for 20x30 prints).  

Note that items are greeting photos and are ordered in quantities of 1 or 2 per shot with a variety of formats/sizes.  There are rarely any large quantity orders.  

2. How are you currently fulfilling these requirements? 

The services were being fulfilled by a Vendor whose contract expired on September 30, 2006.  

3. Are you specifying a photographic print? 

Yes.  Each order will have a specific style associated with it depending upon the event and print size.  The Government will provide guidance regarding required print size and any specifics that may be required for the prints such as the DHS Logo . 

4.) Are you specifying minimum standard paper? 

No, the Government requires quality paper, such as E-Surface, which is best suited when signatures are required.  

5.) Please explain the spraying of the protective finish. Are you specifying canvas for the 20x30's? We ask because photographic prints do not require protective sprays. 

The Government requires that a clear or luster protection spray be applied on the prints.  Canvas is not required for the 20x30s.  
 
6)  Regarding ?20x30 prints, mounted protective spray finish, framed and wired for hanging.?  Where will the prints be displayed ? i.e. interior or exterior?  Any additional information on the quality of the frame required is also requested.

Prints will be displayed in the interior with no glass.  These are internal communication/morale shots in a standard black thin wooden frame.  They are designed to be rotated from location and buildings.  They are currently mounted on gator foam and are very light weight.

7)  Is there a specific standard frame molding that the DHS Office of Affairs is requiring for the 20?x30? framed prints (ie. Metal or Wood, thickness of profile etc) 

Thin wooden black frame is required.   

8)  Would the Vendor be doing the collage work on the 8?x10? montages, if so, is there a sample available to review for the complexity of the Photoshop work? 

Yes, the Vendor shall do the collage work on the 8? x 10? montages.  The required layouts are of a standard nature and will not require any complex designs.  The Government will provide the shots (3-5) to use or select from.
