STATEMENT OF WORK DARPA 50th Anniversary Display October 20th, 2007 1.0 SUMMARY The Defense Advanced Research Project Agency (DARPA) seeks to obtain a contractor to develop and produce a display that showcases DARPA?s 50th Anniversary. This exhibit will be displayed at the DARPATech Conference at the Anaheim Marriott in Anaheim, CA August 6- 9, 2007. DARPATech is conducted approximately every 18 months to inform the private industry, the academic community, and the military services of the DARPA mission. The last DARPATech was held in August 2005 and is described at http://www.darpa.mil/DARPATech2005/index.html . The 50th Anniversary display will occupy approximately 10ft(width) x 60ft (length) x 15ft(height) of exhibit hall space (See attached floor plan). There may also be separate pedestals or stand alone items that will need to be developed and set up for additional content/displays throughout the lobby and exhibit halls of the Marriott. The objective is to create a standalone display that will provide a centerpiece to the DARPATech 07 exhibits and communicate DARPA's technical achievements since 1958. As an option, the contractor may be asked to recreate the display at the 50th Anniversary Conference and Dinner at the Washington DC Hilton on 10 April 2008. For the performance of the requirements specified in this Statement of Work, DARPA will identify as a minimum a 50th Anniversary Display Coordinator and planning staff. These personnel will perform the following duties: Provide a comprehensive list of content elements and assist the contractor in understanding the nature and context of specific content in DARPA's history.

Contract mods will be made only through the DARPA Contracting Officer. 2.2.2 The Contractor will hold monthly status meetings with the 50th Anniversary planning personnel via telecon or VTC to provide updates on the fabrication effort. The Contractor will provide updated visual renderings of proposed changes and/or integration of content along with a list of any potential problems, cost issues or construction delays at each of these meetings. 2.2.3 The Contractor's fabrication efforts will culminate in a set up and walkthrough of the display at the Contractor's facility or other approved site NLT 29 June 2007. This walkthrough will include all available content items.

Any material considered proprietary shall be marked as such with any associated disposition/handing instructions. Submissions to this RFQ will not be returned.

Offers shall be signed and dated and show the date/time specified in the RFQ for receipt of offers; the name, address, telephone number and email address of the administrative point of contact for the offeror; acknowledgement of solicitation amendments, if applicable; and the period for acceptance of the offer (minimum of 30 days required). Any offer, modification, revision, or withdrawal of offer received at the designated Government office after the exact time "Offer Due Date" designated in the solicitation is "late" and will be handled by the Government as indicated by FAR 52.212-1. 7. Communications. The Government intends to evaluate all offers received and award without discussions. However, in order to support evaluations and selection, the Government may choose to obtain proposal clarifications and / or hold discussions, with one or more of the offerors. (E) SUBCONTRACTING & TEAMING ARRANGEMENTS - Subcontracting and Contractor Team arrangements are permissible in response to the RFQ. The following guidance applies regardless of any arrangements made between the prime and subcontractors: ? All proposal submissions must come under the Prime Contractor ? The Prime Contractor will, at all times, be solely responsible for performance and adherence to the standards in the task order ? The Prime Contractor is responsible for compliance with DARPA?s operating procedures, including ODC qualifications, travel approval and submission of backup ? materials, and adherence to quality standards; and ? Only the Prime Contractor will have any privity of contractual arrangement (e.g., access to DARPA staff). Proposed arrangements with subcontractors must be clearly identified in proposals to the Government. Identification must include the scope of the work to be performed as well as the method of inclusion (i.e. labor category and rates or other direct cost (ODC)). If a task order is awarded to a contractor who proposed a non-schedule subcontractor as an ODC, that subcontracting arrangement is not subject to the GSA Industrial Funding Fee (IFF). Typically, ODC labor is capped at five percent (5%) of total task order labor value unless other, specific conditions are met and called out in the RFQ language. While there are many variations of team arrangements, DARPA adheres to the traditional "prime contractor-subcontractor" interpretation. At all times, the Prime Contractor is responsible for performance and management, regardless of team size, makeup, or flow-down subcontracting agreements. (F) RFQ EVALUATION CRITERIA - The government will make a single award resulting from this RFQ to the responsible Offeror whose conforming business and technical offer is considered most advantageous to the government. In order to support evaluations and selection, the Government may choose to obtain proposal clarifications and/or hold discussions, at its discretion, with one or more of the offerors. The Government will evaluate offers based on the following criteria listed below: 1. The overall approach in supporting the development and production of an exhibit showcasing DARPA's 50th Anniversary. 2. Past performance that shows experience in developing and producing conference displays and exhibits (evidenced by samples of prior work) and an ability to manage time and cost sensitive tasks. 3. The quality and availability of the Contractor's Key Personnel as evidenced by prior corporate experience related to the proposed tasks. 4. Cost realism and Reasonableness. Relative order of importance for the evaluation factors is as follows: a and b-Equal and more important than c c -More important than d As a competitive "best value" solicitation, the Government reserves the right to award to other than the lowest bidder, at its discretion. (G) AWARD ? Contractors will be notified by email regarding the disposition of their proposals. These notifications will be issued at the time the CO issues the contract to the selected Contractor.
