<DESC>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) intends to issue a competitive Request for Proposal (RFP) for services to conduct a Pilot Study to acquire and analyze the data that will allow the determination of an effective method for performing a full scale motorcycle crash causation study, and will identify the main factors contributing to crash causation in motorcycles (to the extent possible within the constraint imposed by a 110 to 220 crash sample size), and the main factors relevant to crash outcomes, with a focus on possible means to mitigate these outcomes. Specifically, this Pilot Study will provide a preliminary assessment of: 1) factors associated with motorcycle crashes; 2) types of motorcycle crashes; 3) types and severity of motorcycle injuries and the nature of fatalities; and, 4) effectiveness of protective gear including helmets. International harmonization of motorcycle crash data needs to be considered when conducting research on crashes.  Recently, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) completed an international effort to establish a common method for collecting motorcycle crash data for global application.  NHTSA plans to follow the OECD guidelines as outlined in their report in conducting this Pilot Study.  It is contemplated that a Cost Reimbursement plus Fixed Fee type Contract will be awarded.  The period of performance of this contract is eighty-four (84) weeks from contract award.  The solicitation and any documents related to this procurement will be available over the Internet, referencing the above solicitation number. These documents will reside on a World-Wide Web (WWW) server, which may be accessed using a WWW browser application. The Internet site, or URL, for the FedBizOpps page is www.fedbizopps.gov or www.eps.gov. The anticipated issuance date is on or about May 23, 2005. However, it is the Offeror’s sole responsibility to monitor the Internet site for the release of the solicitation and amendments (if any). Potential Offerors also will be solely responsible for downloading their own copy of the solicitation and amendments (if any), and any other related documents.
