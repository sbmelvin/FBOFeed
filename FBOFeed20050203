<DESC>The General Services Administration (GSA) hereby notifies of the intent to issue a solicitation for the construction of a new parking facility at the Food and Drug Administration located at the White Oak Federal Research Center in Silver Spring, Maryland. The North Garage is to be built as part of a multiphase construction project consisting of a new office, laboratory and research campus. The North Garage project is a 255,300 GSF, 3 story (2 above, 1 partially below grade) 831 car, post tensioned concrete parking structure. The Garage’s principle facade, the west facade, has a low brick wall at the entry level with the upper levels constructed with an exposed cable barrier system. The remaining facades are exposed concrete with the exposed cable barrier system. There are (3) three exterior stair towers, two of which (the northwest and southwest) are clad with an aluminum curtain wall system. The southwest stair tower contains one hydraulic elevator with the structure in place. The contractor must provide all management, supervision, labor, materials, supplies, and equipment and must plan, schedule, coordinate and assure effective performance of all construction to meet GSA and client agency requirements. Construction is to be performed in accordance with the design specifications, drawings and provisions of the contract. The estimated construction cost range for the project is between $7 to $10 million.  The 2002 NAICS Code is 236220. The Construction Performance Period shall not exceed 280 calendar days. The government contemplates award of a firm fixed price contract. This solicitation is not set-aside for small business; however this procurement is being made under the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program. The General Services Administration (GSA) is committed to assuring that maximum practicable opportunity is provided to small, small disadvantaged, and women-owned small business concerns to participate in the performance of this contract consistent with its efficient performance. GSA expects any subcontracting plan submitted pursuant to FAR 52.219-9, Small, Small Disadvantaged, and Women Owned Small Business Subcontracting Plan, to reflect this commitment. Consequently, an offeror, other than a small business concern, before being awarded a contract exceeding $500,000 ($1,000,000 for construction) will be required to demonstrate that its subcontracting plan represents a creative and innovative program for involving small, small disadvantaged, and women-owned small business concerns as subcontractors in the performance of this contract. If selected for award, the offeror’s subcontracting plan should be ready for approval without the need to obtain additional information. The FY 2004-2005 GSA goals for subcontracting are as follows: small businesses at least 39% of total subcontracting planned; small disadvantaged businesses at least 12% of small business subcontracting planned; small women-owned businesses at least 5% of small business subcontracting planned; HUB Zone Small Business at least 3% of small business subcontracting planned; Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business at least 3% of small business subcontracting planned; and Veteran-Owned Small Business at least 4% of small business subcontracting planned. In a partnership between GSA and Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes-Norton, Delegate representing the District of Columbia, GSA has agreed to include a requirement for an Apprenticeship Training and Labor Trade Plan in future Major Construction contracts.  The intent of an Apprentice Plan is to promote the growth of skilled craft labor, specifically the General Contractor's use of a registered apprenticeship program.  (As used herein, the term "registered apprenticeship program" is a program that is registered with the United States Department of Labor or State Apprenticeship Council.)  In accordance with GSA policy, the solicitation will be issued electronically via FEDBIZOPPS (www.fedbizopps.gov) within two weeks of issuance of this synopsis. Proposals will be due 30 days after issuance of solicitation. A pre-proposal conference will be scheduled after the solicitation is released. ALTHOUGH NOT MANDATORY, YOU ARE STRONGLY ENCOURAGED TO REGISTER TO RECEIVE NOTIFICATION OF UPLOADS AT THIS SITE AND TO REGISTER ON THE INTERESTED VENDOR LIST (IVL).

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division Lakehurst NJ intends to place a delivery order under Basic Ordering Agreement N68335-04-G-0016 with McDonnell Douglas Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of The Boeing Company. The delivery order will be for unscheduled maintenance and repair, modification, management services and failure analysis of spares for the Reconfigurable Transportable Consolidated Automated Support System (RTCASS), Multi Analog Capability Instrumentation Kit (MAC) and Self-Maintenance Automatic Test/Calibration (SMAT/CAL). These services will be in support of TECHEVAL/OPEVAL testing of low rate initial production RTCASS stations. The base requirement will be procured to support stations installed in FY05 with an option to support additional stations in FY06.  An option will also be included for the effort to transition the performance based logistics elements to Government control.  The Government intends to solicit and negotiate this requirement on a sole source basis with The Boeing Company, St Louis MO under the authority of 10 USC 2304 (c) (1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1. Boeing is the prime integrator of the RTCASS, MAC and SMAT/CAL. The Government does not own the technical data package and the design is not yet finalized. Boeing is the only source capable of screening each spare part down to the component level to ensure correct configuration and functionality with RTCASS, MAC and SMAT/CAL, while meeting the US Navy's testing schedule. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, the Government will consider all responses received within fifteen days after the date of publication of this synopsis. A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based on the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received as a result of this notice will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive requirement.

<DESC>This is a notice of intent that the United States Coast Guard, Maintenance and Logistics Command, Atlantic intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302 for a sole source contract with Fairbanks Morse Engine Division to Proto-Type Overhaul / Modify One (1) Fairbanks Morse 3800D8 1/8 Model 38D8 1/8 Diesel Engine.  The U.S. Coast Guard issued a sources sought synopsis (Reference number-21058053FA920, Posted January 14, 2005, Response Date January 24, 2005), no responses were received.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement within 10 calendar days of this notice.  The approximate issue date for the solicitation will be February 14, 2005.  The prototype engine overhaul / modification will be to a single diesel engine on the USCGC KATMAI BAY, a 140’ WTGB Icebreaking Tugboat located at Sault St. Marie, MI.  Overhaul /Modification will be done at the vessel’s homepier in Sault St. Marie, MI.  Vessel's availability schedule is for twenty-five (25) calendar days starting April 25, 2004.  The following services being requested to Overhaul and Modify the Fairbanks Morse Engine are:  (1) Evaluate the existing diesel engine’s salient features, to include the operating conditions, conditions of the existing machinery, review of the available service records of the engine, and the application of OEM and after-market components.  (2) Install exchange or rebuilt fuel injection pumps to produce a change to the existing injection timing of the engine to achieve higher exhaust temps at lower engine loads.  (3) Install an external motor-driven vacuum fan to ensure that the engine remains under proper vacuum irrespective of engine speed.  (4) Install an air-operated, PLC controlled, temperature control valve in the engine’s jacket water system.  The valve will be configured to regulate jacket water temperature based on existing lube oil temperature.  (5) Install a PLC control panel to control the above mentioned control valve as well as the existing air by-pass actuator for the installed blower.  (6)  Install a crankshaft air seal to reduce lost crankcase vacuum.  (7) Calibrate the existing Lube Oil Sump bayonet gage to ensure it complies with engine OEM Service Bulletin, Volume “A”, Issue 12, dated June 22, 1987.  (8) Perform an inspection of the engine’s existing vertical drive shaft assembly and provide a report on the condition of the components relative to the OEM tech manual.  (9) Perform an inspection of the engine’s existing roots blower and provide a report on the condition of the components relative to the EOM tech manual.  The inspection shall include the conduct of an air test.  (10) Perform an inspection of the engine’s existing gear train at the free end of the engine and provide a report on the condition of the components relative to the OEM tech manual.  This upgrade/overhaul is a prototype modification that will address documented concerns associated with light load operation, while maintaining optimum high icebreaking steady state and transient performance.  The light load concerns include excessive oil injection into the exhaust manifolds and piping.  Excessive exhaust oil injection also leads to the cutter’s topside surfaces getting coated with a slippery film of oil.  The oil injection is also an environmental concern, whether carried directly into the sea, or into the bilge.  The second primary low load concern is high smoke opacity.  The prototype installation goals are intended to demonstrate a Fairbanks Morse Engines proprietary modification approach that will successfully address the low load concerns, while maintaining optimum icebreaking steady state and transient load performance.  The engine is a unique opposed piston design.  One of the environmental concerns associated with the 140’ WTGB MSA main engine design decision is whether a modified Fairbanks Morse 8-38D8-1/8 engine will have to meet Environmental Protection Agency Tier 2 exhaust emission requirements.  The only known source to the Government for the services listed above is Fairbanks Morse Engine, Beloit, WI.  There may be vendors that can repair and tune the FBM diesel, but as a result of these unique design characteristics, it is believed that only the OEM, Fairbanks Morse Engine Division, possesses the design criteria, historical expertise, and technical ability to develop a new load-carrying profile for this engine.  The desired outcome of the engine modification should allow the vessel to operate safely and environmentally compliant at lower vessel speeds associated with new DHS Law Enforcement duties.  All reference documents are available for viewing at 300 East Main Street, Suite 600, Norfolk, VA  23510-9102.  There are no drawings applicable to this requirement.  For information concerning the acquisition, contact the Contracting Official listed.

<DESC>The U.S. EPA, National Risk Management Research Laboratory (NRMRL) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Mercury Technology Services under the authority of FAR Part 6.302-1 for a modification under existing Contract 68-C-02-088 to conduct the final phase of a three phase study to determine the mercury content of the U.S. petroleum supply.  Under the contract, the contractor is required to perform the following tasks:  (1) Produce a Quality Assurance Project Plan, (2) Obtain crude oil samples and supporting information needed to perform statistical analysis, (3) Construct a sampling plan that will provide a statistically acceptable mean and standard deviation of the mercury concentation in the U.S. oil supply, (4)  Analyze samples, (5) Distribute samples as required and maintain chain of custody records, (6) Schedule sampling to occur such that aging does not become a factor and identify samples for which mercury speciation is required, (7) Receive, assemble and statistically analyze the data to determine the mean, standard deviation, and confidence level, and (8) provide monthly reports and a final report or peer-reviewed journal article. Under the proposed modification, the contractor shall obtain and analyze an additional 260 samples.  This notice is not a request for competitive proposals.  EPA source research indicates Mercury Technology Services is uniquely qualified to meet this requirement.  The work to be performed requires: extensive contacts throughout the petroleum industry;  in-depth knowledge of the pollutant chemistries of the gas and oil industry with an emphasis on the chemistry of mercury;  the ability to model the fate of various mercury speicies in the gas and oil processing industries; and in-depth knowledge of mercury cleanup and mercury control technologies available to the gas and oil industries.   Mercury Technology Services conducted the first two phases of the study and is thoroughly familiar with the project.  Its personnel are the only ones known with the required combination of knowledge, experience, abilities, and established relationships needed to complete the final phase of this study.  However, any firm believing itself capable of meeting EPA requirements may submit technical documentation to establish the potential of complying with the statement of work.  Such documentation must be submitted to the POC within 15 days of electronic posting of this notice.  A determination not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement or to proceed on a sole source basis for the proposed contract modification.  This acquisition is being processed under FAR Part 15, Contracting By Negotiation.  The applicable NAICS code is 541620.  The anticipated effctive date for the modification is 11/16/04.  See Numbered Note 26.

<SUBJECT>S -- PRIVATIZATION OF THE ELECTRIC AND WATER DISTRIBUTION AND WASTEWATER COLLECTION UTILITY SYSTEMS AT FORT LEWIS ARMY INSTALLATION, WASHINGTON
<SOLNBR>SP0600-05-R-0021(a)
<RESPDATE>051905
<ARCHDATE>06032005
<CONTACT>Montrez Nicholson, Commodity Business Specialist, Phone 703 767-9406, Fax 703 767-2382, Email Montrez.Nicholson@dla.mil
<DESC>DESC:  The Defense Energy Support Center (DESC), in conjunction with the United States Army, plans to offer the privatization of the electric, water and wastewater utility systems at Fort Lewis, Washington.  Privatization is defined as the transfer of ownership and responsibility for the operations, maintenance, repair, future upgrades, and future utility system replacements.  As a result of this solicitation, the firm will be selected to assume ownership of the above-mentioned utility systems.  The successful firm will be required to provide expansions to the system to meet future needs of the government.  The resulting contract, if awarded, will require the Contractor to furnish all facilities, labor, materials, tools and equipment necessary to own, maintain, and operate the utility systems.  The Contractor shall manage the maintenance, repairs, replacement, etc., of the systems to ensure continuous, adequate, and dependable service for each Government or tenant connection within the service area.  The Contractor shall be responsible for funding all capital investments required to acquire, maintain and operate the utility systems in a safe, reliable condition and to meet the requirements listed in the contract. Offerors will not be required to submit offers on all of the utility systems and may submit offers on individual system(s) or on groups of systems on an all or none basis.  For purposes of economic comparison required by 10 U.S.C. 2688, each system will be analyzed and considered for award separately. 
The Utility System being privatized is described as follows:

Installation: Fort Lewis, Washington

Installation Description:  Fort Lewis, one of the U.S. Army largest and most modern, consists of 87,000 acres located approximately 15 miles south of Tacoma, Washington. Founded in 1917, the Installation was named after Captain Meriwether Lewis, leader of the historic Lewis and Clark Expedition of 1803. Today, Fort Lewis is home to I Corps, 4th ROTC Region, 2nd Battalion, 7th Rangers, 1st Special Forces Group and Madigan Medical Center.

Utility Systems to be privatized: The following is provided only to give an approximation of the size, scope, and general description of the system.  Any numbers should only be used for estimating purposes.  The following system parameters are approximations.

Electrical Distribution System

Fort Lewis currently purchases its electrical power requirements from the Tacoma City Utilities (TCU) through four (4) separate primary delivery points located within the Installation’s main cantonment area. All three (4) delivery points are supplied from TCU’s 110 kV Boise Cascade/Fort Lewis Loop transmission system. 

The Installation’s distribution system consists of four (4) 100 kV / 13.8 kV substations, 96.2 circuit miles of overhead (OH) primary distribution line and 52.1 circuit miles of underground (UG) primary distribution line. With regard to the four (4) substations, TCU owns the 110 kV switching, protective equipment and the power transformers and Fort Lewis owns the secondary structures, bus-works, voltage regulators and metal-clad switchgear. The primary distribution system consists of a total of twenty-one (21) 13.8 circuits. The majority of the distribution circuits are configured with loop tie switches to neighboring circuits. The distribution system is primarily OH conventional open wire pole-line construction with pole-mounted transformers. However, there is also a substantial amount of UG primary construction, utilizing duct type construction practices.
 
Water Treatment and Distribution System

Fort Lewis’ potable water system includes eight (8) active, two (2) standby wells, the Sequalitchew Springs, a raw water pumping station, a WTP, a booster pump station, a pressure reducing station, an elevated storage tank, eleven (11) ground-level storage tanks and the water distribution lines. The raw water taken from the Sequalitchew Springs and the wells is chlorinated, fluoridated and a corrosion inhibitor is added before the water enters the distribution system. Fort Lewis redistributes the treated water throughout the Main Post, North Fort and Davis Hill service areas via 718,388 linear feet (136 miles) of asbestos cement, cast iron, ductile iron, and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) pipe, ranging in size from less than 2 to 16-inches in diameter. The 500,000 gallon elevated storage tank was constructed in 1960 and repaired in 1979 and 1995. There are also eleven (11) ground-level storage tanks: one (1) 200,000 gallon tanks (constructed in 1949 and repaired in 1979 and 1995), five (5) 500,000 gallon tanks (constructed in 1949 and repaired in 1979), one (1) 500,000 gallon tank (constructed in 1965 and repaired in 1979), two (2) 750,000 gallon tanks (constructed in 1949 and repaired in 1979), and two (2) 840,000 gallon tanks (constructed in 1953 and repaired in 1979 and 1995).       

Wastewater Collection and Treatment System 

Fort Lewis’ wastewater utility system includes 501,400 linear feet (95 miles) of underground wastewater collection lines, 1,674 manholes, 35 relatively small sewage life stations and a secondary wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). The wastewater collection lines include vitrified clay, concrete or reinforced concrete, and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) pipe, ranging in size from 4 to 36-inches in diameter. The wastewater is collected and conveyed primarily via the gravity system with the help of 35 relatively small sewage lift stations to the WWTP. On average, the 7.6 million gallon per day (MGD) WWTP treats 4.3 MGD of domestic and industrial wastewater collected from the Main Post, North Fort, Camp Murray, the VA Hospital, Clover Park Schools, McChord AFB, DuPont Village, Northwest Landing and Madigan Army Medical Center. Initially constructed in 1955 as a primary treatment facility, the WWTP was upgraded in 1974 to provide secondary treatment. Fort Lewis’ WTP includes two (2) mechanically cleaned bar screen, a grit chamber, four (4) primary clarifiers, two (2) trickling filters, (2) secondary clarifiers, three (3) anaerobic digestors, one (1) sludge thickener tank and sludge drying beds.

The Contractor(s) shall furnish all facilities, labor, materials, tools, and equipment necessary to own, maintain and operate the utility system(s) in a safe and reliable condition.  The Contractor(s) shall manage the maintenance, repairs, replacement, etc., of the system(s) to ensure continuous, adequate, and dependable service for each Government or tenant connection within the service area.  Real property interests will be conveyed in the form of a Real Estate Easement as an attachment to the RFP.  The utility system(s) will be conveyed via a Bill of Sale upon award of the contract.  Past performance information from potential Offerors shall be submitted as directed in the RFP. All responsible sources may submit an offer, which shall be considered.  Large businesses are required to submit a subcontracting plan with their offer.  The cascading preference source selection method will be used in the evaluation of firms for award under this solicitation.  Offerors from small businesses will be considered first.  In accordance with FAR Subpart 19.5, any award resulting from the solicitation will be made to an eligible small business concern provided that; (1) at least two competitive offers are received from responsible small business concerns, and (2) award will be made at a fair market price.  If conditions for an award to a small business are not met, award will be made on the basis of full and open competition considering all offers submitted by responsible business concerns.  Interested sources shall contact E. Montrez Nicholson (montrez.nicholson@dla.mil) or Angela Mattox (angela.mattox@dla.mil) to be added to our bidder mailing list. 
 
The solicitation will be available on or after February 18, 2005.  A copy of the solicitation will be available after issuance on the Internet at the below listed URL.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Systems Project Management Office (UAVS PMO) seeks to acquire and field an existing Small Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (SUAV) system that provides the best overall value to meet the small unit need for real-time recon naissance, surveillance, and target acquisition (RSTA) and battle damage assessment (BDA).  The system shall have the flexibility to be modified through a Block Upgrade approach to achieve time-phased incorporation of the requirements within the Operationa l Requirements Document (ORD).  The governments objective for Block 0 is for the contractors to demonstrate their existing systems capabilities during a System Capability Demonstration (SCD).  At a minimum, the Block 0 system is required to meet the SUAV  screening criteria, Key Performance Parameters (KPPs), Airworthiness and Safety Requirements, and trade space requirements (optional).  The objective for Block 1a is the execution and delivery of LRIP systems and the corresponding program support.  The ob jective for Block 1b is the delivery of Full Rate Production (FRP) systems and corresponding program support.  The objective for Block II is for continued Spiral Development and Horizontal Technology Insertions. AMCOM plans to issue formal RFP Number W58RGZ-05-R-0382 for a full and open competition for the U.S. Army SUAV system on or about 28 February 2005 with proposals due on or about 11 April 2005.  The competition will be conducted in two phases, with the firs t phase resulting in contracts awarded to up to three offerors to demonstrate their system capabilities.  The second phase will result in a contract awarded to one offeror for the production and delivery of LRIP systems and the corresponding program suppor t, as well as for possible follow-on FRP systems.  The Phase I down-select will occur on or about 9 May 2005.  The Phase II/SCD will occur on or about 10 May  30 June 2005.  A best value approach will be used in source selection.   The UAVS PMO is hosting a Pre-Solicitation Conference on 14 February 2005 at the Marriott Hotel, 5 Tranquility Base, Huntsville, Alabama  35805/Phone: 256-830-2222, from 0830 to 1130.  The purpose of this Pre-Solicitation Conference is to obtain industry f eedback on technical requirements and acquisition approach.  The UAVS PMO has established an informational Web site at https://www.tuav.redstone.army.mil/SUAV1 .  Draft technical requirements will be posted at this Web site for review and additional requir ements may be posted prior to the 14 February event.

POSITION DESCRIPTION
Background

After three years of negotiations, Sudan’s government and main rebel group in Southern Sudan (Sudan Liberation People’s Movement/Army – SPLM/A) signed comprehensive peace accords on January 9 to end more than 21 years of civil war. But as Khartoum makes peace on one front, another violent conflict persists in Western Sudan.
 
Open warfare erupted in Darfur in early 2003 when two loosely allied rebel groups, the Sudan Liberation Movement/Army (SLA) and the Justice and Equality Movement (JEM) attacked military installations. The rebels, who seek an end to the region’s chronic economic and political marginalization, also took up arms to protect communities against the government-backed militias (“Jingaweit”) recruited among groups of Arabic extraction. Militia attacks and a scorched-earth government offensive have led to looting, indiscriminate killings, and massive displacement.
 
The situation in Darfur is acknowledged to be a humanitarian crisis of the first order. According to the UN’s Humanitarian Profile (# 9 – dated Dec. 1, 2004) an estimated 2.39 million people are displaced out of a population of 6.5 million within Darfur, and more than 200,000 have crossed the border into neighboring Chad.

Introduction

The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) is the office within the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) that is responsible for providing non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters. OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA). OFDA is organized into three divisions, under the management of the Office of the Director. The Disaster Response and Mitigation (DRM) Division is responsible for coordinating with other organizations for the provision of relief supplies and humanitarian assistance.  DRM also devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human caused disaster situations. DRM hires sector specialists to provide technical expertise in assessing the quality of disaster response. The Program Support (PS) Division provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA’s Washington and field offices. The Operations (OPS) Division develops and manages logistical, operational, and technical support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations. OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue (SAR) Teams, Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs).
The Field Officer will be a part of the Disaster Assistance Response Team in the Darfur Region of Sudan.
OBJECTIVE

USAID has determined that OFDA needs to recruit multiple Field Officers for the Darfur DART to meet its program objectives.  The Field Officers provide a critical on the ground link to implementing partners and other U.S. government programs.

POSITION DESCRIPTION
Background

After three years of negotiations, Sudan’s government and main rebel group in Southern Sudan (Sudan Liberation People’s Movement/Army – SPLM/A) signed comprehensive peace accords on January 9 to end more than 21 years of civil war. But as Khartoum makes peace on one front, another violent conflict persists in Western Sudan.
 
Open warfare erupted in Darfur in early 2003 when two loosely allied rebel groups, the Sudan Liberation Movement/Army (SLA) and the Justice and Equality Movement (JEM) attacked military installations. The rebels, who seek an end to the region’s chronic economic and political marginalization, also took up arms to protect communities against the government-backed militias (“Jingaweit”) recruited among groups of Arabic extraction. Militia attacks and a scorched-earth government offensive have led to looting, indiscriminate killings, and massive displacement.
 
The situation in Darfur is acknowledged to be a humanitarian crisis of the first order. According to the UN’s Humanitarian Profile (# 9 – dated Dec. 1, 2004) an estimated 2.39 million people are displaced out of a population of 6.5 million within Darfur, and more than 200,000 have crossed the border into neighboring Chad.

Introduction

The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) is the office within the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) that is responsible for providing non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters. OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA). OFDA is organized into three divisions, under the management of the Office of the Director. The Disaster Response and Mitigation (DRM) Division is responsible for coordinating with other organizations for the provision of relief supplies and humanitarian assistance.  DRM also devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human caused disaster situations. DRM hires sector specialists to provide technical expertise in assessing the quality of disaster response. The Program Support (PS) Division provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA’s Washington and field offices. The Operations (OPS) Division develops and manages logistical, operational, and technical support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations. OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue (SAR) Teams, Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs).
The Program Officer will be a part of the Disaster Assistance Response Team in the Darfur Region of Sudan.
OBJECTIVE

USAID has determined that OFDA needs to recruit multiple Program Officers for the Darfur DART to meet its program objectives.  The Program Officer provides a critical on the ground link to implementing partners and other U.S. government programs.

<DESC>The purpose of this Modification/Amendment (No. One) of synopsis/solicitation number OAM-2005-N-0009 Parts A and B is to revise the United States Domestic and International Aviation Systems Data and Technical Support Services and to respond to questions received as a result of synopsizing this requirement in FedBizOpps on February 25, 2005 under Classification Code R –  Professional, Administrative, and Management Support Services.  Questions are as follows:  1. Question - Does the Government have a not-to-exceed budget for the proposed effort?  Response - No, but we have expectations about what is a reasonable the price, above which we would not purchase it.  2.  Question - Is there an incumbent performing these services for the government?  If so, is the government satisfied with the current vendor's performance?  A similar question was received from a firm responding to the solicitation - Is there an Incumbent contractor for this requirement?  If so; who is the contractor, what is the contract number, value, and expiration date?  Response - No, There is no incumbent contractor.  3.  Question - Are other vendors currently working with GAO to develop databases, queries, or reporting capabilities for BTS data, as described in the Solicitation?  Response – No.   4.  Question - If the Government intends to develop a new database through this effort, does it have any preference with respect to the software that is used (e.g., SAS, SPSS, Oracle, Access, DB2)?  Response - We are not concerned with whether it is a new database or not, or what the specific software used is, as long as it meets our requirements.  5.  Question - The Executive Summary notice states "Initial training must be provided for up to ten GAO staff within one month of the contract award date."  Given the scope of the work, is there an existing application that already performs the requirements stated in the Solicitation?  Does the government expect a fully operation tool to be built, tested, and delivered within one month, so that training can begin on that schedule?  Response – Based on question Number 5, the FedBizOpps and Executive Summary Statement of Work (Attachment A), III. Data Needs and Requirements, fourth-paragraph, second-sentence is revised to read “Initial training must be provided for up to ten GAO staff for a period not to exceed 60 days from the contract award date”.  6. Question - Does GAO have a Data Use Agreement in place with BTS to obtain the data described in the Executive Summary?  If not, can all data be acquired from BTS via public use files or will the vendor need to work with GAO and BTS to develop a Data Use Agreement?  Response - This data is publicly available from BTS.  7.  Question - The Executive Summary notice states " Scheduling software must have the ability to produce route maps."  Can the government elaborate on how the maps are used, and why they are a requirement for this Solicitation?  Does the government have a preference for the mapping software used (e.g., ArcView, SAS, Mapinfo, etc.)?  Response - Route mapping is often used to analyze airline competition and associated issues; the mapping software is a component offered by a number of vendors that provide scheduling data.  8. Question - One oversight that I think I see is that the GAO has not specifically requested information on airline FLEET portfolios to be included.  FLEET information is critical to all current aviation studies, since current flight worthy aircraft plus aircraft on firm order that will be delivered within the next 5 years have a significant impact on the SUPPLY side of commercial aviation.  We will include FLEET data as part of our proposal, however I bring this to your attention, as you may need to post an addendum to the solicitation to add airlines' Aircraft FLEET data as a requirement.  Response - While GAO appreciate the value of airline fleet information, we do not make it a requirement  because incorporating such a requirement would unreasonably limit the number of vendors that could potentially bid on this contract, eliminating the value of having it bid competitively.  Note:  Those firms that have not requested the Executive Summary Notice of additional information (see Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) Notice code R – Professional, Administrative, and Management Support Services dated January 25, 2005, must request a copy by emailing Harold Miles (Contract Specialist) (milesh@gao.gov).   The date and time for receiving all proposals is 2:00pm (EST) February 14, 2004.*****

<DESC>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is investigating new methods and technologies for lightning data (LD) services and capabilities that will be utilized to support several Government agencies.  The Government is conducting market research into state-of-the-art technologies to meet future Government LD requirements for CONUS/OCONUS coverage. 

For purposes of this RFI, OCONUS is defined as outside of the continental United States, including Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and the Caribbean.

 The Government is inviting all interested parties to submit a description of LD systems, sensors, and networks that provide data collection and products on cloud-to-ground and in-cloud (cloud-to-cloud and intra-cloud flashes/activity) lightning which could meet Government requirements.  Interested parties are asked to provide ROM cost estimates, technical descriptions of their systems, sensors, and LD Networks, data and reporting formats, processing techniques and methods, facilities, and transitional processes/capabilities which may meet the needs of the Government.  The technical descriptions should include supportive technical information, operational data, validated model runs with operational data or data sets, scenarios of detected lightning data activity during recorded or captured thunder storms that have been validated or verified, and any other supportive technical documentation that will enable the Government to evaluate the current state-of-the art. 

Technical information and data provided should substantiate and be supportive in verification of the interested parties’ stated LD system/sensor/network capabilities and performance for lightning detection efficiency, location accuracy, and area coverage.  Interested parties should provide a detailed explanation of their recommended approach to providing LD area coverage for regions with varying terrains, such as OCONUS and the Western Region of the U.S.  

Interested parties should also provide a detailed description of their projected data reporting formats and how they would be applied, implemented, and transmitted to various display platforms.  For an example, “How would detected lightning data (both cloud-to-ground or in-cloud) be detected, transmitted, processed, and reported to the NWS Gateway, and then processed, formatted, and transferred to the NWS All Weather Interactive Processing System (AWIPS)”.  Interested parties should also provide other examples to demonstrate interfacing, transitional, and formatting capabilities to other display or processor platforms. Further, the description should identify required hardware, data structures/formats, and software required for the transmission, processing, and reporting of the Lightning Data by Government Agencies (such as, NOAA/NWS, FAA, BLM, NASA, DOD, and other Government agencies).

In summary, interested parties should address the following areas and capabilities:

1) LD delivery methods, data transmission, and reporting capabilities

2) Transitional capabilities, requirements, hardware, software, training and associated costs

3) Interested parties LD Network and area coverage capabilities, describing/including:
-   the network that presently exists
-  number and location of network sensor sites
-  network area coverage and validated detection efficiency and location accuracy
-  other area, country and coastal coverage (i.e. Canada, Mexico, Caribbean, Alaska, Hawaii)  
-  and future plans for expanding network area coverage.

4) Long-range lightning detection capabilities, which would cover Atlantic, Pacific, and Caribbean oceanic areas

5) Hardware and software commercial products.

Any information considered to be proprietary should be marked as such and will be considered confidential. However, it is not the Government=s intent to disclose vendor proprietary information and trade secrets to the public. The information submitted by vendors during the pre-solicitation period maybe used by the Government in preparing its RFP and finalizing the statement of work, provided this can be done without disclosing proprietary vendor information that is protected from disclosure pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act and other laws and regulations.

If there is sufficient interest generated from this Request for Information, the Government contemplates conducting an Industry Day Conference.

This is not a solicitation announcement and no contract will be awarded pursuant to this synopsis.  Furthermore, the Government will not pay for information received in response to this synopsis. Responses are due 28 February 2005. 

Responses should provide a point of contact, including representative=s name, e-mail address, mailing address and phone number.  Questions and responses shall be sent via e-mail in Microsoft Word format to: Jenista.M.Featherstone@noaa.gov or Anita.R.Middleton@noaa.gov.

<SUBJECT>D -- RFI on Data Model Harmonization and Visualization Tools
<DESC>Request for Information (RFI)
On
Data Model Harmonization and Visualization Tools




Background

The Inter-agency Core Data Types Working Group is chartered to define and develop core data models for use in cross-agency information exchanges.  A core data model is a data model applicable across more than one information domain.  To facilitate the rapid development of such core data models the group seeks information from vendors on tool support for data model harmonization and visualization.

Information Requested

Provide information on software tools to support data harmonization process as described in the following paragraphs.

Data Model Harmonization is the process of comparing similar conceptual and logical data models to determine the common data elements, similar data elements and dissimilar data elements in order to produce a resulting unified data model.  Some possible features of a Harmonization tool are:

•	Import.  The ability to import data models into the tool from various representation formats including: 
o	Entity Relationship Models (i.e. ERWIN).
o	Unified Modeling language (UML).
o	eXtensible Markup Language (XML) Schema.
o	Resource Description Framework (RDF).
o	Web Ontology Language (OWL).
•	Analyze.  The ability to linguistically and semantically analyze the components of multiple data models to determine equivalence, similarity and dissimilarity.
•	Visualize.  The ability to construct multi-modal views of the data models to assist in comparison analysis.  Possible visualizations are:
o	“Side-by-Side” visualization.  The process of comparing models must be supported by robust “side-by-side” visualization of two or more data models.  
o	Similarity visualizations with lines and color shading to represent equivalence, similarity and dissimilarity.
o	Other innovative visualizations to reveal subtle linguistic or semantic aspects of the data.
•	Collaborate.  The ability to harmonize and visualize models with multiple users simultaneously and to jointly create the resultant data model.
•	Create.  The automated ability to extract common data elements across models to produce a new resultant skeleton model that can be further refined by a manual process.
•	Transform.  The ability to map and convert the source data models into the resultant format or other source formats.
•	Export.  The ability to save the resultant data model in multiple representations (the same set of representations available to import).


Responses 
Responses should be identified with an RFI No., and are due by February 28, 2005. Please send a Microsoft word document with your response electronically to MCOE@dhs.gov .

This RFI is for information and planning purposes only and should not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the Government. The Government does not intend to award a cooperative agreement on the basis of responses to this RFI nor otherwise pay for the preparation of any information submitted or for the Government’s use of such information.

<SUBJECT>National Small Arms Center Organization Days'
<DESC>Purpose:A meeting of the National Small Arms Center and Small Arms Technology Consortium is scheduled for March 1st and 2nd at the Hilton Garden Inn, Rockaway, NJ.  The object of this meeting is to explain the scope and nature of the Center's organization and activities-and to discuss the value-added for those opting to join the consortium. Please note: Day one is open to all prospective members. However, the second day is limited to only Consortium members-the OTA and CMA are posted on the NDIA Website www.NDIA.org  for your review (click on Divisions, then Armaments, then Small Arms). This will enable you to join the Consortium on the day one (1March) of the meeting and, you will be able to participate in the second day's meeting.  This second day's meeting has as its object the further amplification of matters related to the recently released project proposal (W15QKN-05-X-0200). Additionally, we will collectively unpack issues pertaining to the organization of the Consortium committees and subcommittees. Lastly, a discussion of requirements and technology needs will flesh out Consortium plans.  The  Consortium is the private sector partner of a National Small Arms Center sponsored by the U.S. Army and other Defense and Government organizations. A major goal of this Consortium and Center is to improve the  U.S. technology base and production base capabilities essential for the sustaining of U.S. military supremacy in research, development, engineering and production of small arms weapons and ammunition.  These include handguns, shoulder-fired weapons, grenade launchers, machine guns, grenade machine guns, and advanced weapons/devices such as lightweight acoustic and directed energy weapons.  Also, small arms ammunition; gun launched and rocket grenades; fire control; embedded computers; power supplies; fuzing; the soldier/gun/vehicle interface and related materials and processes.  Background: The small arms weapons and ammunition technology base and industrial base are in serious jeopardy due to a long period of reduced Defense spending and the restructuring and downsizing of Government, industry and university capabilities.  Conventional small arms weapons and ammunition technologies are core capabilities-those which must be maintained to meet our military needs around the world.  The National Small Arms Center is under the management of the Program Manager for the Joint Services Small Arms Program and is cosponsored by the PEO Soldier; PEO Ammunition; Rock Island (TACOM-RI), the Army Research Laboratory (ARL)  and the Armaments Research and Development Engineering Center (ARDEC).  The other Services and other Government agencies are invited to join the Center by this announcement and separate correspondence.  The management of the Center will be located at Picatinny, NJ although in operation the center is a virtual center that will leverage the assets and capabilities of its Government sponsors and industry and academia partners.  ARDEC serves as the Army's focal point and authority for research, development, test and evaluation of small arms weapons system designs, optimization of lethality, durability, reliability and ease of use; and development and application of computer models and simulations to all aspects of weapons system design.  The sponsors have partnered and continue to partner with a number of universities and private sector companies on many diverse activities in the areas of Small Arms Weapons Systems.  The Army would like to build upon this partnering activity with academia, industry and other profit and non-profit organizations to address the Army's long-range goals in the area of small arms weapons systems. Description. The partnership/consortium will perform research, development and engineering activities-those which address the Army's long-range goals in the areas indicated above.  The role of this consortium is to define collaborative efforts that advance the technology and scientific and engineering skills in the areas that are required to develop, upgrade and produce weapons and ammunition which support the Army's current and future requirements.  The role of the Government will be to directly participate in these collaborative efforts, to provide partial or full funding, and share expertise and facilities.  It is expected that the non-Government collaborators will share in the funding of projects for the National Small Arms Center on a case-by-case basis, contribute their own personnel resources in planning and organizing collaborative efforts and under special instances provide materials, facilities, equipment or instrumentation.The objectives will be accomplished through the use of an "Other Transaction Agreement (OTA)" for prototyping (Section 845 of the 1994 Defense Appropriations Act and amendments) between the Army and the consortium, where each consortium member participates in accordance with a Consortium Member Agreement (CMA).  The CMA will define the purpose, goals and responsibilities of the members including how the members will address intellectual property. The Consortium is organized under the National Cooperative Research and Productive Act of 1993, and amendments; the Attorney General and Federal Trade Commission have been notified of the consortium as required by law and provided copies of the OTA and CMA (March 2004). The consortium will consist of industry (large and small businesses), universities, and non-profit organizations working with PM JSSAP personnel and other Government sponsors utilizing their own facilities or ARDEC laboratories and facilities on a fee for service basis.  The level of funding from the Government is estimated to be $3.0 M - $5.0M in the first year.  The term of the agreement with the government is expected for five years with provisions for renewal. The Consortium is open to new members at all times; and members may withdraw from the Consortium in accordance with the provisions of the CMA. Inasmuch as this consortium is to improve and sustain U.S. military supremacy in the research, development, engineering and production of small arms weapons and ammunition, the Consortium will be open to qualified U.S. and foreign-owned organizations to foster the largest technical impact.  The members may need a Secret clearance to collaborate on certain projects, and will need to comply with U.S. Army Security, safety and environmental requirements and export laws.  There is a preference for the work to be performed in the U.S. whether by U.S. or foreign-owned organizations.  The Center will engage in broad areas of research and development leading to prototypes to include weapon systems,  ammunition, subassemblies such as fire control, fuzing and power supplies, materials and material behavior, coatings, manufacturing science and technology, modeling and simulation and failure analyses.  The Center will also foster specialized education and training as necessary consistent with its  goals.Coordinating Instructions: Please respond to this announcement if you plan to attend the Organization Days. As mentioned above, Day One is open to all members as well as those interested in joining: It is scheduled for March 1, 2005 (1:00 pm to 4:30 pm)  at the Hilton Garden Inn, Rockaway Town Square Mall, Rockaway, NJ - Please respond NLT  February 15, 2005.  Organization Day Two (March 2, 2005-0800 am - 5:00 pm) as indicated above, this meeting is limited to those members who have formally signed the OTA and have been ratified by the NSAC Management Committee-as mentioned above, you will be permitted to join on the first day.  Please advise Barbara J. Byrnes, eme1bmt@aol.com, (703) 212-8030 Ext. 223, or Dr. Stephen C. Small, ssmall@pica.army.mil (973) 724-7043 of your intent to attend one and/or both Organization Days.  Security:These meetings are unclassified.Miscellaneous: The Government will not pay for attendance (approximately $50.00 for meals) nor award a contract based on your submission or attendance.  The purpose of the meeting is twofold: (1.) To update candidate members of the Center on the value thereof, and (2) (for members only) to amplify upon a recently released Request for Project Proposal (RPP), as well as to organize the Consortium committees and subcommittees and to discuss technology needs with the Consortium members.

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.

<DESC>SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION: This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation WILL NOT be issued.  

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS:  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests(OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office(GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award or performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

This acquisition is 100% small business set-aside.  The NAICS is 481212.  The small business sized standard is 1,500 employees.  The contract type will be a firm fixed price contract.

DESCRIPTION OF SERVICE:  The Contractor shall re-fuel Alaska mountain top high sites with propane in the three Areas of Operation (AOR), they are Valdez, Juneau and Kodiak .  This is a high priority U.S. Coast Guard search and rescue system that must be kept operational at all times to protect property and lives.  The National Voice Distress System Radio sites to be fueled are remote sites that are only accessible by helicopter.  There is no road access to any of these sites and the weather conditions can vary considerably in any season.  Typical transportation of propane to these sites usually includes the use of a barge and/or helicopter.  Normally full pickle barrels are transported by barge to a location near the site and then slung to the mountaintop by a helicopter rated for that load carrying capacity.  A fuel mechanic will then remove the barrel from the sling and transfer the propane to the 500 Gallon propane tanks.  This process is repeated until all tanks at a site are at maximum capacity or fuel gauge reads between 80-85%.  A typical tank is filled to maximum capacity between 80-85%.  Fuel quantity estimate is conservative and already adjusted for the seasonal temperature changes and altitude. All sites should be filled to capacity, if fuel is delivered within required timeframes.  The contractor shall provide for all services, materials and equipment, personnel, transportation and propane. Contractor shall record and document actual gallons of propane delivered to each site and tank gauge level percentages after filling.  All documentation will be delivered to the Contracting Officer Technical Representative within one week of work completion.

<DESC>NAVAIR Orlando Training Systems Division (TSD) intends to issue a Cost Type contract for duration of 12 months with LINXX Security Services, 983 Providence Square Shops, Virginia Beach, VA 23464, for the design, development, delivery, and sustainment of Visit Board Search and Seizure (VBSS) training course with applied Combative/Defensive Tactics training.  

This acquisition is being pursued on a sole source basis under the statutory authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304 ( c) (1) as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 6.302-2, “Unusual and Compelling Urgency.”

The VBSS Combative/Defensive Tactics component requires a high level of skill and proficiency in close quarters battle operations in a maritime environment.  LINXX has a credible and established background focusing more on employing and incorporating martial art techniques into tactical military scenarios (to include Close Quarters Battle (CQB), Military Operations on Urbanized Terrain (MOUT), Visit Board Search and Seizure (VBSS), Close Quarter Combat (CQC) Techniques, Tactical Shooting and Boarding Scenarios, Confined Space Takedown Techniques, etc).  They also have an intricate understanding of the tactical employment of hand-to-hand techniques, and how to adopt these techniques to distinctive scenarios and environments.  LINXX has the ability to re-utilize and customize existing training content modules currently being used by other special operations agencies and tailor these existing courses to meet/satisfy the development of the Combative/Defensive Tactics requirement of the VBSS training, allowing for a shorter developmental phase and lowering the cost to the government.

The Government has an immeditate requirement for this curriculum to be ready to train for a 22 February 2005 pilot.   The developed courseware of instruction will be trained to all identified deploying Fleet Navy personnel then supervised/maintained/reevaluated over the course of the period of performance. 

This synopsis is not to be considered a request for quotations or proposals. No solicitation document is available.

I. 	GENERAL SPECIFICATIONS

1.	Scope of Contract.

A.	This work is being solicited to improve habitat for the Red-cockaded Woodpecker (Picoides borealis, herein referred to as RCW), a species federally listed as endangered.  This habitat improvement work will occur on sites presently occupied by RCWs (active clusters), sites presently unoccupied by RCWs (inactive clusters), and forested areas used by the RCW as foraging habitat.  Contactor shall furnish all labor, materials, equipment (including safety equipment), tools, transportation, supervision, and perform all work required to mechanically remove hardwood midstory vegetation on 136.3 acres of pine forest at the Poinsett Electronic Combat Range, South Carolina, in accordance with the specifications and provisions of the contract.

B.	This work is also being solicited to control exotic vegetation and to maintain access trails to permanent monitoring stations/study plots.  Contactor shall furnish all labor, materials, equipment (including safety equipment), tools, transportation, supervision, and perform all work required to mechanically clear a 0.6-acre stand of bamboo and 5 miles of existing access trails at the Poinsett Electronic Combat Range, South Carolina, in accordance with the specifications and provisions of the contract.

2.	Description and Location.  The areas to be treated are within the boundaries of the Poinsett Electronic Combat Range, Sumter County, South Carolina.

A.	The RCW habitat improvement work will occur on seven forested sites with a pine basal area of <100 ft2 per acre and a dominant midstory of oak (Quercus spp.). 

B.	The exotic vegetation work will occur in a dense bamboo stand.  The access trail work will occur at 25 sites that support a mix of pine, hardwood, and herbaceous vegetation.  These trails have been cleared and treated with herbicide in the past, but require periodic maintenance.   

3.	Boundaries.  The boundaries of the sites to be treated will be marked with flagging tape as depicted on a site map, which will be provided.   

4.	Explosive Objects Encountered in Contact with Work Areas.

A.	Although the sites within the project area are not known to contain unexploded ammunition or explosive devices, any military items encountered shall not be disturbed in any manner and their presence shall immediately be brought to the attention of the Endangered Species Biologist.

B.	Any employee or other person working within Poinsett Electronic Combat Range shall have attended a pre-work conference with the Range Operations Officer and the Endangered Species Biologist.

5.	Coordination.  The contractor shall coordinate closely with the Endangered Species Biologist concerning items such as security, access to work sites, work schedules, etc.  The contractor shall notify the Endangered Species Biologist on Thursday prior to each weekend when work is to be performed.  This notification is required so that the Endangered Species Biologist can coordinate with Range Control to schedule the closure of work areas for the safety of the contractor.

6.	Safety and Health.  Contractor shall comply with all applicable requirements in OSHA regulations.

7.	Environmental and Cultural Resources.

A.	Protection of RCW Cavity Trees.  The contractor shall use every precaution necessary to protect RCW cavity trees within the project area.  RCW cavity trees are identified by 1 or 2 white bands painted on the bole approximately 5 feet above the ground.  Equipment and supplies shall not be stored within 200 feet of any RCW cavity tree.  No work shall occur within 200 feet of any RCW cavity tree during the nesting season (1 April – 31 July).  Outside of the nesting season, all work within 200 feet of cavity trees must proceed with minimal delay.  Damage to RCW cavity trees by vehicle, brush cutter or any other means shall not be tolerated.  The contractor shall be assessed $300.00 per skinned or damaged RCW cavity tree.

B.	Erosion Control.  All equipment shall be operated in a manner causing the least possible disturbance to the soil. 

C.	Protection of Streams, Lakes and Reservoirs.  Contractor shall use every precaution necessary to prevent pollution of streams, lakes and reservoirs by fuels, oils, other chemicals, silt or other harmful materials.  All streams will be kept free of contractor-generated debris.

D.	Protection of Archeological/Historical Resources.  The contractor, upon the discovery of suspected archaeological or historical materials, shall cease work in the vicinity of such material and immediately notify the Endangered Species Biologist.

E.	Protection of Soil.  Contractor shall use every precaution necessary to prevent the contamination of soils by the spills of petroleum products (oils and fuels), ethylene glycol (coolant) and other chemicals and harmful materials.  Contractor shall also be responsible for reporting all spills of the aforementioned materials immediately to the Endangered Species Biologist.  
		
II.  TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS

1.	Equipment and Treatments.  All sites shall be treated with heavy-duty brush-cutting machinery that chips and spreads hardwoods and other vegetation.  A minimum of 3 machines operating simultaneously shall be used.  Each machine shall have a cutting width of at least 7 feet, an engine with at least 200 horsepower, and be capable of treating at least 5 acres per day.  Machines with low ground pressure are preferred to reduce soil disturbance.

A.	RCW Habitat Improvement.  Seven sites, totaling 136.3 acres, shall be treated to improve RCW habitat conditions.  Hardwoods £ 9 inches in diameter at breast height shall be knocked to the ground and run over until the remaining stumps and debris are &#8804; 6 inches in height above the ground.  Every effort shall be made by the contractor to avoid damaging RCW cavity trees, other mature pines, and pine regeneration.  

B.	Exotic Vegetation Control and Trail Maintenance.  One 0.6-acre site shall be treated to control exotic vegetation.  All bamboo stems within this site shall be knocked to the ground and run over until the remaining stumps and debris are &#8804; 6 inches in height above the ground.  Five miles of trails shall be cleared to improve access to monitoring stations/study plots.  Each trail shall be 7-feet wide (or the cutting width of the machine if wider than 7 feet).  The vegetation (pine, hardwood, and herbaceous) within each trail shall be knocked to the ground and run over until the remaining stumps and debris are &#8804; 6 inches in height above the ground.     

2.	Work Schedule.  All work shall be completed between 21 March and 31 October 2005.  Work is permitted between 1300 and 1900 hours on Fridays and between 0630 and 1900 hours on Saturdays and Sundays.  Work also may be permitted between 0630 and 1900 hours during the period 26 – 30 September 2005, but this time is subject to change or cancellation depending on the mission needs of the military.  Work during other times may be possible with the approval of the Range Operations Officer and the Endangered Species Biologist.  Personnel must have vacated the property no later than 1900 daily and must notify the Range Control Officer and the Endangered Species Biologist to ensure all gates are closed and locked after the property is vacated.  All equipment shall be removed from the property prior to 1 November 2005.  

III.  INSPECTION AND ACCEPTANCE

Inspection Procedures.  Inspection by the Government of the work performed under this contract
		shall be made as the treatment progresses.  The Endangered Species Biologist will periodically observe the operation to ensure that all of the technical specifications are followed.

IV.  MEASUREMENT AND PAYMENT

1.	Measurement.  The size or length of the treatment sites were determined using a Global Positioning System and are considered accurate.  

2.	Basis for Payment.  Payment will be made at a rate up to but not to exceed unit bid price for the project as satisfactorily completed by the contractor.  Two separate payments will be made to the contractor.  The first payment will be made after 50% of the work has been completed as outlined by the contract and approved by the Endangered Species Biologist.

6 		PROJECT DESCRIPTIONS AND PROFILE

The selected DM Consultant would review a proposal for a Feasibility Study (FS) to expand the Svilosa AD Pulp Mill in Bulgria to produce hardwood and softwood pulp as well as paper.  

Svilosa AD is one of the largest enterprises in the Bulgarian chemical industry.  It is located on the Danube River in the town of Svishtov.  The company has its own port, railway network and railway station equipped with the appropriate facilities necessary for its distribution network.  

At present, Svilosa AD is the only producer of paper grade sulphate bleached hardwood pulp in Bulgaria and the surrounding Balkan region.  There are other pulp manufacturers in the region; however, Svilosa AD uses a chlorine-free “Kraft” mechanism to bleach the pulp, which increases efficiency of the production line, as well as decreasing the environmental impacts of pulp production. The pulp is sold under the registered trademark of SVILOCELL, and is sold to paper mills in Turkey, Greece, Romania, Slovenia, Germany, Austria, Italy, the Czech Republic and the Ukraine.  The company’s full production capacity is 55,000 short fiber pulp tons per year (tpy). 

While Bulgaria has several small pulp manufacturers, none produce finished paper products.  In fact, most paper products for writing and printing in Bulgaria are imported from Greece or Turkey.  Since sulphate bleached hardwood pulp is used in the production of high-grade paper, Svilosa AD believes it would behoove the company to close the technological cycle and begin producing a finished product.  Svilosa AD has performed preliminary appraisals and surveys that indicate the company could increase its capacity to 200,000 tpy and introduce a paper production line with the capacity of approximately 100,000 tpy and gain substantial market share in Bulgaria and possibly the region.

The proposed feasibility study would evaluate possible options for installing the writing and printing paper production line.  The study would evaluate the surrounding terrain, communications, production, capacity, and available equipment to implement the new paper line.  Specifically the study would examine the following: (1) Requirements for additional construction including the possible placement of any new facilities; (2) Assessment of the existing pipelines for pulp slurry, water, steam and cables, and evaluation of the overall capacity to handle increased production; (3) Production capability and choice of most feasible option for production of hardwood and softwood pulp depending on daily consumption of the paper machine; and (4) Assessment of pulp storage tank areas, pulp transportation options and way for delivering pulp directly to paper production line. 

The DM consultant would be required to travel to Bulgaria for up to 4 work days to tour the Svilosa AD facilities and examine the surrounding areas suitable for the expansion project.  The DM consultant would also be required to spend at least one day in Sofia to review any other projects that may be identified prior to DM travel, and also to brief the U.S. Embassy in Sofia.  (At present the Svilosa AD proposal is the only proposal for review under this DM.)  This DM requires expertise in the production of sulphate bleached kraft pulp and the production of finished high-grade paper.  The consultant must be familiar with pulp and paper production equipment, international environmental standards and regulations relating to paper production facilities, and overall facility maintenance requirements.  The consultant must be qualified to evaluate the economic, financial and technical viability of the proposed project.
