<DESC>Container Security & Chemical Biological Programs for U.S. Customs & Border Protection (CPB).  CBP will be awarded a contract to Johns Hopkins University (JHU), Applied Physical Laboratory (APL) to perform and conduct independent tests and evaluations of advanced container security technologies and to conduct independent tests, evaluations and deployments of chemical and biological sensor systems.  JHU was selected to maintain and essential engineering, research or development capability (41 USC 253(c)(3).  JHU has closely supported CBP' chemical and biological program, including the test and evaluation of chem/bio sensors at border crossings.  As part of this acquisition, JHU has developed the existing test cell for COTS/GOTS sensors, which CPB currently own to initiate tests against known backgrounds at CBP sites.  JHU/APL is a not-for-profit research and development organization dedicated to solving critical challenges to the nation that acts in the role of the independent trusted agent for various DOD, DOT, NASA and other federal sponsors.  JHU/APL has unparalleled knowledge and experience with these systems and are uniquely qualified to support CBP in the testing, evaluation and deployment of chemical and biological sensor systems.  Because of JHU/APL's unique knowledge and capabilities; ownership of the intellectual property for the environment test cell, and extensive experience (over 10 years) in related work, it is recommended that a non-competitive contract be awardd to JHU to maintain this essential engineering, research and development capability.

<SOLNBR>DE-RP05-04OR23075
<CONTACT>Darlene Ahlers, Contracting Officer, 865-241-0687, ahlersdd@oro.doe.gov;Darlene Ahlers, Contract Specialist, 865-241-0687, ahlersdd@oro.doe.gov
<DESC>The mission of the Nuclear Physics program is to foster fundamental research in nuclear physics that will provide new insights; advance our knowledge on the nature of matter and energy; and develop the scientific knowledge, technologies, and trained manpower that are needed to underpin the Department of Energy's missions for nuclear-related national security, energy, and environmental quality. To accomplish this mission, the Nuclear Physics program proposes to construct the Rare Isotope Accelerator (RIA) facility as a national priority.  This facility would provide intense beams of rare isotopes (i.e. short-lived radioactive nuclei not normally found on earth) for a wide variety of studies in nuclear structure, nuclear astrophysics, and fundamental interactions. RIA would allow the Nuclear Physics program to achieve its goals in major scientific thrusts of basic nuclear physics research.  These major scientific thrusts are identified in five scientific questions articulated in the Department of Energy/National Science Foundation Nuclear Science Advisory Committee's 2002 Long-Range Plan for Nuclear Science.  RIA directly responds to three of the five questions, namely: "What is the structure of nucleonic matter," "What is the nuclear microphysics of the universe," and "Is there new physics beyond the Standard Model?" The proposed RIA facility would embody the best features of both in-flight and isotope-separation-on-line (ISOL) techniques and provide both re-accelerated and fast beams.  It is envisioned that the proposed RIA would be driven by a highly flexible superconducting linear accelerator (linac), which would provide a high-power, 400 MeV/nucleon beam of any stable isotope from hydrogen to uranium onto production targets.  The broad assortment of short-lived secondary beams needed for the experimental program would be variously produced by the most effective combination of a number of techniques: projectile fragmentation, target fragmentation, fission, and spallation.  After separation, the selected rare isotopes would, in many instances, be accelerated and directed to fixed-target experiments.  Experiments with stopped and trapped isotopes would also make up a major component of the scientific program. The RIA facility would also include several experimental areas and a suite of instrumentation that would allow the community of facility users to perform the forefront experiments needed to shed light on the most important scientific issues. The ultimate objective is to provide a unique research facility that will fully exploit the scientific potential of RIA, as a research tool, in support of the national objectives embodied in the DOE mission and assigned to the Office of Science.  To reach this objective, DOE will select the organization judged best able to:  i) operate and manage RIA as a national user facility and maximize its research, educational and related benefits for the Nation; ii) provide a site suitable to be considered the preferred site;  and iii) lead the design, construction, and commissioning of RIA.  The contractual relationship between DOE and the entity will be a DOE Management & Operation (M&O) contract. Selecting the M&O contractor with the capabilities described above will provide a preferred site linked to a contractor capable of leading the effort to design the scientific features and infrastructure that, in turn, drives the requirements for the associated civil works of the total facility. The selection of a site will not be considered final until the NEPA process is completed, a record of decision is issued, and, in the event a non-FFRDC is selected, the new site will be established as a FFRDC.  To maximize the fairness, no offeror will be allowed to use Federal funds to prepare their proposal in response to the request for proposal.

<DESC>The Air Armament Center (AAC) 46th Test Wing Commander plans to contract for unique, specialized hardware and software and/or prototype systems to develop and/or modify/improve Eglin Range Complex facilities and infrastructure urgently required for test/training and evaluation of C4I and Munitions systems.  General areas of work on this contract will include design, development, test, modification, installation, training, and/or transition support.  This is a delivery order, Cost Plus Fixed Fee, Cost Reimbursable, and Firm Fixed Price contract and each delivery order is competed amongst all awardees.  The contract will require rapid response (technical and cost proposals within 10 days) to support urgent requirements including the following:  (1)  Test Capability Enhancements involving systems analysis, systems engineering, design, development, fabrication, calibration, integration of test instrumentation including hardware and software, test facility design and characterization, and requirements verification;  (2)  Software Development involving computational modeling/simulation, accreditation, and database design;  (3)  On-site Test and Evaluation Support including planning, execution, data reduction, analysis, technical support, test facility verification, and training; (4)  Munitions relating to guidance and control/aiming systems, aircraft compatibility/interface, flight test analysis, lethality, countermeasures/counter-countermeasures, electromagnetic interference/ electromagnetic compatibility (EMI/EMC), target signatures, warheads, munitions effectiveness, system performance, non-cooperative target scoring, and survivability; and  (5)  C4I relating to command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance, networking, management information systems, information warfare, system security and vulnerability, and system performance.  A subcontract management plan will be required to ensure the contractor has an established capability to successfully accomplish 5-25 delivery orders concurrently.  AAC/PKZ plans to award two contracts but reserves the right to award more than 2 or less.  Each contract will be of an approximate duration of 5 years.  A draft Request for Proposal (RFP) was released on 21 Apr 04.  The formal RFP is scheduled for release in the last week of Jun 04.  Contract awards are planned for the 1st Quarter FY 05.  Information associated with this program may be classified up to, and including, TOP SECRET/SCI.  Additionally, all potential contractors will be required to obtain export control certification from the Defense Logistic Service Center (DLSC), Battle Creek, MI 49016-3412 (1-900-353-3572) in accordance with DOD 5320.25 prior to being provided any additional technical data from the technical library and access to other unclassified data that is not released in the RFP.  Certification is accomplished using DD Form 2345, “Militarily Critical Technical Data Agreement”.  This requirement for DD Form 2345 certification also applies to any subcontractors being given access to reproduced data by another contractor.  Material developed under this program will be considered non-proprietary and may be used by the Government under other contracted programs.  This effort will contain an organizational conflict of interest clause.  The clause will state that a contractor delivering a prototype in response to requirements of this contract will be excluded from follow-on production.  Developers of equipment to be evaluated by Eglin Munitions and C4I test resources in order to proceed into production shall be excluded from competition for this effort.    A source list, based on responses from the sources sought synopsis issued 5 Nov 03 was published in FedBizOpps and has been updated periodically.  Firms already on the source list need not respond.  The source list is for informational purposes only and no RFPs will be issued to firms named on the list.  The RFP will be posted in FedBizOpps and must be retrieved there by interested firms. Acknowledgment of receipt of responses will not be made.  The NAICS Code for this effort is 334511.  The small business size standard is 750 employees.  See Numbered Notes 2 and 26.

Description:  The Department of Defense Dependent Schools Europe (DoDDS-E) Information Technology Division has a need for Information Technology Services covering Customer Support Help Desk; On-Site Desktop support; System Administrator Support; Network Administrator Support; Database Administrator Support; Software Systems Development Support; Project Management Support; and Application Program Analyst Support.  DoDDS-E operates 110 elementary and secondary schools for children of U.S. military members and Government civilian employees stationed in Bahrain, Belgium, England, Germany, Iceland, Italy, Netherlands, Portugal, Spain and Turkey.  DoDDS-E has installed a modern technical infrastructure that connects all classrooms and administrative offices to the DoDDS-E private network.   The private network supports HTML filters, SPAM filters, cache engines, intrusion detection, access control, and firewall protection to the Internet.  Internet service is commercially provided through privately leased communication lines.  DoDDS-E leases over 18,000 workstations distributed throughout its schools—all covered under extended warranty.  The workstations are leased with the Microsoft Windows 2000 Professional operating system and the Microsoft Office Professional suite.  All schools and offices have campus area networks (CAN) interconnected with fiber optic cable, both single and multimode.  Each CAN supports network speeds of 100 mbps (FDDI) or 1000 mbps (Gigabit) and uses Category 5 cabling to support workstation access.  In some community locations, where several schools and administrative offices are located in close proximity, fiber optic cable has been installed to connect those sites. Schools use a variety of instructional methods and rely on several computers in each classroom.  Each school consists of at least one fully equipped lab of computers (25-30 ea) as well as computers in commonly used Information Centers.  Some of the larger schools may have several computer labs to support various instructional programs.

     All schools have access to a global electronic mail system, Microsoft Exchange.  The Email system consists of approximately 20,000 entries in the global directory.  There are approximately 6000 mailbox entries for DoDDS-E and is consistent with assigned staff.  Students are not permitted to use the corporate email system and are supported separately.  DoDDS-E will begin supporting student email accounts on the commercial GAGGLE.NET system platform in September 2004.

     All schools use locally available file and print servers that are configured with the Novell Netware Operating System, Version 6.  DoDDS-E is planning a migration from Novell Netware to Microsoft Server 2003.  The migration is scheduled to begin in June 2004 and be fully completed by January 2005.  This migration will provide the DoDEA organization with a global Active Directory infrastructure.  The implementation will provide new server hardware and a standard configuration to all schools.

     The primary network management functions are located at Headquarters DoDDS-E in Wiesbaden, Germany.  Some network administrative staff are located at other locations throughout DoDDS-E.  Field level staffs identify and coordinate change management support requirements for the network infrastructure.

    The planned contract type is firm fixed price, indefinite quantity type with a base year and four (4) option years.  Contract start is projected on 1 Nov 04.  The procurement will be conducted under full and open, unrestricted competition basis.  Award will be made using FAR Part 15.101-2 “Lowest price technically acceptable source selection process.”  The solicitation will be made available on or about 6 Jul 04.  Interested parties may access the solicitation at http://www.eps.gov or via e-mail from the points of contact below using a read only Adobe Acrobat 5.0 PDF format.

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division Lakehurst, NJ intends to enter into negotiations on a non-competitive basis with Teradyne for modification and delivery of four (4) preproduction modified Teradyne GDS3100 Diagnostic Tablet Tester units.  Teradyne will modify their GDS3100 unit by adding the Teradyne Bi4 Series Bus Test Instrument (BTI) and the Teradyne GNA-620 communication gateway and any/all cabling necessary to provide the Navy with bus emulation support for standard avionics busses 1553, 429, 232, 422 and 485 and other serial data buses as a means to aid the Fleet maintainer in collection of Built-In-Test (CIT) data, verifying mission profile data and interfacing with the standard communication busses.  The modified GDS3100 will execute diagnostic routines under the direction of an Interactive Electronic Technical Manual (ITEM).  The modified GDS3100 will include source and measurement functions and be able to upload/download updates to ITEMs.  Modification to the GDS3100 with the Teradyne Bi4 and GNA-620 communication gateway will provide the Navy with the required avionics standard communication buss interface.  The modified Teradyne GDS3100 Diagnostic Tablet Tester will fill the Navy’s avionic platforms’ need of a commercial “man-portable” integrated diagnostic tester to provide a wide range of maintenance applications incuding fault diagnostics, data recording, integrated technical manual display utilities and traditional diagnostic debugging tools.  The government does not own data, drawings, software code or other specifications to permit full and open competition.  All responsible sources are encouraged to submit a proposal which may be used by the government in determining whether or not to conduct a competitive procurement.  Responses should reference N68335-04-R-0122.  A determination by the government not to open the requirement to competition based on the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.  No solicitation will be available for this procurement.

<DESC>The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) supports research related to basic understanding of microbiology and immunology leading to the development of vaccines and novel therapeutic agents for the prevention and treatment of infectious and immune-mediated diseases, and improvements in public health.  As a part of the research program to improve defense against bioterrorism and emerging/re-emerging infectious diseases, the NIAID seeks to establish an Administrative Center in support of the NIAID Proteomics Research Program, being solicited under a separate RFP (see RFP NIH-NIAID-DMID-03-38).  The Proteomics Research Program shall focus on early stage basic research for target discovery and identification and early validation studies.  The subject solicitation is being issued as a 100% SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE.  The applicable NAICS code is 541710 with a size standard of 500 employees.  See Government-wide Numbered Note 1.  As assistance to the Proteomics Research Program, the Administrative Center will: 1) Design, develop, and maintain a publicly accessible website that contains the data and technology protocols generated by each Proteomics Research site, as well as a catalog of reagents and products developed by the sites and available for public distribution; 2) Monitor and facilitate the deposition of reagents and protein targets generated by the Proteomics Research sites.

<CONTACT>Lynn Montalvo, Contracting Officer, Phone 301 496-6546, Fax 301 402-0642, Email MONTALVL@mail.nlm.nih. - Karen Riggs, Contracting Officer, Phone 301 496-6546, Fax 301 402-0642, Email kr33v@nih.gov
<DESC>It is the intent of the Center for Information Technology (CIT), National Institutes of Health (NIH), to acquire on a sole-source basis pursuant to FAR 6.302-1 and 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) a Procurement Services Provider (PSP) Agreement from IntraMalls LLC; 120 Cockeysville Road, Suite 204; Hunt Valley, Maryland 21030, for CIT to use the NIH IntraMall and provide the opportunity to extend the IntraMalls program to other agencies.  The NIH IntraMall represents an innovative, full-service acquisition system that harnesses the power of the Internet to streamline the Federal procurement process for the NIH scientific community.  This pioneering e-commerce acquisition system provides product information, on-line ordering, and sophisticated accounting and budget functions that are all customized for the Federal acquisition community.  The NIH IntraMall is able to satisfy the researcher’s equipment and supply needs while saving time and money with every purchase transaction.  Having been tested and implemented for use in 1998, the NIH IntraMall is currently being used by approximately 13 NIH Institutes/Centers (ICs).  Growth of vendors and products offered by the NIH IntraMall has been considerable, with over 150 vendors and over three million catalogue items currently included.  The NIH IntraMall program has empowered the NIH scientific community to exert direct control over purchases of needed supplies and equipment with a substantial decrease in the administrative processing costs per purchase transaction.  The NIH has partnered with IntraMalls, LLC since 1996 to develop and expand the NIH IntraMall software platform, making it a model for digital end-to-end e-commerce by integrating procurement card-based purchasing and seamless transaction information between buyers and sellers.  The NIH IntraMall includes the following features:  electronic ordering, payment, and automated record keeping; a revolutionary automated reconciliation module; and the integration of each purchase transaction to the NIH legacy accounting system (the NIH Administrative Data Base).  Services provided by the NIH IntraMall software platform developed by IntraMalls LLC include hosting and maintenance of supplier catalogues, online shopping and transaction processing, automated purchase order/funds reconciliation, ad-hoc reporting, and toll-free customer support.  Representing a business-to-government (B2G) solution, the NIH IntraMall program has essentially converted supplier catalogues into convenient procurement vehicles, and performs more efficient managed procurement support services that has enabled NIH to reduce its cost of procurement.  Within the IntraMalls LLC software functionality, the process of procuring through the NIH IntraMall is defined as end-to-end, beginning with comparative shopping and ending with receipt, payment and reconciliation.  The software functionality transcends e-catalog connectivity by tightly integrating shopping and requisitions with the order and payment processing services necessary to fulfill audit purposes.  CIT has a need to establish a Procurement Services Provider (PSP) Agreement with IntraMalls LLC to allow CIT to acquire the same end-to-end, web-based vendor catalogue, order delivery and account reconciliation system services currently being used by other NIH ICs, or to extend the IntraMall program to other agencies.  Specifically, the services will include (1) access to over three million catalogue items from over 150 existing vendors; (2) standardized, searchable electronic catalogues comprised of scientific, office and computer equipment and supplies; (3) catalogue descriptions that include NIH-specific pricing and financial classification codes; (4) complete vendor support including enrollment, training and catalogue formatting services; (5) management of user profile data including purchase card and shipping location data; (6) automated order delivery system for interactive communications and order monitoring; (7) custom built interface for delivery of transaction and billing data directly into the NIH accounting system; including an automated reconciliation function; (8) toll free help desk for users and vendors; and (9) activity reporting for users and NIH IC management.  The software platform used to operate the NIH IntraMall program was developed by and is proprietary to IntraMalls LLC.  The software functionalities provided by IntraMalls LLC in its Procurement Services Provider (PSP) Agreement are unique in their ability to meet all current Federal and NIH documentation requirements for purchase card transactions.  Additionally, IntraMalls LLC’s proprietary software is the only source that provides the ability to integrate purchase transactions from the NIH IntraMall into the existing NIH accounting system (an internally programmed legacy system).  Because of the characteristics of the NIH legacy accounting system and IntraMall LLC’s proprietary ownership of the software integration solution, building a new interface to another e-commerce platform would require a substantial investment of time and effort that would simply duplicate what has been achieved by NIH to date in partnership with IntraMalls LLC.  Additionally, NIH is in the process of replacing its legacy accounting system within the next 24-36 months; therefore, making an additional investment in the legacy system is impractical.  Duplicating the unique software functionalities available from IntraMalls LLC’s proprietary Procurement Services Provider (PSP) Agreement would not be financially prudent.  Finally, if NIH were to compete for a new integration effort, it would immediately lose the important benefits of (1) CIT’s use of the existing NIH IntraMall solution and its labor-saving features developed by IntraMalls LLC; e.g., automated transactions and billing data reconciliations; and (2) the opportunity to extend the IntraMalls program to other agencies.  The proposed acquisition will be procured under FAR Part 12 – Acquisition of Commercial Items.  The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. This is not a Request for Quotations (RFQ).   However, all interested parties may request an RFQ by contacting Lynn Montalvo Furtaw at 301-496-6546.   Sources interested in responding to the RFQ must be able to provide convincing evidence that they possess the requisite expertise and experience to successfully perform the services as specified above and in the RFQ.  Responses must be in writing and must be received in the office within fifteen (15) calendar days from the publication date of this notice.  Proposals must include pricing information.  All responses received in a timely manner will be considered by the Government. This requirement is being processed for CIT by NIH’s National Library of Medicine (NLM).  NLM Synopsis No. NLM 04-143/LMF shall be cited on all correspondence regarding this announcement.  Inquires regarding this procurement may be made to Lynn Montalvo Furtaw on 301-496-6546 or by email at: montalvl@mail.nlm.nih.gov.

<DESC>NASA/JSC has a requirement for a 880 Ton Plate Press and components. NASA/JSC intends to purchase the items from Rockland Research Corporation.  The Rockland Research temperature and pressure controllers uniquely match the needs of NASA-JSC.  The Rockland Research temperature and pressure control system uses a 48/12 Volt transformer step down configuration that is unavailable from other companies.  This capability will allow research to be carried out with both graphite and Re foil furnaces (12 Volt) as well as lanthanum chronite furnaces (48 volt).	The pressure control system allows the user to gradually ramp pressure from ambient conditions to run conditions, as well as back down, both at very slow ramp rates that are necessary to maintain the integrity and lifetime of the tungsten carbide pressure anvils.  The Rockland Walker multi-anvil module is able to generate pressures between 30 and 300 kilobars, equivalent to the pressure range defined by the center of the Moon to the core-mantle boundary of Mars. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on July 9, 2004.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

This office is requesting quotes on the following items:   0001 Provide all required and necessary software and data management  services to complete assessment requirement for the Reading First Program  in accordance with the following Scope of Work:   BACKGROUND:  The Bureau  of Indian Affairs (BIA), Office of Indian Education Programs (OIEP) serves  as a state education agency (SEA) for 184 elementary and secondary schools  and dormitories serving approximately 50,000 students located in 23 states  on 63 American Indian reservations. The BIA was awarded a Reading First  grant from the United States Department of Education in September of 2003.   The purpose of the Reading First program is to “establish reading  programs for students in kindergarten through grade 3 that are based on  scientifically based reading research, to ensure that every student can  read at grade level or above not later than the end of grade 3.”   Twenty-four sites have been awarded subgrants through a competitive  process to implement a K-3 reading program based on the scientifically  based research components of reading instruction including the use of  scientifically researched based reading assessments.  The BIA’s grant  identifies the Dynamic Indicators of Basic Early Literacy Skills (DIBELS)  as the assessment to be used in all Reading First classrooms.  The scope  of work calls for the purchase of technology that allows for the  traditional paper-based administration of DIBELS to move to a handheld  device that can then “sync” data to the Web.  Data must “sync” to a secure  Website, where data analysis and reporting functions can occur.  In  addition, the scope of work calls for professional development for staff  from the 24 Reading First sites and on-site implementation services for  initiation of the project. OBJECTIVES:   1.

RESPONSIBILITIES OF PROVIDER:  1.  Provide software  for hand held devices that will allow the administration of DIBELS to be  done electronically.  2.  Install software on individual hand held devices  provided by the individual school sites.  3.  Provide certified  implementation services on-site at the 24 locations to allow for the data  to be hot “synched” to the Web based data system.  4.  Provide data  management, analysis and reporting functions on all DIBELS data submitted  by schools.  5.  Provide professional development for staff from the 24  sites.  6.

<DESC>The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) intends to award on a sole source basis, under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures, a firm fixed award to the University of North Texas Health Science Center, 3500 Camp Bowie Blvd., Fort Worth, Texas 76107.  The University of North Texas Health Science Center will implement a community-based obesity self-management education intervention program for use in the Hispanic American community in Fort Worth, Texas.  Approximately 250 persons will participant in the project.  The project will target Hispanic Americans ages 25 to 65 years who are obese or at risk for developing obesity.
The goal of this procurement is to develop an understanding of the effectiveness of a community-based obesity self-management education intervention with members of the Hispanic American community. According to the literature, such programs have been shown to be generally effective, but depend upon collaborative models of care.  The objectives of the contract are to: 1) determine the knowledge of Hispanic Americans about obesity, 2) provide information about  obesity, 3) discuss the factors contributing to the development of obesity, 3) describe strategies for self management and preventing obesity, 4) describe strategies for preventing complications of obesity, and 5) measure the impact of the project by developing a follow-up evaluation at 3 and 6 months after the intervention to determine their progress on the participant’s behavior associated with addressing obesity.  The program will include features that allow for an evaluation that determines  (but is not necessarily limited to) retention of information received during the education component of the program and adherence to guidelines as presented in the education component of the program.  This education outreach project is a one-arm intervention trial with a six-month follow-up period in 250 overweight or obese Hispanic individuals.  All participants will receive the intervention that will consist in three weekly educational sessions.  The success of the intervention will be evaluated by comparing the baseline assessment (before) and three and six months after the intervention, the participants’ body mass index, blood pressure, depression index, and the attitudes, knowledge and behaviors associated with obesity.  The results will be compared to published literature reporting similar studies. One goal of CMS’ Minority Health Initiatives is to strengthen the presence of minority institutions in the delivery and evaluation of health care provided to minority populations. Thus, the proposed action is consistent with the Hispanic Executive Order 13230, signed on October 12, 2001 establishing the President's Advisory Commission on Educational Excellence for Hispanic Americans.  With strong ties to the target communities, the Council of Latino Agencies is in a position to direct culturally appropriate interventions at multiple layers of the program. The University of North Texas, Health Science Center, School of Public Health has the capacity 
to conduct health services research and programs such as the one envisioned here. Making the award to this HSI affords the agency the maximum flexibility in terms of the appropriate number 
and location of sites. Making the award to a single entity also reduces the fixed costs associated with the program design phase of the project. Therefore, a noncompetitive purchase order 
is justifiable for an award to The University of North Texas, Health Science Center, School of Public Health as a HSI contractor to develop a community-based diabetes self management education program for use in the Hispanic American community.
A major factor for the sole source justification is that this contractor is addressing a health area that CMS is concern about. The University of North Texas Health Science Center is one of the nation's distinguished academic medical centers dedicated to the advancement of all three disciplines of medical science education, research and patient care.  The UNTHSC consists of three major institutions - Texas College of Osteopathic Medicine (D.O. and PA degrees), the Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences (M.S. and Ph.D. degrees) and the School of Public Health (MPH and Dr.P.H degrees) - with a combined faculty of more than 200, a staff of 900, and a cadre of some 400 community physicians and adjunct professors.   Total enrollment for the Health Science Center in the spring of 2002 is 826 students.  All responsible sources may submit capability statements in consideration to the Agency at the above address.

A noncompetitive purchase order is justifiable for The Council of Latino Agencies (CLA) as the contractor to develop and conduct the immunization project in the District of Columbia. The Council of Latino Agencies (CLA) is a nonprofit membership organization whose mission is to support and promote its members for the betterment of the community and to act as a voice of the Hispanic community in the District of Columbia.  As the coordinator of the Hispanic Seniors Immunization Project, CLA will provide experienced bilingual personnel skilled in research, writing, training and grassroots education, and organizational coordination.  For over 25 years, the Council has provided vital assistance to grassroots organizations while advocating for increased support for community-based efforts to improve the social and economic conditions of Washington-area Hispanics.  The Council currently comprises 41 multi-cultural organizations, forming a network of service providers to the Washington metropolitan area’s 400,000 Hispanics.  The Council also works in collaboration with numerous Hispanic and non-Hispanic leaders, advocates, universities and organizations throughout the metropolitan area on issues of mutual concern.  All responsible sources may submit capability statements in consideration to the Agency at the above address.

<DESC>It is the intent of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to negotiate, on a sole-source basis pursuant authority of 10 USC 2304(c) (1), as set forth in FAR 6.302-1 (b)(1)(ii)(2) entitled, “Only One Responsible Source and no other Supply or service will satisfy the Agency Requirements.”   The USCG will issue a one-year task order with a one year option to Global Computer Enterprises, a small business.  Global Computer Enterprises is the current contractor providing maintenance of the US Coast Guard’s Oracle Financial System (CGOF).   The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) had KPMG performed an audit on the USCG Financial Systems.  This effort is in support of the remediation of their findings. The USCG has created a backlog of System Problem Reports (SPRs) that needs to be resolved expediently.  To resolve these findings in a timely manner, the USCG will need to add additional staff to reduce the backlog of SPRs identified during the audit. The current contractor has considerable knowledge of the CGOF system and this will save the Government in technical, cost, and time efficiencies.  NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENT IS AVAILABLE.  The USCG will consider all affirmative responses received no later than 2:00 PM EDT, on July 16, 2004.  Affirmative responses shall be accompanied by sufficient documentation to clearly show the ability to provide the required services at terms more advantageous to the Government.  Request for more information or a copy of the solicitation will not be considered affirmative responses.  If no affirmative response is received that clearly demonstrates the ability to meet all requirements and that it is more advantageous to the Government, a sole-source award will be made to Global Computer Enterprises.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) intends to negotiate a sole source delivery order with Chadwick-Helmuth, a business unit of Honeywell International, Inc., El Monte, CA  91731-1211, for the acquisition of eighteen (18) Vibration Analyzers for use with E-2 and C-2 aircraft equipped with NP2000 propeller systems, with an option for an additional seven (7) units.  Based on the results of an industry-wide market survey performed by Hamilton Sundstrand, the manufacturer of the NP2000 propeller, the Chadwick Helmuth vibration analyzer emerged as the only vibration analyzer that met all of the Government’s technical and delivery requirements.  The purpose of the vibration analyzer is to achieve and maintain installed performance vibration tolerances  and to achieve reduction in USN organizational level maintenance and Aviation Depot Level Repair (AVDLR) cost of the E-2 and C-2 propeller systems.  Chadwick-Helmuth is the designer, developer, and sole manufacturer of the selected vibration analyzer for the NP2000 propellers and is the only source that can provide these vibration analyzers to meet USN and FMS requirements within the time required.  See Note 22.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>Defense Contracting Command-Washington (DCC-W) on behalf of the Office of the Secretary of Defense, Per Diem, Travel, Transportation and Allowance Committee is seeking contractor support to obtain detailed local market cost data for numerous location s in the United States to support this allowance.  Section 403B to Title 37, U.S. Code allows the Secretary of Defense to pay a cost-of-living allowance to Service members in high cost areas in the continental United States.  DCC-W intends to award a comme rcial contract under FAR Part 12 under a full and open competition to secure the services of a contractor for support to obtain detailed local market cost data for numerous locations in the United States to allow the Secretary of Defense to pay a cost-of-l iving allowance to Service members in high cost areas in the continental United States IAW Section 403B to Title 37, U.S. Code.   The CONUS COLA Program focuses on non-housing cost-of-living data.  For the contract, the company must have long-term in-depth  expertise in providing data related to non-housing cost-of-living, especially in generating median city indexes and aggregations.  An expected turn around time is normally 30 days to collect and provide requested data for up to 500 locations simultaneousl y.  The company must already be providing this in-depth capability to its other customers.  The contract shall provide current off-the-shelf non-housing cost-of-living data to a wide and sophisticated customer base.  The law governing this program requires  an index developed in the private sector, i.e., civilian, rather than military.  Therefore, a firm is being sought that is able to develop data  in-house with customers  with similar requirements to the USG.  USG generated data (for example, Bureau of Lab or Statistics) will be rejected.   The period of performance is one (1) year with four (4) option years. Questions relative to this procurement received after 8 Jul 04 will not be accepted. Contact Point, Mr. Ken Kitahara, Contract Specialst, (703) 695-256 3, Mr. Harry Shatto, Contracting Officer, (703) 614-4579.  The RFP will be available on or about 1 Jul 04 and will be available on DCC-WÃ¢Â€Â˜s homepage: http://dccw.hqda.pentagon.mil/services/RFP1.asp

<CONTACT>Paulette Wilson, (757) 878-2788
<DESC>The Aviation Applied Technology (AATD), U.S. Army Aviation and Missile Research, Development and Engineering Center, Fort Eustis, Virginia, has a competitive requirement for the design, development, analysis, documentation, and fabrication of two (2)  structural test articles and one (1) prototype shipset of the Lightweight Armament Support Structure (LASS) .  The requirement includes optional production LASS shipsets with minimum quantity of 22 and maximum quantity of 32.  The LASS will  replace the E xternal Fuel System (EFS) Ã¢Â€Âœstub wingsÃ¢Â€Â on the MH-60L Integrated Defensive Armed Penetrator (IDAP).  The goal of the program is to reduce weight on the fleet of MH-60L IDAP helicopters.  Currently, the EFS Ã¢Â€Âœstub wingsÃ¢Â€Â provide the most l ikely source of significant weight reduction on the aircraft.  The EFS are shortened, single-store-station versions of the External Stores Support Systems (ESSS), which were originally designed to support over 3200 pounds on the inboard stores station and almost 1700 pounds on the outboard stores station at the same time. Due to changes in mission and equipment over time, the EFS now does not support fuel at all and the heaviest load is expected to be less than 700 pounds.  It is expected that a redesign of  the EFS will result in a weight savings of 60-70% of the main support structure, equating to a savings of approximately 200 pounds per shipset. The specification document for this acquisition may be viewed at the following website: http://www.aatd.eustis. army.mil/Transfer/LASS_Specification.doc.  The successful offeror will be required to generate technical data whose export is restricted by the Arms Export Control Act (Title 22, USC., SEC 2751 ET SEQ).  The procurement is 100% setaside for small business concerns.  Award will be a single firm-fixed-price contract with option (s).  The non-recurring development/ engineering base effort period of performance is 10 months.  The anticipated optional production delivery schedule is up to 24 months after option exercise (based on 32 shipsets) with accelerated delivery desired.  The anticipated award date is 4 November 2004.  A solicitation will be issued on 15 July 2004 and the closing date will be on 26 August 2004.  The applicable North American Industrial classification System (NIACS) code is 336413 and the size standard is 1,000.  The Government does not intend to a cquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which shall be considered by the agency.  Notes:  1 and 26 apply.

<SOLNBR>W912BU-04-R-0022
<RESPDATE>082604

<CONTACT>Jennifer McGivern, 215-656-6773
<DESC>This procurement consists of one solicitation with the intent of awarding up to eight (8) firm fixed price Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Multiple Award Task Order Contracts (MATOCs) for Design-Build Plus services for a broad range of  various military facilities, primarily in support of the Air Mobility Command and other DoD agencies (military and civilian) to be used CONUS, Hawaii and Alaska. The anticipated contracts will be firm fixed price and work performed will be primarily desig n and construction of military facilities such as administrative, training, operations and recreation under the NAICS code 2365220, Commercial and Industrial Building Construction (small business size standard of $28.5 million).  It is the Governments inte nt to issue one solicitation for award of up to eight (8) contracts (three (3) HubZone and five (5) unrestricted) creating two separate multiple award contractor pools.  HubZone Small businesses can compete for the unrestricted awards and be considered for  more than one category.  Contractor may not receive more than one award.  HubZone small business must provide a copy of their HubZone certification. As part of the evaluation process, all offerors must show proof of their bonding capacity.  Bonding limits  are as follows:  Unrestricted:  Single Task order $80,000,000.00 and concurrent task order $250,000,000.00; and HubZone:  Single Task Order $40,000,000.00 and concurrent task order $100,000,000.00.  If the offeror cannot demonstrate sufficient bonding cap acity as described above, your proposal will not be considered. Each contract awarded as a result of this solicitation will include a base period of 24 months and three 1-year option periods; for a total contract duration not to exceed 60 months.  Anticipa ted program ceiling for this acquisition is $5 B ($4.7B unrestricted and $300,000,000.000 HubZone). Total dollar value of all task orders placed on all contracts awarded will not exceed the total program value for each contractor pool. To preclude the need  to resolicit, if three contracts cannot be awarded to HubZone firms, the total combined contract capacity of $5B will be distributed by one, or a combination of two methods:  (1) equally distributed to the five successful unrestricted contractors, or (2) make an additional competitive award to a sixth unrestricted contractor.  The task order limitations are as follows:  Unrestricted:  $10,000.00 minimum and $80,000,000.00 maximum; HubZone:  $10,000.00 minimum and $40,000,000.00 maximum.  The guaranteed min imum for each contract is $10,000.00, which may be met by award of a task order in an equivalent amount.  Each contract will remain active:  (1) unless the contractor performs unsatisfactorily on a task order; (2) until contract expiration, (3) until task order completion; or (4) until the total contract capacity limit is reached.  It is anticipated that any remaining capacity for awarded contracts with documented unsatisfactory performance may be distributed among the remaining contractors with a record of  satisfactory performance.  For estimating purposes only, each of the five (5) unrestricted contractors estimated maximum per one-year contract is $940,000,000.00, and each of the HubZone competitive contractors estimated maximum per one year contract peri od is $100,000,000.00.  However, each unrestricted contractor has the opportunity to receive award amounts up to the estimated unrestricted total of $4.7B.  Likewise each HubZone competitive contractor has the opportunity to receive awards up to the estima ted HubZone total contract capacity of $300,000,000.00.  After award of the contracts, unrestricted contractors will not compete with the HubZone contractors for award of individual task orders.  In determining which contractor pool to solicit for a given task order requirement, consideration may be given to (1) complexity of the work, (2) past performance of the contractor, (3) contract task order limitation, (4 ) on-going work, (5) bonding capacity and any other task order specific requirement.  The Government reserves the right to exceed the stated maximum task order limitation.  Awards will be made using best value source selection procedures. The Government wi ll award the contracts resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offerors whose proposals, conforming to the RFP will be the Best Value to the Government.  Best Value will be determined using a Trade offÃ¢Â€Â process, comparing price, technical and other factors.  It is the GovernmentÃ¢Â€Â™s intent to award based on initial offers received, without discussions.  The award may be made to a superior offeror which is not the lowest offered priced, but which is significantly more technically advantag eous than the lowest offer so as to justify the payment of a higher price.  The evaluation factors are: (1) Mission Capability, (2) Past Performance, (3) Proposal Risk, (4) Cost/Price and (5) Bonding Capacity.  Mission Capability (Factor 1) and Past Perfor mance (Factor 2) are of equal importance. Proposal Risk (Factor 3) is slightly less important than Factors 1 and 2.  Cost/Price (Factor 4) is slightly less important than Factor 3.  Factor 5, Bonding is a Go/NO Go factor and is, therefore, not weighted. In  accordance with FAR 15.304(e), Factors 1, 2, and 3 when combined, are significantly more important than cost or price; however, cost/price will contribute substantially to the selection decision. As part of the submittal, offerors will be required to subm it technical and cost/price proposals for a hypothetical project (not including site work) as described in a sample task order which will be included in the Request for Proposal. Consideration will be given to prime firms, joint ventures, partnerships, and  their subcontractors or consultants who have the resources and capability to provide Constructability Review and Design-Build Services. Selected firms will be expected to work closely with CENAP and Installation project managers and Installation Administr ative Contracting Officers.  Once the contracts are awarded, the Government will compete the work among the awardees based on performance and other factors set forth in the contract and the Request for Proposal.  Each awardee will be provided a fair opport unity to be considered for subsequent task orders, except under those circumstances described in FAR 16.505(b)(2).

The Government received twelve (12) responses to this requirement and four (4) have been invited to submit technical and cost proposals.

The request for proposal will be released within two weeks no later than July 23, 2004 to those vendors determined to be in the competitive range.

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to correct the title stated above to read "C4I and Munitions Test Improvement Contract II (CIMTIC II)" in lieu of "NAC4I and Munitions Test Improvement Contract II (CIMTIC II)".  All other informatin below this sentence is the same as that posted in the notice of contract action on 2 Jun 04.  The Air Armament Center (AAC) 46th Test Wing Commander plans to contract for unique, specialized hardware and software and/or prototype systems to develop and/or modify/improve Eglin Range Complex facilities and infrastructure urgently required for test/training and evaluation of C4I and Munitions systems.  General areas of work on this contract will include design, development, test, modification, installation, training, and/or transition support.  This is a delivery order, Cost Plus Fixed Fee, Cost Reimbursable, and Firm Fixed Price contract and each delivery order is competed amongst all awardees.  The contract will require rapid response (technical and cost proposals within 10 days) to support urgent requirements including the following:  (1)  Test Capability Enhancements involving systems analysis, systems engineering, design, development, fabrication, calibration, integration of test instrumentation including hardware and software, test facility design and characterization, and requirements verification;  (2)  Software Development involving computational modeling/simulation, accreditation, and database design;  (3)  On-site Test and Evaluation Support including planning, execution, data reduction, analysis, technical support, test facility verification, and training; (4)  Munitions relating to guidance and control/aiming systems, aircraft compatibility/interface, flight test analysis, lethality, countermeasures/counter-countermeasures, electromagnetic interference/ electromagnetic compatibility (EMI/EMC), target signatures, warheads, munitions effectiveness, system performance, non-cooperative target scoring, and survivability; and  (5)  C4I relating to command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance, networking, management information systems, information warfare, system security and vulnerability, and system performance.  A subcontract management plan will be required to ensure the contractor has an established capability to successfully accomplish 5-25 delivery orders concurrently.  AAC/PKZ plans to award two contracts but reserves the right to award more than 2 or less.  Each contract will be of an approximate duration of 5 years.  A draft Request for Proposal (RFP) was released on 21 Apr 04.  The formal RFP is scheduled for release in the last week of Jun 04.  Contract awards are planned for the 1st Quarter FY 05.  Information associated with this program may be classified up to, and including, TOP SECRET/SCI.  Additionally, all potential contractors will be required to obtain export control certification from the Defense Logistic Service Center (DLSC), Battle Creek, MI 49016-3412 (1-900-353-3572) in accordance with DOD 5320.25 prior to being provided any additional technical data from the technical library and access to other unclassified data that is not released in the RFP.  Certification is accomplished using DD Form 2345, “Militarily Critical Technical Data Agreement”.  This requirement for DD Form 2345 certification also applies to any subcontractors being given access to reproduced data by another contractor.  Material developed under this program will be considered non-proprietary and may be used by the Government under other contracted programs.  This effort will contain an organizational conflict of interest clause.  The clause will state that a contractor delivering a prototype in response to requirements of this contract will be excluded from follow-on production.  Developers of equipment to be evaluated by Eglin Munitions and C4I test resources in order to proceed into production shall be excluded from competition for this effort.    A source list, based on responses from the sources sought synopsis issued 5 Nov 03 was published in FedBizOpps and has been updated periodically.  Firms already on the source list need not respond.  The source list is for informational purposes only and no RFPs will be issued to firms named on the list.  The RFP will be posted in FedBizOpps and must be retrieved there by interested firms. Acknowledgment of receipt of responses will not be made.  The NAICS Code for this effort is 334511.  The small business size standard is 750 employees.  See Numbered Notes 2 and 26.

<DESC>This notice is hereby amended to extend the deadline for responses until June 15, 2004.

It is the intent of the Center for Information Technology (CIT), National Institutes of Health (NIH), to acquire on a sole-source basis pursuant to FAR 6.302-1 and 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) a Procurement Services Provider (PSP) Agreement from IntraMalls LLC; 120 Cockeysville Road, Suite 204; Hunt Valley, Maryland 21030, for CIT to use the NIH IntraMall and provide the opportunity to extend the IntraMalls program to other agencies.  The NIH IntraMall represents an innovative, full-service acquisition system that harnesses the power of the Internet to streamline the Federal procurement process for the NIH scientific community.  This pioneering e-commerce acquisition system provides product information, on-line ordering, and sophisticated accounting and budget functions that are all customized for the Federal acquisition community.  The NIH IntraMall is able to satisfy the researcher’s equipment and supply needs while saving time and money with every purchase transaction.  Having been tested and implemented for use in 1998, the NIH IntraMall is currently being used by approximately 13 NIH Institutes/Centers (ICs).  Growth of vendors and products offered by the NIH IntraMall has been considerable, with over 150 vendors and over three million catalogue items currently included.  The NIH IntraMall program has empowered the NIH scientific community to exert direct control over purchases of needed supplies and equipment with a substantial decrease in the administrative processing costs per purchase transaction.  The NIH has partnered with IntraMalls, LLC since 1996 to develop and expand the NIH IntraMall software platform, making it a model for digital end-to-end e-commerce by integrating procurement card-based purchasing and seamless transaction information between buyers and sellers.  The NIH IntraMall includes the following features:  electronic ordering, payment, and automated record keeping; a revolutionary automated reconciliation module; and the integration of each purchase transaction to the NIH legacy accounting system (the NIH Administrative Data Base).  Services provided by the NIH IntraMall software platform developed by IntraMalls LLC include hosting and maintenance of supplier catalogues, online shopping and transaction processing, automated purchase order/funds reconciliation, ad-hoc reporting, and toll-free customer support.  Representing a business-to-government (B2G) solution, the NIH IntraMall program has essentially converted supplier catalogues into convenient procurement vehicles, and performs more efficient managed procurement support services that has enabled NIH to reduce its cost of procurement.  Within the IntraMalls LLC software functionality, the process of procuring through the NIH IntraMall is defined as end-to-end, beginning with comparative shopping and ending with receipt, payment and reconciliation.  The software functionality transcends e-catalog connectivity by tightly integrating shopping and requisitions with the order and payment processing services necessary to fulfill audit purposes.  CIT has a need to establish a Procurement Services Provider (PSP) Agreement with IntraMalls LLC to allow CIT to acquire the same end-to-end, web-based vendor catalogue, order delivery and account reconciliation system services currently being used by other NIH ICs, or to extend the IntraMall program to other agencies.  Specifically, the services will include (1) access to over three million catalogue items from over 150 existing vendors; (2) standardized, searchable electronic catalogues comprised of scientific, office and computer equipment and supplies; (3) catalogue descriptions that include NIH-specific pricing and financial classification codes; (4) complete vendor support including enrollment, training and catalogue formatting services; (5) management of user profile data including purchase card and shipping location data; (6) automated order delivery system for interactive communications and order monitoring; (7) custom built interface for delivery of transaction and billing data directly into the NIH accounting system; including an automated reconciliation function; (8) toll free help desk for users and vendors; and (9) activity reporting for users and NIH IC management.  The software platform used to operate the NIH IntraMall program was developed by and is proprietary to IntraMalls LLC.  The software functionalities provided by IntraMalls LLC in its Procurement Services Provider (PSP) Agreement are unique in their ability to meet all current Federal and NIH documentation requirements for purchase card transactions.  Additionally, IntraMalls LLC’s proprietary software is the only source that provides the ability to integrate purchase transactions from the NIH IntraMall into the existing NIH accounting system (an internally programmed legacy system).  Because of the characteristics of the NIH legacy accounting system and IntraMall LLC’s proprietary ownership of the software integration solution, building a new interface to another e-commerce platform would require a substantial investment of time and effort that would simply duplicate what has been achieved by NIH to date in partnership with IntraMalls LLC.  Additionally, NIH is in the process of replacing its legacy accounting system within the next 24-36 months; therefore, making an additional investment in the legacy system is impractical.  Duplicating the unique software functionalities available from IntraMalls LLC’s proprietary Procurement Services Provider (PSP) Agreement would not be financially prudent.  Finally, if NIH were to compete for a new integration effort, it would immediately lose the important benefits of (1) CIT’s use of the existing NIH IntraMall solution and its labor-saving features developed by IntraMalls LLC; e.g., automated transactions and billing data reconciliations; and (2) the opportunity to extend the IntraMalls program to other agencies.  The proposed acquisition will be procured under FAR Part 12 – Acquisition of Commercial Items.  The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. This is not a Request for Quotations (RFQ).   However, all interested parties may request an RFQ by contacting Lynn Montalvo Furtaw at 301-496-6546.   Sources interested in responding to the RFQ must be able to provide convincing evidence that they possess the requisite expertise and experience to successfully perform the services as specified above and in the RFQ.  Responses must be in writing and must be received in the office by June 15, 2004.  Proposals must include pricing information.  All responses received in a timely manner will be considered by the Government. This requirement is being processed for CIT by NIH’s National Library of Medicine (NLM).  NLM Synopsis No. NLM 04-143/LMF shall be cited on all correspondence regarding this announcement.  Inquires regarding this procurement may be made to Lynn Montalvo Furtaw on 301-496-6546 or by email at: montalvl@mail.nlm.nih.gov.

The revised Chapter will also relate and explain the underlying methods for two existing NRCS national software packages.  The revised Chapater will also add new material related to the analysis and design of irrgation piplines and appurtenances.  The Chapter should explain the appropriate uses and limitations of all methods and include numerous graphics, tables, charts, and solved examples to facilitate thorough planning and design for conveyance of water and water borne materials.  An example of a recently completed Chapter of a similar Field Handbook is availaable at:  http://www.info.usda.gov/CED/ftp/CED/neh651-ch10.pdf.  All mathematical details and examples will be presented in dual units with US primary and metric equivalents secondary.  The period of performance for the successful proposal is 480 calendar days after contract award.  SOLICIATION PACKAGES SHOULD BE AVAILABLE APPROXIMATELY JULY 9, 2004.

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to update the areas of interest and range of requirements, add JFCOM to the list of agencies, change the technical POC and republish the original announcement, with administrative corrections and previous updates, pursuant to FAR 35.016(c).  The administrative corrections and updates are as follows:  (1) update the contracting POC in the body of the announcement and (2) delete the ombudsman program for the announcement.  No other changes have been made.


This BAA is open and effective until September 30, 2005.  CONTACTS:  Dawn Trevisani/Program Manager/315-330-7311; Renee Arcuri, Contracting Officer/315-330-4777.  Air Force Research Laboratory Rome Research Site (AFRL RRS) is soliciting white papers for various scientific studies and experiments to increase AFRL’s knowledge and understanding of the broad range of capabilities required in support of Modeling and Simulation (M&S) of warfighting techniques, equipment and capabilities.  Solutions to basic research and engineering using innovative approaches will be sought.  The scope of this effort primarily concerns the area of the Modeling and Simulation science, as applied to C4ISR and covers a broad range of requirements which include, but are not limited to, improved real-time decision-making, predictive assessments, operationally focused simulation, theoretical foundations of decision science, wargaming and course of action analyses. AFRL RRS requires solutions sufficient to meet the needs of the Air Force and the national modeling community (Air Force Battle Labs, National Air and Space Intelligence Center (NASIC), Joint Warfare Simulation (JWARS) Program Office, Air Force Agency for Modeling and Simulation (AFAMS), Defense Modeling and Simulation Office (DMSO), Air Force Warfighting Integration (AF/XI), Joint Forces Command (JFCOM), etc.  Some areas of interest are:   model abstraction techniques, multiresolution M&S, modeling the cognitive process, synthetic environments, parallel and distributed simulation systems, interactive simulation technologies, Real-time applications, augmented reality, component based simulation, optimization approaches, M&S in distributed mission training, information visualization/animation, control theoretic approaches,scenario generation, qualitative/fuzzy simulation , M&S for wargaming and exercise support, modeling paradigms/methodologies, behavior representation, model interoperability, among others, and involve feasibility studies, functional prototyping, proof-of-concept development/demonstration and specific C4ISR/military applications.  Emphasis is placed on the insertion of technology into ongoing and planned simulation infrastructures and activities.  THIS ANNOUCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION.  DO NOT SUBMIT A FORMAL PROPOSAL AT THIS TIME.  Offerors are required to submit five (5) copies of a one-sided, 12 point type, single spaced, one inch margined white paper not to exceed five (5) pages with a cover letter indicating whether the offeror is a large, small, women-owned small, or small disadvantaged business or historically black college, university or minority institution.    All responses to this announcement must be addressed to AFRL/IFSB, ATTN: Dawn Trevisani, (Reference BAA 02-05-IFKA), 525 Brooks Road, Rome, NY, 13441-4505. The white paper will be formatted as follows:  SECTION A:  Title, Period of Performance, Cost of Task and Name of Company; SECTION B:  Task Objective and SECTION C:  Technical Summary.  White papers must reference BAA 02-05-IFKA.  Offerors must mark their white papers/proposals with the restrictive language stated in FAR 15.609(a).  White papers addressing different areas of applicability must be submitted under separate cover.  The purpose of the white paper is to preclude unwarranted effort on the part of an offeror whose proposed work is not of interest to the Government.  Offerors submitting white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal.  Complete proposal instructions will be contained in a letter accepting your white paper and requesting a proposal.  Such invitation does not assure the offeror will receive an award.  Proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.  Individual proposal evaluations will be based on acceptability or unacceptability without regard to other proposals submitted under this BAA.  Evaluation of white papers and solicited proposals will be performed using the following criteria:  (1) Effectiveness in Enhancing Modeling and Simulation for Supporting the Air Force Mission (Soundness of Approach); (2) Relevance to the Air Force Mission; (3) Uniqueness of the Approach, and (4) Cost Realism and Reasonableness.  Criteria 1 through 3 are of equal importance and Criteria 1 through 3 are more important than Criteria 4.  Also, consideration will be given to other factors such as past and present performance on recent Government contracts and the capacity and capability to achieve the objectives of this BAA will be used.    The technical and cost information will be evaluated at the same time.  Awards of efforts as a result of this BAA will be in the form of contracts, grants, cooperative agreements or other transactions depending upon the nature of the work proposed.  Options are discouraged and unpriced options will not be considered for award.  Selected offerors may be required to review classified material up to the SECRET level; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to the proposed effort must be cleared for, or desirable for, access to SECRET information.  In addition, the offeror must have or have access to a certified and Government-approved facility available to support work under this BAA. Individual awards will not normally exceed 12 months in duration; with dollar amounts normally ranging from $50K to $300K.  Total funding for this BAA is approximately $1.95M.  Foreign or foreign-owned offerors are advised that their participation is subject to foreign disclosure procedures.  Foreign or foreign-owned offerors should immediately contact the contracting focal point, Renee Arcuri, Contracting Officer, 26 Electronic Parkway, Rome, NY 13441-4514, phone: 315-330-4777, email: Renee.Arcuri@rl.af.mil for information if they contemplate responding.  Data subject to export control constraints may be involved and only firms on the Certified Contractor Access List (CCAL) will be allowed access to such data.  The cost of preparing proposals in responding to this announcement is not an allowable direct charge to any resultant contract or any other contract, but it is an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect cost as specified in FAR 31.205-18.  An informational briefing is not planned.  This BAA is open and effective until 30 Sep 05.  A copy of the AFRL/IFK publication BAA & PRDA:  A Guide for Industry, Sep 1996 (Rev), may be accessed at: http://www.if.afrl.af.mil/div/IFK/bp-guide.html.

<DESC>Section 1. HIGH EFFICIENCY, LOW COST, EXPENDABLE, SUBSONIC TURBINE ENGINE BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT, W31P4Q-04-R-RB01. EXTENSION OF PROPOSAL DUE DATE AND UPDATES ON PROPOSALS SUBMITTED PREVIOUSLY ON 11 MAY 2004. EXTENSION IS DUE TO PROGRAM FUNDING DELAY UNTIL FY 2005 .  The proposal due date is extended from 11 MAY 2004 to 03 AUGUST 2004. Request proposal validity until 16 NOV 2004. Updates to previous proposals received on 11 MAY 2004 are limited to 2 pages for Technical/Management (Part I) and unlimited for Cost (Part I I). The Propulsion Technology Function, Propulsion and Structures Directorate (P&SD), U. S. Army Aviation and Missile Research, Development, and Engineering Center is requesting proposals for high efficiency, low cost, expendable, subsonic turbine engine propu lsion systems suitable for use as the sustainer in the Non Line of Sight Launch System Loiter Attack Missile (NLOS LS LAM).  The contractor shall deliver high efficiency, low cost, expendable, subsonic turbine engine designs, analysis, and hardware for use  and evaluation in close combat tactical missile system applications such as the NLOS LS LAM.  The contractor shall deliver to the government propulsion components and integrated propulsion units to demonstrate the state of the art for high efficiency, low  cost, expendable, subsonic turbine engine propulsion systems. Section 2. Technical Requirements General     a.  The contractor shall develop concepts, designs, and hardware for subsonic tactical missiles using highly efficient, low cost, subsonic turbine engine air breathing propulsion systems in the 30 to 50 lb thrust class.     b.  Low Specific Fuel Consumption (SFC), high durability, packaging, and low per unit cost shall be considered as design variables.     c.  The final demonstrated flight weight propulsion module shall be a possible replacement for the propulsion module used in the NLOS LS LAM, or any Army authorized derivative of the NLOS LS LAM missile, and shall be compatible with all electrical and mechanical interfaces.         d.  The contractor shall work closely with the NLOS LS LAM prime contractor to insure the propulsion module integration functionality.     e.  No government furnished equipment (GFE) or government furnished property (GFP) is anticipated for executing this contract.     f.  The contractor shall deliver the detailed designs, analyses, and test hardware for expendable evaluation of selected concepts at P&SD. Section 3. Technical Requirements Specific     a.  Multiple contract awards are anticipated for this effort.  Options may be exercised based on successful completion of the Basic effort and each succeeding option effort. Options will be exercised at the discretion of the government.     b.  BASIC EFFORT: (The estimated performance is 6 to 9 months)         The contractor shall develop the concepts, designs, and analysis in sufficient detail to enable the government to assess the effectiveness and applicability of the propulsion module.  This includes, but is not limited to, feasibility, performance, packaging, risk, weight, and cost.  The contractor shall summarize the pros and cons for each concept, indicate the technical hurdles, and suggest the test and analysis required to overcome these hurdles.  Prototype hardware and rig tests of critical funct ion hardware would be beneficial.  A non-functional, but mechanically accurate prototype propulsion module shall be delivered as part of the final report.  An accurate computer solid model will be delivered as part of the final report.  A detailed cycle de ck model shall be delivered based on best estimates of engine performance.     c.  OPTION I: COMPONENT/BRASS BOARD DEVELOPMENT: (The estimated performance is 12 to 24 months)         (1)  The contractor shall develop a demonstration prototype engine propulsion module that quantitatively exhibits the properties required.  The delivered module is not required to be i n a final, flight weight configuration, but shall be reasonably demonstrated to have the potential for such packaging and functionality.  The module shall include a prototype engine, fuel delivery system, lubrication system, (if required), and pyrotechnic start system.  In addition, the propulsion module must be capable of being operated in an alternate, non-pyrotechnic static testing (e.g. air spin and torch/sparker ignition with associated hardware and documentation) configuration.  The contractor shall d eliver a complete drawing package, solid model, and all ancillary hardware, software, and documentation required for operation of the propulsion module from a test stand.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI), BULLET TRAP SYSTEMS.   The FBI requests information from manufacturers and other interested parties concerning bullet trap systems suited for law enforcement small arms ranges having at least 20 shooting lanes.  Information submitted concerning bullet trap systems which have been installed on military small arms ranges having at least 20 shooting lanes will be accepted and may be considered as well.  Submissions are not restricted to bullet trap systems which have any particular mode of operation - ie. the submission of information for either "wet" trap systems or "dry" trap systems are welcome.  Further, submissions for bullet trap systems which have bullet/bullet fragment collection and conveyance capability as well as for systems which do not have collection/conveyance capability are welcome.  The FBI however is only interested in receiving - and will only consider - information for bullet trap systems which have an established history of performance on law enforcement (of military) small arms ranges which are at least 20 shooting lanes wide.  This is a Request for Information (RFI) only and does not constitute a Request for Proposal, a Request for Quotation and further is not to be construed as an express and/or implied agreement for the Government to enter into a contract either now or in the future.  The primary objective of this RFI is to gather information that increases the efficiency of possible future procurement actions by improving the FBI's knowledge of available bullet trap systems suited for law enforcement small arms ranges.  The Government will not pay for the information submitted in response to this RFI.  The information provided may be used to assist the Government in formulating and refining its approach for addressing its needs and may influence future procurement strategy and/or actions.  The Government may use the submissions provided in response to this RFI for whatever purpose(s) it so chooses and may include but is not limited to;  (1) establishing the marketplace for bullet traps which appear to meet the needs of the FBI, (2) limiting competition for future procurement actions, (3) sharing information with other law enforcement agencies, and (4) comparing information submitted as the baseline against which actual trap system performance is compared as part of a possible future bullet trap system test and evaluation study.  Lack of response to this RFI in whole and/or in part may be interpreted as a lack of market interest and/or capability to provide bullet traps.  Lack of submission of fully responsive, detailed  information for every numbered/lettered item below may be interpreted as evidence that the bullet trap system has poor performance and/or no performance capability with regard to that numbered/lettered item.  The Government does not intend to respond to submissions except as may be determined necessary and appropriate by the FBI in order to clarify information submitted and/or to otherwise seek answers to questions which may arise upon FBI review of the submitted information.  Submitters are advised that the FBI intends to contact current law enforcement (and/or current military) bullet trap system owner's and/or user's and conduct inquiries as to the owner's and/or user's experience with the bullet trap system submitted in response to this request for information.  All submissions will become the property of the US Government and will not be returned.  The FBI reserves the right to share submitted information in whole and/or part with any other party(ies) - except for any proprietary or confidential information submitted.  Any proprietary or confidential information submitted should be clearly annotated as such.  Do not submit samples;  the FBI will not guarantee the return of any samples provided.  

Background: The FBI conducts small arms training on various firearms ranges around the country.  These various firearms ranges are used for firearms training, qualification and tactical training.  Some of these firearms ranges are indoor ranges, some are outdoor ranges and others are fully baffled, all-weather ranges.  Ranges generally vary from approximately 20 shooting lanes wide to 56 shooting lanes wide.  The shooting distance in these ranges may vary from weapon discharge at the target line to weapon discharge at the 50 yard firing line.  Ranges are subject to up to approximately 15,000 rounds of ammunition discharged per shooting lane per month, or 180,000 rounds per lane per year.  Rounds discharged on these ranges primarily consist of either lead based or non lead based 9 mm, 40 caliber, 45 caliber, .223, 12 gauge shotgun 9 pellet OO buckshot and 12 gauge shotgun 1 ounce slug, however other caliber rounds and/or round types may also be discharged on FBI ranges on occasion.

<DESC>The Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) is performing “market research” to determine 8(a) small business sources to provide Scientific and Engineering Services for Countermeasure Technology Development and Assessments.

The Naval Research Laboratory is responsible for research, development, and management support of countermeasure technology development projects for the U.S. Navy.  The projects encompass a broad spectral range, primarily the radio frequency (RF) and millimeter wave regions, but also the infrared (IR) spectral region, to improve the countermeasure capabilities of the Fleet for both shipboard and airborne applications.  With the development of advanced missile seekers by potential adversaries, advanced countermeasure technologies play an increasing role in protecting Fleet assets in both the blue water and littoral environments. Support is required to evaluate the performance of technologies in areas, which include, but are not limited to, off board countermeasure systems, RF, millimeter, and IR systems, airborne and surface sensors, and unique countermeasure capabilities and systems.   The application of advanced technologies will be tested with hardware developments.  The technologies will then be assessed with laboratory and field tests to demonstrate improve countermeasure and sensor systems for these missions.To be considered a potential source, the contractor shall provide scientific and engineering support for the design, test and performance evaluation of off board countermeasure systems, including RF systems, millimeter wave systems, IR systems, and surveillance sensors to support blue water and littoral missions for the Navy.  The tasks shall include the areas of threat analysis, system analysis, system design and development, system test and evaluation, data collection and analysis, computer simulation design and development, and various facility operations and support.  The acquisition of foreign technology information and hardware may be required to support development projects.  Subcontract support of unique expertise for the development and analysis of specific technologies may be needed.  The contractor shall provide systems engineering support in the analyses of conceptual designs, development equipment, and existing systems to assess system and subsystem performance in both controlled and operational environments.  The evaluation of various system performance techniques will require the use of very specialized devices and systems, calibration facilities, radar measurement systems, radiometric instrumentation, data acquisition systems, and image processing systems.  The contractor shall calibrate, operate, and maintain these complex devices, systems, and facilities and perform detailed data reduction and analysis.  The contractor shall select, develop, and integrate measurement platforms.  Field exercises will be conducted in a variety of geographic locations with the free world, but the majority will be located within the US.  This effort shall include evaluation of performance under both controlled laboratory conditions and dynamic field conditions.   It shall also include the development of system models and computerized simulation capabilities in order to evaluate performance in a cost-effective manner.  The effort shall include parametric performance studies, sensitivity studies and multi-sensor correlation studies.  Environmental impact and the effects on both hardware and personnel shall be assessed.   The contractor shall provide technical and engineering support for the evaluation of emerging technologies for proposed and fielded sensor and countermeasure systems.  The technologies are primarily under development in the US; however, foreign technologies shall be evaluated for applications for the aforementioned systems. The contractor shall acquire and assess foreign technologies and systems, as required.

<DESC>The Bureau of the Public Debt (Public Debt) is assessing the market to gain information about the conversion of microfilm images to digital images in order to facilitate record retrieval.  Public Debt is interested in ad hoc retrieval, conversion, and distribution of microfilm images and/or conversion of a portion of the existing library for computer-assisted retrieval.  With respect to ad hoc retrieval, we are interested in hardware and/or software that will allow us to use data from our current microfilm index, which is contained in a DB2 table, to direct searching; prioritize and route work; collect and collate captured images; distribute images by fax, e-mail, or intranet using commercial software – off-the-shelf or custom written – or an internally developed application; and collect and manage workload and production statistics.  We must have the ability to annotate captured images and to enhance them to maximize legibility.  At a minimum, images should be 8-bit grayscale captured at 200 dpi. In addition, we are interested in mass conversion of some portion of the microfilm library to facilitate fully automated retrieval.  At a minimum, images should be 8-bit grayscale captured at 200 dpi, with the files compressed to minimize storage costs.  To support retrieval, sufficient information must be captured to build an index that will work in conjunction with our existing index, contained in a DB2 table, to identify individual images.  The index may consist of reel identification and blip numbers, the serial numbers of individual securities captured from the microfilm images using OCR technology, a combination of the two, or other.  Conversion must occur in the United States in a secured environment, and measures must be taken to safeguard the source microfilm from damage or mishandling.  

Public Debt's current working microfilm library consists of approximately 1.2 million 100- and 250-foot reels of 16 mm first-generation diazo process microfilm; original silver-process films are maintained in a separate archive under strictly controlled environmental conditions.  The films contain records relating to the issue, servicing, and retirement of United States Savings Bonds and marketable Treasury securities.  The original savings bond film dates from 1946 to the present, and because of the span of years involved, varies according to the technology available at the time of its creation.  Original and diazo films are 2.5 to 6 mm thick, and source documents, generally ranging from 3-1/4 by 7-1/4 inches to 14 by 18 inches, were filmed in both cine and comic orientation.  Hardcopy source documents were filmed using both rotary and planetary cameras; a portion of the film library is COM.  The images on our film may be negative or positive, simplex or duplex and some of the films contain document images on the left side down their length and on the right side up their length.  Images are grayscale with reduction ratios of 1:25 to 1:50.  Most of the film created since 1988 is blipped to individual images; COM is blipped to pages of data.  On average, each reel contains approximately 9,000 images.  Our current staff generates roughly 2,750 images per day using Bell & Howell 7700 and Canon NP 980 reader printers to respond to internal customer search requests.  Public Debt’s current IT environment includes an IBM 2064-102 mainframe CPU with a z/OS operating system running CICS, DB2, and MQSeries; Lotus Notes messaging infrastructure; Windows 2000 based servers; WEBSPHERE and DB2 for JAVA applications; a J2EE-compliant application development framework that provides personalization capabilities; and Fax, Wireless, and Telephony/computer telephony integration.  

Public Debt is interested in equipment and software or conversion services that:  a) are compatible with Public Debt's current environment; b) allow for expansion; c) require minimal customization after installation; d) require minimal or no downtime for upgrade processes; e) are an original vendor product (or a minimum of a single third-party product); and, f) include comprehensive 24X7 support.  Additionally, the vendor must provide training for technical personnel and allow knowledge transfer for product maintenance.  

No additional information is available at this time.  In your response, please reference RFI-MFI-1.  Public Debt is requesting technical product literature that will demonstrate the vendor’s ability to meet the specified features, GSA or commercial price lists (if available), and references (agency name, point of contact, and phone number) only at this time.  However, at Public Debt's option, evaluation software, product demonstrations, and/or technical presentations may be requested from vendors responding to this announcement.  Please note that this information is being requested for information and planning purposes only as Public Debt is primarily interested in assessing the viability of this technology.  The Government does not intend to award a contract or otherwise pay for the information requested.  Public Debt will assess the ability of the market to meet the needs as stated above based on the information received.  Dependent upon the results of this market survey, Public Debt may subsequently issue a solicitation to acquire the appropriate tool(s).  Any such solicitation would be based on a strictly functional statement of requirements in order to maximize competition. Information sent in response to this request shall be addressed to Robert Durant, Bureau of the Public Debt, Procurement, 200 Third Street, UNB 4, Parkersburg, WV 26101 and received no later than July 30, 2004, 2:00 PM EDST, or sent electronically to robert.durant@bpd.treas.gov.  Email responses requiring more than 5 megabytes of memory must be sent as separate files.

<SUBJECT>Rare Isotope Accelerator (RIA)
<DESC>The mission of the Nuclear Physics program is to foster fundamental research in nuclear physics that will provide new insights; advance our knowledge on the nature of matter and energy; and develop the scientific knowledge, technologies, and trained manpower that are needed to underpin the Department of Energy's missions for nuclear-related national security, energy, and environmental quality. To accomplish this mission, the Nuclear Physics program proposes to construct the Rare Isotope Accelerator (RIA) facility as a national priority.  This facility would provide intense beams of rare isotopes (i.e. short-lived radioactive nuclei not normally found on earth) for a wide variety of studies in nuclear structure, nuclear astrophysics, and fundamental interactions. RIA would allow the Nuclear Physics program to achieve its goals in major scientific thrusts of basic nuclear physics research.  These major scientific thrusts are identified in five scientific questions articulated in the Department of Energy/National Science Foundation Nuclear Science Advisory Committee's 2002 Long-Range Plan for Nuclear Science.  RIA directly responds to three of the five questions, namely:  "What is the structure of nucleonic matter," "What is the nuclear microphysics of the universe," and "Is there new physics beyond the Standard Model?" The proposed RIA facility would embody the best features of both in-flight and isotope-separation-on-line (ISOL) techniques and provide both re-accelerated and fast beams.  It is envisioned that the proposed RIA would be driven by a highly flexible superconducting linear accelerator (linac), which would provide a high-power, 400 MeV/nucleon beam of any stable isotope from hydrogen to uranium onto production targets.  The broad assortment of short-lived secondary beams needed for the experimental program would be variously produced by the most effective combination of a number of techniques: projectile fragmentation, target fragmentation, fission, and spallation.  After separation, the selected rare isotopes would, in many instances, be accelerated and directed to fixed-target experiments.  Experiments with stopped and trapped isotopes would also make up a major component of the scientific program. The RIA facility would also include several experimental areas and a suite of instrumentation that would allow the community of facility users to perform the forefront experiments needed to shed light on the most important scientific issues. The ultimate objective is to provide a unique research facility that will fully exploit the scientific potential of RIA, as a research tool, in support of the national objectives embodied in the DOE mission and assigned to the Office of Science.  To reach this objective, DOE will select the organization judged best able to:  i) operate and manage RIA as a national user facility and maximize its research, educational and related benefits for the Nation; ii) provide a site suitable to be considered the preferred site;  and iii) lead the design, construction, and commissioning of RIA.  The contractual relationship between DOE and the entity will be a DOE Management & Operation (M&O) contract. Selecting the M&O contractor with the capabilities described above will provide a preferred site linked to a contractor capable of leading the effort to design the scientific features and infrastructure that, in turn, drives the requirements for the associated civil works of the total facility. The selection of a site will not be considered final until the NEPA process is completed, a record of decision is issued, and, in the event a non-FFRDC is selected, the new site will be established as a FFRDC.  To maximize the fairness, no offeror will be allowed to use Federal funds to prepare their proposal in response to the request for proposal.

<SUBJECT>U -- Testing a standard core Occupational Safety & Health curriculum
<DESC>The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) plans to negotiations, on a sole source basis with the National Association of State Directors of Career Technical Education Consortium for coordination of study in public high schools participating in an evaluation study of a new occupational safety and health curriculum module for career clusters.

Statement of Work, Background Information and Purpose:
This requirement is for completion of the following tasks in support of an evaluation in public high schools of a new educational curriculum.  NIOSH requests sole source contracting with the National Association of State Directors of Career Technical Education Consortium (NASDCTEc) to acquire project coordination expertise within public school settings and ensure quality-controlled evaluation in public high schools as outlined below.  NASTCTEc is the organization recognized in the United States as the appropriate body to develop, evaluate, and implement Career Clusters Education in High Schools.  NASTCTEc has provided technical support to NIOSH during the development of a national occupational safety and health core curriculum designed specifically for high school students and prepared to nest within their National Career Clusters Educational Program.  NASDCTEc has received commitments from sixteen schools in ten states currently engaging in career clusters educational approaches to participate with NIOSH in an evaluation of this new curriculum.  The schools are located in LA, OH, IN, ID, AZ, KS, FL, PA, MO, and IL.
Purpose:  The purpose of this requirement is to procure project coordination and evaluation services from a source that will enable the government to efficiently conduct a study within public high school settings in order to evaluate this curriculum. 

PRIMARY TASK # 1:  The contractor will provide for an expert curriculum specialist  project director (PD) who will provide project coordination at all sites and who will oversee the onsite data collections and professional communication tasks as noted below by subtask for specific phases of the project.  

Subtask 1.1.  Throughout the study period, July 2004 through August 2005, the contractor’s project coordinator will serve as the liaison between NIOSH, participating school authorities, and the National Association of State Directors of Career Technical Education/ Career Clusters, providing a weekly report by email or phone with the NIOSH project officer (PO) and informing and debriefing the State Directors as requested.

Subtask 1.2.  The contractor PD will assist the NIOSH project officer by coordinating by phone, mail, and email with all attending teachers from 16 schools with regard to logistical details and preparation for attending the NIOSH teacher training workshops. The contractor PD will serve as the point of contact for all participating teachers and will respond to inquiries and assist or re-direct the teachers as needed to appropriate NIOSH staff.  The contractor PD will attend and assist in a summer 2004 training workshop.

Subtask 1.3.  The PD will contact by phone or email each teacher at all 16 schools participating in the evaluation during late summer 2004 to ensure that they are prepared to begin teaching the curriculum, have all materials needed, understand how to teach each unit, and understand the baseline test collection requirements.  The PD will provide NIOSH with a completed checklist report form or log indicating that these contacts have been completed and that the required preparation at all 16 participating schools is complete. 

Subtask 1.4.  The PD will oversee collection of baseline test data at all 16 sites within two weeks of the beginning of each school’s academic school year, and forward data to the NIOSH project officer.  The baseline test data forms will be provided by NIOSH.

Subtask 1.5.  The PD will provide for each of the 16 schools up to 4 hours of phone or email consultation and assistance between August and December 2004 (approximately one hour per month) to ensure appropriate delivery of the curriculum and collection of students evaluation assessments. The PD will maintain a log of consultation requests.  The log will include the date of the request for assistance, the identity of the requestor, and the content of the request.  The log will be provided to NIOSH at the conclusion of the data collection period. 

Subtask 1.6.  The PD will conduct a quality control site visit while the curriculum is being taught (September-November, 2004) to each of the 16 schools to observe teachers utilizing the curriculum using a NIOSH provided checklist.  These checklists will be tabulated and sent to the NIOSH project officer.   

Subtask 1.7.  The PD will coordinate and oversee collection of closeout post-training test forms in December 2004 with all 16 schools, and forward the post-training tests to the NIOSH project officer.  

Subtask 1.8.  The PD will prepare, in consultation with the NIOSH Project Officer, a summary PowerPoint presentation with handouts for use in debriefing participating teachers in June 2005.  This talk must be sent to the NIOSH PO for approval two weeks before the debriefing.  The PD will attend and assist in this debriefing. 

Subtask 1.9.  The PD will prepare and present a 20 minute PowerPoint presentation on behalf of the project at an appropriate meeting of the American Career and Technical Education Association and the National Tech Prep Association.  These presentations will be cleared through NIOSH by submitting a draft to the NIOSH Project Officer for review two weeks before each conference.

PRIMARY TASK #2:   The contractor will disperse $1000 to each of the sixteen participating schools in May, 2005 to cover the schools’ expenses related to attending the debriefing workshop.  Total amount: $16,000

Reports:

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This procurement is unrestricted therefore all responsible sources may submit a proposal and a best value evaluation will be performed. The Scope of Work (SOW) includes  Jet Service from an International Airport within the Southwest Region (Dallas Texas, Denver Colorado) to Roswell, New Mexico with the flight originating at the International Airport, flying directly to Roswell and making the direct return flight to the International Airport from Roswell in accordance with the below schedule.

Each flight must originate and end from a gate within the secure area of the airport allowing incoming/outgoing passengers to make connection with the Charter Flight or their departing flights without leaving the secure area.  The Charter Flight must be listed within the scheduling system of the airline allowing for those who are making reservations to view and confirm their reservations.  The airline will also post the flight on all monitors within the International Air Port displaying the departure and arrival gate and times.  The airline must provide for baggage transfer so as that the passenger has the same type of service as if they were on the carrier’s regular scheduled flights. The flight schedule will be each week on Sunday and will be accomplished between the following times from each site: Denver—Depart Denver prior to 1:00p.m. MDT—Arrive back to Denver no later than 4:00 p.m. MDT//Dallas—Depart Dallas prior to 1:30 p.m. CDT—Arrive back to Dallas no later than 4:00 p.m. CDT.

The airline will provide for all fuel services at both locations and will be responsible for licenses, fees or tariffs associated with the operation of the flights.  Regarding evaluation of proposal, interested parties are informed that even though price is an important selection criteria, a best value determination will be made based upon the offer that best meets the following technical and past performance factors and will be made in accordance with FAR provision 52.212-2 entitled, “Evaluation - Commercial Items.”  A go/no go technical factor will be used to assure that the offeror can meet the required safety and insurance requirements of the airline industry.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce, NOAA intends to acquire a seven (7) conductivity Temperature and Depth Sensors. Salinity being a derivative of the temperature and conductivity of sea water, the coral reef monitoring requires a Conductivity precision factor greater than or equal to 0.0003 S/m accuracy with a 0.00001 S/m resolution. The Temperature must also have a 0.002 0C accuracy with a 0.0001 resolution. The instrument must be supplied with internal memory storage, internal integral pump, internal battery pack and must also have an external RS232 interface for communication to our data logger. The CTD sensor records the conductivity, temperature and depth internally while simultaneously up loading the data via the RS-232 interface to our data logger, which transmits the data hourly via GOES satellite. If any problems arise and transmission to the GOES satellite is stopped or the external power drops below 12vdc, no conductivity, temperature or depth data is lost. These sensors will be deployed two to a station at all CREWS (Coral Reef Early Warning System) monitoring deployments in both the Atlantic and Pacific networks. One just below the surface and one at depth to record and transmit their respective environments.

<DESC>17(i).This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) intends to establish a manageable number of Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs) to fulfill its continuing Information Technology (IT) requirements for computer hardware and software products.  The USPTO’s requirements for FY 2003 were approximately $50 million.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; and a written solicitation will not be issued. See 17(xvi) for instructions for submittal of proposals.  17(ii).  The solicitation number is PROC0400151.  The solicitation is issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ).  17(iii). This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-22.  17(iv). This acquisition is reserved for small businesses.  The requirements will be fulfilled using the Simplified Acquisition procedures, Part 13 of the FAR, and the test program authorized in FAR subpart 13.5, to the maximum extent possible. The associated North American Classification System (NAICS) code is 443120.  The small business size standard is 500 employees.   The USPTO intends to establish Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs) with small businesses including HUBZone and Service-Disabled Veteran-owned businesses.  The USPTO reserves the right to compete individual requirements, with the selected HUBZone or Service Disabled Veteran-owned businesses to accomplish its socio-economic goals.  17(v).  The initial BPAs will be issued for a period of 2 years, with 3, 1-year option periods to renew.  The USPTO reserves the right to cancel any company’s BPA for any reason including poor performance and/or if the company’s prices are determined to be no longer competitive.  In addition, the USPTO may solicit additional companies at any time to replace or increase existing BPAs to fulfill the USPTO’s requirements. 17(vi). The Government is seeking a one-stop shopping vehicle, which offers a wide array of computer hardware and software products to include computer hardware, software and licenses, and maintenance that is found under Schedule 70 – General Purpose Commercial Information Technology Equipment, Software, and Services. Examples of items that the USPTO may be procuring are:  servers, wintel servers, color scanners, mass storage units, fiber channel ports and fabric management software, dual port fibre channel cards, routers and switches, security software, automated tape libraries, data tape cartridges, sniffer software, and virus control software.  Currently, the USPTO has an existing contract vehicle under which it procures desktop computer hardware.  Items on that vehicle are excluded from these BPAs.   The established BPAs will replace most BPAs that are currently registered in the USPTO’s Internet Purchasing Application (IPA), IT Product and Services Category.  As requirements occur, the USPTO will compete the actions among BPA holders.  Exact requirements are not known at this time and there is no guarantee of requirements.  Offerors must be authorized dealers or resellers of products that they are offering to the Government.  17(vii).  Place of delivery will vary but most deliveries will go to the present USPTO headquarters located in Crystal City, Arlington, VA 22202, or to its new location located in Alexandria, VA.  The USPTO is in the process of moving to a new consolidated campus in Alexandria, VA.  The delivery location will be specified in each order.    17(viii).  The provision at 52.212.1, Instructions to Offeror—Commercial, applies to this acquisition.  In addition, Offerors are required to submit (1) Brief capabilities statement not to exceed 10 pages, and (2) References from 3 current customers with whose company has had an established relationship for over one year and sales in excess of $100,000 for the year.  Offerors’ entire proposal, including catalogs and brochures shall not exceed 20 pages in length.    Offeror should address capabilities as it relates to the evaluation factors in the capabilities statement    17(ix).   The provision at 52.212.2, Evaluation –Commercial Items, will be used to evaluate offerors for awarding BPAs.   The Government intends to award BPAs resulting from this solicitation to the most responsible offerers whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be the most advantageous, representing the best value to the Government, price and other factors considered.  The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:  (1) ability to provide a vast array of computer hardware and software products,  (2) Past performance, (3) Delivery Terms – ability to meet required delivery schedules, (4) Other factors, and (5) Price.   Factors 1 through 4 are of equal importance.  Those factors individually and collectively are more important than price. Other factors may include, for example, the amount of maximum discounts offered to the Government, availability of internet products catalog, obtaining quotes on-line, ordering and on-line order tracking, flexible return policies, flexible hours of operation, distribution centers, technology consultants, use of other small businesses as teaming partners, etc.   Pricing information provided should include pricing, pricing discounts or volume discounts for similar types of computer equipment.

MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS FOR THE SYSTEM BEING PROCURED: The system must include a stage for the tensile and compression testing of samples within a scanning electron microscope (SEM).  NIST will install (or Contractor may install if Contractor will not permit NIST to install) such a stage into an existing JEOL JSM6400 SEM equipped with an HKL Inc. electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD) camera system.  The SEM host is located in Building 223, Room B131.  The JEOL JSM6400 SEM system was delivered in August, 1991 (the HKL EBSD system was purchased in October, 2000) and is currently installed and operating at the U. S. Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, Maryland.  The list of contract line item numbers, their descriptions, the related quantity of each, and the unit of measure of each for this solicitation are as follows:

CLIN 0001, Tensile/Compression System for SEM EBSP; Quantity: 1; Unit of Measure, Each.

The system offered for CLIN 0001 must meet or exceed the following minimum requirements:

(1) Be compatible with the NIST equipment JEOL JSM6400 scanning electron microscope stage, and be compatible with an HKL Inc. electron backscatter diffraction camera system.

(3) Have a motorized stage for directional control (tension and compression).

(4) Be remotely controlled via a Microsoft Windows 2000 based PC (NTFS) to provide: access to motorized stage controls, strain rates as low as 1 micrometer/minute, programmable testing of specimens IAW ASTM standards, capabilities for cyclic and fatigue testing, a control interface that attaches directly to the stage to allow testing outside of the microscope environment.

(5) Have tiltable specimen grips so as to be compatible with electron backscatter diffraction studies.

(6) Have tiltable heating elements capable of heating the specimen to temperatures of 1200 C (i.e., simultaneous EBSD and specimen heating).

(7) Attain a maximum load of 1000 pounds force.

(8) Have linear drives with translation variation less than 0.5 mm between grips and drive rails.

(9) Have interchangeable load cells to provide a range of maximum loading.

(10) The system shall include a minimum of three load cells with loading on the order of 1000 lb, 500 lb, and 100 lb force, respectively.  These specified values are not absolute weight requirements, but are guidelines for what would be considered appropriate capacities for load cells.

(11) Have interchangeable fixtures to provide for 3-point and 4-point bending (in compression).

(12) The system shall be able to mechanically test specimens within the SEM while simultaneously acquiring EBSD patterns.  

(13) The system shall have linearity of travel.

ACCEPTANCE TESTING REQUIREMENTS FOR CLIN 0001: The Contractor must perform acceptance testing after the system is delivered to NIST.  This acceptance testing shall occur within seven (7) days after the system is received by NIST Shipping and Receiving.  This acceptance testing must be performed in the presence of the Contracting Officer’s Technical Representative (COTR) to verify that all installed items are fully operational and operate as intended by the manufacturer.  The COTR will indicate acceptance of the system ONLY IF ALL ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA SPECIFIED BELOW ARE MET, and the system is demonstrated to be fully operational and operate as intended by the manufacturer.  The COTR will measure the variation of motion (from side-to-side, and top-to-bottom) between the grips and stage rails throughout the maximum travel.  The variation shall be less than 0.5 mm side-to-side and/or top-to-bottom.  The load cell drift will measured by applying 80% of maximum load, continuously reading the output from the stage.  After 5 minutes of load time, the measured load output shall have a drift variation of no more than 5% of the applied load.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation.  Quotes are being requested and a written document will not be issued.  HSCG44-04-Q-210415dgps134 is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  The incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular 01-20.  The applicable NAICS number is 335911 and the small business size standard is 500 employees.  This is an unrestricted procurement.  The contract will be awarded using simplified acquisition procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13.5.  The FOB Destination delivery is to:  Portsmouth, VA 23703 and Hartsville, TN, on or before:_75 days after award . The USCG, C2CEN has a requirement to purchase: A.2 SPECIFICATIONS
Project:  Specification to prevent accidental release of back up power batteries housed in their prescribed storage racks for the Differential Global Positioning System (DGPS), GCF-C2-1216- DGPS V(1) Maritime SC-1000 transmitter during earthquake and other non-static conditions.
1.0	SCOPE
1.1	General.  The contractor shall provide all management, supervision, personnel, labor, materials, and equipment to provide Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS) battery containment kits.  Major work items include designing battery containment kits, installing a battery containment kit, refining battery containment kit design, producing 64 battery containment kits, and providing installation steps with drawings.
1.2	Background.  Following the 1989 earthquake in San Francisco, CA Bay Area, the USCG Navigation Center Detachment at Petaluma, CA became concerned for the ability of any DGPS site to maintain full operational status during an earthquake or other natural disaster.  Studies were completed and stated that DGPS sites could be hardened against natural disaster for minimal cost.  Current site hardening proposals are to provide shelves for DGPS Reference Stations and Integrity monitors and to provide a containment system for the back-up power battery system.  The Reference Station and Integrity Monitor shelves have been procured and accepted.

The back-up power battery system consists of 12 (each) 8G8D gel-cell batteries, wired in series for a total of 144 VDC.  The batteries are arranged on battery storage racks with 3 shelves, each holding 4 batteries.  The batteries are routed via a 144 VDC 50 Amp breaker and connected to the back panel of the Southern Avionics Company SC-1000 DGPS transmitter.  The battery rack holding the batteries is a framework of black plasti-coated steel posts, flat stock, and angle iron as described in the DGPS V (1) site manual.  The current system features a 1” lip on the front and back of the rack, but no device to prevent lateral slippage during earthquake or non-static conditions.  Under extreme conditions, the batteries could slide out of the rack and break, causing a lack of back-up power in an environment where use of the back-up power will likely be required to continue broadcasting navigation corrections for mariners, emergency response teams, and other land-based users.

5.1	General.  The contractor shall provide a COTS battery containment system to ensure all batteries are securely stored and are not at risk for slippage under extreme conditions.  All construction shall be in accordance with NEC code (reference 2.3).
5.2	Top Brace for a Battery Shelf.  The top brace for a battery shelf shall serve as a brace for applying tension to increase friction and thus minimize slippage.  Construction shall be as follows:
5.2.1	Width and Height:  The top brace shall be a square prism with each edge no smaller than one inch (1”).  Each edge shall not exceed two inches (2”).
5.2.2	Length:  The top brace shall be 50” (fifty inches) long.
5.2.3	Material:  The top brace shall be constructed of aluminum.
5.2.4	Material Thickness:  The top brace material shall be no thinner than 1/8th (0.125”) of an inch.
5.2.5	Material Coating:  The top brace exterior shall be colored black and treated with non-conductive material, such as plasticoat or rubber.  The coating shall be at least 1/32nd of an inch (0.03125”).  The outer two inches (2”) of the top brace interior shall be coated similarly as the exterior of the top brace.
5.2.6	Connectors/Options:  The top brace may have a minimum amount of holes, slots, and connectors required for system integration and operation.
5.3	Side Braces for a Battery Shelf.  Two side braces for a battery shelf shall serve to apply tension and to increase friction and thus minimize slippage.  Additionally, the side braces serve as physically orthogonal barriers to potential battery slippage.  Construction shall be as follows:
5.3.1	Width and Height:  Each side brace may be either a square prism with each edge no larger than 5/16th inch (0.3125”) or a cylindrical prism with a diameter no larger than 5/16th inch (0.3125”).  The prospective edge or diameter shall be no smaller than ¼ inch (0.25”).
5.3.2	Length:  Each side brace shall span at least 10 inches plus required space for connectors.  All threaded type connectors shall have at least ½ inch (0.5”) extended length.  For example, if all-thread is selected and 1” aluminum prism is used, and the all thread is fastened to the bottom of the battery rack and the top of the top brace, the total length would be 10” (span)+1” (top brace) +0.5” (top)+0.5” (bottom) or 12”.
5.3.3	Material:  Each side brace may be constructed of any commercially available material normally used for industrial tension applications.
5.3.4	Material Thickness:  The material shall be solid.
5.3.5	 Material Coating:  Each side brace shall be coated in the same manner as requirement 5.2.5.  The total diameter or prism side shall not exceed 5/16th inch (0.3125”) AFTER coating.
5.3.6	Connectors/Options:  Each side brace may be threaded, hooked or otherwise have integrated connectors to minimize the number of pieces or parts required for system installation and operation.  
5.4	Miscellaneous Hardware.  The contractor shall design and provide all nuts, bolts, washers, hooks, keepers and other miscellaneous hardware required to fasten the top brace, side braces, and battery rack in the battery containment system. All hardware shall conform to the following:

<CONTACT>Carole Hubbard, (256)876-3390
<DESC>This is Amendment 0003 to the combined synopsis/solicitation for the Aerial Surveillance Platform and is issued for the purpose of providing questions and answers.  The proposal due date is hereby extended to 7 Jul 04, 2:00 p.m. Central Standard Time  (CST).  Q1:  One of the questions asked regarding the former RFP was: (Q1: In view of the fact that no airplane company makes and installs sensors and no sensor company makes airplanes for installation of its sensors and neither type company makes and nei ther installs the types of avionics required it appears that at least three or four other NAICS codes should be included or incorporated into this solicitation.  Is this solicitation limited to airplane manufactures only? and your response was: A1: Our mar ket research indicates aircraft with sensors of the type specified in the solicitation are commercially available.  Our requirement is for aircraft with sensors, not individual items.  This solicitation is not limited to aircraft manufacturers only.)  This  indicates that your research has identified aircraft that meet the aircraft-specific requirements.  Please list those aircraft.  A1: The government will not provide a listing of aircraft identified through market research.  Each offeror may propose the ai rcraft of their choice.  Q2:Please explain your need given the recent announcement that a Jordanian company has been awarded the contract.  A2: Solicitation W58RGZ04R0547 was cancelled in its entirety because no technically acceptable proposals were receiv ed.  No contract was awarded as a result of the cancelled solicitation.  The requirement was redefined and reissued under solicitation W58RGZ04R0713 and will be evaluated on a best value basis.  This requirement is a valid requirement.  As an interim solut ion, the CPA office in Baghdad awarded a contract for 2 aerial surveillance platforms to provide this service until proposals can be evaluated and a contract award made.  The U.S. Army AMCOM Acquisition Center in Huntsville, Alabama was not responsible for  the awarded contract.  Q3: Before I reinvest the effort necessary to submit a proposal, you have to prove your sincerity and address this announcement published by Aero-News.  A3:  See answer 2.  Q4: Given the nature of the conflict, it would appear that a fast, high-altitude, turbine-powered aircraft with high resolution optics/IR would be a superior tool to that being requested.  One that would fly high enough to keep it's occupants safe, be able to respond rapidly to distant threats, and that could be b ased in a friendly country - thereby reducing it's own vulnerability.  Will such an RFP be issued?  A4: No.  Q5: Where will the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA) perform the acceptance check flight?  Will they be available within one days notice? Will the CPA actually fly the planes?  A5: The Multi-National Forces-Iraq will accept the aircraft. The effort must be coordinated with the Multi-National Forces-Iraq and the U.S. Government.  Yes, the CPA will fly the planes.  Q6: Is the following radio freque ncy correct: VHF voice 130-173.9975 KHz?  A6: The correct radio frequency is VHF voice 130-173.9975 MHz.  Q7: Are the systems to be exported to the Coalition Provisional Authority, the Army or to Iraq?  A7: The Multi-National Forces-Iraq will be the receiv ing agency.  Q8:  Will contractor badges be provided by the Army to contractor employees?  A8: The Multi-National Forces-Iraq will coordinate badges in country if they are required.  Q9: Can you provide a copy of FAA Form 8130-2?  A9: The FAA Form 8130-2 i s the Conformity Certificate-Military Aircraft.  This is an FAA-restricted document that is issued only after application for Airworthiness Certification.  A copy will not be provided by ths office.  Q10: Where will the Coalition Provisional Authority acce pt the planes?  Can it be in the US, Kuwait, etc.?  A10:  As stated in the solicitation, the aircraft will be delivered to Basrah International Airport, Iraq, F OB Destination.  Final acceptance of the aircraft will be after delivery.  Q11: In Amendment 0002, you provided the answer for Jet Fuel as 'not required'. Our aircraft uses Jet A1 fuel, may I presume that using it is up to the contractor?  A11: No.  Only M OGAS 80-91 octane or AVGAS are allowed.  MOGAS or Motor Gasoline is fuel suitable for use in spark-ignition engines.  AVGAS is gasoline fuel for reciprocating piston engine aircraft.  Q12: Competitive due diligence has surfaced information indicating that another company has possibly already been identified as the likely recipient of the planned award.  Further, the abbreviated response time of two weeks from date of issue for a solicitation containing the scope and technical content of subject solicitation  has been judged unrealistic by proposal team members who have had extensive experience in such matters.  This accelerated schedule lends further credence to the inference that a proposal already submitted for the prior solicitation is now being 'fine tune d' to correct administrative or compliance technicalities that prevented its prior selection.  A12: As discussed in question and answer 2, this solicitation is a valid competition that will be evaluated on a best value basis.  No proposal from the cancelle d solicitation is being 'fine tuned' nor they will be considered in the evaluation of solicitation W58RGZ04R0713.  That solicitation and all proposals received in response are filed away as a cancelled solicitation.  The response time for this solicitation  was set at 2 weeks because the requirement had already been issued and industry questions had already been addressed.  The 2 week proposal lead time was sufficient to address any questions on the revised portions of the requirement.  The questions answere d in this amendment do not change the requirement and should not affect proposal preparation.  However, due to the late posting of this amendment, the proposal due date is extended from 2 Jul 04 to 7 Jul 04, 2:00 p.m. Central Standard Time.  Q13: Do you re quire submission of data for the CDRLs with our proposal or are these items you will need later?  A13: The CDRL submissions are to be delivered after contract award.

Industry comment (para phrased): There is  concern about a technical performance reduction in paragraph 3.0.3 SENSOR/COMMUNICATIONS, specifically the capability to detect a man-sized target at a 3 km range rather than the 5 km range as was called for in the previous (-0547) solicitation. Answer: O fferors are free to propose the best possible solution to meet or exceed the stated requirement, offerors are reminded that evaluations will be based on a best value approach. 4. Paragraph 3.0.3 SENSOR/COMMUNICATIONS SUITE is changed as follows: replace '( UnCooled IR is a desired characteristic)' with '(Cooled IR is a desired characteristic)'. 5. Paragraph 3.0.4 COMMUNICATIONS is changed as follows: all references to 'KHz' should now read 'MHz'.

Questions & Answers:

Q:  I’m working on the layout and I’m having some trouble with my computer. Would it be possible 
To send me the layouts in a DWG format.

A:  I am unable to obtain the DWG plans in time.

Q:  I had a few questions regarding this request:
 
1) Rugs -  Is there a specific size that needs to be quoted, including material, etc?
2) Conference Room Table - Can we quote a laminate top? Panel base?
3) Conference Room Seating - Would you like us to quote chairs that have wood or upholstered backs?
4) Desk for Front Lobby - Simple Single Pedestal or L-Shaped Desk? Laminate or Metal?
5) Freight - Would you like this quoted direct or to a depot?

A:  
1)  Kitchen rug can be approximately 7’ x 11’ or 8’ x 10’.  No oriental patterns; just a simple kitchen rug.

2)  You can bid any Conference Room Table you deem appropriate to meet our need.  We are requesting your professional expertise in our request for room design.

3)  Fabric for the conference room chair is preferred by the customer.

4)  The desk for the front lobby should be simple.  A secretary’s desk or a desk you would see in a nice hotel room used for the phone would be appropriate.  This is in the lobby of the Distinguished Visitor’s lounge.  

5)  Freight should be quoted directly to Guam due to the short delivery time necessary to meet our need.  Shipping to Tracy CA would take longer than the stated delivery times in the solicitation.

Q:  My  name is Lee Floersch and I work with OmniFineArt Limited.  We were  recently awarded our GSA contract and have been looking for vendors to contact  about our artwork and services that we provide.  After looking through  the Fed Biz Opps website, I saw that Andersen Air Force Base is going through  renovations. I am writing to inquire how far along they are in the project and  if they may possibly need any artwork or our any of our other services.   Please feel free to call with any questions concerns or requests that  you might have.  Any help is greatly appreciated.  

Best,

A:  You are welcome to contact Mr. Floersch if you are in need of artwork to fulfill our requirement.  (Status of this project:  Bids are due NLT 2 Jul as specified in this solicitation.)

Q:  I see no specifications for the furniture, I also see requirements for wallpaper, vertical blinds, artwork, etc. We are not sure of your contract requirements. We would like to submit a qualified quote for your review, but we, at this time somewhat unsure of what we must quote.

A:  We are relying on your expertise to design the rooms.  We have listed the furniture/furnishings required in our attachment.  The DV Lounge should have a “homey” feel.  The recliners do not need to be big and bulky, but the sofa and loveseat are typical living room furniture.  The conference room will be used for business.  It is quite small.  The area rug for the kitchen shouldn’t be an oriental pattern; just a simple area rug approximately 7’ x 11’.  Measurements for mini blinds are approximately 23” W x 77”L.  I do not have an exterior measurement (for verticals or curtains).  There are two windows requiring coverings.  Vendors are encouraged to take exact measurements prior to installation.

Q:  Are we to understand, that based upon the floorplans provided, that we may offer unspecified products of inventory that may meet the space requirements of afore mentioned floorplans?

A:  Yes, we are relying on your expertise to design the rooms while incorporating the requirements list.

<DESC>This procurement requires the vendor to provide charter airlines service for the Artesia Federal Law Enforcement Training Center.  This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This procurement is unrestricted therefore all responsible sources may submit a proposal and a best value evaluation will be performed. The Scope of Work (SOW) includes Jet Service from an International Airport within the Southwest Region (Dallas Texas, Denver Colorado) to Roswell, New Mexico with the flight originating at the International Airport, flying directly to Roswell and making the direct return flight to the International Airport from Roswell in accordance with the below schedule.  The Aircraft proposed must accommodate a minimum of 120 passengers, must meet the industry standard for commercial flights with the exception of beverage/snack service and be in compliance with all FAA inspections, regulations and safety requirements for a commercial airliner. Each flight must originate and end from a gate within the secure area of the airport allowing incoming/outgoing passengers to make connection with the Charter Flight or their departing flights without leaving the secure area.  The Charter Flight must be listed within the scheduling system of the airline allowing for those who are making reservations to view and confirm their reservations.  The airline will also post the flight on all monitors within the International Air Port displaying the departure and arrival gate and times.  The airline must provide for baggage transfer so as that the passenger has the same type of service as if they were on the carriers regular scheduled flights. The flight schedule will be each week on Sunday and will be accomplished between the following times from each site: Denver: Depart Denver prior to 1:00p.m. MDT/Arrive back to Denver no later than 4:00 p.m. MDT//Dallas: Depart Dallas prior to 1:30 p.m. CDT/Arrive back to Dallas no later than 4:00 p.m. CDT.

If there is space available, then any government employee on official travel may provide proper identification and travel orders at the gate and the airline will allow that individual to travel.  The FLETC in conjunction with the Transportation Security Administration will provide security screening for all students departing from Roswell to the International Airport selected.  The FLETC will also provide for the loading of baggage at the Roswell Airport on to the return flight, however this only relates to the placing of the bags from the secure area to the aircraft.  The Airline will be responsible for securing all baggage within the hold and is responsible for all damage after it is placed inside the aircraft. The airline will provide for all fuel services at both locations and will be responsible for licenses, fees or tariffs associated with the operation of the flights.  Regarding evaluation of proposal, interested parties are informed that even though price is an important selection criteria, a best value determination will be made based upon the offer that best meets the following technical and past performance factors and will be made in accordance with FAR provision 52.212-2 --Evaluation - Commercial Items.  A go/no go technical factor will be used to assure that the offeror can meet the required safety and insurance requirements of the airline industry.

Answer:	Basic power (120V, 20 amp) is near by as well as water connection at a hose bib at the ball field.  Restrooms are also within 200 ft of the worksite.  	

Question: We were unable to determine from the solicitation if the following is required for this contract:  Davis-Bacon pay/certified payroll, Payment surety or performance bond, certificate of insurance, etc.

<DESC>SOLICITATION NUMBER:  PROC0400151 – AMENDMENT – NO. 3.
This combined synopsis/solicitation is amended to include the following Questions and Answers regarding this synopsis/solicitation.  IN PARTICULAR, QUESTION NO. 7 SHOULD BE CAREFULLY REVIEWED FOR PROPOSAL REQUIREMENTS.  Also, the Questions and Answers may be found at:  http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/ac/comp/proc/itbpareq/itbpahom.htm.
The following questions and their answers have been submitted to the United States Patent & Trademark Office (USPTO) vis-à-vis combination synopsis/ solicitation PROC0400151. 
1.	What is the NAICS small business size for this requirement? The NAICS is 443120 for the requirement listed in synopsis/solicitation PROC0400151.  The small business size is 500 employees. 
2.	What do I need to provide should I decide to submit a proposal?
All the information you need may be found at the following web site:
http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/ac/comp/proc/itbpareq/itbpahom.htm
3.	What items have you requested be available under any resulting BPA?
See Answer No. 2
4.	Is this a GSA BPA? No, as explained in the combination synopsis/solicitation PROC0400151, this award is to be made by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO).
5.	Is Teaming allowed? Yes, teaming is allowed.  The USPTO encourages teaming with other small businesses.  
6.	Are desktop computers to be included as offered products?  No, as explained in combination synopsis/solicitation PROC0400151, the USPTO already has mandatory source contracts for these products.
7.	Offerors are required to submit examples of prices discounts, or volume discounts for similar types of IT products in conjunction with evaluation factor No. 5 (Price).  How many examples should we submit in our proposal?
In order to clarify this question, the USPTO has decided Offerors should submit examples of its 10 largest sales, which represent the types of IT products, that the company has sold to the federal government community in the last two years.  The examples should be a variety of products and should be listed in a spreadsheet with the heading of “Description”, “Quantity”, “Date of Sale”, “Regular Price”, “Price Discount Given to Government on Items”, “Final Price to Govt”.  If Offeror did not offer the Govt. a discount from its regular charged prices, please indicate by using “N/A”.  In addition, the Offeror shall submit sales copies (i.e., purchase orders, sales receipts, etc) of its 10 example orders to substantiate its sales.   
8.	Do you have a required format for catalogs and price sheets that would make product and price evaluations easier?
There is no required format for catalogs.  Submissions can be in the format that the offeror uses to provide information to its customers.
For price sheets, see answer to No. 7 above.
9.	Can I get a printed copy of the RFP?
No, as explained in combination synopsis/solicitation No. PROC0400151, the announcement of the requirement serves as a combination synopsis/solicitation and “…a written solicitation will not be issued…” 
10.	In Solicitation PROC0400151, you state, “The USPTO’s requirements for FY2003 were approximately $50 million.” Using this information is it correct to estimate the value of the entire contract (base years plus option years) to be approximately $250 million (50 X 5).  Is this a correct estimation, or is $50 million the sum of the contract?
As stated in combination synopsis/solicitation PROC0400151, “…The United States Patent and Trademark Office…intends to establish a manageable number of Blanket Purchase Agreements to fulfill…Information Technology (IT) requirements for computer hardware and software products. The USPTO’s requirements for FY2003 were approximately $50 million…”. Any award resulting from this combination solicitation/synopsis will be a Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA). FAR 13.303-1(a) defines a BPA as “…a simplified method of filling anticipated repetitive needs for supplies or services by establishing “charge accounts” with qualified sources of supply…” The $50 million figure represents what was ordered in the past and shall not be construed as a guarantee of future orders in that amount. There is no guarantee of receiving a call just because a company has a BPA. Calls will be competed between/among all BPA holders. 
A BPA is nothing more than an agreement on how supplies may be purchased if the BPA holder offers the lowest price for supplies. This combination synopsis/ solicitation guarantees only that any firm holding a BPA will be given the opportunity to compete for requirements when they become available.
11.	 Is pricing required to be submitted for the items listed in the sample list of  USPTO’s previously purchased Information Technology (IT) products, located at:
http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/ac/comp/proc/itbpareq/itbpalst.pdf.
No.  The sample list of IT products is provided as information purposes only of the types of IT products the USPTO had purchased last year.  Offerors are not expected to price this list of products.  Offerors should provide pricing information in its proposal for similar types of IT products the company has recently sold to the federal government community. See Answer to No. 7 (above).
12.	May companies submit proposals that only offers IT products in one area, i.e., network servers?  As stated in combination synopsis/solicitation PROC0400151, “ The Government is seeking a one-stop shopping vehicle that offers a wide array of computer hardware and software products to include computer hardware, software, and licenses, and maintenance that is found under Schedule 70 General Purpose Commercial Information Technology Equipment, Software, and Services…”  Those companies offering products in only one area will not meet the USPTO’s requirements, and will be not considered for award. 
13.	 “You want us to submit a sample of items we sold previously to the Government along with PTO cost for these items. We cover a very wide range of computer products (hardware and software) and services.  How many items would you consider reasonable to list.  Is it advantageous to add as many items as possible?”  See answers to No. 7 & 12 above.
14.	 “Could you clarify what you all are looking for as far as pricing information?  Do you all want pricing for all of the items in the spreadsheet of previously purchased items or are you just looking for a sampling?”
See answers to No. 7 & 12 above.
15.	“Is there any recommended format for the price sheets”.  See answers to No. 7 & 12 above.
16.	 “Should and do we have to submit pricing for each item on the list posted on the website?”
See answers to No. 7 & 12 above.
17.	“How can I obtain a copy of the items requested for the Solicitation Number:  PROC0400151”.  The USPTO has provided a sample list of USPTO previously purchased information technology products at:
http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/ac/comp/proc/itbpareq/itbpahom.htm
This list is for information purposes only and shall not be construed as a guarantee of future orders.
18.	 “My question is may we bid on this solicitation, since we are a service firm and need the clearing houses for the hardware and software?”.  The requirements under this combined synopsis/solicitation requires the offeror to submit a capabilities statement, with 3 current customers with whose company has had an established proposal relationship for over one year and sales in excess of $100,000 for the year, ability to meet required delivery schedules, other factors, and price sampling.  If your company does not meet the requirements, your company would be disqualified from receiving an award.  As the synopsis/solicitation states: “Offerors must be authorized dealers or resellers of products that they are offering to the Government”. 
19.	 “ How many awards will be made within the USPTO BPA? How many companies will be a part of the BPA and have the opportunity to bid on products?”  As stated in the synopsis/solicitation, “The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) intends to establish a manageable number of Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs) to fulfill its continuing Information Technology (IT) requirements for computer hardware and software products”.  
Companies which are awarded a BPA by USPTO under this synopsis/solicitation “As requirements occur, the USPTO will compete the actions among BPA holders”.

Question No. 3. This references Schedule 70.  We are considered a small business under 500 employees on our GSA schedule.  Is our GSA Schedule certification the determining factor for us to qualify....

Answer:  No, the GSA certification is not the determining factor to qualify.  This acquisition lists Schedule 70, General Purpose Commercial Information Technology Equipment, Software, and Services, only as an example of types of Information Technology (IT) products found under this schedule, which the USPTO may acquire under the awarded Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs).  The NAICS for this requirement is 443120.  The small business size is 500 employees.  Companies will determine their existing business size at the present time according to the criteria of the NAICS 443120.

Question No. 4.  You state that all you will be buying is peripherals.  Yet on your sample product listing you show Sun product as well as servers.  Can you clarify this please?

Answer:  The USPTO is seeking a one-stop shopping vehicle, which offers a wide array of computer hardware and software products to include computer hardware, software, and licenses and maintenance like those that are found under Schedule 70, General Purpose Commercial Information Technology Equipment, Software, and Services.  Servers are one of the many commercial items included under Schedule 70, which may be purchased.

for additional information.

Question No. 5.  The proposal is supposed to be 20 pages. Are the reps and certs in addition to the 20 pgs, or do they count as part of the 20?  

Answer:  See Answer No. 1 and No. 2 above.

Question No. 6.  Does the table of contents and introduction letter count as part of the 20 pages?

Answer:  No, the table of contents does not count as part of the 20 pages. 
For introduction letter, see Answer No. 1 above. 
 
Question No. 7. Can you please clarify the due date of the above mentioned RFP? The General Information section of the FED BizOpps advertisement states a due date of May 10th, however the last paragraph of the advertisement states a due date of May 6th, please advise us as to the correct due date.

<DESC>This combined synopsis/solicitation is amended as follows:  All questions concerning this synopsis/solicitation should be submitted by e-mail to: Sylvia.VanDyke@uspto.gov no later than 11:00 a.m. (EST), May 3, 2004. 
 See Answer No. 1 and Answer No. 2 above.
Question No. 9.  May we be allowed extra pages in our submittal for the supporting documentation for the Federal sales examples?  With 10 examples in a spreadsheet, and meeting the requirement to provide copies of purchase orders and invoices supporting those examples – we would likely exceed the limits of 10 pages for pricing/20 pages totals for our response.
Answer:  See answer No. 1 and Answer No. 2 above.
Question No. 10. - May I confirm that the required certifications and representations would be considered an attachment, and not be required to conform to the page limitations of our response?
Answer:  See Answer No. 1 and Answer No. 2 above.
Question No. 11. - To qualify, does the contractor need to have established relationships with 3 current customers with each customer having sales over $100,000 a year (i.e., more than $300,000 total a year) or the 3 combined customers having sales exceeding $100,000 a year?

Answer:  The requirement is in conjunction with “Past Performance”, one of the evaluation factors. The synopsis/solicitation at 17(viii) requires offerors to submit, among other items, “References from 3 current customers with whose company has had an established relationship for over one year and sales in excess of $100,000 for the year.”  The requirement is for the offeror to submit 3 references from 3 different customers, whom the offeror has sold over $100,000 a year in sales. Each reference provided should reflect sales of over $100,000 a year with that customer.    

Question No. 12. - Most authorized dealerships and authorized resellers are required to commit to specific volumes of sales per year.  For small businesses to become authorized resellers and dealers for wide array of computer hardware and software products, this would be cost prohibitive for small businesses. Is the prime contractor required to have signed reseller/dealership agreements in order to qualify? 

Answer:  Companies are not required to have signed reseller/dealerships agreements in order to qualify for an award under this BPA; however, if you are awarded an order under the BPA, companies will be required to be an authorized reseller or dealer of products at that time.  The USPTO does not intend to award any orders under this BPA for “gray” market items.  If a company is an authorized dealership or reseller for a product, the company should state this in their proposal under Factor 1 (ability to provide a vast array of computer hardware and software products) in their capabilities statement.    

Question No. 13. - Does the prime contractor have to provide the 3 current customer references or can the prime contractor and teaming partners combine to satisfy this requirement?

Answer:  The prime contractor must be able to provide 3 current customer references in order to satisfy this requirement.

Question No. 14 - Is the prime contractor required to submit examples of its 10 largest sales or can the prime contractor and teaming partners combine to satisfy this requirement?

Answer:  The prime contractor is required to submit examples of the Offeror’s 10 largest sales occurring in the last two years, which represent the types of IT products that the company has sold. This requirement should not be confused with the submittal of the 3 past performance references (Question No.11) from current customers with whom the company has had sales for $100,000 or more. 

Question No. 15.- What other IT contracts are in place, whose products could not be procured on this vehicle? (eg workstations, servers, SANS, etc)? 

Answer:  The USPTO has established contracts in place which includes desktops computers, laptops, monitors, printers, and PDAs.  

Question No. 16. - Offerors are required to submit examples of prices, discounts, or volume discounts for similar types of IT products in conjunction with evaluation factor No. 5 (Price).  Offerors are required to submit examples of its 10 largest sales, which represent the types of IT products, that the company has sold to the federal government community in the last two years.  Can Offerors submit sales, made to other than to the federal government community, as examples of its 10 largest sales?  

Answer:  Yes, Offerors may expand the scope of its examples to include other than the federal government community. 

Question No. 17. - 17 (viii) Offerors’ entire proposal, including catalogs and brochures, shall not exceed 20 pages in length.  Currently, your requirement states that there is a 20-page limit. Ten pages are set aside for company capabilities.  The remaining ten pages will easily be filled with our product catalog, pricing structure, warranty information, and delivery terms. Can the required Past Performance and Certs and Reqs be an attachment to the submitted proposal?

Answer:  See Answer No. 1 & 2.

Question No. 18. - Ref : 17 (xii) Section 508 Compliance - Since we don’t know the specific requirements PTO will have, it is impossible for us to certify 508 compliance as compliancy is specific to individual products.  Is this something that would be done on an order-by-order basis after the BPA is issued?

Answer:  Yes.  Although there is a Section 508 certification requirement which applies to this BPA, certification will be required on an order-by-order basis.  

Question No. 19. -  “Re: The Q&A question 1 (Amendment 3). What is the NAICS small business size for this requirement?  Answer: The NAICS is 443120 for the requirement listed in synopsis/solicitation PROC0400151. The small business size is 500.”  “A number of companies are considered small on GSA Schedule but currently have over 500 employees.  Most RFP's require the certification of business size at the time of proposal submission.  This offeror request the Business size certification be at time of proposal submission.”

Answer:  Amendment 3, Question No. 4 states that this BPA is an award that is being made by the USPTO.  This procurement does not have any connection to GSA schedules, other than Schedule 70 is mentioned as an example of products that could be acquired under the USPTO’s BPAs.  You are correct in that the business size would be determined at the proposal submission.
