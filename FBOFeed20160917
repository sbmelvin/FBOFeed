<DESC>Ammunition Supply Point, hereinafter (ASP) AND /Langford Lake Road Repair and Drainage Improvement, Fort Irwin, San Bernardino County, CA. The Fort Irwin NTC Cantonment area received an intense rainfall event last October which created flash floods, causing damage to Fort Irwin property. The flash flood damaged storm drainage channels, deposited sediment on roadways and parking areas, flooded buildings, and affected the structural integrity of major roadways. In addition, the roadways were previously under-designed and have exceeded their life span. As part of the project ASP Loop Road and intersecting Langford Lake Road will be demolished, excavated, regraded, compacted, and repaved to properly handle the heavy vehicle loading expected. In addition, the two channels adjacent to ASP Loop Road will be improved and protected to protect the road from future storm events and provide proper storm drainage. To improve protection of adjacent facilities and Langford Lake Road, a berm has been designed to divert surface run-off and flow from adjacent tributaries. Work also includes utility re-route, guard rail repair and other minor drainage work. The total contract performance period is 365 Calendar Days from contactor's receipt of Notice to Proceed.

<p><br />Note to the Proposed Contractor:</p>
<p>OIG Exclusion List</p>
<p>No contract award shall be made to a vendor or provider listed on the OIG Exclusion List (http://exclusions.oig.hhs.gov) throughout the duration of the contract. Should a candidate be found with a non-favorable security clearance it shall be the contractor's responsibility to replace the candidate working under the contract/purchase order with a suitable candidate. It shall be the responsibility of the contractor to notify the Acquisition Office is there is a change in provider.</p>
<p>In addition, no Contractor or subcontractor employee shall be permitted to perform work under this contract if listed on the LEIE (HHS Office of Inspector General List of Excluded Individuals/Entities), http://exclusions.oig.hhs.gov. As soon as practicable prior to the performance of the work, the Contractor shall provide to the Contracting Officer the names of all individuals to be used in performance of work for screening against the LEIE. During the performance, the Contractor shall provide the Contracting Officer the names of any additional or substitute employees for screening before they begin work.</p>
<p>The Contractor is responsible for conducting security preclearance investigations in sufficient depth to ensure that each Contractor or subcontractor employee referred to IHS is not on the LEIE and can obtain a favorable fingerprint clearance. Each security preclearance shall be conducted sufficiently in advance of the start of performance to avoid delays caused by denial of access. If this is a Time and Materials, Labor-Hour, or Cost-Reimbursement contract, the contractor shall not charge for or be reimbursed for labor hours or other costs incurred for employees who are unable to perform due to denial or access or the excess time required to resolve and clear unfavorable security clearance findings. If this is a Fixed-Price contract, denial of access due to security clearance findings shall not be a basis for excusable delay or an increase to the contract amount.</p>
<p>The Government will pay for the cost to process the contractor's suitability clearances. However, multiple investigations for the same position may, at the Contracting Officer's discretion, lead to a reduction(s) in the contract price of no more than the cost of the investigation(s).</p>
