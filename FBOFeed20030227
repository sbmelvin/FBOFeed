<DESC>NASA/SSC plans to issue a Best Value Request for Offer (RFO) for Signalization and Roadway Improvements along Trent Lott Parkway. The work for this requirement consists of, but is not limited to the following: Provide all labor, equipment and materials to signalize the intersections of J Road, H Road and Saturn Road along Trent Lott Parkway at Stennis Space Center.  The Work also consists of asphalt paving and roadway improvements at each intersection.	   Best Value Selection (BVS) seeks to select an offer based on the best combination of price and qualitative merit (including past performance, and relevant experience) of the offers submitted and reduce the administrative burden on the Offerors and the Government. BVS evaluation is based on the premise that, if all offers are of approximately equal qualitative merit, award will be made to the Offeror with the lowest evaluated price (fixed-price contracts). However, the Government will consider awarding to an Offeror with higher qualitative merit if the difference in price is commensurate with added value.  Conversely, the Government will consider making award to an Offeror whose offer has lower qualitative merit if the price (or cost) differential between it and other offers warrant doing so.	    The order of magnitude for this procurement is $250,000 to $500,000, and the effort shall be completed within (180) calendar days after receipt of the notice to proceed.       This procurement is unrestricted. The NAICS Code and small business size standard for this procurement are 238210 and $12.0 million, respectively. This procurement is part of the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program.	As a result, all qualified sources may submit a bid, which shall be considered by the agency.	The anticipated release date of the RFO is on or about Mar 20, 2003, with an anticipated bid closing date of on or about Apr 21, 2003. The firm date for receipt of bids or offers will be stated in the RFO.	   An ombudsman has been appointed -- See NASA Specific Note "B".	    Specifications and Drawings will only be made available on CDROM. Requests for copies shall be made by email to the Bid Distribution Office:  Anita.DeMarco-1@nasa.gov or you may fax your request to (228) 688-1141.	  The solicitation and any documents related to this procurement [with the exception of the specifications and drawings] will be available over the Internet at NASA/SSC Business Opportunities page:  http://nais.msfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/EPS/bizops.cgi?gr=C&pin=64	   Prospective offerors shall notify this office of their intent to submit an offer. It is the offeror's responsibility to monitor the Internet site for the release of the solicitation and amendments (if any). Potential offerors will be responsible for downloading their own copy of the solicitation and amendments (if any).

The offeror must demonstrate its experience and professional ability in the following areas: 1) Experience as a Prime Contractor of similar size and general scope of this project, i.e., health centers, street and parking lots, hospital and other health facilities over the past 3 years (20 points); 2) The Prime Contractors/Project Management?s proposed staff (key  personnel) for this project, including professional experience, qualifications, education and training, i.e., project manager, superintendent, estimator, quality control supervisor, etc. (10 points); 3) Past performance on contracts with Government agencies including Indian organizations, tribes, i.e., Indian Health Service and Bureau of Indian Affairs (10 points); and 4) Technical approach and past performance on renovation of occupied/operational health centers, hospitals facilities and other health care facilities over the past 3 years (10 points).  Upon establishment of a list of firms whose technical proposals are technically acceptable their respective cost proposals will be opened and evaluated.  For purposes of evaluation of offerors, the technical factors when combined are as important as the price.  PRICE EVALUATION FACTORS (50 Points):  Offerors are advised that an award may be made without discussion, exchanges or any contact concerning the proposals received; therefore, offerors should present their best and final price at the time of submission.  Offerors should not assume that they would be contacted or afforded an opportunity to qualify, discuss, or revise their proposals.  Proposals will be evaluated on lump sum bid price for the base item and evaluation of price on any options that is most advantageous to the Government.  Award of any options items may be made by modification to the contract and, if exercised, would be awarded when funds become available during the term of the contract.  The Government reserves the right to reject any or all proposals at any time prior to award; to negotiate with any or all offerors; to award the contract to other than the offeror submitting the lowest total price; and to award to the offeror submitting the proposal determined by the Government to be the most advantageous to the Government.  The final selection will be determined based on both the technical proposal and the cost proposal submitted.  Specifications, plans and offering documents will be available O/A March 11, 2003, for a NON-REFUNDABLE PRICE OF $50.00 per set by writing John Hoffman at the address above.

<DESC>The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is soliciting innovative research proposals for applying molecular-scale electronics technology to the development of ultra-dense molecular electronic computer processors and molecular electronic sensor systems for use in a variety of standalone and embedded applications. Proposed research should investigate innovative approaches that would actually produce prototype nanoelectronic systems that will enable revolutionary advances in computing and sensing.  Specifically excluded is research that only uses conductive organic or molecular materials, but does not employ them to fabricate systems of nanometer-scale functional devices which are integrated on similar scales.  PROGRAM OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION  DARPA seeks innovative proposals in the following two (2) thrust areas:  (1) Ultra-dense Molecular Electronic Computer Processor (MoleComputing)  The goal of this program thrust area is the reliable, hierarchical assembly and fabrication of a prototype molecular electronic computer processor with local molecular device densities of at least one hundred billion  devices per square centimeter.  Such a processor will have approximately fifty thousand nanodevices in a 100 square micron area, all operating with a clock rate of at least 10 kilohertz or equivalent, and consuming no more than 10 Watts per square centimeter of power.  This nanoprocessor should be programmable and reprogrammable, and it should perform logic functions including arithmetics.  Logic and registers should be integrated and in communication with memory.  Such a nanoprocessor is envisioned to have approximately the complexity of the original 1971-vintage microprocessors, i.e. the Intel 4004, but it would be 100,000 times smaller in area.  The molecular electronic computer processor should be compatible with and/or capable of being integrated with the molecular memory such as those developed by the DARPA Moletronics Program.  (2) Ultra-dense Molecular Electronic Sensor System (MoleSensing)  The goal of this program thrust area is the reliable, hierarchical assembly and fabrication of a prototype molecular electronic sensor system that operates in air or water, which will have sensitivities and discrimination comparable to the animal kingdom, e.g. artificial dog’s nose.  Such an artificial system would consist of at least 1000 nanosensors per square micron (i.e., 100 billion per square centimeter), including matched subsystems of at least eight complementary nanosensor “receptors” for effecting unique identification of any of 255 different chemical or biological agents, which have a concentration as small as 500 parts per trillion.  This should require no more than one second of electrical response time after receptor attachment and no more than ten seconds of chemical response time after exposure of the sensor array to the environment.  Also of particular interest are solutions that allow for reuse of the sensor array up to at least 10 times. The molecular electronic sensing system must be compatible with and/or able to be integrated with the memory developed by the DARPA Moletronics Program.  Among the requirements for this purpose is that the interaction of a nanosensor with a chemical or biological agent must be transduced into an electrical signal.  The chemical/biological interaction area or active detection area of the digital sensing system should range from 1 to 25 square microns.  However, should an offeror wish to incorporate additional nanoscale sensor processing circuitry into a proposed architecture, a total of up to 100 square microns for the sensing and the processing modules would be acceptable.  The above states the technical goals for the two thrust areas; these shall be interpreted as targets, and not as requirements, and not as specifications. Prototypes in each thrust area must be defect-tolerant in their design and fabrication, as well as fault-tolerant in their operation.  To the ends stated above, in both program thrust areas the proposal, development, and application of advanced nanofabrication and nanoassembly techniques, as well as innovative device or circuit design and system architecture concepts will be viewed favorably as part of an overall strategy for developing prototypes with the characteristics enumerated. Additionally, modeling and simulation to ensure a complete, predictive understanding of device and system operation and performance is considered to be an integral part of the prototyping process.  Novel approaches are welcome for achieving digital computational and sensing systems at the high densities and performance levels specified, provided primarily that the proposed approaches give evidence of a strong system plan and a rationale indicating a high likelihood that they can be translated to a functional prototype.  To ensure sufficient technical management focus in each thrust area, the MoleApps Program will require that contractor R&D in each thrust area be managed independently of the other. Thus, a proposal should focus only on a single thrust area.  For groups who might wish to propose in both areas, a separate proposal is required in each thrust area.  Additionally, a successful proposal will specify a Principal Investigator who is responsible for R&D in only a single MoleApps thrust area.  PROGRAM SCOPE:  The MoleApps program will consist of an 18-month Phase I effort, followed by an optional Phase II (18 months) and Phase III (24 months) for those efforts exhibiting the greatest potential for production, insertion, transition, or overall benefit to DoD.  Awards totaling approximately $15 million for Phase I are expected to be made during calendar year 2003.  Options totaling approximately $50 million may be awarded for Phase II and Phase III efforts.  Organizations wishing to participate in Phase II and Phase III should include them as options in their proposal (separate options for each phase). Multiple awards are anticipated.  Collaborative efforts/teaming are strongly encouraged. A website at the URL https://www.davincinetbook.com/moleapps has been established to facilitate the formation of teaming arrangements among interested parties.  The specific information content, communications, networking, and team formation data provided are the sole responsibilities of the participants.  Neither DARPA nor the Department of Defense (DoD) endorses the content of the website at the URL cited above, including any of the technical or organizational information contained therein, nor does DARPA or the DoD exercise any oversight at that URL.  The website is provided consistent with the stated purpose of this BAA.  The program also may support some innovative individual investigator efforts.  Cost sharing is not required and is not an evaluation criterion, but is encouraged where there is a reasonable probability of a potential commercial application related to the proposed research and development effort.   PROPOSER INFORMATION:  Proposers must obtain the pamphlet entitled BAA 03-12 MoleApps Proposer Information Pamphlet which provides further information on areas of interest, the submission, evaluation, and funding processes, proposal formats, and other general information.  This pamphlet may be obtained from the FedBizOpps website: http://www.fedbizopps.gov/, World Wide Web (WWW) at URL http://www.darpa.mil/ or by fax, electronic mail, or mail request to the contact address given below.  Proposals not meeting the format described in the pamphlet may be rejected without review.   PROPOSAL ABSTRACTS:  Submission of proposal abstracts (i.e., "white papers") is optional.  Submission and review of proposal abstracts is intended to minimize unnecessary effort in proposal preparation and review.  All proposal abstract submissions will be evaluated for their responsiveness to the stated goals and objectives of this BAA.  Offerors should submit an original and ten (10) copies of the proposal abstract to DARPA/MTO, (Attn.: BAA 03-12), 3701 North Fairfax Drive, Arlington, VA 22203-1714 on or before 4:00 p.m., local time, Thursday, March 27, 2003.  In addition, offerors should submit 2 electronic copies (i.e., two separate disks).  File formats shall be PDF and MS-Word-readable.  Media for each copy may be a single CD-ROM, a single 100 Megabyte Iomega Zip (registered) disk, or a single 3.5-inch High Density MS-DOS formatted 1.44 Megabyte diskette.  Each disk must be clearly labeled with BAA 03-12, proposer organization, proposal abstract title (short title recommended), and Copy number.  Proposal abstracts received after this time and date may not be reviewed.  Proposal abstracts must meet the objective and format guidelines as described in the Proposer Information Pamphlet in order to be considered.  FULL PROPOSALS:  The full proposal (original and designated number of hard and electronic copies) must be submitted to DARPA/MTO, (Attn.: BAA 03-12), 3701 North Fairfax Drive, Arlington, VA 22203-1714  on or before 4:00 p.m., local time, Friday,  May 23 , 2003, in order to be considered during the initial round of selections. However, proposals received after this deadline may be received and evaluated up to one year from the date of posting on FedBizOpps.

<DESC>NA As a result of previous synopses issued on 24 June 2002, 1 July 2002 and 19 December 2002, the government is in the process of purchasing commercially available protective masks, which will be tested against the government performance specification for the  Joint Chemical Environment Survivability Mask (JCESM).  As a result of a recent change in the government's acquisition strategy, the requirements for the JCESM have been revised which will result in the procurement of a Block I JCESM and a Block II JCESM.   The government will test commercial available masks against the requirements of the Block 1 performance specification.  The changes to the performance specification, which has been posted on the following website, https://abop.monmouth.army.mil/ibophome. nsf/home?open under RFP DAAD13-02-R-0031, are listed below: Vapor challenge levels identified for each block (Block I - 3333 CT, Block II - 10,000 CT) (what is CT) Continuous above-the neck head protection for six hours - Block II, two hours Block I Only Block II has a drink tube requirement Only Block II has FOV requirements Only Block II must permit use of receiving and transmitting communication devices Only Block II has immersion to 66 feet of saltwater Based on the results of these tests, the government may elect to limit competition for future procurements of the JCESM.  Therefore, potential offerors should contact Ms. Carol Hillen at (410) 436-2053 regarding the submission of potential candidate masks for testing.  Those firms that have previously submitted sample masks need not reply to this announcement. A subsequent Presolicitation/Procurement announcement will be issued at a later date.

<DESC>NA The U.S. Army Aviation and Missile command (AMCOM) has a requirement to acquire additional support for the independent integration analysis of the PATRIOT missile system under Contract DAAH01-97-C-0324.  The purpose of this additional effort is to provide uninterrupted contractor support to the Lower Tier Project Office (formerly PATRIOT Project Office) until award of a competitive follow-on procurement to DAAH01-97-C-0324 can be accomplished.  These services shall be procured on an “other than full and ope n competition” basis from the incumbent contractor, CAS, Inc.   Based on Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii), CAS, Inc. has been determined the only responsible source that can provide these services within an acceptable timeframe to pr event a break in service.  A break in existing service would impact the readiness of the deployed systems and the military units they are assigned to; adversely impact the ability of deployed troops to defend themselves and U.S. allies; and could result in  loss of life and loss of valuable assets to which no value can be assigned.  It is estimated that an additional 336,322 hours will be required for a period of approximately six months.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be consider ed by the agency.

<RESPDATE>032703
<ARCHDATE>05262003
<CONTACT>marilyn johnson, 757-878-2062
<DESC>NA Using a 2-Step Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) process, the Aviation Applied Technology Directorate (AATD) is soliciting abstracts, followed by technical and cost proposals, to conduct concept exploration research and development in support of the Army’s R otary Wing Vehicle (RWV) Technology Effort Objectives. The long-range objective of AATD’s structures program is to improve the lethality, agility, survivability, and supportability of the Army’s Objective Force by making airframe and rotor structures light , affordable, and durable.  This long-range objective is supported by our Technology Effort Objectives, which include more accurate dynamic load and stress prediction methods, reduced aircraft weight through the use of multifunctional structures, and more survivable and efficient aircraft through the use of reconfigurable structures. TWO STEP PROCEDURES The two step process requests interested Offerors to submit abstracts which include program concepts, ideas and methodologies based on maturing technologies, a brief description of relevant past experience and capabilities, and a cost estimate.  After revi ew of abstracts, those Offerors deemed to merit full proposal submission will be invited by letter to submit a full proposal.  Offerors whose proposals are not deemed meritorious will be notified in writing, however, those Offerors may still submit a full proposal if desired.  No proposal will be considered if a corresponding abstract was not submitted.  SOLICITATION TOPICS:  There are three topics under this Announcement with the following areas of interest: TOPIC 01-2003: Dynamic Load and Stress Prediction Component testing is an undesirable necessity to fully understand the effects of dynamic loading on a structural design due to inaccuracies in stress calculation and internal or external load prediction.  In dynamic loading cases such as crash, impact, or high frequency vibration, uncertainty about internal stresses and inexact design methods have lead to excessive weight or premature failures.  More accurate dynamic load and stress predictive capability will result in increased structural efficiency, impro ved durability, and decreased design time and cost.  AATD seeks abstracts and proposals from industry for more accurate dynamic load and stress prediction methods.  The matured methodology is to be validated in this effort by comparing predictions with exi sting test results to an extent sufficient to eliminate the need for validation testing for future applications.  This effort should include typical rotorcraft structural materials.  The offeror should substantiate current and anticipated prediction accura cy, time, and cost. TOPIC 02-2003: Multifunctional Structures The U.S. Army has an ongoing interest in developing increasingly weight-efficient aircraft.  Multifunctional aircraft structure can reduce aircraft weight through the reduction of parasitic (not load-carrying) structure and the consolidation of structure.  For example, military aircraft typically have a variety of installed antennae, which impart loads on the structure of the aircraft.  Embedded antennae, designed to conform to the shape of the aircraft structure and carry structural loads, can make the air craft structure more efficient.  In addition, integrated avionics and electronics enclosures potentially save space and weight, but structural composite electronics racks must be made conductive for electromagnetic shielding and ground plane purposes.  Fur thermore, military aircraft designed for reduced radar signature often utilize parasitic (not load-carrying) Radar Absorbing Material (RAM).  This RAM may increase the level of load in the primary (load-carrying) aircraft structure as a result of its weigh t and drag.  Primary Radar Absorbing Structure (Primary RAS) can reduce or eliminate the weight penalty associated with parasitic RAM, making the aircraft more weight efficient.  AATD seeks abstracts and proposals to mature and apply i nnovative multifunctional structures technology to reduce the weight of Objective Force aircraft systems.  The envisioned effort should address such topics as multifunctionality, structural efficiency, typical rotorcraft structural materials, and opportuni ties to leverage the technology for other purposes.  Innovative approaches are encouraged, such as novel methods of designing structural stiffening concepts (e.g. sandwich panel honeycomb or foam cores) with radar absorbing properties. TOPIC 03-2003:  Reconfigurable Structures The U.S. Army is interested in the development and subsequent application of reconfigurable structures.  Recent work in government labs, industry, and academia has suggested that state of the art materials technology, combined with novel structural design methods may lend itself towards the development of reconfigurable structures that have the ability, for example, to alter their physical configuration.  For example, in the event of battlefield damage, primary load paths could be damaged to the point of re ndering a structure useless.  A self-healing structure would allow the war fighter the ability to maintain operations on the battlefield, even after sustaining what would otherwise be considered incapacitating damage.  As another example, the design of rot or blades, control surfaces, or fuselage surfaces is often optimized to a particular flight condition, and reconfigurable structure could in theory provide optimized performance throughout a variety of flight conditions.  AATD seeks abstracts and proposals  from industry that describe the development and/or application of reconfigurable structures technologies for improved ballistic tolerance, damage tolerance, or aerodynamic efficiency.  The intent is to achieve reconfigurable structures that are capable of  altering their physical configuration (autonomously if applicable); creating new or altering existing load paths, optimizing existing control surfaces, or initiating self-repairs. ANTICIPATED FUNDING LEVEL AND PERFORMANCE PERIOD:  Anticipated funding for all awards by each topic is as follows: TOPIC 01-2003: Dynamic Load and Stress Prediction - Approximately $600K  TOPIC 02-2003: Multifunctional Structures – Approximately $1.7M Note:  $1.7M is intended to support awards in multiple areas of multifunctional structures, so proposals limited in technical scope should be appropriately limited in cost. TOPIC 03-2003:  Reconfigurable Structures - Approximately $800K Period of Performance for each award resulting from this Announcement is estimated to be 24 months starting in FY03/FY04 and ending in FY05/FY06.  Any FY04 award is subject to the availability of funds.   TYPE OF FUNDING INSTRUMENT: A variety of funding instruments are available pursuant to this Announcement depending upon the proposed effort, the entity submitting the successful proposal(s), and statutory and regulatory requirements the Government must sat isfy.  Such instruments include conventional contracts subject to the Federal Acquisition Regulation, as supplemented, and Technology Investment Agreements (TIAs) that are either Cooperative Agreements or other transaction agreements for research.  Cost sh aring of up to 50% under a TIA is a matter of DoD policy.  Contract type is a subject for negotiation. DELIVERABLES:  All awards under this Announcement will require delivery of the following data items:  (1) Management Plan, (2) Test Plan (if applicable), (3) Bi-Monthly Performance and Cost Reports (if applicable), (4) Final Report, and (5) Executable soft ware (if applicable).  All awards will include a requirement to present the results of the work in a final briefing at Ft. Eustis, Virginia upon completion of all technical effort. EVALUATION CRITERIA:  The selection of one or more sources for award will be based on a scientific and/or engineering evaluation of proposals (both technical and cost as it relates to technical effort) in accordance with the criteria set  forth in this section.  Proposals will be evaluated on their own merit without regard to other proposals submitted under this announcement.  These evaluations will result in narrative ratings, which will be used to develop an order of merit listing for pr oposals submitted under each topic.  Proposed cost will be evaluated, as appropriate, for realism and reasonableness.  The evaluation criteria are:  (1) the extent to which the proposed work satisfies an Army research need by use of innovative, efficient, affordable, and suitable approaches to the stated technical problem; (2) the merit of the offeror’s proposed approach to accomplish the scientific and technical objectives; (3) the experience and qualifications of the scientists, engineers, technicians, an d other proposed personnel; (4) the suitability and availability of proposed facilities; and (5) cost to the Government.

Performance measures shall include maximum detection ranges, generation of coverage diagrams (range-height-angle charts), signal-to-interference ratio charts, probability  of detection charts, range, angle and Doppler resolution, range, angle and Doppler accuracy for monopulse or conical scan radars.  The assessments shall quantify tracking performance by both radar and electro-optics sensor systems with applicable fire-con trol algorithms such as linear predictor, second-order predictor, and Kalman filtering. The contractor shall be required to conduct basic technology research that identifies state-of-the-art in various countries or geographical regions, identifies key rese archers in the fields of radar and electro-optics sensors, and manufacturers capabilities.   The contractor must be experienced in the architecture and application of NGICs specialized radar analysis software package “MBERT” (see below for an overview of MBERT). The contractor must be able to formulate assessments and be available to assist in pro duct improvement projects relating to MBERT.   The contractor shall produce technical assessments of short-range air-defense search/acquisition radars, fire-control radars, fire-control systems, electro-optics, direct-view optics, image intensifier systems, thermal-imaging sensors, closed-circuit telev ision tracking systems, passive radar, counter-stealth radars and technology, artillery-locating radars, active-protection systems, ground surveillance radars, radar signals analyses, radar transmitters, receivers, signal processing systems, phased-array a nd reflector antenna designs.    The contractor shall assemble a team of experts in the following areas: antenna theory, electromagnetic-wave propagation, multipath and clutter effects on radar performance, receiver system design, radar detection theory, conical scan and monopulse radar t racking /fire-control processes and techniques, coherent radar performance, pulse compression, FMCW radar, radar signal processing techniques, and electro-optics systems.  All analysis tools shall be developed in the MatLab/Simulink environment.  The analytical tools developed shall incorporate the effects of all commonly encountered degradation factors associated with radar in realistic scenarios.    The tool shall make provisions for utilizing standard antenna radiation patterns for typical refle ctor and phased-array antennas or incorporating measured antenna patterns from foreign materiel exploitation.  The tool shall provide patterns for a variety of different antenna illumination functions and incorporate the effects of feed blockage.   The analytical tool shall incorporate a state-of-the-art target and environment methodology that provides the most realistic target environment available for short-range low-altitude air-defense situations.  The environment analysis shall incorporate the e ffects of multipath propagation; this sha ll include the interference region, the intermediate region, and the diffraction region.  The contractor shall review the existing MBERT clutter model and recommend/adapt useful portions for integration into the analysis tool.  The tool should also make pr ovision for various target flight paths and associated variations in the radar cross-section as well as the effects of dynamic radar cross-section associated with helicopter bodies.  The toolset shall have the ability to easily import data from ASCII text files or Excel spread sheets. The tools shall incorporate the effects of the receiver and signal processing on the various aspects of radar performance and  the effects of clutter correlation on the various measures of performance.   The outputs of the toolset shall provide graphical or tabular results of various radar performance measures to include: nominal detection ranges, signal-to-interference ratio vs. range, radar coverage diagrams, range accuracy, angular accuracy, range & ang ular resolution, signal processing responses, sum/difference channel performance, antenna patterns, and power densities received at the target.  The toolset shall allow the operator save  output data into an ASCII text file or an Excel spread sheet format and shall also allow the operator to be able to easily alter the radar, environment, and target parameters in a GUI-driven interface.  In addition, the on-line documentation shall have detailed explanations of the models used and an explanation of the para meters and their limits.  Additional research tasks may be required to include: scientific and technical literature research to establish the status of foreign capabilities in advanced areas of communications and non-communications research from scientific and technical published l iterature. The contractor shall provide two data products for each subject area: A bibliography of significant source material including the listing of all known institutional affiliations of the authors and an analysis of the organization of research effo rts; and a summary report for each subject area containing a synopsis of the of the research efforts. The report shall identify the level of maturity of research in terms of the following descriptive levels: 1. Basic Research - the most basic level of rese arch, generally before applications are obvious. 2.Exploratory Development - continued basic research oriented toward examining promising capabilities of a new technology. 3.Advanced Development - the maximization of a new technology’s attributes to make i t feasible for application to specific use. 4.Engineering Development - the inclusion of a new technology into end-use hardware. 5.Production - evidence of production of end-use hardware including the technology. 6.The rationale for each technical maturity  assessment. A brief Overview of MBERT  MBERT is a specialized analysis tool that provides concise performance assessments of short-range air defense artillery and integrated missile systems.  It incorporates the current state-of-the-art in desktop computer analytical tools that has provisions f or radar and integrated radar/electro-optic fire-control systems.  The tool covers all technical areas applicable to modern radars/fire-control systems to include antenna theory, electromagnetic-wave propagation, multipath and clutter effects on radar perf ormance, receiver system design, radar detection theory,  conical scan and monopulse radar tracking/fire-control processes and techniques,   coherent radar performance, pulse compression, FMCW radar, radar signal processing techniques, integration of elect ro-optic sights to include IRCCD, image intensifiers, direct view sights, etc. The analysis tools are developed in the MatLab/Simulink environment.The MBERT model is developed on a Windows/PC platform using current versions of the Matlab (version 6.5) and Simulink (version 5.0) environment.  The models exist with significant detail i n the Simulink environmen t with additional functionality achieved by calling Matlab m-files. The Matlab compiler is used to generate C++ files from the Matlab m-files when necessary for computational efficiency. The Matlab Signal Processing Toolbox and the Simulink DSP Block set a re used for improved productivity in developing the tools. The Real-Time Workshop is used to generate executable files from the Simulink models. The Simulink environment promotes the development of modular object-oriented modules that increase the flexibil ity and maintainability of the program. User-friendly interfaces will be developed to increase the usability of the model. The analytical methods in MBERT incorporate the effects of all commonly encountered degradation factors associated with radar in real istic scenarios.  Such effects include the effects transmitter phase noise, timing jitter, and other instabilities. The tool will make provisions for utilizing standard antenna radiation patterns for typical reflector and phased-array antennas or incorpora ting measured antenna patterns from foreign materiel exploitation.  The tool will provide patterns for a variety of different antenna illumination functions and incorporate the effects of feed blockage. It also has provisions for incorporating measured ant enna patterns from ASCII or Excel files The analytical tool incorporates a state-of-the-art target and environment methodology that provides the most realistic target environment available for short-range low-altitude air-defense situations.  The environme nt analysis will incorporate the effects of multipath propagation, including effects on clutter returns arising from the interference region, the intermediate region, and the diffraction region.  The tool will also make provision for various target flight paths and associated variations in the radar cross-section as well as the effects of dynamic radar cross-section associated with helicopter bodies.  The toolset will have the ability to easily import data (such as target RCS versus angle cuts) from flat AS CII files or Excel spreadsheets. The tools incorporate the effects of the receiver and signal processing on the various aspects of radar performance.  The tool will also include the effects of clutter correlation on the various measures of performance.  Th e outputs of the toolset will provide graphical or tabular results of various radar performance measures to include: nominal detection ranges, signal-to-interference ratio vs. range, radar coverage diagrams, range accuracy, angular accuracy, range & angula r resolution, signal processing responses, sum/difference channel performance, antenna patterns, and power densities received at the target.  The toolset will allow the operator to easily save any output data into a flat ASCII file or an Excel spread sheet  format.

<DESC>Director of Central Intelligence Postdoctoral Research Fellowship Program.  The Director of Central Intelligence (DCI) and the DS&T’s Chief Scientist announce a Fiscal Year 2003 competition for the DCI Postdoctoral Research Fellowship Program. The mission of the DCI Postdoctoral Research Fellowship Program is to establish long-term relationships and mentoring of postdoctoral researchers and to provide research institutes with an understanding of the Intelligence Community’s research requirements. The program will foster partnerships with postdoctoral researchers as they move into career positions and provide innovative solutions to critical Intelligence Community problems. Through this competition, the Chief Scientist (CS) expects to make awards in specific research topics. All awards will be based on merit competition. Depending on the quantity and quality of proposals received, the CS may not make any award(s) under a particular research topic.  In the event more funds become available additional awards may be made at a later date based on initial evaluation results.  Typically each award will be: For a basic period of one year (funded incrementally), with a potential option for a second and third year, and for the amount of $100,000 per year/per grant. This DCI Postdoctoral Research Fellowship Program competition is specifically for the research topics described in paragraph 0. Offerors are advised to read the announcement at http://164.214.2.59/ocrn/nima/contracts.html  carefully. It explains the program research needs upon which the topics are based and the terms and conditions of this competition.  AREAS OF INTEREST:  In paragraph 0, this BAA describes twenty-two (22) research areas, comprising some of the Intelligence Community’s most current technology interests. These descriptions provide offerors with a frame of reference. The DCI encourages innovative ideas that address these interests. Offerors are urged to consider the research issues posed and, as appropriate, to contact our research topic chiefs to discuss potential efforts. Inquiries are welcome. Note that while technical contacts are listed for a topic, proposals must be submitted only to the addressees shown stated in announcement.  CONDITIONS:  The DCI expects that DCI Postdoctoral Research Fellowship Program projects will promote application of research primarily for intelligence purposes. The first phase of this competition has been completed. An internal program call was placed – at the National Foreign Intelligence Program (NFIP) agencies: CIA, NIMA, NRO, NSA and DIA (including NGIC, NAIC, AFMIC, CMO and others) – for federal NFIP employees interested in making a commitment to serve as an Intelligence Community advisor (mentor) for a minimum of two years. Intelligence Community advisors submitted their resumes as well as proposed research topics that would help to draw highly qualified Postdoctoral Fellows for Intelligence Community-related research. These research topics are listed below. With completion of the first phase, the call in this announcement is seeking qualified postdoctoral research investigators interested in being funded to support research in the specified topical areas and to support interactions with the Intelligence Community advisors.Potential Fellows must be associated with an accredited U.S. university or college. Each Postdoctoral Fellow must be a U.S. citizen. The principal investigator / university mentor, is NOT required to be an U.S. Citizen.  SUBMISSION HIGHLIGHTS: The Government will evaluate all proposals submitted under the terms and conditions of this BAA. Government-paid consultants or subject matter experts may be involved in the evaluation and selection processes.  General: The CS, through NIMA as his executive agent, intends to award with FY03 funding. To be considered and evaluated the Government must receive the full proposal by the due time and date identified in the announcement. NIMA will send the offeror an acknowledgment of receipt of the submission, and will follow-up later with a notification letter announcing whether the proposal is being recommended for an award. Proposals will be evaluated against criteria described in the announcement. The estimated grant start date identified should be used for budget and proposal purposes. You may, however, request a later start date and may therefore develop your budget based on your proposed start date. Submission:  Proposals shall be formatted as one .doc file (or “zipped”.doc file) of a size not to exceed 1.95 Megabytes in total. The Government’s mail servers will not accept files of a greater size. The proposal shall reference BAA Number NMA 501-03-BAA-0001. Proposals shall be submitted electronically by e-mail and simultaneously to MoorJA@nima.mil and mpf&#64979;it@ticomeast.com. Content: Proposals must be complete and self-contained to qualify for review. Proposals shall be prepared single-spaced in 12-point Times New Roman font, with at least one-inch margins on top, bottom and sides, on 8½” by 11” paper. The Intelligence Community is concerned with research in specific areas of science and engineering. For this reason, all proposals must adequately describe the technical objectives and approaches, support of principal investigator and Postdoctoral Fellow, and expenditures for equipment, all of which will be evaluated by qualified reviewers. Separate attachments, such as institutional brochures or reprints that are not germane to the proposal, are discouraged.  Cover Page.  The cover page shall include the BAA number (NMA501-03-BAA-0001), proposal title, and topic or research area of interest. The cover page must also indicate the name, phone number, fax number, postal address, and e-mail address of both the principal investigator AND an appropriate official in the university's research administration office. Project Description: The project description portion of the proposal shall be limited to three pages and shall: Describe the proposed research objectives and approach to be undertaken. State the objectives and approach and the relationship to state-of-knowledge in the field and to similar work in progress. Include appropriate literature citations and prior work. Discuss the nature of expected results. Describe the expected outcomes and relevance to the Intelligence Community research need. Identify other parties to whom the proposal has been/will be sent.  Resume: The Resume shall be limited to two (2) pages each and shall provide the credentials of the principal investigator, demonstrating why the offeror is qualified to do the work proposed.  If a Postdoctoral Fellow has been identified, an additional resume, two (2) pages in length, may also be included. Cost: Beginning on a new page, the financial portion of the proposal should contain cost estimates in sufficient detail for meaningful review. The annual cost must be no greater than $100,000. At least 50% of this cost should be allocated for direct support of one full-time Postdoctoral Fellow, including salary and fringe benefits. The remaining funds can be allocated to a fraction of the principal investigator’s time, unique equipment needed to conduct the proposed research, other direct costs and university overhead. For proposal purposes, use the later of the estimated award start date per paragraph Error! Reference source not found. or the offeror’s proposed start date. Exceptions to the above-recommended allocation will need to be approved by the Chief Scientist.  The cost proposal must include the total cost of the project, as well as a breakdown of the amounts by source of funding (e.g., funds requested from the DCI Postdoctoral Research Fellowship Program, and/or institutional funds to be provided as cost sharing). The costs should be broken down for each year of the program and shown by three distinct totals: a total for the basic year and a total for each of the optional follow-on years. Although expected to be short, there is no page limit for the cost section of the proposal. Cost elements should include, but are not limited to: Time being charged to the project by the principal investigator and Postdoctoral Fellow, and their commensurate salaries and benefits.  
Costs of equipment based on most recent quotations and broken down in sufficient detail for evaluation (equipment costs should be budgeted primarily during the first year). Allowable equipment will ordinarily be limited to research equipment and apparatus not already available for the conduct of the work. General-purpose equipment, such as a personal computer, is not eligible for support unless primarily used in the actual conduct of the proposed scientific research. Travel costs and time, and the relevance to stated objectives. This shall include a breakdown of the name and number of travelers, location and duration; and estimated costs for transportation, rental car and per-diem.  This shall also include travel for the required attendance at the annual DCI Postdoctoral Research Fellowship Program colloquium in the spring of each year.   The colloquium is held in Washington D.C. area.  Other direct costs such as materials and supplies; publication, documentation and dissemination; computer services; communication costs not included in overhead; or others (identify).  These costs shall include at least one published article per year in the Journal of Intelligence Community Research and Development (JICRD).  This published article will need to be coordinated, vetted and submitted through the IC Advisor.  These certifications are located in Parts 25 and 28 of the DoD Grant and Agreement Regulation (DoDGARs), D0D 3210.6-R. This document is available electronically, under the heading "publications", at the following Internet site: http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/.  Also, it will be necessary for either the Dean or Provost at the University to acknowledge that they are receiving CIA Funds. Awards will be made for one year with two one-year options.  The Government expects to exercise the first year option assuming quality research is ongoing. Second year option will be the exception, rather than the rule.  The awards will be incremental funded at funding levels no greater than $100,000 per year, per award/option period.  SPECIFIC RESEARCH TOPICS FOR FY03 DCI POSTDOCTORAL RESEARCH FELLOWSHIP PROGRAM  The following 22 topics represent the Intelligence Community’s research interests particularly suited this year for investment.

<DESC>NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center plans to issue a Request for Proposal for a Safety Management System (SMS) Implementation Project in support of the GSFC's Safety and Environmental Branch, Code 205.2. This requirement necessitates in-depth knowledge and understanding of a comprehensive SMS and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Voluntary Protection Plan (VPP) requirements.  The vendor must possess the unique knowledge, skills and ability to facilitate the development and implementation of the SMS (modeled after the VPP elements) at a large government site with a mixed government and contract staff and a variety of mission requirements related to science, engineering research and development.    NASA/GSFC intends to purchase these services from STAR Consultants, Inc.  The authority for this action is 10 U.S.C. 2304(C)(1), Only One Responsible Source.  STAR Consultants, Inc., is uniquely qualified to provide the required service.  They are recognized as the national leader in training, educating and auditing of OSHA, EPA, VPP, Cooperative Compliance Programs and Program Performance Measures.  Through the application of diverse hands-on experience with private industry, government (including NASA) and insurance sectors, STAR is noted for providing cost effective and sound solutions.  STAR has successfully tethered professional experience and academic backgrounds with excellent communications skills to deliver a complete management package that would greatly benefit GSFC.  In addition, STAR Consultants has developed a software tool that assists in quantifying safety performance against the 28 VPP elements, therefore, would be invaluable to the Center's efforts to continually improve its safety record.	STAR Consultants is considered to be the only known source capable of providing the Government with the required service.  An option is included to provide a Qualitative Risk Analysis of the Code 200 and 500 Directorates as requirements and budget constraints permit.   The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.  See Note 26. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on  March 13, 2003.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. An Ombudsman has been appointed.  See NASA Specific Note "B". All qualified responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.

The purpose of the  campaign is to encourage consumers to focus on the label as a vital  source of information for the selection, safe use,  and appropriate storage and disposal of household consumer products, and to improve consumer understanding of  the information presented on product labels.  As part of its Read the Label First educational campaign, the consumer  labeling  initiative team has produced and made available for distribution by stakeholders promotional items such as  eight inch long bag clips, round rubber jar openers, business card sized magnets, twelve inch rulers, small round logo  stickers, etc.  There are approximately forty orders of varying sizes  to be processed.  These orders should be filled  within three weeks from the date on which the contract is awarded.  There are approximately 204,500 items or  approximately six thousand pounds of items to be stored.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Optical Technology Division (OTD) intends to modify an existing order with Virial, Inc.  The modification will be issued on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b) Only One Source Reasonably Available.  OTD has several projects that use integrating sphere devices for high accuracy measurements:  The Fourier Transform Spectrophotometry Project, the Spectral Directional Emittance Project, and the Spectral Irradiance and Radiance Calibration Using Uniform Sources Project.  The current order with Virial, Inc is to optimize the instrumentation design, improve measurement methods, and reduce measurement uncertainties.  Monte-Carlo based ray-tracing computational models have been developed and implemented to optimize the instrumentation design, improve measurement methods, and reduce measurement uncertainties.  The modification will add the following subtasks:  TASK 1, MODEL INTEGRATING SPHERE FOR INFRARED REFLECTANCE, SUBTASK 1.1.The contractor shall incorporate real BRDF behavior for the sphere walls and extend geometry of the sphere design capability to include source/detector positions away from direct opposition to the entrance/exit port.
TASK 2, MODEL INTEGRATING SPHERE FOR INFRARED EMITTANCE, SUBTASK 2.1.  The contractor shall incorporate real BRDF behavior for the sphere walls into the existing emittance sphere ray tracing code.  TASK 3, MODEL BLACKBODIES, SUBTASK 3.1.  The contractor shall prepare portions of manuscripts for journal publication describing (1) the results of analyses using the black sphere modeling code and (2) the uncertainty derivation and budget for the emittance sample temperature measurement.  TASK 4, DEVELOP BRDF MODEL, SUBTASK 4.1.  The contractor shall develop several BRDF models to simulate real BRDF data for several types of materials including those approaching but not perfectly diffuse. As stated in SUBTASKS 1.1. and 2.1., these shall be added into the reflectance and emittance sphere model codes.   The contractor shall prepare a presentation and manuscript for a proceedings or journal publication describing the program and analysis results.
Virial, Inc has extensive experience in the field of radiometric numerical modeling and published a wide range of software that can simulate blackbodies, integrating spheres, and other radiometric systems with a high degree of accuracy.  Codes developed enable numerous numerical studies that directly result in improved designs that are incorporated into the construction of radiometric instruments that are used at NIST.  Fidelity to physical laws and reciprocity are critical to accurate radiometric modeling.  These critical factors are combined in VIRIAL, INC. modeling.  Additionally, the proposed contractor is well published in scientific journals and has the capability to publish the results that NIST requires as a work product.  Award may be for 12 months with a 1 year option.  THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITION; no solicitation is available, however, interested parties may express, in writing, their interest and document their bona fide capability to fulfill the requirement NLT March 13, 4 PM EST.  Such information will be reviewed to determine if it is necessary to conduct a competitive procurement.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.

The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) intends to solicit proposals for a five-year, Performance Based Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity Contract (IQC or IDIQ), utilizing either Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP) or Cost-Reimbursement (cost-plus-fixed-fee) (CPFF), Cost Reimbursement-no fee, pricing/payment methods for task orders to be issued. We anticipate that the solicitation will be released on or about January 24, 2002. This RFP incorporates the services previously synopsized under M/OP-01-994 for Womens Legal Rights. USAID will be making multiple awards (up to six) for technical assistance and advisory services to support mission in the Bureau for Economic Growth, Agriculture and Trade, Office of Women in Development to help ensure that women participate fully and benefit equally from U.S. development assistance programs. [The RFP will result in the award of up to six (6) Indefinite Quantity Contracts (IQCs); up to three under full and open competition, two under a partial set-aside for small business concerns, and one under a set-aside for small disadvantaged business (8[a]) concerns]. Today the Bureau for Economic Growth, Agriculture and Trade, Office of Women in Development office assists the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) with integration of gender concerns into all USAID programs, coordinates with the donor community, and identifies emerging issues where gender is a key concern. The office has four strategic objectives: Enhancing the economic status of women; Expanding educational opportunities for girls and women; Improving women's legal rights and increasing their participation in civil society; and Integrating gender considerations throughout USAID programs. In pursuing these objectives, the WID Office supports technical assistance and training for USAID Missions, host countries and non-governmental organizations (NOGs); promotes greater awareness of gender issues through publications and conferences; and funds studies of emerging issues. The purpose of this contract is to acquire quick-response short- and long-term technical services, including reports and other deliverables, for the implementation of EGAT/WIDs strategy, which includes support to other USAID operating units in integrating gender considerations into their programs and activities. The quick-response short- and long-term technical services into five major areas:(1)Technical Assistance and Training;(2)Legal;(3)Communications and Outreach (including conference planning and implementation);(4) Grants; and(5)Research. USAID encourages the participation to the maximum extent possible of U.S. small businesses, U.S. small disadvantaged businesses, U.S. women-owned small businesses, and U.S. HUBZone small businesses in this activity as prime or subcontractors in accordance with Part 19 of the FAR. In this respect, it is anticipated that the prime contractor will make every reasonable effort to identify and make maximum practicable use of such concerns. To help identify potential subcontractors, a list of all organizations requesting a copy of the solicitation will be included with each solicitation issued. By providing the list, USAID does not endorse the listed organizations as being capable of carrying out the activity, nor does USAID verify the claimed status of the organizations. Necessarily, the list will contain the names of only those organizations known prior to the issuance of the solicitation. Telephone requests for the RFP will not be honored. The preferred method of distribution of USAID procurement information is via the Internet or by request of a solicitation on a 3.5 Floppy Disk.

<DESC>THIS PROPOSED PROGRAM IS 100% SET ASIDE FOR SMALL BUSINESS CONCERNS.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 518210 and the business size standard is not to exceed  $21M. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), National Institute of Health (NIH), will make available a request for proposal (RFP) to interested offerors with the ability to serve as a Data Coordinating Center (DCC) for a new five-year multi-center research program, the Lung Tissue Research Consortium (LTRC). The overall objective of the LTRC is to enable better management of lung diseases by increasing understanding of the pathogenetic mechanisms of these diseases through molecular histopathological studies of human lung tissues with and without disease.  The LTRC will facilitate histopathological research of pulmonary diseases by collecting lung tissues from donors and preparing and distributing collections of tissue specimens to researchers within and outside the Consortium. Primary emphases will be on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Collections of specimens will be linked to extensive, individual clinical data appropriate to the particular disease.  Donor subjects will be recruited for specific enrollment groups that are designed to address important research questions.  The consortium will be comprised of Clinical Centers (CC), RFP-NHLBI-HR-04-08; a Tissue Processing and Distribution Center (TC), RFP-NHLBI-HR-09; a Radiology Center (RC), RFP-NHLBI-HR-10; and a DCC.  Offerors are strongly encouraged to read the RFPs for all of these components of the LTRC to better understand the overall structure and function of the Consortium.  The Principle Investigator of the DCC will have expertise in biostatistic and clinical research study design and support the protocol development, including power and sample size calculations.  The Principle Investigator will be responsible for the statistical approaches and the overall performance within the DCC.  The DCC will plan and make all arrangements for meetings and teleconference calls of the LTRC; participate and assist the TC in site visits of the CCs by the TC; verify that potential subjects are eligible for recruitment into specific enrollment groups; coordinate the electronic transfer of clinical data from the CCs to the DCC; maintain an electronic repository of clinical data collected from LTRC subjects, together with descriptive histopathological analyses from the TC and descriptive reports and radiographic measures of lung disease from the RC; maintain computer software necessary to process, store, and analyze data furnished by the CCs, TC, and RC; maintain a liaison with each CC to assist in the solution of operational problems involved in data collection and reporting; assist CC staff in data management and administrative functions; prepare public use data sets corresponding to tissue collections prepared by the TC; direct the TC and the RC to provide specified LTRC resources and public use data sets to investigators approved for access; perform statistical analyses for investigators for research studies that utilize LTRC materials; prepare progress reports of the LTRC; and develop, maintain and enhance a LTRC web site. ******This is not a RFP and the Government is not committed to award a contract pursuant to this notice.  It is anticipated that  RFP-NHLBI-HR-04-11, Lung Tissue Research Consortium: Data Coordinating Center, will be available on or fifteen (15) days after the publication of this notice through the NHLBI Website at: http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/funding/inits/index.htm#rfp and posted on FedBizOpps at: http://www.fedbizopps.gov.

<DESC>THIS PROPOSED PROGRAM IS 100% SET ASIDE FOR SMALL BUSINESS CONCERNS.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 518210 and the business size standard is not to exceed  $21M. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), National Institute of Health (NIH), will make available a request for proposal (RFP) to interested offerors with the ability to serve as a Data Coordinating Center (DCC) for a new five-year multi-center research program, the Lung Tissue Research Consortium (LTRC). The overall objective of the LTRC is to enable better management of lung diseases by increasing understanding of the pathogenetic mechanisms of these diseases through molecular histopathological studies of human lung tissues with and without disease.  The LTRC will facilitate histopathological research of pulmonary diseases by collecting lung tissues from donors and preparing and distributing collections of tissue specimens to researchers within and outside the Consortium. Primary emphases will be on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Collections of specimens will be linked to extensive, individual clinical data appropriate to the particular disease.  Donor subjects will be recruited for specific enrollment groups that are designed to address important research questions.  The consortium will be comprised of Clinical Centers (CC), RFP-NHLBI-HR-04-08; a Tissue Processing and Distribution Center (TC), RFP-NHLBI-HR-09; a Radiology Center (RC), RFP-NHLBI-HR-10; and a DCC.  Offerors are strongly encouraged to read the RFPs for all of these components of the LTRC to better understand the overall structure and function of the Consortium.  The Principle Investigator of the DCC will have expertise in biostatistic and clinical research study design and support the protocol development, including power and sample size calculations.  The Principle Investigator will be responsible for the statistical approaches and the overall performance within the DCC.  The DCC will plan and make all arrangements for meetings and teleconference calls of the LTRC; participate and assist the TC in site visits of the CCs by the TC; verify that potential subjects are eligible for recruitment into specific enrollment groups; coordinate the electronic transfer of clinical data from the CCs to the DCC; maintain an electronic repository of clinical data collected from LTRC subjects, together with descriptive histopathological analyses from the TC and descriptive reports and radiographic measures of lung disease from the RC; maintain computer software necessary to process, store, and analyze data furnished by the CCs, TC, and RC; maintain a liaison with each CC to assist in the solution of operational problems involved in data collection and reporting; assist CC staff in data management and administrative functions; prepare public use data sets corresponding to tissue collections prepared by the TC; direct the TC and the RC to provide specified LTRC resources and public use data sets to investigators approved for access; perform statistical analyses for investigators for research studies that utilize LTRC materials; prepare progress reports of the LTRC; and develop, maintain and enhance a LTRC web site. ******This is not a RFP and the Government is not committed to award a contract pursuant to this notice.  It is anticipated that  RFP-NHLBI-HR-04-11, Lung Tissue Research Consortium: Data Coordinating Center, will be available on or fifteen (15) days after the publication of this notice through the NHLBI Website at: http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/funding/inits/index.htm#rfp and posted on FedBizOpps at: http://www.fedbizopps.gov.  No collect calls will be accepted.

<SUBJECT>13--Anti-Structure Munition (ASM) Round/ Improved Smoke Rounds
<SOLNBR>DAAE30-03-Q-0231
<RESPDATE>032803
<CONTACT>Mary Lou Desseaux, Contract Specialist, (973)724-3217
<DESC>NA The U.S. Government is seeking information on potential candidates for mmediate  procurement or rapid development of an Anti-Structure Munition (ASM) Round for  the U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) Multi-Role Anti-Armor Anti- Personnel Weapon System (MAAWS).  The current MAAWS program is the Non- Developmental Item (NDI) acquisition of the Saab Bofors Dynamics Carl Gustaf  84mm recoilless rifle system.  The U.S. Government does not own data rights to  the system.  USSOCOM has a requirement for a MAAWS round that will incapacitate  personnel protected outside the line-of-sight of the projectile detonation  inside of man-made or natural protective structures/confined spaces. The ASM  round must be capable of entering enclosures through existing openings; it is  desired that the round be capable of entering urban structures constructed  using 8 inch reinforced concrete or 12 inch triple brick walls where no opening  exists.  The desired ASM round explosive payload is 2,200 grams.  The round  must be capable of achieving a 0.25 probability of hit against a 1m X 1.2m  target at a range of 300 meters, with 500 meters desired.  It is also desired  that the round match the flight trajectory of a fielded MAAWS round.  The ASM  round fuzing must meet U.S. safe and arming device requirements.  The fuze must  function the round upon impact; airburst or delay function modes are desired.   Minimum fuze arming distance must be 20 meters, with 15 meters desired; it is  also desired that the round reach safe separation distance prior to reaching  the minimum arming distance.  The Government also seeks information on a  potential upgraded Smoke round for the MAAWS.  The round must provide the  capability to obscure or mark targets with a dense visible smoke screen no less  than 10 meters in diameter.  Duration should exceed 15 seconds under stable  (0-3 knots) wind conditions.  The round must be capable of functioning between  ranges of 100 meters and 800 meters, with maximum range of 1000 meters  desired.  The time of flight to 1000 meters must be 10 seconds or less.  It is  also desired that the round match the flight trajectory of the fielded MAAWS  Smoke 469B round.  The ASM round fuzing must meet U.S. safe and arming device  requirements.  The fuze must function the round upon impact.  For both the ASM  and Smoke rounds, the total weight of the complete cartridge and projectile  must not exceed 10 pounds.  The rounds must be completely compatible with the  Saab Bofors Dynamics 84mm M3 Carl Gustaf recoilless rifle.  Because the  Government does not own data rights to the weapon, potential offerors must  request required weapon data from Saab Bofors Dynamics, Karlskoga, Sweden.  The  round must be capable of being rigged for airborne and submersible operations  in accordance with existing service procedures.  The round must be sufficiently  rugged to remain safe, operational and effective following exposure to the  rigors normally associated with military operations, including air delivery and  salt water submersion.  A fully developed round is desired, development effort  not to exceed 24 months to delivery of production configuration is acceptable.   Contractor/Government teaming to streamline the effort, perform concurrent test  and evaluation will be utilized.  The round must meet U.S. safety and  performance requirements.  In response to this survey, information shall be  provided on the following areas and topics.  Additional information and topics  are also encouraged.  All responses to this survey must be in the English  language.  Item Status:  Information shall be provided that shows item  production status or how each item will be developed.  It shall include  information on the design, fabrication and tests conducted or to be conducted  to validate the design.  Compatibility with the Bofors M3 Carl Gustaf system  must be specifically addressed.  Cost/Schedule:  Actual or expected production  unit costs for both round types shall be provided.  If development is required,  projections of development costs for both items from start of work to delivery  of approximately 400 production representative end items for U.S. Government  qualification, along with supporting safety, performance and design data shall  be provided.  The time required to deliver both the test items and data for  each round shall also be provided.  Safety Program:  Information shall be  provided on existing system safety engineering capability and experience in  meeting U.S. Army, Navy and Air Force health and safety requirements.   Industrial Preparedness:  Information shall be provided on round availability,  including a summary of facilities and tooling available to support development  and production.  Production history for recoilless rifle systems or munitions  shall be submitted to demonstrate past performance, with emphasis on work  performed for the U.S. Government.  Acquisition Teaming:  Information shall be  provided describing experience in teaming with a customer, to include level of  involvement with emphasis on participation in U.S. Government defense  acquisition teams.

The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) intends to solicit proposals for a five-year, Performance Based Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity Contract (IQC or IDIQ), utilizing either Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP) or Cost-Reimbursement (cost-plus-fixed-fee) (CPFF), Cost Reimbursement-no fee, pricing/payment methods for task orders to be issued. We anticipate that the solicitation will be released on or about January 24, 2002. This RFP incorporates the services previously synopsized under M/OP-01-994 for Womens Legal Rights. USAID will be making multiple awards (up to six) for technical assistance and advisory services to support mission in the Bureau for Economic Growth, Agriculture and Trade, Office of Women in Development to help ensure that women participate fully and benefit equally from U.S. development assistance programs. [The RFP will result in the award of up to six (6) Indefinite Quantity Contracts (IQCs); up to three under full and open competition, two under a partial set-aside for small business concerns, and one under a set-aside for small disadvantaged business (8[a]) concerns]. Today the Bureau for Economic Growth, Agriculture and Trade, Office of Women in Development office assists the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) with integration of gender concerns into all USAID programs, coordinates with the donor community, and identifies emerging issues where gender is a key concern. The office has four strategic objectives: Enhancing the economic status of women; Expanding educational opportunities for girls and women; Improving women's legal rights and increasing their participation in civil society; and Integrating gender considerations throughout USAID programs. In pursuing these objectives, the WID Office supports technical assistance and training for USAID Missions, host countries and non-governmental organizations (NOGs); promotes greater awareness of gender issues through publications and conferences; and funds studies of emerging issues. The purpose of this contract is to acquire quick-response short- and long-term technical services, including reports and other deliverables, for the implementation of EGAT/WIDs strategy, which includes support to other USAID operating units in integrating gender considerations into their programs and activities. The quick-response short- and long-term technical services into five major areas:(1)Technical Assistance and Training;(2)Legal;(3)Communications and Outreach (including conference planning and implementation);(4) Grants; and(5)Research. USAID encourages the participation to the maximum extent possible of U.S. small businesses, U.S. small disadvantaged businesses, U.S. women-owned small businesses, and U.S. HUBZone small businesses in this activity as prime or subcontractors in accordance with Part 19 of the FAR. In this respect, it is anticipated that the prime contractor will make every reasonable effort to identify and make maximum practicable use of such concerns. To help identify potential subcontractors, a list of all organizations requesting a copy of the solicitation will be included with each solicitation issued. By providing the list, USAID does not endorse the listed organizations as being capable of carrying out the activity, nor does USAID verify the claimed status of the organizations. Necessarily, the list will contain the names of only those organizations known prior to the issuance of the solicitation. Telephone requests for the RFP will not be honored. The preferred method of distribution of USAID procurement information is via the Internet or by request of a solicitation on a 3.5 Floppy Disk.

<DESC>The Missile Defense Agency's (MDA) Joint National Integration Center (JNIC), located at Schriever AFB, CO, is seeking potential sources for JNIC Technical Advisory and Assistance Services (JTAAS).  The JNIC intends to utilize the MDA Basic Support Services Program (BSSP) approach for acquiring advisory and assistance services, adapted to meet the special requirements of the JNIC.  The BSSP process utilizes the General Services Administration (GSA) Multiple Award Schedule Program.  See the "Executive Summary, MDA Support Services Program, Adapted to Meet JNIC Requirements, Revision 1," on the JNIC web site at http://www.jntf.osd.mil/Programs/AMD/ESAS/Showfiles.asp.

SMALL BUSINESS PREFERENCE.  This is a small business preference acquisition (provided the JNIC determines there are at least three highly qualified small businesses capable of fulfilling the requirement).  Potential Offerors* for this order shall be a single small business GSA contractor or a team led by a small business with at least one existing applicable GSA Schedule contract under the GSA Multiple Award Schedule Program.  An Offeror submitting a Capabilities Statement shall indicate in its response to this FedBizOpps Sources Sought Announcement that the Offeror was awarded a GSA schedule contract, or option period extension to the contract, as a small business, and that the Offeror, including qualifying small business team members, are currently small businesses meeting the small business standard under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) 541710, Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences, Size Standard 1,000 employees, who will perform over 50% of the labor and dollar value of the contract.

<DESC>MARKET SURVEY REQUEST FOR INFORMATION .  
RFI  Reference No. WMOK-03-004. The Air Armament Center?s Combat Support Systems Program Office at Eglin AFB FL requests information for a Heater, Forced Air, Re-Circulating, Indirect Fuel-Fired for extreme cold weather.  The Air Force plans on comparing viable heater candidates against current heater baselines/upgrades.  FSC Classification is 41. The NAIC Code is 339999 with a size standard of 500.
The Air Force will use the heater with the Air Force?s small shelter system (~5,100 cubic feet volume requiring one heater), medium shelter system (~17,200 cubic feet, two heaters) and TEMPER tents (~5,100 cubic feet, one heater).  Each has an aluminum frame covered with PVC coated polyester fabric cladding and an internal liner.  The Air Force uses several types of shelter floors such as, but not limited to insulated padding or plywood.  The heater will sit outside the shelter and connect using supply and return flexible ducts via 18 inch diameter, shelter wall openings. The heater will maintain a comfortable environment inside the shelters under ambient temperatures from minus 25 degrees to 60 degrees Fahrenheit.  Based on recent tests, this program office estimates a heater capacity range of 120,000 to 150,000 BTU/hr and approximates an airflow performance of 1,000 CFM at 1.5 inch water gage of static pressure.  The heater will re-circulate air from the shelter while providing adjustment from 0 to approximately 200 CFM of fresh air.  The heater will have a properly sized fan to ensure sufficient airflow and minimal stratification inside the shelter.  The heater will have an integrated fuel tank with a 12-hour minimum run time.  The heater should have JP-8 and diesel fuel capability, variable output adjustment, provisions for external fuel connection, and de-fueling procedures for storage or shipping.  Safety is important; the heater will have safety devices and features normally associated with portable heaters. The heater must be compatible with requirements for military airlift in that it will be stackable, capable of being restrained up to 4.5g, and make efficient use of the 463L pallet system.  The heater?s internal components should resist in up to 4.5g force without breaking loose and becoming a hazard.  The heater, when shipped or stored, will have appropriate covers or other arrangements to prohibit rodents or insects intrusion and habitation. The heater should be simple and reliable by utilizing proven commercial technology.  For instance, the design of the heater should minimize or eliminate features that are difficult to maintain such as, but not limited to small screws and complex controls.  The heater will also be capable of being easily moved by two people in less than ideal conditions--tall grass, mud, and snow. The heater will be ruggedized to resist the damage encountered during transportation, 15 years of storage, and 5 years of use in a field environment without degradation of safety or effectiveness.  In addition to meeting the above listed requirements, the Air Force may use the heater to support the Collectively Protected Expeditionary Medical Support (CP EMEDS) system and other Joint Service expeditionary needs, which include supporting 640 square feet  transportable collectively protected shelters.  As such, it is desired the heater be operable in remote austere locations under toxic wartime and peacetime contaminated environments.  Operation in NBC mode requires compatibility to filtration systems, such as the FFA 400 or M28 Motor Blower.  None of the specific features or capabilities contained in this request are intended to discourage any potential offeror from presenting innovative solutions, features, or arrangements that will safely and effectively heat the shelters specified in the cold weather conditions outlined. All solutions are being considered.  In order to promote an environment of development of a partnering/teaming for a possible new acquisition, we are involving industry in the very early development of this acquisition.  In order to initiate an exchange of information, we are requesting that interested parties submit any or both of the following:  (1) an up to ten page paper, with pictures/sketches if applicable, that identifies existing solutions for such a unit, and (2) product brochures or marketing materials.  Responses to this Market Survey/Request for Information should be received no later than 19 Mar 2003 mailed to AAC/WMO, 314 W. Choctawhatchee Ave, Suite 104, Attn: 2nd Lt. Brant Lagoon, at Ph.
