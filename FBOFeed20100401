<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD A SOLE SOURCE PROCUREMENT FOR the Defense Production Act (DPA) Title III Terahertz (THz) Spectrometer Project. This is a pre-solicitation synopsis which is not a request for competitive proposals. The U.S. Government is contemplating this procurement under the authority of Title III of the Defense Production Act (50 U.S.C. App. Section 2061 et seq.). This project will leverage prior work performed in conjunction with the Army Research Laboratory in the development of a THz Spectrometer, capable of detecting hazardous materials; specifically explosives, chemical agents, and biological agents. The intent of this project is to reduce the size and weight of the current unit; ruggedize it, and develop the necessary production processes and procedures to increase the manufacturing readiness and affordability of the unit. At the conclusion of this project, the THz Spectrometer will be portable, ruggedized, capable of autonomous operation, and will be suited to operating in field (non-laboratory) environments. The offeror shall develop the necessary manufacturing capacity, processes and procedures to increase yield, reduce unit cost, and improve the reliability of the existing THz Spectrometers. This project will ultimately provide an improved explosives and chemical/biological agent detection capability for the U.S. Government. The offeror shall document its current hazardous materials detection capabilities, and maintain and expand an existing signature database of these materials as new system capabilities are established. The DPA Title III Program Office intends to award a Technology Investment Agreement (TIA) on the basis of less than full and open competition for this requirement to Goodrich ISR Systems, 100 Wooster Heights Road, Danbury, CT 06810. Per DPA Title III law, the offeror must possess domestic development and production capabilities. The offeror must demonstrate it possesses marketing and customer sales experience in the production and sales of THz Spectrometers to the Government. The period of performance for the procurement is anticipated to be 24 months. Key tasks will include: development and implementation of production improvement plans addressing unit cost, quality, yields, and delivery; continued support to Government customers regarding their unique product specifications and necessary unit qualifications; analysis of the explosives and chemical/biological detection community marketplace; and development and implementation of a comprehensive strategic business plan and a marketing plan that addresses both Government and commercial applications for this technology. The Government intends to issue an award for these requirements on a Sole Source basis per FAR 6.302-1(a)(1), "Only One Responsible Source" or "DoD Grant and Agreement Regulations 37.400 (b)," based on the aforementioned requirements, as well as an assessment of technical and programmatic risk to the Government. Offerors who are capable of meeting the requirements stated above shall fully identify their interest and submit, in writing (either electronically or mail), to the POCs listed above, information documenting their qualifications and capabilities to meet the requirements stated above within 15 days after publication of this synopsis. This documentation shall specify the offeror's area of expertise and experience. It shall identify the offeror's current production capabilities and capacities for producing THz Spectrometers that are capable of detecting hazardous materials such as explosives, chemical agents and biological agents. The offer shall provide documentation that it possesses sufficient company infrastructure to support the production of THz Spectrometers. Documentation shall also include a listing of products and services currently offered along with market share. The documentation shall identify relevant production experience, and a listing of both Government and commercial customers that currently possess and utilize the offeror's THz Spectrometer products for detection of explosives as well as chemical and biological agents. Responses received after 15 days or without the required information will be considered non-responsive to the synopsis, and will not be considered. Direct all questions pertaining to this acquisition to the contracting point of contacts listed above in this announcement. Only one responsible source per capability of interest and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements as per the authority under 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1). All responsible sources may submit information, which shall be considered by the agency. See Numbered Note 22.*****

<p>Description <br />The US Department of Education anticipates the release of the subject solicitation on or about March 29, 2010. The Institute of Education Sciences (IES) at the U.S. Department of Education (ED) is conducting a broad assessment of programs being implemented under the newly passed American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. As part of this effort, the U.S. Department of Education intends to award a hybrid contract to conduct an integrated evaluation of how states are using ARRA funds and whether there appears to be a relationship between the use of the funds and student outcomes. The main purpose of this evaluation is to determine how states, districts and schools are using ARRA funds and whether the use of these funds is associated with student outcomes. Information gathered shall address the following research questions:</p>
<p>1. Money: Which states/districts/schools get which program funds, when, and how much? What do they spend it on? How much overlap is there across ARRA funding streams in terms of who receives the funding or what grantees do with it?</p>
<p>2. Strategies: What efforts and activities are underway as a result of each of the ARRA programs and overall? What state policies are changing or being enacted? What specific interventions are districts and schools implementing? How do the strategies line up with the four assurances or with the specific strategies promoted by the different programs?</p>
<p>3. Implementation Process: How much coordination do states and districts report in the decision-making and planning for implementation across the various streams of funds? Are districts that receive funds directly (e.g., thru I3) employing strategies that are consistent with their state's policies and plans (e.g., under Race to the Top)? On an ongoing basis, what challenges do grantees face in enacting their plans and what successes have they had?</p>
<p>4. Outcomes: Is receiving more ARRA funds or certain types of funds associated with improvement in student outcomes or other key measures (e.g., more equitable distribution of teacher quality)?</p>
<p>The base contract is for 48 months, with two options at ED's discretion that would extend the contract to 60 months.</p>
<p>ARRA provides approximately $100 billion to the U.S. Department of Education, with the initial goal of delivering emergency education funding to states and investing in education and other essential public services to ensure the long-term economic health of the nation. A large part of this funding is intended to replace state revenues that may have been lost due to economic conditions. But at the same time, the ARRA funding is being used as an opportunity to spur innovation and reform at different levels of the U.S. educational system. To support these objectives, ARRA requires those receiving grant funds to commit to four core reforms (the four "assurances"): (1) adopting rigorous college-ready and career ready standards and high quality assessments, (2) establishing data systems and using data to improve performance, (3) increasing teacher effectiveness and the equitable distribution of effective teachers, and (4) turning around the lowest performing schools.</p>
<p>NOTE: Integrated Evaluation of American Recovery and Reinvestment ACT (ARRA) Funding, Implementation and Outcomes shall not be funded with ARRA funds.</p>

This notice constitutes a BAA as contemplated by FAR 6.102(d)(2). TECHNICAL POC: Mr. Nam Phan (301) 342-9359</p>
<p>I. INTRODUCTION. The NAVAL AIR SYSTEMS COMMAND (NAVAIR) and the Structures and Materials Engineering Divisions under the Air Vehicle Department (AIR-4.3) are soliciting proposals for research and development (R&amp;D) concepts in the area of structures and materials to support current and future Naval Aviation needs. Concepts proposed may represent novel dedicated technologies and/or dual use of new emerging commercial technology.</p>
<p>II. BACKGROUND. The missions of the Structures and Materials Engineering Divisions of the NAVAIR Air Vehicle Department are to identify and pursue the most promising technologies within a broad spectrum of the science and engineering research communities and to develop, evaluate, and transition those technologies into NAVAL AIR SYSTEMS to impart new military capabilities. To this end, NAVAIR is soliciting proposals for advanced research and development in a variety of enabling technical areas as described below. Proposals may be either basic or applied research. Proposals that are not research, but rather integration of technologies or systems development will also be considered. Multiple awards are anticipated. The amount of resources made available to this BAA will depend on the quality of the proposals received and the availability of funds. While there is no specific requirement for cost and duration of the proposed effort, it is recommended that proposer include a Phase I of no more than 18 months in length that addresses the most critical issues on the path to success. This BAA constitutes the entire solicitation for this effort. No Proposer Information Pamphlet or other additional information will be published, nor will a formal request for proposal, or other solicitation, regarding this research and development be issued. Requests for same will be disregarded. <br /><br />III. SPECIFIC AREAS OF INTEREST. New Structures and Materials, Structural and Material Concepts, Structural Analysis, Modeling and Simulation, and Materials Processing applied to metals, ceramics, polymers, and composites. Specific areas of interest include, but are not limited to: development and application of new and improved structural concepts, analytical modeling and simulation, life tracking, resins, structural reinforcing fibers, core and foam materials, adhesives, and sealants/coatings for naval aviation applications; new and/or lower cost manufacturing processes for structural components (including tooling); new and novel materials, processes and design methods for structural repair; process modeling; engineered materials for low-observable applications; high temperature resins/adhesives; structural and non-structural adhesives, Applique and paint replacement film materials, environmentally compliant surface preparations for bonding, non-chromated and organic corrosion inhibitors for sealants and/or adhesives, novel approaches to toughened resins for prepregs and adhesives; composite property/life prediction and related technologies; fracture phenomena of polymers &amp; composites; galvanic corrosion ; Optical materials and coatings for aircraft transparencies and their repair; and structural and multifunctional (structure + function) materials. Ideas outside of the advertised focused areas will be considered in scope provided they have the potential for radical improvement to national security and are within the interest of the office. IV.</p>
<p>CONTRACT/AGREEMENT TYPE. NAVAIR is willing to consider various types of acquisition vehicles including, but not limited to, traditional FAR/DFARS type contracts and/or non-procurement agreements (e.g. Grants, Cooperative Agreements and Other Transactions). Other Transactions will be entered into under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2371, and Section 845, Authority to Carry Out Certain Prototype Projects. Information<br />concerning Other Transactions can be found at http://www.darpa.mil/cmo/grants.html and http://www.acq.osd.mil/ddre/research. Final decision on acquisition type (contract/agreement) will be made by the government. <br /><br />NOTE: Typically, research findings result in the need for additional services/supplies, which are not possible to anticipate or project. Contract modifications may be executed to satisfy these requirements; thereby providing for flexibility in technology assessment (with technology transition the ultimate goal). In the event that this is required, it shall be considered to be within the scope of this BAA and the resulting contract, and therefore will have met the requirements of the FAR/DFARS and the Competition in Contracting Act.

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division (NAWCWD) intends to procure and award, on an other than full and open competition basis in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, a Fixed Price contract with National Technical Systems (NTS) in Littleton, CO.
Ordnance Assessment Testing (OA), previously called Quality Evaluation (QE), for several programs was located at Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWC) Crane.  This testing is conducted at regular intervals for each explosive and non-explosive component in all of the current weapons systems in the fleet.  Some of this testing included detonating explosive leads and boosters and measuring the detonation velocity of that blast wave as it moves through the item.  This was done for many years by NSWC Crane using a Fiber Optic Test Set designed and built by National Testing Systems (NTS) in Littleton, CO.  In order to maintain comparable data during the Base Re-Alignment Commission (BRAC) transition, and to enable Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division (NAWCWD), China Lake to perform these same tests, it is necessary to procure a test set that will perform the same function.  
Anticipated award is September 2010 or earlier and required delivery will be 6 months after contract award.  This notice is not a request for competitive proposals; however, any firms believing they can fulfill the requirement of providing the Fiber Optic Test Set may submit a written response, which shall be considered by the agency.  The written response shall reference solicitation number N68936-10-R-0044 and clearly show the firm's capability, background, experience and assets necessary to perform the required work mentioned above without compromising the quality, accuracy, reliability, and delivery of the product.  Written response shall be submitted by e-mail to sheena.tang@navy.mil or mailed to Commander, Code 254100D (Sheena Tang), NACAIRWARCENWPNSDIV, 429 E. Bowen Rd. Mail Stop 4015, China Lake, CA 93555-6108 within 15 days from the Notice date.  See numbered note 22.

The Government physically does not have in its possession sufficient, accurate, or legible data to purchase this part from other than the current source(s). Only the source(s) previously approved by the government for this item have been solicited. The subject item requires Government source approval prior to contract award, as the item is flight critical and/or the technical data available has not been determined adequate to support acquisition via full and open competition. The time required for approval of a new source is normally such that an award cannot be delayed pending approval of a new source. If you are not an approved source you must submit, together with your proposal, the information detailed in the "https://www.neco.navy.mil/sar.aspx" Naval Inventory Control Point Philadelphia Source Approval Information Brochure. This brochure can be obtained by calling NAVICP Phila at 215-697-4243. You may also obtain this information online by searching for "source approval request" at www.navsup.navy.mil. This brochure identifies technical data required to be submitted based on your companys experience in production of the same or similar item, or if this is an item you have never made. If your request for source approval is currently being evaluated at NAVICP-P, submit with your offer a copy of the cover letter which forwarded your request for source approval.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC><BR><BR>1.  DESCRIPTION OF INTENT:<BR><BR>THIS IS A MARKET RESEARCH QUESTIONNAIRE REQUESTING INFORMATION IN SUPPORT OF A POTENTIAL REQUIREMENT.  No contract will be awarded from this announcement.  This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an announcement of a forthcoming solicitation, nor is it a request seeking contractors to be placed on a solicitation mailing list.  Response to this questionnaire is voluntary and no reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this market research and any follow-on information requests.  Data submitted in response to this market research will not be returned.  No solicitation document exists at this time, and calls requesting a solicitation will not be answered.<BR><BR>2.  GENERAL INFORMATION: The Government appreciates the time and effort taken to respond to this survey.  The Government acknowledges its obligations under 18 U.S.C. 1905 to protect information qualifying as confidential under this statute. [To avoid possible confusion with the meaning of the term confidential in the context of Classified Information, we will use the term PROPRIETARY.] Pursuant to this statute, the Government is willing to accept any PROPRIETARY (e.g., trade secret) restrictions placed on qualifying data forwarded in response to the survey questions and to protect it from unauthorized disclosure subject to the following:<BR> <BR>	1. Clearly and conspicuously mark qualifying data with the restrictive legend (all caps) PROPRIETARY with any explanatory text, so that the Government is clearly notified of what data needs to be appropriately protected.<BR><BR>	2.  In marking such data, please take care to mark only those portions of the data or materials that are truly proprietary (over breadth in marking inappropriate data as PROPRIETARY may diminish or eliminate the usefulness of your response - see item 6 below).  Use circling, underscoring, highlighting or any other appropriate means to indicate those portions of a single page which are to be protected.<BR> <BR>	3.  The Government is not obligated to protect unmarked data. Additionally, marked data that is already in the public domain or in the possession of the Government or third parties, or is afterward placed into the public domain by the owner or another party through no fault of the Government will not be protected once in the public domain.  Data already in the possession of the Government will be protected in accordance with the Government's rights in the data.<BR> <BR>	4.  Proprietary data transmitted electronically, whether by physical media or not, whether by the respondent or by the government, shall contain the PROPRIETARY legend, with any explanatory text, on both the cover of the transmittal and at the beginning of the file itself.  Where appropriate for only portions of an electronic file, use the restrictive legends PROPRIETARY PORTION BEGINS: and PROPRIETARY PORTION ENDS.<BR><BR>	5.  In any reproductions of technical data or any portions thereof subject to asserted restrictions, the government shall also reproduce the asserted restriction legend and any explanatory text.<BR><BR>	6.  The Government sometimes uses support contractors in evaluating responses. Consequently, responses that contain proprietary information may receive only limited or no consideration since the Respondents marking of data as PROPRIETARY will preclude disclosure of same outside the Government and therefore will preclude disclosure to these support contractors assisting the evaluation effort.  The Government will use its best efforts to evaluate those responses that contain proprietary information without using support contractors consistent with the resources available. <BR><BR>3.

<DESC>INTRODUCTION: The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) is performing Market Research to determine capabilities in the marketplace to perform the requirements described in the attached draft Statement of Work (SOW) entitled "Analyze and Assess Method, Data and Case Mix Assessment Information for the Monitoring and Refinement of the Inpatient Psychiatric Facilities Prospective Payment System (IPF PPS)".
<p>PURPOSE: This SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE is to determine the availability of potential small businesses/small disadvantaged businesses (e.g., 8(a), service-disabled veteran owned small business, HUBZone small business, veteran-owned small business, and women-owned small business) that can conduct an aggression analysis for the refinement and monitoring of an inpatient psychiatric facility prospective payment system for CY 2011, and potentially for future years. The information/Capability Statements obtained from this market research will be considered in planning the appropriate acquisition strategy. While the focus of this market research is to identify capable small or small disadvantaged businesses, large businesses are not precluded from submitting capability statements in response to this SSN. However, the Government may not evaluate capability statements submitted by large businesses unless it is unable to identify capable small or small disadvantaged businesses. Please be sure to indicate if you have a GSA schedule contract, a contract on GSA 8(a) STARS, or a contract on GSA VETS GWAC.</p>
<p>THIS IS STRICTLY MARKET RESEARCH TO ASSIST IN DETERMINING THE APPROPRIATE ACQUISITION STRATEGY TO OBTAIN CONTRACTOR SUPPORT SERVICES TO PERFORM THE SAME OR SIMILAR REQUIREMENTS TO THOSE DESCRIBED IN THE ATTACHED DRAFT SOW. THE CENTERS FOR MEDICARE AND MEDICAID SERVICES (CMS) MAY OR MAY NOT ISSUE A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. RESPONSES TO THE SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE BE THE SUBMISSION OF A CAPABILITY STATEMENT. ACCORDINGLY, CMS WILL NOT ENTERTAIN QUESTIONS REGARDING THIS MARKET RESEARCH.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND: <br />The Balanced Budget Refinement Act of 1999 (BBRA) required the establishment of a PPS for inpatient hospital services furnished in psychiatric hospitals and psychiatric units of acute care hospitals to replace the reasonable cost based payment system. Please note that the Medicare Modernization Act also allowed critical access hospitals to establish psychiatric units. Section 124 of P.L. 106-113 mandated that the Secretary develop a per diem PPS that includes an adequate patient classification system reflecting the difference in patient resource use and costs among psychiatric facilities. In addition, the Secretary is permitted to require psychiatric hospitals and units to submit information necessary for the development of the PPS.<br />To meet the requirements of the BBRA, CMS prepared a proposed rule (68 FR 66920), which was published on November 28, 2003 and a final rule that was published on November 15, 2004 (69 FR 66922). In the final regulation, CMS indicated that we would continue to complete special studies, expand the research to focus on the impact of the IPF PPS, and analyze the data to make recommendations regarding potential updates and refinements to this system. The first update to the IPF Payment System was proposed in January 2006 (71 FR 3616) and finalized on May 6, 2006 (71 FR 27040).</p>
<p>In support of the development and implementation of an inpatient psychiatric facility PPS, a number of research projects were undertaken. The University of Michigan was funded to complete data analysis in support of the regulation and examine the feasibility of developing and pilot testing an instrument to collect additional patient specific data. This instrument, The Case Mix Assessment Tool (CMAT), was tested on a small number of facilities. Results were generated in the fall of 2006. Another project was funded with the Research Triangle Institute to examine variations in cost including, analysis of cost variation by day of stay, and collection of an expanded list of patient specific data. A third study was funded following the publication of the November 15, 2004 final rule (69 FR 66922).This study was funded with the Urban Institute to replicate and update the data base used for the final rule and to begin to make recommendations to CMS regarding refinements focusing on the available administrative data, and the increase in the reporting of DRGs and co-morbid conditions.</p>
<p>To ensure that the IPF PPS was able to account adequately for each IPF's case mix, we performed an extensive regression analysis of the relationship between the per diem costs and certain patient and facility characteristics to determine if those characteristics associated with statistically significant cost differences occurred on a per diem basis. For characteristics with statistically significant cost differences, we used the regression coefficients of those variables to determine the size of the corresponding payment adjustments.</p>
<p>In that final rule, we explained that we believe it was important to delay updating the adjustment factors derived from the regression analysis until we have IPF PPS data that includes as much information as possible regarding the patient-level characteristics of the population that each IPF serves. Therefore, we indicated that we did not intend to update the regression analysis and recalculate the Federal per diem base rate and the patient- and facility level adjustments until we completed that analysis. Until that analysis is complete, we stated our intention to publish a notice in the Federal Register each spring to update the IPF PPS (71 FR 27041).</p>
<p>RESPONSE REQUIREMENTS/INFORMATION: In order for CMS to assess a firm's capability, Capability Statements, submitted in response this SSN, shall include written responses that demonstrate the necessary knowledge, experience and ability to meet the SOW requirements. Specifically, Capability Statements (not exceeding 10 pages) shall include sufficient detail that clearly demonstrates your ability to provide the following services:</p>

<DESC>STATEMENT OF WORK
General:
The U. S. Department of State (DoS) requires a service contractor to provide training for Building Automation Systems (BAS)  DoS Facility Managers (FM) and locally employed staff (LES) from embassies throughout the world. The contractor will provide all labor, supplies, tools, materials and equipment necessary to provide the training services as described in the course requirements below. 
Background:
DoS is in the process of installing BAS systems in New Embassy Compounds (NEC’s) around the world. Currently there are 56 NEC’s with BAS systems installed by a variety of third party vendors. The implementation of the  BAS is currently providing many challenges for US State Department oversight and management to include: varied skill sets among FM’s responsible for BAS operations; inconsistent power supplies at embassy compounds; varying skill levels among LES responsible for BAS oversight; limited resources for BAS support; limited vendor availability, responsiveness and support; language barriers impacting the ability to train LES responsible for BAS management; limited protocol for emergency response when BAS systems fail; lack of knowledge on how modify BAS parameters for new  space allocation or other NEC facility modifications; no best practice strategies for trouble shooting BAS problems; lack of a plan/process for upgrading BAS software that is outdated; and minimal knowledge of how manual overrides or modifications of BAS parameters impacts overall facility operations. In addition to challenges related to basic BAS operational knowledge. The types of systems installed at NEC’s involve at a minimum 7 different BAS vendors as well as an undetermined number of third party contractors responsible for the system installations, support and knowledge transfer. 
The goal of this training is to provide FM’s and LES with the knowledge, skills, abilities and resources necessary for the successful integration, operation and support of BAS systems at NEC’s as well as existing embassy compounds. 
Course Requirements:
The course will train FM and LES in the theory, operation and maintenance (O&M), and troubleshooting of BAS in a manner not specific to one brand or manufacturer.  At a minimum the course must cover the following topics;

<DESC>Title: <br />The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is seeking sources for an Enterprise Data Protection (EDP) Solution Integrator (SI).
<p>Description:<br />The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is requesting information regarding prospective Solution Integrators (SI) to identify, deploy, manage, and maintain an Enterprise Data Protection (EDP) solution to the TSA enterprise. This is a Sources Sought Notice only and responders will not be compensated for the information provided. No solicitation will be issued at this time.</p>
<p>The Transportation Security Administration's (TSA) mission is to protect our Nation's transportation sector and to ensure the free and unrestricted movement of people and commerce. To support this mission, the TSA is investigating Solution Integrators (SI) that may be able to assist with implementing a TSA enterprise-wide EDP solution. The integrated EDP solution is a combination of Data Loss Prevention (DLP) and Digital Rights Management (DRM) technologies that can provide the ability to identify and protect digital content within the TSA environment. The EDP unified solution will allow administrators and end-users to locate, label, and protect sensitive information, to assign usage restrictions to documents, to generate reports based on the creation, usage, and disposition of documents, and will integrate with existing document generation and management tools and systems. Please note: DRM is also known as IRM (Information Rights Management), ERM (Enterprise Rights Management) as well as other names, however this document will use the generic DRM term for enterprise Digital Rights Management functions used to protect sensitive content from unauthorized activities and use. <br />Please provide a detailed description of your organization's capabilities and experiences with project management, detailed planning, technical design, system implementation, and operation and maintenance of an integrated EDP solution for large, distributed organizations with complex information sharing relationships. Please include at a minimum the following information:<br />&bull; Describe your organization's experience with implementing EDP solutions for large organizations that have sensitive information that must be securely shared with many different parties, both internally and externally to the organization.<br />&bull; Discuss the strategy and proposed methodology your organization would utilize to ensure a successful deployment of EDP technologies to a large distributed, geographically diverse, heterogeneous environment.<br />&bull; Describe the DLP and DRM technologies your organization has successfully deployed. Discuss the number of users the system supports, the number of external entities using the system, and the total number of documents protected. <br />&bull; Describe your organization's experience in deploying DLP technologies to a large distributed, geographically diverse, heterogeneous environment. Please describe your experience with DLP Data at Rest, Data in Motion, and Data in Use deployments.<br />&bull; Describe your organization's experience in deploying enterprise-wide DRM technologies where information sharing recipients that may be using TSA trusted, semi-trusted, and untrusted systems where TSA is unable to control and/or install software on semi-trusted and untrusted systems.<br />&bull; Describe your organization's experience with integrating DLP and DRM functionalities. Discuss how data coherency is maintained between the DLP and DRM systems. Discuss whether or not the two systems will either seamlessly share information with each other, or utilize a single, unified database between both platforms.<br />&bull; Describe your approach to integrating and deploying the EDP solution to end users. Describe how your organization would gather solution requirements for end users, how the solution would be deployed, what your training strategies would be, and how the solution would be maintained throughout the systems lifecycle. <br />&bull; Discuss integration mechanisms that allow for a single unified user interface for both DLP and DRM functionalities. This capability refers to both administrative user and end-user interfaces. <br />&bull; Describe your organization's experience with DLP and DRM integrations that utilize a common schema to label the sensitivity of files, to include DLP solutions that are capable of identifying sensitive content within files that have been encrypted with DRM controls.<br />&bull; Describe how integrated DLP and DRM solutions will utilize a common set of administrative policies that govern the usage and access controls in place for all sensitive information.<br />&bull; Describe methods used to provide authorized external third parties (i.e. Federal, State, Local and Tribal agencies, and applicable private sector partners and organizations) access to DRM protected content.<br />&bull; Describe the capability to provide TSA trusted, semi-trusted, and untrusted systems updates for DRM file protection attributes, certificates, and control mechanisms when these attributes/control structures change while a user(s) is/are off-line.<br />&bull; Describe how the EDP solution will monitor and control sensitive information within the Continental United States (CONUS) and international locations.<br />&bull; Describe your operations and maintenance (O&amp;M) strategy and service level capabilities required to support 24x7x365 operations.<br />&bull; Discuss your organization's System Development Life Cycle that would be leveraged for this solution, and experience with FISMA Certification and Accreditation processes, procedures, and documentation.<br />&bull; Describe previous experience that would be utilized to ensure the EDP solution meets Section 508 standards compliance.<br /><br />Provide company information and product history to include: <br />&bull; Professional services capabilities and partnerships.<br />&bull; Number of years in the marketplace.<br />&bull; Is the organization and/or the technology(s) used foreign-owned? If so, please describe. <br />&bull; Total number of deployments and number of deployments to Federal agencies. Please provide references and points of contact.<br />&bull; Number of successful DLP/DRM integrations and the associated technologies used.</p>

<DESC><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Purpose:</strong> <br />The USSOCOM is pleased to release this Request for Information (RFI) to determine and update a capabilities list of current companies with Information Management Technologies, Broadcast Technologies, Print Technologies, and Scatterable Media Technologies as outlined in the Background section of this RFI and the response guidelines of this RFI.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Background:</strong><br />USSOCOM is seeking information on Information Management Technologies, Broadcast Technologies, Print Technologies, and Scatterable Media Technologies to advance and improve USSOCOM's psychological operations that are applicable to the planning/research, target audience analysis, development, design, production, distribution, dissemination, and evaluation of information to mass markets including those over long distances. Specifically, USSOCOM is looking for information from industry to meet this fielding requirement with regard to the following four disciplines:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Information Management Technologies:</strong> <br />USSOCOM is seeking information on Information Management systems. Specifically, for the purposes of this RFI, USSOCOM is interested in receiving information regarding industries capabilities in Embedded Metadata, Enhanced Archive Storage/Retrieval, Enhanced Editing Technology; Blue Light Storage, Laser Technology For Enhanced Higher- Volume Storage Over Current Media; Standardized Formats, Eliminate File Conversion; Data Compression Capability Technology, Improved Bandwidth Usage; Virtual Studio Technology, 3D Graphics &amp; Virtual Set Software Tools; Automated Data Archive Technology; Standardization Of Deployable Production &amp; Electronic News Gathering Capability Technology; Video &amp; Audio Studio Modernization Technologies; Video &amp; Audio Processing Enhancement Technologies.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Broadcast Technologies:</strong> <br />USSOCOM is seeking information on Broadcast Technologies that enhanced/improved efficiency for broadcast transmitters and antennas. Specifically, for the purposes of this RFI, USSOCOM is interested in receiving information regarding industries capabilities in affordable digital/Analog TV and AM, FM, SW capabilities which allow remote broadcast and reduce forward signature of friendly forces (remote long distance broadcast). In addition, blue tooth/wireless like technologies which allow remote broadcast from a family of loudspeakers (allows forces to broadcast synchronous messages using UAVs, manportable, and/or vehicular loudspeakers to deliver clear messages across a large area). This will assist in reducing loss of life during clearing operations/movement to contact, management of DPs, MIGOPs and HA missions.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Print Technologies:</strong> <br />USSOCOM is seeking information on Print Technologies and capabilities that are used to disseminate marketing, advertising, and information in the commercial world, both domestically and internationally. Technologies allowing print capability to be rapidly taken down, packed, and moved via air, ground, or sea, and rapidly established in an austere environment, without degrading quality or capability are especially of interest. Ruggedized equipment, equipment built to operate in austere, dusty, and wet environments, and equipment for use with variable data are also of interest.

<DESC>Savannah River Nuclear Solutions, LLC (SRNS), Management and Operations Contract for the Savannah River Site (SRS) for the Department of Energy, solicits expressions of interest from companies wishing to license new technologies. Researchers at the Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) and Clemson University have developed a new method to remediate the subsurface areas (vadose zone) by introducing amendments using aerosol injection. Laboratory testing has shown aerosol injection can reach significant distances to treat contaminated areas. In addition, this method shows aerosolized amendments can extend horizontally through a subsurface as opposed to the vertical migration of liquid applications. Any company interested in licensing this patent pending method must respond with a letter of interest (may be submitted by email) no later that 30 days from the publication date of this Notice summarizing the company's business and technical expertise and motivation for pursuing this opportunity. Qualified companies will be provided with further information on the technology. Questions and expressions of interest may be addressed to the Point of Contact identified in this Notice.

<DESC>Description<br />Savannah River Nuclear Solutions, LLC (SRNS), Management and Operations Contract for the Savannah<br />River Site (SRS) for the Department of Energy, solicits expressions of interest from companies wishing to<br />collaborate in the development and/or license its new technologies. Researchers at the Savannah River<br />National Laboratory (SRNL) and Clemson University have designed new methods to capture and/or<br />geologically store carbon dioxide (CO2). Modeling studies have shown that the proposed aqueous capture<br />technology is applicable to many sources of CO2, is less capital and energy intensive, and thus lower in cost<br />per ton. The companion geologic storage method is safer than supercritical CO2 injection (negatively<br />buoyant), has higher volumetric sweep efficiency, and can be employed where there are limited geologic<br />seals. With looming cap and trade legislation the capture and storage methods have been calculated to show<br />significant savings in the cost for full scale management of CO2 . Any company interested in collaborating<br />or licensing these patent pending methods must respond with a letter of interest (may be submitted by<br />email) no later that 30 days from the publication date of this Notice summarizing the company's business<br />and technical expertise and motivation for pursuing this opportunity.

<p>Anticipated Release Date:<br />1 April 2010</p>
<p>Title:<br />Launch and Range Systems Wing (LRSW) Spacelift Range Systems Contract (SLRSC) addition of Instrumentation (IM) Projects</p>
<p>Description(s):</p>
<p>The Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC), Launch and Range Systems Wing (LRSW), Los Angeles Air Force Base, CA intends to modify the existing SLRS contract with ITT, Corporation, Systems Division, 1030 South Highway A1A, Bldg 989, Patrick AFB, FL 32925 to add several IM projects.</p>
<p>The SLRSC provides for the sustainment and IM upgrades to the Eastern Range (ER) and Western Range (WR) communications, telemetry, and command and control systems located at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station and Vandenberg Air Force Base respectively. The current SLRS contract, F04701-01-C-0001, expires on 31 October 2010.</p>
<p>The added projects are needed to satisfy the Wing's requirements to maintain and upgrade the ER and WR until the award of the Launch Test Range System (LTRS) Integrated Support Contract (LISC). LISC is anticipated to provide range operation services, maintenance and upgrade of both ER and WR. Currently, the LISC acquisition strategy is in development with an anticipated award date of late FY11.</p>
<p>The SLRS projects will prevent unacceptable delays in critical range IM projects which ensure the Ranges are continuously ready to support National priority space launches. Project activities include Western Range Message Switching Phase II efforts, Global Positioning Satellite System Metric Tracking upgrades and some software depot projects. These projects will extend the contract performance up to 35 months.</p>
<p>This action is being pursued on a sole source basis under the statutory authority of 10 U.S. C. 2304 (c)(1) as implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1 "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements." The Government does not anticipate another offeror can meet the required project timelines. While this notice of intent is for information purposes only, and is not a request for competitive proposals, interested parties may identify their interest and technical capability, and submit information which shall be considered by the agency. Interested parties must show capability to fulfill the Government's immediate, short-term need for the projects described above. The notice expires 15 days after publication.</p>
<p>The NAICS code for this effort is 541712 and the Small Business Size Standard is 1000 employees. Capabilities information may be emailed to Mr. Robert Nadeau, Contracting Officer, at robert.nadeau@us.af.mil.</p>

PROGRAM DESCRIPTION AND OBJECTIVE

The objective of PTSS is to deliver an operational space-based system to address the ascent phase midcourse tracking challenge facing the MDA.  To meet this objective, MDA plans to first develop a prototype system, followed by an operational PTSS.  The PTSS prototype and operational system are planned to consist of a constellation of spacecraft and associated ground control and processing equipment that is integrated with the developed Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) elements to support command and control, track generation, fusion, and transfer of data through the entire fire-control loop. The operational PTSS will integrate into the BMDS.

INDUSTRY DAY GOALS 

The goals of this Industry Day are fourfold: (1) to familiarize participants with MDA’s efforts in the Precision Tracking Space System, (2) share the acquisition approach for the prototype and operational PTSS, (3) discuss the planned timing and content of solicitations related to PTSS, and (4) answer questions. 

REGISTRATION INFORMATION

Attendance at the PTSS Industry Day will be limited to three individuals per company.  Highlight these individual’s names on the registration form and email to: orgboxdv@mda.mil no later than 5:00 PM EST, Wednesday, April 7, 2010.

<DESC>Sole Source Notice of Intent - Economic Modeling Specialist, Inc, (EMSI)<br />The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Acquisition Management Division, on behalf of the Manufacturing Extension Partnership Program, intends to negotiate with Economic Modeling Specialist, Inc, (EMSI), on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR Subpart 13.106-1 (b), Soliciting from a Single Source, for the purchase 1 - Strategic Advantage Package,
<p>NIST seeks more efficacy in its program management, having the ability to analyze a region for its manufacturing base and the impact of manufacturing on the economy are critical. The ability to analyze manufacturing at more specific levels of industry and geographic detail will position us to better serve the manufacturing community, which is part of MEP core function.<br />NIST MEP is interested in analyzing local labor market in information for the economic conditions and impact of manufacturing. Publicly available labor market information is not sufficient because it does not provide enough industry detail (e.g. manufacturing instead of transportation equipment manufacturing for auto) or geographic detail (e.g. county or metro area but not the ability to customize the geography such as a MEP Center service delivery areas).<br />MEP's data needs to include: (1) assistance in the peer review and annual review process of how our centers are performing, (2) information about the economic impact of manufacturing closing, such as the recent closure of a 54,000 employee plant in California, (3) ability to create customized economic models at detailed industry and geographic level to answer request form key stakeholders, congressional staff, and federal, state, and local partners.<br />Economic Modeling specialist Inc., is a company that helps in understanding regional labor markets, industries, occupations, demographics, workforce trends economic impacts, skills, job compatibility, educational attainment, and more. The medium used is web-based tools and reports that interpret and analyze labor market and demographic data for any geographic area in the United States or Great Britain.<br />EMSI provide a resource library that acts as an online information source for professionals in workforce development, economic development, and higher education. <br />Interested parties that believe they could satisfy the requirements listed above for NIST and are authorized to provide these before April 7, 2010 at 12:00 pm EST. To be considered an affirmative response, vendors must submit written data and documentation which demonstrates their authorization to meet these requirements. This notice of intent is not a solicitation. Information submitted in response to this notice will be used solely to determine whether competitive procedures could be used for this acquisition. Any questions regarding this notice must be submitted in writing via email to Janice.Moten@Nist.Gov. 301 975 6307</p>

<DESC>Request for Information (RFI): Automated Handling System for the Triage, Imaging, Re-Labeling and Re-Arraying of Frozen Biological Samples in a -20°C Freezer Environment

Notice Number: 
RFI-NCI-100073-TG

Key Dates: 
Capability Statement Due Date: April 20, 2010 11:00 am Eastern Time

Issued By:
National Cancer Institute (NCI), Office of Acquisitions (OA)
http://www.nci.nih.gov or http://rcb.cancer.gov/rcb-internet/ 

General Information:
This Request for Information (RFI) is intended to provide source material for a state-of-the science summary of technology available for automated handling system for the triage, imaging, re-labeling and re-arraying of frozen biological samples in a -20°C freezer environment.  It should not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the Federal Government, the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and the NCI. The NCI does not intend to award a cooperative agreement, grant, or contract on the basis of responses to this RFI or to otherwise pay for the preparation of any information submitted or for the Government's use of such information. 

Purpose:
Based on the response to this RFI, the NCI may issue a solicitation at an undetermined time in the future or use the information to guide purchases of equipment, adaptation of specific methodologies or conduct specific methodological research.  THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME, no basis for claims against NCI shall arise as a result of a response to this Request for Information notice or the NCI’s use of such information as either part of our evaluation process or in developing specifications for any subsequent requirement.

This notice is for market research only.  The NCI is specifically interested in determining the types of organizations available in the marketplace that provide these technologies.  In particular, the NCI is seeking qualified small business concerns [including Small Disadvantaged Businesses (SDB), Woman-owned Small Businesses (WOSB), Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) Small Businesses, Veteran-Owned Small Businesses (VOSB) and Service-Disabled Veteran-owned Small Businesses (SDVOSB) which provide these technologies. Based on the responses received from this announcement, an acquisition may be solicited as a Total Small Business Set-Aside. 

NAICS Code and Size Standard:
In the event a Request for Quotation (RFQ) is issued, North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 423450 with a size standard of 100 employees is being considered.
 

Background: 
The Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG) stores approximately 12 million biospecimens collected in support of approximately 500 studies that have undertaken to understand the etiology of cancer.  Over time, study specimens have been stored in a variety of locations in formats that are independent of material type, causing high labor rates when specimens are retrieved for testing.  In addition, specimens collected longer than five to ten years ago may not have printed barcode labels.  

The Division is currently seeking a way to automate the process of ensuring that specimen containers are barcoded and are located together with other specimens from the same study and of the same material type.  This effort must be taken at temperatures that allow the specimens to remain in a frozen state throughout the duration of this handling and reorganization.  This effort would allow the repository to standardize the labeling scheme of samples that have been collected over several decades to a single format, array samples to a new physical location that maximizes available space, maximize relative sample locations to allow for greater efficiency in the manual pulling of samples for a study, update and correct the NCI’s tracking database and the physical characteristics of the destination boxes to allow for automated specimen retrieval at a later date.

Please use solicitation number referenced in the subject line.<BR><BR>The Structural Mechanics Branch, Geotechnical and Structures Laboratory, USACE/ERDC is currently investigating experimental techniques to aid in the development of multi-scale modeling efforts.  This experimental eeffort will provide the necessary data to assist in the development of numerical tools to analyze concrete materials subjected to both low and high  strain-rate loadings.  X-ray tomography is an experimental technique by which the internal structure of a material may be determined from maps of its x-ray absorption.  Reconstructed maps give informative physical description of the meso-structure of concrete specimens.  This data is input into numerical tools to better define the internal structure of concrete, which should lead to more accurate numerical simulations.  <BR><BR>The University of Florida in Gainesville, Fl, recently installed a computed tomography x-ray system developed by North Star Imaging, Inc., (NSI).  The integrated MTS capability adds a unique advantage of this system over others currently in use.  This capability will enable specimens to be scanned while under stress, assuming the appropriate fixtures are available.  In order to gain the valuable data to improve the understanding of concrete meso-scale behavior, such as that described previously, it is imperative that the facility at the University of Florida be utilized.  Point of Contact for this project is Dr. Reynaldo Roque, Department of Civil and Coastal Engineering.<BR><BR>For ERDC Technical questions, please call Bradley Foust, 601-634-3915.

Instrumentation is needed within two days for two surgical procedures. PR #523-10-2-7910-1147Intuitive surgical Inc1266 Kifer RdSunnyvale, CA 94086                3.	Description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs (including the estimated value).The Intuitive DaVinci surgical 3D HD endoscopy system is robotic technology enabling the surgeon intuitive motion. This system virtually extends the surgeon's eyes and hands into the surgical field, preserving natural eye-hand instrument alignment and intuitive instrument control, giving the patient minimally invasive surgical procedures for treatment of prostate cancer.  These specific instruments are used in conjunction with other instrumentation and the Davinci equipment already on station.  Not to use these specific instruments would render other VA owned components and the recently purchased Davinci machine useless, making it necessary to purchase a new system which would be costly. This procurement is advantageous to the government as well as ensuring ultimate care for our patients. Est. $32,500.4.	Identification of the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition.FAR 6.302-2   Unusual and Compelling Urgency5.	Demonstration that the proposed contractor's unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited.   Intuitive Surgical Inc is the only known source for the Davinci equipment and accessory items.  These supplies are consistent with instrumentation and equipment currently in house. These specific items are compatible with the Davinci machine.     6.	Description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable, including whether a Commerce Business Daily notice was or will be publicized as required by subpart 5.2 (copy attached) and, if not, which exception under 5.202 applies.  N/A7. Determination by the contracting officer that the anticipated cost to the government will be fair and reasonable.This is based on a full procurement that was done six months ago so the price has been determined to be fair and reasonable.8.	Description of the market survey conducted (i.e., names of firms and the date(s) the firms were contacted) and the results or a statement of the reasons a market survey was not conducted.These items are to be used specifically with equipment already on station.  There is no other known source that provides the requested supplies.9.	Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition, such as an explanation why technical data packages, specifications, engineering descriptions, statements of work, or purchase descriptions suitable for full and open competition have not been developed or are not available.	These items are necessary to maintain compatibility in instrumentation and equipment. Not to use this specific supply item could increase cost as the instruments are used in conjunction with equipment already on station.  To the best of my knowledge, there is no authorized dealer to distribute the DaVinci equipment and accessory disposable and reusable items.  10.	A listing of the sources, if any, that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition.	N/A11.	A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required.Allow sufficient time for A&MMS to solicit on the open market to determine other source of supply, if any.	CERTIFICATIONI hereby certify that the data provided herein is complete and accurate to support other than full and open competition.			SIGNED						 3/22/10___________________________________      	_____________________TECHNICAL OR REQUIREMENTS PERSONNEL                 DATEI hereby certify that the justification for other than full and open competition is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.___________________________________  	         ____________________ SIGNATURE OF APPROVING OFFICIAL				   DATE  FOR REQUESTING SERVICE                                     SIGNED									3/26/2010                                                  __________	                  CONTRACTING OFFICER                                 DATE	 This Special Notice is not a request for competitive quotes.

<DESC>Under the Authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), and FAR 6.302-1, the VISN 19 Rocky Mountain Consolidated Contracting Center, Denver, CO, proposes to enter into a non-competitive commercial items contract with Sheridan Memorial Hospital & Nursing Home, 440 W Laurel Ave., Plentywood, MT 59254, for a Primary Care location and support staff for VA providers to provide primary care over tele-health conferencing systems. The Video Health conferencing equipment and circuitry will be provided by VA Montana HCS. VA patients will be determined and referred to Sheridan Memorial facilities site by the Department of Veterans Affairs. The VA intends to provide VA Physician coverage for primary care services over a Tele-Health VA network to an access point at Sheridan Memorial Hospital. Contractor's unique characteristics include an extensive history of already established tele-health services located in their facility. They are trained and understand the use, logistics and special requirements of providing health care over Tele-Health equipment. Sheridan Memorial Hospital is the only facility within a 100+ mile radius that can provide the appropriate facility and professional clinical staff required. The agreement with Sheridan Memorial Hospital for this contract will allow Veterans easy access to primary care without the need to travel significant distances to the nearest fully staffed VA CBOC site. The geographic area contains many elderly veterans whose mobility to travel between sites for specific care is limited, in addition to hazardous driving conditions during winter months. Locating the Tele-Health primary care services in the community will provide veterans with the minimal amount of travel required to receive VA services. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received within the due date for receipt of proposals will be considered by the Government.  A Determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. *****

<p>I. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION:</p>
<p>The Air Force Research Laboratory Munitions Directorate, (AFRL/RW), located at Eglin AFB FL, is part of the Air Force Material Command, Wright-Patterson AFB OH. AFRL/RW is responsible for research and development in conventional armament systems and is soliciting <span style="text-decoration: underline;">White Papers</span> on the following research effort: Low Collateral Damage Alternative Payload Technologies (LCDAPT) for ordnance. AFRL/RW develops advanced ordnance technologies for air launched munitions. The AFRL/RW also performs research and development of focused energy warheads, unitary warheads, and alternative payload technologies, including specialized diagnostics technologies. The objective of this LCDAPT BAA is to provide specific research and development innovations and capabilities to the Government with trained and experienced specialists in the field of warhead design, development, testing, and demonstration. It is anticipated one of the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">White Papers</span> will be selected for further consideration, and its originator will subsequently be requested to submit a formal written technical and cost proposal, with the intent of negotiating <span style="text-decoration: underline;">one<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span></span>5-year Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract for award of the LCDAPT program. However, the Government reserves the right to award one, multiple, or no contracts pursuant to this BAA and to award without discussions.</p>
<p>(1) Introduction: The research and development for this BAA will be on emphasis in the Low Collateral Damage Alternative Payloads to include emerging threats such as: chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and explosive (CBRNE) targets, fleeting targets, and urban warfare targets. AFRL/RW requires highly qualified scientists and engineers in several very specialized areas to meet performance and schedule goals levied by the various organizations within the Department of Defense (DoD).</p>
<p>(2) Program Objective: The LCDAPT program goal is to develop low collateral damage mechanisms for the following difficult emerging threats: urban warfare, fleeting targets, and CBRNE targets. Understanding the mission, being experts in the existing technology, creating innovative solutions to shortfalls and upcoming needs, and solving diverse and complex challenges have been the driving factors for success in AFRL/RW over the last 2 decades and continue to be the focus here. A measure of the success of these activities is the level of technology transition to and testing for other facilities, services, and industry to meet the Government's needs. Historically the classes of weapon technology addressed include a variety of DoD tactical weapons systems. A specific list of these programs will be made available to "DoD Qualified" contractors upon request to serve as pertinent examples of the types of work expected to be performed under the LCDAPT program. The LCDAPT program objective is to exceed the highest expectations of DoD's weapons developers by providing unprecedented innovation in warhead expertise, design, integration, and superior test technology when required by AFRL and its DoD customers. A list of DTIC published Technical Reports, as well as other presentations and technical descriptions of similar work previously performed by AFRL/RW, is available upon request to "DoD Qualified" contractors.</p>
<p>(3) Technical Requirements: The contractor shall perform research in one or more specific Research Areas (RAs) assigned under the contract(s). The scope of each RA includes one or more of the general technical areas associated with alternative payload technologies. From their description it should be obvious that preventing all or keeping at a minimum any/all collateral damage is a major concern for this program. Emerging technologies that are addressed in the RAs described in this announcement include: the defeat, disruption, or denial-of-access to CBRNE targets; and applying focused lethality and variable lethality technologies on a wide variety of targets particularly in sensitive and or populated areas. It is expected the contractor will be required to establish Proprietary Information Agreements or Associate Contractor Agreements for the conduct of this research program when interfacing with another contractor's proprietary information, hardware, software, and systems concepts. Performance of these RAs will require the conceptual, design, planning, execution, and documentation of analysis, simulation, and testing of components, subsystems and systems.</p>
<p>The main RAs for this program are described below. A Statement of Work (SOW) for each RA is included. It is envisioned that one or more tasks could be awarded under this contract, each task covering one, or a portion of one or more of the RAs (RA1 and RA2). These two RAs cover the entire 5-year IDIQ period. A specific description anticipated for Task 0001 is also included below the general RA definitions.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Research Area (RA1) - Counter-CBRNE Technologies</span>. AFRL/RW is pursuing concepts for technologies that will defeat, disrupt, or provide denial to facilities that produce or store chemical, biological, nuclear, radiological, nuclear, and explosive (CBRNE) materials. The intent of the counter-CBRNE program is to develop concepts that achieve that goal while minimizing the collateral threat due to the release of hazardous materials. This research program addresses critical technical issues including: assessment of potential concepts, modeling of the deployment and effects of concepts, and experimentation to substantiate the implementation and effectiveness of concepts. The contractor shall: (1) identify, develop, test, evaluate, and optimize defeat and disruption concepts; (2) identify, develop, test, evaluate, and optimize denial concepts; (3) develop simulants, test fixtures, diagnostics, modeling and simulation tools, and analysis methodologies for subscale and large scale tests; and (4) develop test plans, handling procedures, facility protection plans, and test protocols for subscale and large scale tests</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Research Area (RA2) - Focused Lethality and Variable Lethality Technologies</span>. The global war on terrorism (GWOT) has brought new military missions, concerns, and requirements-namely how to fight in urban settings and minimize collateral damage to noncombatants, friendly forces, and infrastructure. AFRL/RW is pursuing concepts for technologies that will provide low collateral damage technologies for emerging threats (such as fleeting targets and time sensitive targets). Interest areas include: miniature (and micro) warheads, selectable effects warheads, and novel methods (including non-kinetic) for functional kill. Miniaturized munitions or submunitions and adaptable warheads allow increased flexibility and a variety of additional advantages to the warfighter. Additional information regarding these allowances will be made available upon request to "DoD Qualified" contractors upon request. AFRL/RW seeks focused lethality or variable lethality technologies that promote higher energy density and insensitivity during the munition storage/transport stage, focused or variable output during the energy release stage and efficient coupling of this energy to the target during the target interaction stage. This research addresses critical technical issues associated with achieving that goal, including: assessment of potential concepts, modeling of the deployment and effects of concepts, and experimentation to substantiate the implementation and effectiveness of concepts. The contractor shall: (1) identify, develop, test, evaluate, and optimize focused lethality and variable lethality concepts, while attempting to minimize collateral damage; (2) develop test fixtures, diagnostics, modeling and simulation tools , and analysis methodologies; and (3) develop test plans, handling procedures, facility protection plans, and test protocols.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Task Order 0001 - Precision Warhead Effects</span>. Task 0001 will be an approximately $600K effort incorporating innovation, development, and application in both RA1 and RA2. The detailed SOW for this task will be developed along with the proposal solicited from the contractor; however, for the purposes of white paper submissions the general requirements can be described as follows:<br />The contractor will develop low collateral damage (LCD) warhead technologies compatible with these objectives: (1) to deliver selectable kinetic effects which functionally defeat fixed and time sensitive targets in complex environments; and (2) to deliver precision kinetic and novel effects against strategic, time sensitive and high value targets, with the ability to select effects during delivery. For (2) the contractor will develop micro UAV-based ordnance concepts and designs, predict performance, fabricate prototype warheads, and characterize their performance and damage effects. For objective (1), the contractor will develop cruise-missile-based ordnance concepts and designs, predict performance, fabricate sub-scale prototype warheads, and characterize their performance and damage effects. Targets of interest include suburban, urban, and CBRNE targets for both objectives. The contractor will evaluate warhead performance using the protocols described in AFRL-RW-EG-TR-2009-7069, AFRL-RW-EG-TR-2009-7068, and documents referenced therein, or in a Government-approved equivalent. AFRL/RW has invested several million dollars in acquiring unique facilities and specialized equipment for the characterization of Counter-CBRNE and novel payloads which can directly support the types of work anticipated under the LCDAPT program. "DoD Qualified" contractors may request access to view these facilities and equipment (subject to availability, i.e. ongoing testing). Requests for additional information by "DoD Qualified" contractors should be made in accordance with Section VII, paragraph (2) of this BAA. The contractor is encouraged to consider the use of the existing facilities and equipment in performing research under this program, both from the expected benefit of the library of previous technical data collected, and an overall cost saving's prospective. Facility descriptions can be found in the documents referenced above, as well as the additional documents made available to "DoD Qualified" contractors upon request.</p>

WHITE PAPER/PROPOSAL/APPLICATION REVIEW INFORMATION:</p>
<p>(1) Evaluation Criteria: White Papers will be evaluated as to their projected success in achieving the objectives/requirements outlined in Section I, of this BAA, utilizing the Factors and Sub-factors below. The following criteria, which are listed in descending order of importance, will be used to determine whether full proposals will be invited based on the White Paper submitted. The white papers will include a Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) so all evaluation factors other than cost or price, when combined, are significantly more important than cost or price. Additionally, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">a risk assessment</span> (See section V(2)) will be made of the offers, and selections will be made based on the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Best Value to the Government</span>. Awards may be made without discussions. Evaluations of proposals solicited by the government based on the White Paper submissions will be evaluated using the same criteria but with specific focus on the specific Task Order objectives and requirements.</p>
<p>Specific Criteria for Award: The factors identified below, listed in descending order of importance, will be considered during White Paper/Proposal evaluation<br /><br />a. Technical Evaluation Criteria (sub factors in descending order of importance): <br />i. The soundness, technical merit and innovation of the proposed approach and its incremental progress towards the delivery of Low Collateral Damage Alternative Payloads for use on emerging threat areas such as urban warfare, fleeting targets, and CBRNE targets. Demonstrate knowledge of problem and historical data, and discuss appropriate technologies, diagnostics, figures-of-merit, and analysis methods. <br /><br />ii. Past experience in counter-CBRNE technology and alternative payload development. White paper should address pertinent experience in all phases of concept development -- concept creation, evaluation, modeling, design, testing, analysis, and documentation. References (document list) required.<br /><br />iii. The qualifications of the proposed principal/key investigators, supporting staff, and consultants.</p>
<p>Capabilities and experience may include unique combinations which are integral factors for achieving proposal objectives. Experience may be best indicated by work performed on programs of similar scope and complexity within the last 5 years. Any resumes should be in a separate Appendix, which is not included in the White Paper page limits. The Government team may request supplemental historical information if required to confirm/verify experience and capabilities.</p>
<p>b. Cost/Price: Substantial factor but second in priority.<br />i. Cost Realism Analysis will ensure proposed cost<br />&bull; Is realistic for work to be performed<br />&bull; Reflects a clear understanding of the requirements<br />&bull; Is consistent with the unique methods of performance and material described in offerors' technical proposals.</p>
<p>c. Risk: Assessed as part of each of the above criteria</p>
<p>(2) White Paper/Proposal Risk Assessment: White Paper/Proposal risk will be assessed at each Factor level as part of the evaluation of the above evaluation criteria. White Paper/Proposal risk relates to the identification and assessment of the risks associated with an offeror's proposed approach as it relates to accomplishing the proposed effort. Tradeoffs of the assessed risk will be weighed against the potential payoff. The following definitions will be used during the risk assessment:</p>
<p>a. High: Likely to cause significant disruption of schedule, increase cost, or degradation of performance. Risk may be unacceptable even with special contractor emphasis and close Government monitoring.</p>
<p>b. Moderate: Can potentially cause some disruption of schedule, increase cost, or degradation of performance. Special contractor emphasis and close Government monitoring will probably be able to overcome difficulties.</p>
<p>c. Low: Has little potential to cause disruption of schedule, increase cost, or degradation of performance. Normal contractor effort and normal Government monitoring will probably be able to overcome difficulties.</p>
<p>(3) No further evaluation criteria will be used. Individual White Paper/Proposal evaluations will be evaluated against the evaluation criteria without regard to other White Papers and Proposals submitted under this BAA.</p>
<p>(4) Review and Selection Process: Should <span style="text-decoration: underline;">formal proposals</span> be requested based on the evaluation of White Papers, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">those technical and cost proposals</span> will be evaluated at the same time, using the same criteria stated above, and categorized as follows:</p>
<p>a. Category I: Proposal is well conceived, scientifically and technically sound, pertinent to the program goals and objectives, and offered by a responsible contractor with the competent scientific and technical staff and supporting resources needed to ensure satisfactory program results. Proposals in Category I are recommended for acceptance (subject to availability of funds) and normally are displaced only by other Category I proposals.</p>
<p>b. Category II: Proposal is scientifically or technically sound, requiring further development and is recommended for acceptance, but at a lower priority than Category I.</p>
<p>c. Category III: Proposal is not technically sound or does not meet agency needs.</p>
<p><br />VI. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION:</p>
<p>(1) Selection Notices for White Papers: Those White Papers evaluated in accordance with sections V(1) and V(2) and determined to be of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Best Value to the Government</span> <strong>may</strong> be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email or letter will be sent by the contracting or technical POC. Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract. Those White Papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner. Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.</p>
<p>Offerors may request status of their White Paper no earlier than 45 days after submission.</p>
<p>(2) Award Notices for Proposals: Offerors will be notified whether their proposal is recommended for award, by letter or e-mail. The notification is not to be construed to mean the award of a contract is assured, as availability of funds and successful negotiations are prerequisites to any award. The Government reserves the right to award one, multiple, or no contracts pursuant to this BAA.</p>
<p>(3) Administrative and National Policy Requirements: The offeror will require a Secret facility clearance (we AFRL/RW can/should be able to provide all/any area needed for TS work) and safeguarding capability. <strong>Some of the key personnel may be identified for assignment and</strong> access to <strong>Top Secret</strong> information. The offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility to support work under this BAA; however, the offeror will not be generating nor storing Top Secret materials. Data subject to export control constraints may be involved and only firms holding certification under the US/Canada Joint Certification Program (JCP) (www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp) are allowed access to such data.</p>

<p>VIII. OTHER INFORMATION:</p>
<p>(1) Support Contractors: Only Government employees will evaluate the white papers for selection. The AFRL/RW has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in the administrative support contract, which do not require the review, reading, or comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks." These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements. The required administrative tasks performed include: (a) Assembling and organizing information for R&amp;D case files; (b) accessing library files for use by government personnel; and (c) handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries. Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis of the objection.<br /><br />(2) Communication: Dialogue between prospective offerors and Government representatives is encouraged <strong>until submission of White Papers (or if selected, until submission of proposals)</strong>. Discussions with any of the points of contact shall not constitute a commitment by the Government to subsequently fund or award any proposed effort. Only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government. <br /><br />(3) Debriefings: When requested, a debriefing will be provided. The debriefing process will follow the time guidelines set out in 10 USC 2305(b)(5), but the debriefing content may vary to be consistent with the procedures that govern BAAs (FAR 35.016). <br /><br />(4) Wide Area Work Flow Notice: Any contract award resulting from this announcement will contain the clause at DFARS 252.232-7003, Electronic Submission of Payment Requests and Receiving Reports, which requires electronic submission of all payment requests. The clause cites three possible electronic formats through which to submit electronic payment requests. Effective 01 October 2006, the Department of Defense adopted Wide Area Work Flow-Receipt and Acceptance (WAWF-RA), as the electronic format for submission of electronic payment requests. Any contract resulting from this announcement will establish a requirement to use WAWF-RA for invoicing and receipt/acceptance, and provide coding instructions applicable to this contract. Contractors are encouraged to take advantage of available training (both web-based and through your cognizant DCMA office), and to register in the WAWF-RA system. Information regarding WAWF-RA, including the web-based training and registration, can be found at <span style="text-decoration: underline;">https://wawf.eb.mil/</span>. Note: WAWF-RA requirement does not apply to Universities that are audited by an agency other than DCAA.<br /><br />(5) Item Identification and Valuation: Any contract award resulting from this announcement may contain the clause at DFARS 252.211-7003, Item Identification and Valuation, (Aug 2008) which requires unique item identification and valuation of any deliverable item for which the Government's unit acquisition cost is $5,000 or more; subassemblies, components, and parts embedded within an item valued at $5,000 or more; or items for which the Government's unit acquisition cost is less than $5,000 when determined necessary by the requiring activity for serially managed, mission essential, or controlled inventory. Also included are any DoD serially managed subassembly, component, or part embedded within a delivered item and the parent item that contains the embedded subassembly, component, or part. Per DFARS 211.274-3 policy for valuation, it is DoD policy that contractors shall be required to identify the Government's unit acquisition cost for all items delivered, even if none of the criteria for placing a unique item identification mark applies. Therefore, your proposal must clearly break out the unit acquisition cost for any deliverable items. Per DFARS 211.274-3 policy for valuation, "The Government's unit acquisition cost is... the contractor's estimated fully burdened unit cost to the Government at the time of delivery" for cost-type or undefinitized line, subline, or exhibit line items (per DoD, "fully burdened unit costs" to the Government would include all direct, indirect, G&amp;A costs, and an appropriate portion of fee.). If you have questions regarding the unique item identification requirements, please contact the contracting point of contact listed above. For more information, see the following website: <span style="text-decoration: underline;">http://www.acq.osd.mil/dpap/uid/</span>.<br /><br />(6) Forward Pricing Rate Agreements: Offerors who have Forward Pricing Rate Agreements (FPRAs) should submit them with their proposal. <br /><br />(7) Pre-Award Clearance: Pursuant to FAR 22.805, a pre-award clearance must be obtained from the U.S. Department of Labor, Employment Standards Administration, Office of Federal Contract Compliance Program's (OFCCP) prior to award of a contract (or subcontract) of $10M or more unless the contractor is listed in OFCCP's National Pre-award Registry <span style="text-decoration: underline;">http://www.dol-esa.gov/preaward</span>. This registry indicates that the contractor has been found to be "in compliance" within the past 2 years with the Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) regulations that the OFCCP is mandated to enforce. The registry is updated nightly and facilities reviewed more than 2 years ago are removed and new ones are added. Award may be delayed if you are not currently listed in the registry and the contracting officer must request a pre-award clearance from the OFCCP. <br /><br />(8) Excessive Pass-Through Charges: Any contract award resulting from this announcement may contain the clause at DFARS 252.215-7004, Excessive Pass-Through Charges, (May 2008) which requires the contractor to identify in its proposal the percentage of effort to be performed by the prime contractor and the percentage expected to be performed by each subcontractor. If the contractor intends to subcontract more than 70% of the total cost of work under the contract or task order, then it shall identify the amount of the contractor's indirect costs and profit applicable to the subcontract work, and a description of the value added by the contractor. If any subcontractor intends to subcontract to a lower tier subcontractor more than 70% of the total cost of its work, then it shall identify the amount of the subcontractor's indirect costs and profit applicable to the lower tier subcontract work, and a description of the value added by the subcontractor. <br /><br />(9) On-Line Representations and Certifications: Potential offerors are notified that effective 01 Jan 2005, to be eligible for an award they must submit annual Electronic Representations and Certifications, otherwise known as On-line Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) via the Business Partner Network (BPN) at <span style="text-decoration: underline;">http://www.bpn.gov/orca</span>. These FAR level representations and certifications are required in addition to the representations and certifications specific to this acquisition. Before submitting the Electronic Representations and Certifications, contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) Database. On-line registration instructions can be accessed from the DISA CCR home page at <span style="text-decoration: underline;">http://www.ccr.gov</span>.</p>
<p>(10) Associate Contractor Agreements: Associate Contractor Agreements (ACAs) may pertain to this BAA. ACAs are agreements between contractors working on government contract projects that specify requirements for them to share information, data, technical knowledge, expertise, or resources. Prime contractor to subcontractor relationships do not constitute ACAs.<br /><br />(11) Post-Award Small Business Program Rerepresentation: As prescribed in FAR 19.308, FAR Clause 52.219-28, Post-Award Small Business Program Rerepresentation (Apr 2009), is incorporated by reference in this solicitation. This clause will be contained in any contracts resulting from this solicitation. This clause requires a contractor to rerepresent its size status when certain conditions apply. The clause provides detail on when the rerepresentation must be complete and what the contractor must do when a rerepresentation is required.<br /><br />(12) Enabling Clause: Any contract award resulting from this announcement may contain the clause at AFMCFARS 5352.215-9008, Enabling Clause between Prime Contractors and Service Contractors, (Jul 1997), substantially as written, in Section I when a prime contractor must agree to cooperate with a support contractor during the performance of this contract.<br /><br />(13) Occupational Safety and health (OSHA) and Voluntary Protection Program (VPP): Eglin AFB is in the process of pursuing recognition under the OSHA VPP. If required, as a part of a resulting contract from this BAA, AFFARS Clause 5352.223-9001 mandates that adequate health and safety requirements be identified in the contract. Contractors can gain more information regarding the OSHA VPP Program at <span style="text-decoration: underline;">http://www.osha.gov/dcsp/vpp/index.html</span>.</p>

<p>PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made by the Contracting Officer. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:<br />Factor 1 - Organizational Representatives. This factor is met when the Offeror provides a listing, in hierarchical succession, of the Offeror's points of contact delegated specifically for this requirement. Listing includes the titles, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses for each representative. List shall include both contracting and technical representatives.</p>
<p>Factor 2 - Interconnection Agreements. This factor is met when the Offeror states whether <br />Offeror is a facilities-based firm or non-facilities based firm. Also, provide documented evidence<br />of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Factor 3 - Evidence of Certification. This factor is met when the Offeror provides <br />documentation showing that Offeror is a Local Exchange Carrier certificated by the affiliated <br />state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide the services for this requirement (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority).<br /><br />Factor 4 - Local Communications Services. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a site-specific diagram <br />and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix <br />10 requirements.</p>
<p>(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation. <br /><br />(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will be performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(iv) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -- No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />(v) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(vi) If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence"<br />performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer.</p>

<p>PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made by the Contracting Officer. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:<br />Factor 1 - Organizational Representatives. This factor is met when the Offeror provides a listing, in hierarchical succession, of the Offeror's points of contact delegated specifically for this requirement. Listing includes the titles, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses for each representative. List shall include both contracting and technical representatives.</p>
<p>Factor 2 - Interconnection Agreements. This factor is met when the Offeror states whether <br />Offeror is a facilities-based firm or non-facilities based firm. Also, provide documented evidence<br />of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Factor 3 - Evidence of Certification. This factor is met when the Offeror provides <br />documentation showing that Offeror is a Local Exchange Carrier certificated by the affiliated <br />state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide the services for this requirement (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority).<br /><br />Factor 4 - Local Communications Services. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a site-specific diagram <br />and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix <br />10 requirements.</p>
<p>(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation. <br /><br />(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will be performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(iv) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -- No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />(v) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(vi) If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence"<br />performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer.</p>
<p>Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition to include the following addendum.</p>

These requirements also apply to applications pending on the effective date of this contract.<br />(3) Public Utilities Commission (PUC) Authorization. All Offerors shall be local exchange carriers certificated (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority) with the state PUC where services are being provided.

If the prices differ from established tariff prices, it is the responsibility of the contractor to either file a special tariff for the contract with the relevant Governmental authorities or make other arrangements to comply with the governmental requirements. The Air Force will not be liable for price increases for failure to follow these requirements. If, during the term of the contract, the TFS change, the contractor must submit supporting state statutes, local ordinances, regulations, FCC ruling and rates, etc, for Government verification. A modification will then be issued based upon the newly documented annual TFS. <br />(ii) The Government shall not prepay for services.<br />(iii) Recurring charges for services and facilities shall, in each case, start with the satisfactory beginning of service or provision of facilities or equipment and are payable monthly in arrears.<br />(iv) Subject to the Cancellation or Termination of Orders clause 252.239-7007, of this agreement/contract, the Government may stop the use of any service or facilities furnished under this agreement/contract at any time.

<p>The Government shall not request the Contractor to use or disclose<br />Protected Health Information in any manner that would not be permissible under the HIPAA Privacy Rule, the HIPAA Security Rule, or any applicable Government regulations (including without limitation, DoD 6025.18-R and DoD 8580.02-R) if done by the Government, except for providing Data Aggregation services to the Government and for management and administrative activities of the Contractor as otherwise permitted by this clause.</p>
<p>Termination</p>
<p>(a) Termination. A breach by the Contractor of this clause, may subject the Contractor to termination under any applicable default or termination provision of this Contract.</p>
<p>(b) Effect of Termination.</p>
<p>(1) If this contract has records management requirements, the records subject to the Clause should be handled in accordance with the records management requirements. If this contract does not have records management requirements, the records should be handled in accordance with paragraphs (2) and (3) below</p>
<p>(2) If this contract does not have records management requirements, except as provided in paragraph (3) of this section, upon termination of this Contract, for any reason, the Contractor shall return or destroy all Protected Health Information received from the Government, or created or received by the Contractor on behalf of the Government. This provision shall apply to Protected Health Information that is in the possession of subcontractors or agents of the Contractor. The Contractor shall retain no copies of the Protected Health Information.</p>
<p>(3) If this contract does not have records management provisions and the Contractor determines that returning or destroying the Protected Health Information is infeasible, the Contractor shall provide to the Government notification of the conditions that make return or destruction infeasible. Upon mutual agreement of the Government and the Contractor that return or destruction of Protected Health Information is infeasible, the Contractor shall extend the protections of this Contract to such Protected Health Information and limit further uses and disclosures of such Protected Health Information to those purposes that make the return or destruction infeasible, for so long as the Contractor maintains such Protected Health Information.<br /><br />Miscellaneous</p>
<p>(a) Regulatory References. A reference in this Clause to a section in DoD 6025.18-R, DoD 8580.02-R, Privacy Rule or Security Rule means the section currently in effect or as amended, and for which compliance is required.</p>
<p>(b) Survival. The respective rights and obligations of Business Associate under the "Effect of Termination" provision of this Clause shall survive the termination of this Contract.</p>
<p>(c) Interpretation. Any ambiguity in this Clause shall be resolved in favor of a meaning that permits the Government to comply with DoD 6025.18-R, DoD 8580.02-R, the HIPAA Privacy Rule or the HIPAA Security Rule.</p>

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required.

This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<DESC>Intelligence analysts are frequently called upon to explain data that are sparse, noisy, and uncertain. This process, termed sensemaking, is a basic human cognitive ability as well as a foundational component of intelligence analysis. Yet despite its importance, sensemaking remains a poorly understood phenomenon.
<p>The goal of the ICArUS Program is to construct integrated computational cognitive neuroscience models of human sensemaking. By shedding light on the fundamental mechanisms of sensemaking, ICArUS models will enable the Intelligence Community to better predict human-related strengths and failure modes in the intelligence analysis process and will point to new strategies for enhancing analytic tools and methods. Furthermore, ICArUS models may serve to help define a platform for a new generation of automated analysis tools.</p>
<p>The ICArUS Program is expected to consist of three phases over a five-year period. This BAA solicits proposals for Phases 1 and 2 only.</p>
<p>Phase 1 is 24 months and consists of a 12-month Base Period plus a 12-month Option Period. The objective in Phase 1 is to develop the initial integrated model. Performers will demonstrate the model's ability to learn spatial relationships among data and to use this knowledge to make sense of content in a geospatial display.</p>
<p>Phase 2 is a single, 18-month Option Period. The objective of Phase 2 is to extend the functionality of the Phase 1 integrated model to include the ability to make sense of temporal patterns (event sequences) in geospatial data.</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL<br />ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6-STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION<br />FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION<br />INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE<br />ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN<br />SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED. THE SOLICITATION IS BEING ISSUED USING SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION PROCEDURES.
<p>This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-38.</p>
<p>The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334516 with a small business size standard of 500 employees, however, all interested parties may submit a quotation.</p>
<p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has a requirement for a Low Background Gamma Detector. All equipment must be new. Refurbished and or remanufactured shall not be considered for award.</p>
<p>All interested Contractors shall provide a quote for the following line items:</p>
<p>Line Item 0001: Quantity One (1) each, Low Background Gamma Detector that shall meet or exceed the following minimum specifications:</p>
<p>1. NIST will install the detector in an existing low-background iron shield with inside dimensions 20" x 20" x 24" high and walls 6" thick. Critical dimensions are provided in attachment I. These critical dimensions are intended to ensure that the detector can be fitted into the existing shield. The height A from the bottom of the cryostat assembly to the top of the detector shall be between 10.0 inches and 12.0 inches. The horizontal distance B from the detector centerline to the preamplifier, vacuum flange, or whatever object first exceeds the cryostat rod diameter C shall be at least 16.5 inches.</p>
<p><br />2. The detector shall be made of p-type intrinsic germanium. The detector's relative efficiency shall be 100% or greater and the resolution 1.9 keV fwhm or less, as defined by the IEEE-325 standard. For further reference to the standard, visit webstore.ansi.org.</p>
<p>3. The diameter of the crystal shall be greater than its length;</p>
<p>4. The detector crystal shall be mounted in a low-background J-shaped cryostat attached to a 30-liter Dewar. The cryostat design must be equivalent to an Ortec Cryostat, Model LLB HJ or a Canberra Cryostat, Model ULB 7915-30. In these designs, the vacuum cryostat emerges horizontally from the lower side of the dewar, and after a certain distance, the detector is installed facing upward, thus ensuring that there is no line of sight from the detector to the outside.</p>
<p>All materials inside the shield shall be selected for low gamma-ray background. The detector capsule shall not be removable from the cryostat in the field.</p>
<p>For the purpose of this solicitation, low background means material that has as low a quantity of radioactive material as possible.</p>
<p>5. The preamplifier shall be mounted outside the shield and shall provide two outputs: one for energy and an identical output for timing a future anticoincidence mantle. A sensing circuit shall provide an output signal for high voltage shutdown whenever the detector temperature becomes too high.</p>
<p>6. The 30 Liter Dewar shall be fitted with a pressure filling cap such that excess liquid nitrogen escapes through an overflow tube. A second pressure filling cap shall also be provided.</p>
<p>Line Item 0002: Warranty:<br />The Contractor shall provide, at a minimum, a one year warranty period for the detector. Warranty shall be on-site or return to Contractor's site, at the discretion of the Contractor. All costs associated with parts, labor, travel and shipping shall be borne by the Contractor at no cost to the Government. The warranty shall commence upon final acceptance by the Government. <br />Delivery shall be completed not later than 90 days after receipt of an order.</p>
<p>Delivery terms shall be FOB Destination. FOB Destination means: The contractor shall pack and mark the shipment in conformance with carrier requirements, deliver the shipment in good order and condition to the point of delivery specified in the purchase order, be responsible for any loss of and/or damage to the goods occurring before receipt and acceptance of the shipment by the consignee at the delivery point specified in the purchase order; and pay all charges to the specified point of delivery. The contractor shall deliver all line items to NIST, Building 301, Shipping and Receiving, Gaithersburg, MD 20899.</p>
<p>The Government shall award a purchase order resulting from this solicitation to the responsible quoter whose quotation conforming to the solicitation results in the lowest priced, technically acceptable quotation.</p>
<p>The following will be used to evaluate quotations:</p>
<p>TECHNICAL CAPABILITY<br />PRICE</p>
<p><br />TECHNICAL CAPABILITY<br />Technical capability shall be evaluated to determine the Contractor's ability to successfully complete the project. Technical descriptions and product literature submitted shall be evaluated to determine that the proposed components meet or exceed the minimum specifications stated herein.</p>
<p>The technical drawing shall be evaluated to determine its overall feasibility, and compliance with the required specifications.</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6-STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED. THE SOLICITATION IS BEING ISSUED USING SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION PROCEDURES UNDER THE AUTHORITY OF FAR 13.5 TEST PROGRAM FOR CERTAIN COMMERCIAL ITEMS.
<p>This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-40.</p>
<p>The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334516 with a small business size standard of 500 employees. However, this requirement is unrestricted and all interested Contractors may submit a quotation.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND:</p>
<p>The Precision Engineering Division (PED) is principally engaged in the development and dissemination of dimensional metrology and measurements in support of US industry. The rapid rise of nanotechnology and the formulation of promising new products with unique materials properties have raised concerns about the behavior of ultra-small components from the environmental health and safety as well as from the manufacturing quality-assurance points of view. For the past three years, PED has been the lead laboratory on a NIST Innovations in Measurement Science project called the Fate of Nanoparticles in which measurement aspects of bio-distribution and cellular uptake of nanoparticles are being investigated.</p>
<p>A significant area of interest to this project lies in the field of nanoparticle-based drug delivery systems (NDS). NDS consist of complex assemblies of biomaterial components including targeting proteins and payloads of imaging agents, diagnostics, gene therapy, and/or drug molecules designed with the ability to traverse the bloodstream and be selectively adsorbed only by cells or tissue selected for diagnosis and treatment.</p>
<p>In order to fully account for the size and stability of NDS formulations received from our collaborators, it is necessary for us to qualify that the starting materials used to develop and test these formulations remain constant over the course of our investigations. This implies that we must be able to determine the chemical composition of NDS components and complexes on a regular basis. Since the formulations often contain biomaterials which are extremely expensive or available only in very small quantities for characterization studies, it is imperative that the chemical analysis be selective enough to resolve one specific component in a mixed sample solution and be sensitive enough to make multiple analytical measurements on a few nanoliters of solution.</p>
<p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has a requirement for a complete LC-MS System. All equipment must be new. Refurbished and or remanufactured shall not be considered for award.</p>

For each employee assigned to the contract, initiate verification within 90 calendar days after date of enrollment or within 30 calendar days of the employee's assignment to the contract, whichever date is later (but see paragraph (b)(4) of this section). <br />(2) If the Contractor is enrolled as a Federal Contractor in E-Verify at time of contract award, the Contractor shall use E-Verify to initiate verification of employment eligibility of- <br />(i) All new employees. <br />(A) Enrolled 90 calendar days or more. The Contractor shall initiate verification of all new hires of the Contractor, who are working in the United States, whether or not assigned to the contract, within 3 business days after the date of hire (but see paragraph (b)(3) of this section); or <br />(B) Enrolled less than 90 calendar days. Within 90 calendar days after enrollment as a Federal Contractor in E-Verify, the Contractor shall initiate verification of all new hires of the Contractor, who are working in the United States, whether or not assigned to the contract, within 3 business days after the date of hire (but see paragraph (b)(3) of this section); or <br />(ii) Employees assigned to the contract. For each employee assigned to the contract, the Contractor shall initiate verification within 90 calendar days after date of contract award or within 30 days after assignment to the contract, whichever date is later (but see paragraph (b)(4) of this section). <br />(3) If the Contractor is an institution of higher education (as defined at 20 U.S.C. 1001(a)); a State or local government or the government of a Federally recognized Indian tribe; or a surety performing under a takeover agreement entered into with a Federal agency pursuant to a performance bond, the Contractor may choose to verify only employees assigned to the contract, whether existing employees or new hires.

<DESC><strong>E-mail questions in writing to desantisma@mail.nih.gov by 3:00 pm (ET) by April 12, 2010.</strong><br /><br />The purpose of this subcontract is to identify and evaluate the potential of candidate nanotechnologies to significantly improve the therapeutic index, bioavailability, solubility, and/or pharmacokinetics of otherwise failed anti-cancer agents. Specifically, this subcontract is intended to fund nanotechnology delivery systems which will allow anti-cancer drugs which could not otherwise be delivered in free form due to their excessive toxicity, poor oral bioavailability, poor solubility in biological fluids, inappropriate pharmacokinetics, and lack of efficacy within a tolerable dose range to be re-examined as potential therapies for cancer treatment. The purpose of this subcontract is NOT to fund basic research on nanoplatform development nor is it intended to fund the new synthesis approach to failed anti-cancer compounds.
<p>If the drug can currently be administered to humans in free form and the drug-nanoparticle construct provides only an incremental improvement over the free drug, then the drug-nanoparticle construct is not of interest to NCI and SAIC-Frederick. If, however, the drug-nanoparticle construct results in a significant improvement in properties over the free drug, then NCI and SAIC-Frederick would be interested in the drug-nanoparticle construct. If the drug can not currently be administered to humans in free form and the drug-nanoparticle construct mitigates the unacceptable properties of the drug allowing the drug to be re-evaluated as an anti-cancer agent, then NCI and SAIC-Frederick would be very interested in the drug-nanoparticle construct.</p>

The Shuttle Bus program involves the operation of one bus approximately eight hours per day, seven days per week.  As currently designed the bus program includes three component services, as described below.  The details of this service plan are subject to change, in part to accommodate future changes in Metro North train schedules. Contractor will be notified by the park's COR in advance of any change in service.  But the bus driver's work day will not expand beyond eight hours.
1) Train Station Shuttle - Poughkeepsie Train Station to the Home of Franklin D. Roosevelt National Historic Site (10 miles round trip, 2 round trips per day). 
The 28- passenger shuttle bus transports visitors from the Poughkeepsie train station to the Home of Franklin D. Roosevelt National Historic Site. The shuttle is timed to collect passengers from the Metro North train service from Grand Central Station in New York City at 10:40 a.m. It departs the FDR site at 5:10 p.m. and returns passengers to the Poughkeepsie train station by 5:30 p.m., in time for the 5:40 p.m. train departing Poughkeepsie for New York City. 
2) From the Wallace Center located at the Home of Franklin D. Roosevelt National Historic Site to Top Cottage, FDR's Retreat (14 miles round trip). 
Between 11:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m., the bus provides three round trips between the Wallace Center and Top Cottage. The Top Cottage shuttle schedule is designed to accommodate three Top Cottage tours each day.  These tours begin at the Wallace Center at 11:30 a.m., 2:00 p.m., and 3:30 p.m.  Each round trip to Top Cottage includes either an outbound or an inbound stop at Val-Kill.
3) From the Wallace Center located at the Home of Franklin D. Roosevelt National Historic Site to Val-Kill, the Eleanor Roosevelt National Historic Site (5 miles round trip).
In addition to the six Top Cottage round trips, the current bus schedule includes two additional round trips between the Wallace Center and Val-Kill.  Trips to Val-Kill are designed to accommodate visitors who participate in tours of Eleanor Roosevelt's home, as well as hikers and cyclists who utilize trails that link the FDR site, Val-Kill, and Top Cottage.
Service planners are currently investigating the possibility of adjusting the shuttle schedule to include two daily round trips between the Wallace Center and the Vanderbilt Mansion.  Such a change, if it is made, will have no impact on driver hours or vehicle hours.  It will have minimal impact on the number of miles operated, because this would involve substituting a pair of Vanderbilt round trips for a pair of Val-Kill round trips.

<DESC>The International Boundary Commission, United States and Canada (IBC), is mandated by treaty to maintain an effective boundary line between the two countries.  This is accomplished, in part, by keeping a 20-foot wide strip (vista), 10 feet in each country, clear of trees, brush and other obstructions and the boundary monuments in good repair.

This is an approximatley 100 mile vista-cutting project located along the 141 Meridian a rugged, remote segment of the Alaska-Yukon boundary.  Monument 108 which is approximately the middle of this project is located approximately 5 miles east of Eagle Alaska.

Since the purpose of the vista is to enhance the demarcation of the boundary between the two countries, it is required that it be accurately laid out between boundary monuments and that each segment has the appearance of a straight line of uniform width. 

The majority of the international boundary monuments along this section are 30 inch high, aluminum-bronze obelisks (cones), filled with concrete and set in 3-foot square concrete bases.   

In the interest of good public relations, it is essential that skilled workmen of good character carry out the work in a professional manner.

Due to the remotness of this project helicopter support and camping will be necessary.

Contact the International Boundary Commission to receive a detailed bid package for this project.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131) <br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />Hotline telephone number: 202.372.3695<br />FAX: 202.475.3904</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quote which shall be considered by the agency.</p>
<p>Closing date and time for receipt of offers is April 16, 2010 at 3:00 P.M., EST. Anticipated award date is on or about April 20, 2010.

EVALUATION PROCEDURES/BASIS FOR AWARD The Government intends to award a Firm-Fixed Price (FFP) contract using FAR 15.101-2, Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA). Only one (1) award may be made to the responsible quoter(s) who:1) quotes the brand name items specified in the combined synopsis/solicitation, conforming to the delivery requirement and; 2) quotes the lowest evaluated price. Information submitted by the offeror must be suficient to establish that the quoter is proposing the brand name items specified above. Quoters are  required to submit quotations for all CLINs. The Government intends to evaluate quotations and award a contract without discussions with quoters. Quotations should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary.
Quoters are encouraged to use Standard Form 1449, Solicitation/Contract/ Order for Commercial Items form found at http://www.gsa.gov/forms/pdf_file and submit a proposal. All qualified responsible small business sources may submit a quotation, which shall be considered by the agency. APPLICABLE PROVISIONS AND CLAUSES. Quotations received without the completed copy of the provision at FAR 52.212-3 may be considered non-compliant. Beginning January 1, 2005, the FAR requires the use of the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) in Federal solicitations as a part of the proposal submission process. ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitations. With ORCA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov. ORCA also allows Government personnel to access your information online, thus eliminating the need for you to submit representations and certifications with each offer. To register in ORCA you will need an active Central Contractor Registration (CCR) record and a Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) identified in that CCR record. Your DUNS number and MPIN act as your company's ID and password into ORCA. Vendors are reminded to protect their MPIN from unauthorized use. Once in ORCA you will be asked to review pertinent information pre-populated from CCR, provide a point of contact, and answer a questionnaire. The questionnaire is to help you gather information you need for the clauses. The questionnaire is not the official version. Be sure to read the provisions carefully. The answers you provide are then automatically entered into the actual FAR provisions. You will need to review and/or update your ORCA record when necessary, but at least annually in order to maintain its active status. Detailed information regarding ORCA, how to submit your record, and whom to call for assistance can be found on ORCA's homepage at http://orca.bpn.gov/help.aspx. Full text of FAR and DFARS provisions and clauses may be accessed at http://www.farsite.hill.af.mil/vffara.htm and http://farsite.hill.af.mil/VFDFARA.HTM, respectively.

<DESC>The purpose of this notice modification is to answer the following questions:<BR><BR>QUESTION 1.) The specification is for the size of the package which mounts on the pedestal. The requested specification is 24 inches wide, 12 inches high and 5 inches deep. These dimensions keep the total volume approximately the same as in the SOW (18X12x7), but give us greater flexibility in our design implementation.<BR><BR>ANSWER 1.) Please refer to the previous drawing labeled ROR antenna mounting for the dimensions of the ROR.  The placement of the antenna is critical (facing the front).  The ROR can accept both the 18 or 24 inches in length as shown in the drawing. It is acceptable with no increase in maximum weight.<BR><BR>

The contractor shall schedule sweeping of the parking areas and other areas as necessary to enable maximum cleaning of traffic surfaces minimally obstructed by parking vehicles, normal traffic, etc.                                                                                             2.	LAWN AND PLANT TREATMENT:  All grass areas shall be cut and maintained so that grass length does not exceed three and one-half (3 ) inches above the ground.  Grass shall not be cut any lower than two and one-half (2 ) inches above the ground.  VAACC-Columbus reserves the right to request additional mowing services on an as needed basis.  After cutting, clippings shall be mulched or removed to the extent that no clippings shall be visible.  (NOTE:  The grass areas all have a sprinkler system installed)  It is the responsibility of the contractor to monitor the height of grass and to mow when necessary.  The contractor shall also fertilize the lawn areas as needed to prevent the growth or spread of weeds, such as clover, dandelion, crabgrass, and other invasive weeds.  Fertilizer shall be put on the lawn to ensure that the lawn retains a lush, green appearance without bare spots.  The contractor shall also ensure that grubs are not present and treat as necessary to prevent further infestation including pest and insects control.  The contractor shall remove all dead trees and shrubs and provide the VAACC-Columbus a quotation for the cost of the replacement trees or shrubs.  Weeds/grass growing up from concrete or asphalt cracks/borders/expansion joints will be eradicated by the contractor, so as to maintain a weed free appearance.3.	AERATION OF SOIL:  Aeration consists of making plugs 3/8 inch in diameter by 3 inches deep on 9 inch centers across the complete area.  Aerating plugs shall be mulched or removed.  Aeration on those areas identified on the site plan exhibit shall be accomplished once each year during November. 4.	PLANTING, BEDS, MULCHING AND WEEDING:  All trees, shrubs, bushes and grasses shall be trimmed and pruned annually, and as deemed necessary by the VAACC-Columbus.  Where these plants are immediately adjacent to each other, trimming shall be performed at such a frequency and extent that no branches from one plant shall be within the extent of a branch from another plant.  Once perennial plants have bloomed and subsequently died, any remaining leaves or stems shall be trimmed back in a way that allows the plant to return the following year.  All mulch beds shall be replenished so as to maintain a minimum of 3 of mulch at all locations.  All beds shall be weeded at least at every mowing but will also be necessary when required by VAACC-Columbus.  The contractor shall be responsible for weeding all beds, so as to maintain a weed free appearance.5.	CLEAN-UP:  Grass cuttings, weeds and other debris on sidewalks, streets, parking lots, and other surfaces resulting from mowing, trimming, edging, and weeding will be swept, removed from serviced areas, and disposed of by the contractor at the contractors expense.  During the autumn months, leaves that accumulate on gutters, roadways, parking areas, sidewalks and grassy areas will be gathered, removed from the serviced areas, and disposed of by the contractor at the contractors expense.  Once during the spring and once during the fall, it is required that the contractor will perform an extensive cleaning including litter pickup of the areas mentioned, including using a commercial grade street sweeper.6.	NEW GRASS SEEDING:  Include in the quotation, the cost of all necessary labor, equipment, tools, materials, parts, supervision and incidental costs, including transportation and lodging to provide complete initial grass seeding of the newly acquired space (approximately 36,000 square feet) just south of the facility.

SAFETY REQUIREMENTS:  In the performance of this contract, the contractor shall take all necessary and prudent safety precautions in order to protect the lives and health of all individuals that frequent the facility.  The Contracting Officer or his/her designee will notify the contractor of any non-compliance with the foregoing provisions and the action to be taken.  The contractor shall, after receipt of such notice, immediately correct the conditions to which attention has been directed.  Such notice, when served on the contractor, or his/her representative at the site of the work, shall be deemed sufficient for the purpose aforesaid.  If the contractor fails or refuses to comply promptly, the Contracting Officer may issue an order stopping all or any part of the work and hold the contractor in default.8.	PROTECTION FROM DAMAGE:  The contractor shall provide all labor, materials and equipment necessary to protect personnel, furnishings, equipment and buildings from damage; shall remove and replace movable items, if necessary, and shall replace or repair any item damaged due to work performed under this contract equal to its original construction and finish. 9.	SITE VISIT:  The contractor is urged and expected to inspect the site where services are to be performed and to satisfy themselves regarding all general and local conditions that may affect the cost of contract performance, to the extent that the information is reasonably obtainable.  A site visit will be scheduled by the Contracting Officer.  In no event shall failure to inspect the site constitute grounds for a claim after contract award.10.	FACILITY MEASUREMENTS:  VAACC-Columbus currently consists of approximately 270,000 sq ft of grass that requires mowing, and approximately 49,000 sq ft of mulched areas.NOTE:  Approximately by mid summer of 2010, the VAACC-Columbus will acquire an additional property to the south of the existing location.

Once active, this space shall be maintained in the same manner detailed in the SOW.Other Requirements:1.	Competency of Contractor Personnel:  All services under this contract shall be performed by skilled personnel directly employed and supervised by the contractor.

Parking:  Contractor personnel shall park in areas as designated by Contracting Officer Technical Representative (COTR).4.

If occupational diseases are not compensable under those statutes, they shall be covered under the employer's liability section of the insurance policy, except when contract operations are so commingled with a Contractor's commercial operations that it would not be practical to require this coverage.  Employer's liability coverage of at least $100,000 is required, except in States with exclusive or monopolistic funds that do not permit workers' compensation to be written by private carriers.    (b)  General Liability: $500,000.00 per occurrences.    (c)  Automobile liability: $200,000.00 per person; $500,000.00 per occurrence and $20,000.00 property damage.    (d)  The successful bidder must present to the Contracting Officer, prior to award, evidence of general liability insurance without any exclusionary clauses for asbestos that would void the general liability coverage. Price Schedule:All offerors shall fill in the Price Schedule and return it with their offer.

If CBP canines are in the kennel, then only CBP personnel will clean the kennel. This prevents non CBP personnel from handling CBP canines. Answer to Question #2: CBP will be responsible for CBP canines that become sick or ill or injured while boarded at the Indio Kennel facility. If CBP canines become sick or injured while boarded at the kenneling facility due to negligence then they will pay for any medical bills incurred caused by this negligence.<BR><BR>

Amendment 1Yellowstone Troughs & WeirsSolicitation #: Q15761000104/1/10
SOLICITATION CLAUSES & PROVISIONS:
Clause 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statues or Executive Orders:Add the following clause to the list of incorporated clauses: "52.219-4"
CONTRACTOR QUESTIONS AND GOVERNMENT RESPONSES:
Question 1:	Will field measuring be required at each location? 
Response:	Yes
Question 2:	Are they (weirs & troughs) made the same and can I measure for all parts at one location? 
Response:	No, all locations are a little different.
Question 3:	Are the weirs and troughs located at section lines 5-6 and B-C, drawing #101/41129B, sheet P-5, page 19 of 64? 
Response:	Yes and between A and C design style between lines A and B for Grant Village only
Question 4:	Also located at section line 5-6, elevation 7789.67, sheet 23 of 64?
Response:	For Grant Village only
Question 5:	Is other equipment or materials being bid on other than the troughs and weirs? 
Response:	Not at this time
Question 6:	Would it be possible to visit the site before bidding so that I may provide an accurate bid and scope of the project? 
Response:	A site visit prior to the date proposals are due is not possible; thus offerors should base their proposals upon the solicitation documents
Question 7:	Do the details on page 26 of 64 give accurate detail of the troughs and weirs for all locations? 
Response:	No, all locations are different.
Question 7:	 Do you have a grade of stainless steel you are requiring, 304, 304L, 3/16, etc?
Response:	304
Question 8:	The Statement of Work indicates there are four Water Treatment Plants (WTP) requiring replacement troughs & weir plates though the drawings do not confirm this or indicate which of the plants is represented by any particular drawing.  Please confirm that there are (FOUR) WTP systems.
Response:	a)	drawing no. 101/41129B  Grant Villageb)	drawing no. 101/41170A  Canyonc)	drawing no. 101/41122B  Mammothd)	drawing no. 101/41195A  Old Faithful

Question 9:	 The drawings Gallery Level Plan show a Settling Tank No.1 & No.2 and a Filter No.1 & No.2.  This suggests that there are at each WTP (TWO) Settling Tank Troughs and (TWO) Filter Backwash Trough Assemblies.  If there are (FOUR) WTP systems this would mean that the RFQ is for a total of (EIGHT) Settling Tank Troughs and (EIGHT) Filter Backwash Trough Assemblies.  Please confirm or correct the quantities requested for quotation.
Response:	Mammoth:	2 each Settling Basins2 each Filter Basins
Canyon:	2 each Settling Basins2 each Filter Basins
Old Faithful:	2 each Settling Basins2 each Filter Basins
Grant Village:	2 each Filter Basins

Question 10:	Please confirm that the quotation is for the supply of the Troughs & Weir Plates, Fasteners, and Gaskets only with no installation required.
Response:	Yes

Question 11:	Is the delivery to be to (ONE) unload location or multiple (FOUR?)
Response:	Multiple
Question 12:	The specifications state that the Troughs & Weir Plates are "slightly different at each location" and that there is a requirement to "Field verify existing conditions and measurements at each site prior to ordering materials and commencing any other work."  Also stated is the requirement to "Construct and utilize protective decking...etc. (as needed)" This would, of course, add very substantially to the cost of providing the desired fabrications. Depending upon the nature of the "Slight Differences" there may be design adjustments for fabrication that would accommodate them for the field installer without incurring the cost of the described work.  For example, if there were only a relatively small difference in lengths alone, a slip flange for field welding would accommodate the variations.  Certainly having a local verification by NPS staff would be less costly than a contractor site visit with the mobilization, construction, & removal of protective decking, etc.  Please comment upon the nature and expected magnitude of all anticipated differences in these troughs.  Are you certain that the cost of this verification is desired in substantially inflating the costs of these fabrications as opposed to having the WTP staff verifying and providing the required information or of having your anticipated installation contractor performing this work?
Response:	Contractor to make their own measurements/verification before construction.
Question 14:	There is a statement in the solicitation " - Fabricate troughs and weirs from inch mill finished stainless steel." What is the dimension in reference to "inch"?
Response: 	1/4"

<SUBJECT>RFI for LED Airfield Taxiway Lighting
<SOLNBR>AFMC001
<RESPDATE>041210
<CONTACT>Molly James, Contract Specialist, Email molly.james@wpafb.af.mil - Christopher L. Muntz, Contract Specialist, Email christopher.muntz@wpafb.af.mil
<DESC><p>1.0 Description<br /><br />1.1 The United States Air Force's (USAF) Enterprise Sourcing Group (ESG) Civil Engineering Commodity Council (CECC) is in the process of&nbsp;determining a sourcing strategy&nbsp;for FAA-certified light-emitting diode (LED) taxiway fixtures. The chosen strategy would provide an enterprise-wide, continental United States (CONUS), solution for converting taxiways from quartz/incandescent fixtures to LED fixtures. The awarded company/companies would supply the LED fixture as well as potentially manage the installation of the fixture. <br /><br />1.2 THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue a RFP in the future. This request for information does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. Further, the Air Force is not at this time seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals. Responders are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI. All costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested party's expense. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any is issued. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website. It is the responsibility of the potential offerors to monitor this site for additional information pertaining to this requirement.<br /><br />2.0 Background<br />The ESG CECC is investigating the availability of suppliers of innovative LED technology that will improve efficiencies in both energy and manpower, while at the same time, maintain or improve airfield operations on taxiways. <br /><br />The USAF operates and maintains 46 CONUS bases which maintain airfield taxiway lighting systems by in-house government and contract work forces. Current airfield lighting, which is typically quartz/incandescent, is inefficient in terms of energy consumption and associated costs for illumination and also has higher greenhouse gas emissions compared to the new LED alternative. Further, there is a higher cost for operations and maintenance associated with airfield taxiway incandescent lamps and fixtures based on their energy consumption and life expectancies. There is also the potential that LEDs could improve the situational awareness and level of guidance to the pilots since LEDs have a greater intensity, which could reduce the amount of incursions and accidents during periods of darkness and low visibility.<br /><br />In line with the Air Force's "20/20 by 2020" goal - to offset a 20% reduction in funds by achieving efficiencies and operational/spend improvements by 20% - the ESG CECC is seeking strategic suppliers of this new LED technology to replace these less efficient incandescent lamps and fixtures, and to contract the work required and/or partner with the USAF to perform the installations and related construction/electrical work on the CONUS bases, so that we can gain benefits from the transition in FY 2011. <br /><br />3.0 Requested Information<br />The primary intent of this RFI is to determine the available LED taxiway fixtures and installation options which can be sourced to meet our mission needs. We also are seeking to streamline our sourcing process and any associated training with installing/maintaining the new LEDs. <br /><br />3.1 Focus areas include but are not limited to the examples listed below:<br /><br />3.1.1 The features of your LED product in terms of energy consumption, ease of maintenance/installation, projected total cost of ownership, and compliance with FAA requirements.<br /><br />3.1.2 The ease of implementing your solution from an enterprise-wide perspective and in the required geographic scope (CONUS) for both product and installation options.

INTRODUCTION The Air Force is planning to acquire a Personnel Recovery Recapitalization aircraft to replace the current HH-60G fleet. This is NOT an Invitation for Bid (IFB) or a Request for Proposal (RFP). The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this SSS/CRFI. This SSS/CRFI is part of ongoing Government conducted market research for planning purposes. It is NOT a solicitation. The Government will not provide reimbursement for costs associated with this request. Responses will be treated as information only and will not be used as a proposal. The submitted documentation, upon delivery, becomes the property of the US Government and will not be returned. Such information will be reviewed by a team comprised of Government as well as contractor personnel hired to provide technical assistance for the Government's preparation of an acquisition approach. All members of the team will be reminded of their obligation to protect such information to the maximum extent perm! itted or required by the Economic Espionage Act, 18 U.S.C. 1831 et seq., and other applicable statutes or regulations. In addition, Government members will be reminded of their obligations to afford protection under the Trade Secrets Act, 18 U.S.C. 1905. All contractor members are required to protect the information by the terms of their contracts. The Government will determine that their contractor team members have no organizational conflicts of interest that could adversely affect protection of the information. The Government will not reply to information received. The Government may conduct follow-on discussions with responders through individual one-on-one and/or collective "industry day" sessions.
It is anticipated the United States Air Force will replace an estimated 112 HH-60G air vehicles. The first lot is anticipated to be awarded beginning in FY12. To assist in this effort, the Aeronautical Systems Center (ASC), 303rd AESW, 669th AESS/SYKA, Wright-Patterson AFB OH, is issuing this Sources Sought Synopsis (SSS)/Capability Request for Information (SSS/CRFI) to obtain market insight into potential solutions and sources capable of providing eight (8) aircraft (excluding any RDT&E aircraft) with sufficient training and other support (initial spares, support equipment, technical data) to operate those aircraft.  The Air Force requires Initial Operational Capability (IOC) no later than 30 September 2015.
Meeting IOC at an affordable cost is critical. If the solution cannot meet all the capabilities, describe the capabilities your solution can meet if a contract award is made in FY12 and describe the cost and schedule needed to meet all the capabilities. If a respondent has more than one solution to discuss, a separate response for each is desired. Respondents must describe their solutions' compatibility and comparability to the given capabilities, rough order-of-magnitude (ROM) cost estimates, delivery schedules, and other market information of potential solutions. &#8195;PURPOSE 
The purpose of this SSS/CRFI is (1) to engage industry early in the effort, (2) to identify sources that can provide capability if a contract award is made in FY12, and (3) to assist the Air Force in ascertaining schedule, cost and technical risk associated with acquisition of the HH-60 Recap capability. The information respondents submit may be used to develop an acquisition approach. The information in this SSS/CRFI is preliminary and may be updated or changed prior to any formal release of an RFP. RESPONSE GUIDANCE 
Information received as a result of this request will be considered sensitive and will be protected as such. Any company proprietary information contained in the response should be clearly marked as such, by paragraph, such that 'publicly-releasable' and 'proprietary' information are clearly distinguished. Any proprietary information received in response to this request will be properly protected from any unauthorized disclosure. The Government will not use proprietary information submitted from any one responder to establish the capability and requirements for any future systems acquisition, so as to not inadvertently restrict competition. 
SSS/CRFI responses should include a:

The fact that Agilent manufactures both pieces of equipment will allow them to install the instrument with few, if any, complications.  Also, as the complete system will be manufactured by Agilent, the chances of hardware or software incompatibilities between the two components will be minimal.  The chances of encountering these incompatibilities with a hybrid system (Agilent and another company) are greater and may require service calls to remedy the situation.  Maintenance on a hybrid system would be complicated, and most likely more expensive with two manufacturers.  The particular brand name, product, or features described are essential to the Government's requirements; market research indicates other companies' similar products or products lacking the particular feature, do not meet, or cannot be modified to meet, the Government's needs.<BR><BR>The following FAR Clauses apply to this procurement.

<DESC>AMENDED TO ISSUE NOTICE:<br /><br />1) The proposal due date will be extended to April 29, 2010.<br /><br />2) Significant areas of change in the solicitation&nbsp;may be but are not limited to: 5 nines requirement, backup/failover of the centers, alarm data transfer, small business&nbsp;and evaluation criteria.<br /><br />3) An amended solicitation will be posted in the next few days.<br /><br /><br />AMENDED TO ISSUE AN AMENDED RFP, POST QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS, POST Pre-Proposal Conference Slides and Attendance List.<br /><br />The proposal due date has not been extended.<br /><br />AMENDED TO&nbsp;ISSUE THE FINAL RFP.<br /><br />AMENDED TO INCLUDE NOTICE THAT THERE&nbsp;IS A PREPROPOSAL CONFERENCE FOR THIS EFFORT&nbsp;ON MARCH 16, 2010&nbsp;as noted in Section L.<br /><br />The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Federal Protective Service (FPS) is responsible for providing security and law enforcement services for federal facilities. <br />The ICE Office of Acquisition (OAQ) plans to offer a requirement for a Computer Aided Dispatch Information System (CADIS) in support of the FPS Law Enforcement Mission.<br />To eliminate current functionality gaps and to address new law enforcement requirements a new system is needed that will automate core FPS law enforcement business processes and will result in a more standardized, integrated, and efficient national information technology solution for FPS. The system must provide a level of scalability and compatibility with other DHS, ICE, and FPS systems and shall always be in compliance with emerging DHS enterprise architecture. Further, the system must reflect the seamless integration of the following three functional components. <br />1) Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD) System for personnel dispatching in response to incidents.<br />2) Record Management System (RMS) to collect, share, and report incident information based on National Incident Based Reporting System (NIBRS) standards. A system to conduct efficient call center management, which includes automated data collection, calls routing, viewing call history, etc.<br />3) Geographic Information System (GIS) to provide location information to assess dangerous sites, improving routing, vehicle tracking and to display other relevant neighborhood information.
<p>Furthermore, the proposed CADIS must replace the current Daily Operations Log (DOL) and Web Records Management System (WebRMS). <br />CADIS shall have the capability to collect, modify, store, retrieve, and process record management and geographic information data via a report management function and a record management system. CADIS will improve FPS Officer Safety, as the current manual processes will be automated; reducing the chances of critical errors by removing the extensive liability that currently exists with the dispatchers. Additionally, CADIS will provide intelligent resources in reporting information that is needed to make knowledgeable business decisions and aid in criminal analysis, helping FPS' efforts in providing preventative security measures. <br />Specifically, the system shall:<br />&bull; Be fully National Incident Based Reporting System (NIBRS) compliant<br />&bull; Implement a system availability of 99.999 percent when measured on a 24-hour per day, seven day a week basis for 365 days. Processor, disk storage, and power supply redundancy may be required in order to achieve the desired availability and protection of information. The system shall be configured such that operating a training component and/or running reports will not affect system response time.<br />&bull; Interface with external applications and data sources.<br />&bull; Have the ability to push the client application via the DHS network to desktops and Mobile Computing Devices (MCD) via the internal network.<br />&bull; Allow a user the ability to access the application, download appropriate information and forms relating to incidents, and submit the necessary information without re-keying information. <br />&bull; Allow the capability to be directly expandable by adding hardware and Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) modules. <br />&bull; Include a feature for backup, archival and recovery capability without taking CADIS out of service and with minimal impact on dispatch operations. <br />&bull; Provide the capability for users to work offline in the event of connectivity failures, and the capability to continue to work off-line in the event the failure occurs in the middle of a session without any data loss, and to upload saved offline data when connectivity is re-established.<br />&bull; Contain data exporting capabilities. CADIS must have the capability to export data in industry standard database formats to facilitate providing data to other databases controlled by DHS and/or other government entities. <br />&bull; Be able to generate standard automated forms and templates to be used by all regions; such as incident report, spot report, etc.<br />&bull; Contain a wide variety of reports and statistical information for analysis and management reporting and/or reporting requirements in real time. <br />&bull; Allow ad-hoc, dynamically generated reports such that code modifications are not required for each new report.</p>
<p>It is the intent of FPS to adapt to the current industry best practices as it relates to the FPS operating procedures and the operating environment of CADIS. Implementing CADIS will enable key FPS stakeholders the opportunity to assess current operating procedures against any productivity gains that can be realized through the introduction of automation. Consequently, neither a blanket "technology driving the process," nor a "process driving the technology" approach will be embraced, but a balanced approach that seriously evaluates the cost/benefit trade-off in moving from current to new operating procedures.</p>
<p>This is&nbsp;a full and open competition&nbsp;with proposals due <strong>APRIL 8, 2010</strong>.</p>

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Training Systems Division (NAWCTSD) is planning the award of an Instructional Systems Development (ISD) contract. This contract will encompass the scope previously included in the NAWCTSD Training Systems Contract (TSC) Lot II. Preference will be given to making multiple awards with a long term ordering period, from 5 -8 years. This contract vehicle, the NAWCTSD ISD Multiple Award Contract (ISDC), will be designed to support current and future customers, including military communities from air, land, surface, undersea, cross platform, and joint systems, as well as other Government agencies. ISDC will provide the ability to analyze, design, evaluate, develop, produce, sustain, and implement traditional training solutions, technology-based training, job aids and performance support systems. ISDC will also provide support for concurrency management of existing training solutions, update/modernization of training delivery systems and conversion of training solutions and delivery systems to new and emerging technology. ISDC is in the acquisition planning stages and is examining the following functional areas, within the ISD process, to determine the optimal grouping of skill-sets required to optimally support customers. The three functional areas being examined are: &bull; Analysis, Design and Evaluation &bull; Development, Production, and Implementation &bull; Sustainment of Training Solutions As stated earlier, the ISDC team is in the acquisition planning stage and is conducting market research to support this process. Attached is a questionnaire concerning your company&rsquo;s human capital, facilities, past performance, capabilities, processes, tools, and capacity to perform. Please complete the attached questionnaire. The open ended essays are provided to solicit your company&rsquo;s opinions in a qualitative manner. To reduce your company&rsquo;s time investment in providing a response, the second section of the market research questionnaire is in table format. Your company&rsquo;s responses to the questionnaire will support the acquisition planning process. The responses received will assist the ISDC team in finalizing an acquisition process and help identify potential opportunities for socio-economic considerations. This sources sought is being posted under numerous NAICS codes to ensure that the maximum amount of interested parties are notified. Responses to this sources sought will be considered when the final solicitation NAICS code is selected. This is a request for information only and should not be construed as a commitment by the Government. No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing the information in response to any submittals. As a potentially interested party, please complete and return no later than no later than 1100, 10 February 2010 via email to Greg Dougherty at Gregory.Dougherty@navy.mil.

UPDATE: 01/28/2010 The following four documents have been added to complement the sources sought questionnaire. 1. TSC II Lot II SOW 2. ISDC Description 3. DADMS Training Education FAM 4. DADMS Enterprise Services FAM Clarification: Although this posting is listed under multiple NAICS listings, only one response is requested.

<DESC>NOTICE OF PROPOSED SOLICITATION

Worldwide Protective Services (WPS)

The U.S. Department of State (DOS) intends to award a multiple award Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity contract (IDIQ) to up to six (6) qualified U.S. firms.  DOS anticipates issuing Task and Delivery Orders under the IDIQ comprised of labor hour / day rate, firm-fixed price, and cost-reimbursement components.  
This IDIQ will satisfy anticipated and unanticipated personal protective, static guard, and emergency response team security service requirements worldwide. The IDIQ focuses primarily on DOS requirements in critical or higher than critical threat areas. The anticipated period of performance is one year with four, one-year option periods (to be exercised at the sole discretion of the Government). The NAICS code for these services is 561612. 
At a minimum, offerors must possess ALL of the following listed below: 

A.	A valid Final Secret Facility Security Clearance at the time of proposal submission for the base contract. If a firm with a valid Final Secret Facility Security Clearance is selected for award of the base contract, the Government will sponsor that firm for the Top Secret Facility Clearance. However, if for whatever reason, within 60 days of contract award, the firm has not been granted an Interim Top Secret Facility Security Clearance, DOS reserves the right to terminate the contract. Similarly, if for whatever reason, within 120 days of contract award, a final Top Secret Facility Security Clearance has not been granted to the contractor, DOS reserves the right to terminate the contract.; and

B.	Have at least two years of experience in managing and operating personal protective, static guard, and emergency response security services programs located in austere and hostile environments overseas (i.e. Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, etc); and

C.	Personal protective, static guard, and emergency response security programs must have a total annual value of at least 15 million dollars; and

D.	Programs must include at least two projects that include managing and operating guard forces with at least 100 positions (posts) at each location, in multiple locations (different facilities, cities, states, regions, etc.); and

E.	Programs must include at least two projects that include managing and operating long term personal protective security details for executive level dignitaries; and

F.	Programs must include at least two projects that include managing and operating emergency response teams comprised of at least four members.

The Contractor shall provide the organizational structure, management, and qualified staff at levels adequate to meet or exceed the requirements contained in the statement of work for each task order awarded under the IDIQ contract. All contracted personnel, regardless of nationality, will be required to pass background investigations conducted separately by the Contractor and the U.S. Government to certify their suitability to work under this contract. Depending on position, all prime and subcontractor employees performing on this contract must possess either a personnel security clearance or a moderate-risk public trust certification, or have been vetted by the Regional Security Office at the U.S. Embassy where performance is requested (for instance U.S. Embassy Baghdad or Kabul).  Firms that are not eligible for a facility security clearance are NOT ELIGIBLE for award of this contract as the prime contractor, nor can they be selected as a subcontractor if the positions require a personnel security clearance for contract performance.     

SPECIAL NOTES: 

1) All International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) and other legal requirements shall be met at the time of contract award.  DOS reserves the right to terminate the contract of a company that is not ITAR compliant.  Contractors shall submit proof of ITAR compliance at the time of contract award; and 

2) DOS reserves the right to reject the proposal of any Offeror that the Government of Iraq or Afghanistan deems ineligible for a Private Security Contractor license, or that is ineligible for any reason to operate as a Private Security Contractor in Iraq or Afghanistan.  Contractors shall submit proof of their legal ability to perform in any country where they are awarded work.

Anticipated Acquisition Schedule

DOS plans to post the complete Request for Proposal to www.fbo.gov approximately fifteen (15) days after this notice, no paper copies will be mailed. Once the solicitation is posted, offerors will have approximately sixty (60) days to submit a proposal for the IDIQ contract award along with four (4) task order proposals consisting of three (3) operational programs and a local program management office.  The three operational programs include: a static guard and emergency response team requirement in Baghdad, Iraq, a static guard and emergency response team requirement in Kabul, Afghanistan, and a personal protective security service requirement in Jerusalem.  DOS intends to award LPMO Task Orders concurrently to firms that are selected for award of an operational task order.  Offerors who do not submit proposals for the IDIQ and all the Task Orders will not be considered by the Government for award. Offerors will also be required to submit a completely separate proposal detailing expenses to establish an LPMO in the Washington, DC metropolitan area. Under this multiple award IDIQ contract, all offerors receiving awards SHALL propose 100% of the time on all task and delivery order requirements throughout the life of the contract.  The Government reserves the right to terminate any contractor for default who fail to conform to this requirement. DOS anticipates contract award approximately sixty (60) to seventy-five (75) days after submission of proposals. As such, offerors shall certify that all proposals SHALL NOT EXPIRE for a minimum of one hundred twenty (120) days after submission to the Government. 

The Question and Answer (Q &A) period opens with the posting of the solicitation (and not before). The Government will allow interested parties to submit questions to the Government up to April 23, 2010; 1:30 PM EDT after the solicitation is issued. DOS intends to address as many of the industry questions as possible during the pre-proposal conference. DOS will post the answers to any questions not addressed during the pre-proposal conference via www.fbo.gov at a later date. Parties attending the pre-proposal conference may submit questions in writing at the end of the conference. Interested parties may submit additional questions up to May 12, 2010; 5:30 PM EDT.    DOS will post answers to questions received at the conference and any additional questions via www.fbo.gov.

No more than three (3) representatives from each firm (to include potential subcontractors) may attend the site visit/preproposal conference. Interested parties SHALL BE READY to give Thomas C. Lemole notice of their interest by providing the name of the representative (s) who will attend the conference, name of the representing firm, address of the firm, telephone number of each person attending and Cage Code of the firm that will be the primary contractor.

Those representatives unable to present two forms of identification SHALL BE TURNED AWAY at the door. Preregistration is MANDATORY.

<DESC>This revision removes the radiation physicist as one of the required disciplines on the design team. It also corrects the floor description of the area designated for the new SPD department which will be gravel and not a concrete slab.REVISED SCOPE OF SERVICE: Architect or architect/engineer firm capable of preparing all design documentation including, but not limited to, advance planning and design of the relocation of an existing Sterile Processing and Distribution (SPD) Department at the Harry S Truman Veterans Memorial Hospital (HSTMVH) in Columbia MO. Prime contractor should have, at least, the following licensed/registered specialty disciplines as members of the firm, or team, with demonstrable expertise in their respective fields: Systems Redesign Consultant, Architect; Medical Planners; Structural, Mechanical, Geo-technical, Communication, Plumbing, and Electrical Engineers; Lean Consultant; Interior Designers; and Cost Estimators with experience in the programming, planning and design of a Sterile Processing and Distribution Department. The project will relocate the SPD Department from its current location in the basement of the hospital building to its new location in an unfinished space of the Operating Suite (OR) addition currently being constructed on the west side of the hospital building. The space to be located by the new SPD department is approximately 14,000 square feet with a gravel floor and exterior walls. The design shall include a system redesign process intended to review the existing SPD operation noting inefficiencies and inadequacies to incorporate improvements in the new space design. The result of the systems redesign process is to have a new work center design that yields the most effective use of space and equipment to achieve the departmental operational requirements. The project will include construction of floors, walls, doors, ceilings, electrical power and lighting, HVAC systems, plumbing systems, and floor coverings. Construction will include the installation of new sterilizers and all associated equipment and all necessary utilities including phone and data site prep.

<DESC>RELOCATE STERILE PROCESSING AND DISTRIBUTION PROJECT # 589-321QUESTIONS AND ANSWERSANSWERS TO QUESTIONS RECEIVEDQUESTION 1: Please confirm the role of the Lean Consultant as it appears that this is a design-bid-build project and lean consulting is typically used on design-build projects or projects with early contractor involvement  ANSWER 1: The A/E is to incorporate the Lean consultant in the design of the new space for the SPD department and proceed through complete construction documents and specifications. Once those are completed a contract for construction will be solicited. The A/E will remain on contract for construction period services such as submittal reviews and periodic site inspections including final inspection of the construction contract.QUESTION 2: Is the Systems Redesign Consultant and Architect the same discipline? ANSWER 2: The Systems Redesign Consultant is the equivalent of a Lean Consultant.QUESTION 3: What scope of work do you foresee for the geotechnical engineering since the project will be designed within the new OR addition? ANSWER 3: Though the building that the SPD department is going is in construction now, there won't be a concrete slab in place (unfinished basement area) and therefore will need to be designed for the equipment load going in that space. Surveying would not be needed, but geotechnical, civil, and environmental services may be required based on the results of the systems redesign. It is the responsibility of the A/E firm to ultimately determine what services will be needed.QUESTION 4: What scope of work do you foresee for the radiation physicist? ANSWER 4: That was an error. A radiation physicist will not be needed on this design.QUESTION 5: Is the Systems Redesign Consultant also a medical or equipment planner?ANSWER 5: The intention of the Systems Redesign Consultant is to work with the staff involved in the SPD relocation to develop the most efficient and cost effective space design. It would involve both medical and equipment planning disciplines.

<DESC>The Bureau of Land Management is utilizing Blanket Purachse Agreement L10PA00578 to award the subject requirement to Premeir Data Services.  Below is a general description of the requirement.
Land Status records consist primarily of Master Title (MT) and Use plats and Historical Index (HI) pages.  All actions affecting the use of public lands are recorded on the Historical Index pages with current cases graphically portrayed on the plats.  The plats and HIs are used to process renewable energy applications therefore the information portrayed should be accurate and current as well as being in a digital format, well-organized, and accessible in an effective and efficient manner.
The LR2000 database consists of 3 major databases derived from the daily workings of the lands and mineral staff.  The Status database contains case information that affects administration of public lands, i.e. patents, withdrawals.  The Case Recordation database contains information pertaining to temporary actions that affect the availability of federally administered lands for approved actions, i.e. oil and gas leasing, wind energy farms.  The Legal Land Description database provides information pertaining to the official cadastral survey of record and the derivation of corresponding legal descriptions. 
The information contained in the LR2000 databases is instrumental in providing public access to case information and, since it contains legal land descriptions and acreage associated with each case, one should be able to derive geospatial information easily and on demand.
To accomplish the requirements of this task, the vendor shall verify that all official records and other documents affecting renewable energy areas are current, complete, and in digital format.  This includes scanning of approximately two million controlled document index (CDI) cards.  The vendor shall assure data contained in LR2000 accurately and precisely reflects the official record in accordance with revised LR2000 standards with land description that can be mapped in GIS.  The vendor shall prepare data to be published on either the intranet or internet.

<p>Identification of OPDIV/Contracting Activity: OAGM/AGG/DRCG</p>
<p>Project Officer: Linh Kennell, ORDI<br />Title: Research Data Assistance Center (ResDAC)<br />Contract Type: Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee<br />Contractor: University of Minnesota<br />Contract No.: HHSM-500-2005-00027I/Task Order 0003</p>
<p>Findings:<br />I. Authority</p>
<p>This contract action is funded by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, (Recovery Act, P.L. 111-5) which specifies, "To the maximum extent practicable, contracts funded under this Act shall be awarded as fixed-price contracts through the use of competitive procedures." <br />II. This contract action is competitive.<br />__ X__ Yes (Modification to Competitive Cost Reimbursement Award)<br />_____ Not Available for Competition. This action is statutorily exempt from competition, e.g., noncompetitive 8(a) set-aside, Tribal agreements (for IHS only), mandatory source.<br />___ _ No As appropriate, please attach a copy of (1) the Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition (JOFOC); (2) the Limited Source Justification (LSJ); (3) documentation of Exception to the Fair Opportunity Process (under FAR 16.505(b)(5)); or (4) for simplified acquisitions, a brief description of the circumstances which justify not competing, signed by the contracting officer. <br />III. This contract action is fixed price. <br />_____ Yes<br />___X_ No</p>
<p>Specificity/nature of requirement (risk and profit):</p>
<p>Modification to a Competitive Cost Reimbursement Award<br />This effort is currently being performed by the University of Minnesota under its MRAD Task Order Contract which was competitively awarded in 2005 under the procedures of FAR 16.505, multiple awards, Indefinite Delivery - Indefinite Quantity contracts. CMS intends to modify Contract HHSM-500-2005-00027I/Task Order 0003, which was competitively awarded on September 29, 2008 as a CPFF Task Order Type. <br />The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has long supported extra-mural research to evaluate the provision of health services in the United States. In operating multi-billion dollar programs with major effects on the provision of health services to special populations, including many of the most vulnerable and with the most chronic conditions in the United States, CMS understands the crucial need to continually support policy development and analyses. Continuing concerns over the rising cost of health services and proposals for reform of government-financed and private sector health services have further highlighted the need for comprehensive, solid research.<br />A wide range of research is carried out and supported by CMS, much of it using data that originate from operation of the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The Medicare program covers Parts A (Hospital Insurance), B (Supplemental Medical Insurance), C (Medicare Advantage programs) and, now, Part D, the prescription drug program. The Office of Research, Development &amp; Information (ORDI) has and continues to conduct and support research on all programs that CMS operates. The research has involved the evaluation of CMS program changes, the impact of legislation, access to care, utilization of services, the costs of care, health services outcomes, the appropriateness of care, quality of care, the epidemiology of disease in the population and other topics.<br />A key component of ORDI, CMS research support involves collaboration with outside researchers. Researchers in the health services arena are affiliated with other government agencies and commissions (both Federal and State), the academic community (schools of medicine, public health, public policy, and economics), non-profit organizations, private consultants (for-profit health research organizations) and other private sector health services providers (hospitals and Medicare Advantage plans). <br />In the course of operating its programs, CMS maintains and utilizes a vast array of data. These data provide information on eligibility and enrollment, Medicare and Medicaid providers, claims and utilization, program regulations, and clinical assessment information that support program oversight, research and evaluation purposes. In the early 1990's, CMS became aware that there are many potential researchers who are not familiar with the wealth of complex Medicare and Medicaid data available. Furthermore, CMS data are not always easy to use, even for researchers experienced with administrative databases. Because of the complexity of the data, for the many health care researchers it is often difficult for them to prepare first-time requests with the appropriate level of specificity needed. Researchers are not always aware of what data are available, when updates take place, the applicability of specific data elements, the implications of CMS program changes on data consistency, and techniques for linking CMS data with data from other sources. In the ensuing years, it has become more difficult for even frequent users of CMS data to use the current files being released. Due to changes in CMS policies regarding beneficiary privacy, the linking of data files has become more challenging as the personal identifiers (i.e., a SSN or HIC) for a beneficiary is no longer provided, rather a unique ID per study is being released. In addition to the CMS Data Center, CMS is now distributing data to researchers prepared by contractors, the Research Data Distribution Center (RDDC) and the Chronic Conditions Warehouse (CCW) which have different formats. Finally, and very importantly, requirements for requesting the data have evolved to become more stringent in recent years in order to better protect beneficiaries.<br />ResDAC has become an integral part of the CMS research and data request process and is the front line contact for researchers. This role will expand in the future, and ResDAC will take a larger role in all requests (including precedent setting requests), CMS contractor requests and the Part D data request process. The future ResDAC contractor will have an expanded role not only with the CMS Privacy Board, but the new Data Governance Board and the Review Board for Part D requests, also.<br />The education and training of researchers will have particular emphasis in this contract due to the forthcoming release of Part D data including the new Part D Medicare Denominator file and a Part D Drug Event data file. This will further expand the scope of ResDAC's current workshops that encompass the use of Medicare enrollment and utilization data, Medicaid eligibility and utilization data, Cost Reports, linked data files such as SEER-Medicare data, MCBS Survey data, and more sophisticated analysis of payment related systems and variables.</p>
<p>Monitoring and Cost Control</p>
<p>The contractor shall develop and provide to CMS monthly status reports that can be used for the required stimulus reporting. Section 1512 9 (c) of the Recovery Act requires that each contractor report on its use of Recovery Act funds. These reports will be made available to the public. The contractor will develop monthly reports that identify the activities, equipment, and staffing which have been allocated using the stimulus funding. The report shall contain, at a minimum, the total costs associated with enhancing each of the following modified tasks: help desk, outreach, website resources and workshops. CMS may request ad hoc, customized reports in addition to the monthly reporting.</p>
<p>IV. If this contract action is not both fixed price and competitive, describe any additional steps taken to pursue a fixed priced competitive award (e.g., prepared more precise requirements documents; established more stringent review thresholds; expanded market research).<br />This contract/task order will be modified to include this effort. This requirement, as noted above, is unpredictable in nature and therefore a firm fixed price contract is not achievable. No other additional steps were taken to pursue a fixed price contract.<br />&emsp;</p>
<p>V. Determination:<br />Based upon the findings, it is the determination of the government that a Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee contract type enhances the degree of potential successful performance that could not absorb the risk of a fixed-price contract type.<br />The HCA (or a GS-1102-15 or higher designee) certifies that a fixed price award is not appropriate (considering contract risk, profit, and specificity/nature of requirement).</p>

<p>RECOVERY-THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY.&nbsp;&nbsp; THIS NOTICE IS NOT A NOTICE FOR SOLICITATION OF OFFERS.&nbsp; THE ACTION DESCRIBED HEREIN IS A MODIFICATION TO AN EXISTING CONTRACT, DOLJ06QA00004.&nbsp; THIS OPPORTUNITY WAS AVAILABLE ONLY TO THE CONTRACTOR IDENTIFIED BELOW.</p>
<p>This opportunity was available only to the Res-Care, Inc under contract number DOLJ06QA00004.&nbsp; The Office of the Assistant Secretary for Administration and Management on behalf of the Office of Job Corps intends to award a modification in the amount of $3,443 to the South Bonx Job Corps Center, operated by Res-Care, Inc.&nbsp; These funds are provided under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA).&nbsp; The funding is within the not-to-exceed ceiling for CRA on this contract.</p>
<p>It would have been impracticable to use a fixed price contract to secure services of the kind or quality required for this modification, since the modification was to an existing Cost Plus Incentive Fee contract (Cost Reimbursement Contract).</p>
<p>The funding is intended to address the following program initiatives:&nbsp; $3,443 to replace the Boiler Room non-functioning sump pump with a new one designed to handle hot water.&nbsp; The operator of the South Bronx Job Corps Center will procure the services of local construction and service providers, by making these funds available through subcontracting opportunities, following all applicable FAR procurement regulations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This modification has been awarded on April 1, 2010.</p>

<DESC>RECOVERY ACTION.  FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. DUNS 007113228.  The modification addresses the following work:

These funds will be used for development of solar reactor technologies to produce syngas from methane and CO2 waste systems.

The action is other than fixed price because work assigned to the Sandia Corporation through the issuance of Work Authorizations (WAs) is pursuant to the terms and conditions of their prime management and operating contract awarded under as a cost reimbursement type contract due to the uncertainties in contract performance.  Cost cannot estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed price contract as the exact nature and duration of the work is uncertain.  The use of a separate fixed price award to Sandia Corporation for the WA is inappropriate because this is issued under an existing cost reimbursable contract.  Sandia was selected by the Department of Energy to participate in this American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) work due to the expertise at Sandia National Laboratories (SNL) in the subject matter.  The funds will ensure the best selection of grantees proposing the best approach in support of new, expanded or re-equipped domestic manufacturing facilities with a goal of growing the domestic manufacturing industrial base with clean energy, sustainable economic growth, job creation, and reduced generation of greenhouse emissions.  The work falls within the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy which is covered by the prime contract Statement of Work, paragraph 3.3, entitled “Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy” that states: “The Contractor shall provide research, design and manufacturing capabilities for solar electric technologies (solar thermal and photovoltaic), wind energy, geothermal energy systems, industrial and transportation applications, fossil energy programs, electric power systems, hydrogen power technologies and battery systems for utilities and transportation.”  

NOTE:  This action is awarded under prime contract modification no. 373 that recognizes WA no. SNL-10-09-014577 issued under Management and Operating Contract number DE-AC04-94AL85000.  This action is funded by Recovery Act dollars.

These funds will be used for construction of the High Energy Battery Test Facility at the Sandia National Laboratories (SNL).  These funds will also be used for:
•  Capital equipment purchase (Laser Diagnostic System and Data Acquisition System and Display), installation and software.
•  Staff support required for two tasks: 1) Technical oversight, project plan development, partnership coordination, and equipment installation review; and 2) Development and installation of a laser based diagnostic system.

<DESC>NASA has a requirement that will be filled under Task 55, of Contract NNG09HP18Cfor the Hydrospheric and Biospheric Sciences (HBS) at NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center(GSFC) to procure a laser system and Attitude and position sensor system. The LaserVegetation Imaging Sensor (LVIS) is a medium/high-altitude wide-swath laser altimeterthat has, for over a decade, demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in measuringvegetation structure, and the topography of land, oceans, ice sheets, and sea ice.  A newversion of the LVIS sensor is being developed (LVIS-GH) specifically for operations inthe Global Hawk aircraft.  The intent of this effort is to purchase upgrades to two keysubsystems of LVIS-GH to make it suitable for operations in a high-altitude, autonomousenvironment. The first is the LVIS-GH laser transmitter subsystem. This new laser systemis required to have a faster repetition rate and higher pulse energy to compensate forthe faster ground speed and higher altitude experienced in the Global Hawk aircraft. Thesecond system is the Precision Attitude and Position Determination Subsystem consistingof a tightly-coupled GPS (Global Positioning System) and INS (Inertial NavigationSensor). Currently, an Applanix POS/AV 510 unit is utilized with LVIS in lower altitudeaircraft. To achieve the required measurement accuracy from the high-altitude Global Hawkplatform, a more accurate attitude determination system is required. Our analysis hasdetermined that the Applanix POS/AV 610 has sufficient accuracy and performance to meetthis requirement. This task under the HBS contract will be performed utilizing AmericanRecovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) funds.&lt;P&gt;NASA/GSFC has awarded Task 55 under Contract NNG09HP18C with Sigma Space Corporation. Contract NNG09HP18C with Sigma Space Corporation is a Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) contractand was awarded on June 15, 2009, on a competitive basis.  This work could not beperformed on a fixed price basis due to the variability of research and development to beproduced with these instruments.

<DESC>Contract N00019-10-C-0008, has been awarded to BAE Systems, 6500 Tracor Lane, Austin TX 78725 and provides an updated Central Processing Unit (CPU) for the AN/ALE-47 Programmer, which drives the AN/ALE-47 countermeasures (chaff and flares) dispensing system fielded on multiple US Navy platforms. Due to the increasing complexity of dynamic threats and required countermeasures options, the current programmer fails to meet system minimum specifications. This action will provide for production of six hundred (600) units and integration of a new CPU/Circuit Card Assembly (CCA) to replace the current AN/ALE-47 Programmer CPU/CCA. This modification is known as the Power PC upgrade. Additional nonrecurring activities will include a preliminary design review, critical design review, functional configuration audit, and physical configuration audit. In addition, a Technical Data Package will be procured.<br />

<DESC>The PT Armor Ballistic Vest model CGC-3A  is currently used by the Diplomatic Security Training Center and issued to all agents enrolled in the High Threat Program. Due to the program shortening the course, the total number of courses has allowed for up to an additional 100 students to be trained this fiscal year. In order to make up for the additional 100 units of the vests, a sole source is required to obtain the same vest that agents are being issued this fiscal year. It is vital to the program’s success that classes are issued the same equipment each fiscal year, before the requirement is recompeted for FY 2011. The estimated cost is $61,500.00.  

The requiring office is the Bureau of Diplomatic Security, Diplomatic Security Training Center, Special Skills Branch; 2216 Gallows Road; Dunn Loring, VA 22027.  The point of contract for this order is Jeff Abramaitys and Matthew MacPhail, 703-204-6275 / 571-233-7225.
