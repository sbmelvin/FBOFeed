Proposals should be submitted initially on the most favorable terms from a price and technical standpoint.  The Government may, after evaluation, award without discussions or conduct further oral discussion with any or all offerors.  Award will be made to the Offeror: (1) whose proposal is technically acceptable and (2) whose technical/cost relationship is the "best value" to the Government.

<DESC>The Headquarters Air Force Services Agency (HQ AFSVA), Directorate of Non-Appropriated Funds (NAF) Financial Management and Comptroller (HQ AFSVA/SVF), is seeking a commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS), web-based fully integrated Treasury Management (In-House Banking) System (TMS) Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system solution. The system must support a global Internet solution to support submission, transmission, storage, and retrieval of required in-house banking financial information.  This includes the capability to accept external data using open application programming interface (API) standards.  The Treasury Division through the Air Force Cash Management and Investment Program (CMIP) provides for central consolidation and management of all nonappropriated fund (NAF) cash resources.  The Treasury Division uses one principal concentration bank, and maintains accounts in other financial institutions on or near approximately 90 Air Force bases throughout the world.  Installation accounts (i.e. virtual accounts) are with the CMIP (as the central in-house bank) and not with the financial institutions.  The installation-level accounting system automatically submits the deposit, disbursement, and inter-NAFI transfers to HQ AFSVA/SVFB to post to the individual CMIP account holders.  The CMIP system uses inter-bank transfers (cash concentration system) to accomplish cash consolidations.  Automated Clearing House (ACH) remittances are also received at the concentration bank on behalf of the installations; these remittances are sent electronically to the Treasury Division and are posted to the individual CMIP accounts.  HQ AFSVA will provide the necessary on-site equipment and facilities at all locations for the Local Area Network (LAN) hardware, servers, and Wide Area Network (WAN) requirements.  We currently are operating in a client server environment.  We are running Microsoft Server 2000, a SQL database server and an Oracle database server.  The operating system in the new TMS may be UNIX, Sun Microsystems' Solaris, or Microsoft Windows.  Vendor may recommend upgraded hardware systems, but the Government is under no obligation to purchase said equipment.  

All interested parties can request a proposal from Hope R. Young or Max Browning at 210.652.6931 or via email at hope.young@agency.afsv.af.mil or max.browning@agency.afsv.af.mil or a copy can be printed using the following directions:

1.	Go to www.afnafpo.com
2.	Click on LINKS
3.	Click on AFNAFPO Business Opportunities.  

Request for Proposals will be available 8 December 2005. All responses should be submitted to AFNAF Purchasing Office, ATTN Mrs. Hope Young, 9504 IH 35 North Suite 370, San Antonio, TX 78233.  All responses shall be received no later than 6 January 2006, 4:30 P.M., Central Time Zone.  The information received will be considered confidential and will not be disclosed without the express written consent of the supplier.  This notice does not express or imply any intent to purchase any service or to enter into a contractual agreement.  Any information provided will be at no cost to the Government.  This is a nonappropriated fund purchase and it does not obligate appropriated funds of the United States Government.  Nonappropriated funds are generated by the military community through the sale of goods and services and the collection of fees and charges for participation in military community programs.  This purchase does not involve federal tax dollars.

B.   Past Performance 

The Government will assess the relative risks associated with each offeror.  Performance risks are those associated with an offeror's likelihood of success in performing the contract requirements as indicated by that offeror's record of past performance.  The assessment of performance risk is not intended to be the product of mechanical or mathematical analysis of an offeror's performance on a list of contracts, but rather the product of subjective judgment by the Government after it considers all available and relevant information.  

When assessing performance risks, the Government will focus on the past performance of the offeror as it related to all acquisition requirements such as cost, schedule, and performance, including standards of good workmanship; the administration aspects of performance; the offeror's reputation for reasonable and cooperative behavior and commitment to customer satisfaction; and generally, the offeror's business-like concern for the interest of the customer.  (See Section L for submission requirements.)

Past performance findings will be highly influential in determining the relative merits and risks associated with the offeror’s proposal in a comparative assessment with all competitors.  The Government will evaluate the reputation and quality of the offeror’s past performance.  The assessment of the offeror’s past performance will be used as a means of evaluating the relative capability of the offeror to other offerors.   Evaluation of past performance will be a subjective assessment based upon consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances.  The Government is seeking to determine whether an offeror has consistently demonstrated a commitment to customer satisfaction and timely delivery of services at fair and reasonable prices.  Offerors will be given an opportunity to address unfavorable reports of past performance, and the offeror’s response, or lack thereof, will be taken into consideration.  In investigating the offeror’s past performance, the Government will consider references submitted by the offeror and may consider information from other sources. 

C.    Price/Cost Evaluation

Price/Costs shall be provided in the format identified in Section L and will be evaluated on the basis of cost realism.  (See Section L for submission requirements.)   As discussed in FAR 15.404-1(d), cost realism analysis is the process of independently reviewing and evaluating specific elements of each offeror's proposed cost estimate to determine whether the estimated proposed cost elements are realistic for the work to be performed; reflect a clear understanding of the requirement; and are consistent with the unique methods of performance and materials described in the offeror's technical proposal. Realism of prices and costs against technical/management proposals may be evaluated as a part of the overall evaluation. Costs will be evaluated as an objective and subjective factor.  All cost and pricing information required by Section L shall be provided and will be used to determine its allowability, allocability and reasonableness relative to the work to be performed under the proposed contract.  The negotiated rates for field overhead, prime’s overhead on subcontractors, prime’s home office overhead, and prime’s profit will be incorporated into the successful offeror’s contract and will be applied to the direct costs of all contract modifications, additive and deductive, (excluding modifications to exercise options).

<DESC>The Bureau of Land Management New Mexico State Office intends to negotiate a sole-source award with Oil-Law Records Corporation, an SBA-certified small business in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma for annual access to historical and current New Mexico and Oklahoma oil well data.  The subscription enables document search by location including filings in the Oklahoma Corporation Commission's oil and gas dockets; allows highly-accurate geological trend tracking of developing and historically productive oil and gas zones; and allows direct access to New Mexico Oil and Gas Commission's pooling and unitizations and well records.  By the guidelines prescribed under FAR Part 6.302-1, this contracting office believes that Oil-Law Records Corporation is the only one responsible source and that no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirement at this time.  The firm's capability to provide the required New Mexico and Oklahoma well data through their online services is crucial in the furtherance of the BLM's mission.  Any firm that believes they can satisfy the government requirement described herein must submit a written response containing at a minimum the firm's name, contact information, and strong supporting evidence thereof.  Written response on company letterhead must be received in this office by electronic mail only within 5 days of this announcement's transmission date.  The decision to compete the requirement or to continue with the sole-source award to Oil-Law Records Corporation rests ultimately to the servicing Contracting Office.

<CONTACT>Robert Gilmore, Contract Specialist, Phone 951-413-2412, Fax 951-413-2432, Email gilmorw@dodmedia.osd.mil - Artimae Shepherd, Contracting Officer, Phone 951-413-2303, Fax 951-413-2432, Email atrimae.shepherd@dodmedia.osd.mil
<DESC>Note 22 applies.  The Government intends to solicit, negotiate, and award a contract to Scientific Atlanta (S-A) for the management of the PowerVu Connect database of customers receiving television programming from the American Forces Network (AFN)and the American Forces Radio and Television Service (AFRTS.)  This is a follow-on contract to MDA112-02-C-0027, also awarded to S-A.  S-A provides a unique capability that allows authorized customers to access PVConnect, a database driven, publicly-accessible website that provides the capabilities defined by AFRTS requirements for user, trusted user, and administrator level access and control over decoder authorizations, and provides a high level of isolation between those users and the PowerVu Network Center (PNC.) A PNC, is employed at each of the seven satellite uplink systems that make up today’s AFRTS satellite network.  Each PNC provides network management, security, and decoder management and control functions and allows properly authenticated users to have full access and control over each PowerVU uplink.  In the wrong hands this level of access is extremely hazardous to the mission of AFRTS as one could potentially provide, or deny, total access to AFRTS programming to any location on Earth.  Access to the PNC gives one the power to destructively modify the configuration of the AFRTS satellite network and potentially jeopardize access to commercial television and radio programming. The programming signal is decoded for each customer by a set-top box, called a Direct-to-Home (DTH) decoder. The number of DTH decoders is expected to exceed 70,000 in CY2006 and bring the total worldwide population of decoders above 100,000. PVConnect was designed without allowing any external customer, trusted user, or administrator level staff direct access to PNC directly therefore preventing damage to the network.  Key to the PVConnect website is S-A’s ownership rights to the conditional access and encryption systems within PowerVU, which belongs to a single source.  No commercial equipment, hardware or software can be modified or interchanged to work with any S-A PowerVU conditional access and encryption system.  Only one manufacturer, Scientific-Atlanta, is capable of simultaneously providing both the isolation required between the website and PNC as well as the required connectivity for machine control between the website and the PNC.  S-A remains an industry leader in conditional access – a core capability of PowerVU.  S-A’s technology provides its customer’s absolute assurance that only authorized users will have access to satellite delivered products (includes video, audio, and data products).  AFRTS has built strong relationships with the television, movie, and radio production industries who provide programming to the military, often times at little or no cost, but only with the clear understanding their products are protected from unauthorized use.  PowerVU provides this capability to AFRTS.  Scientific-Atlanta was chosen in a formal selection process to provide PowerVU to AFRTS and thusly to also develop and provide the PVConnect website capability.  Scientific-Atlanta does not outsource nor license any of its proprietary conditional access technology and thus keeps all repair services for PowerVU hardware in house.  No other vendor or manufacturer is known to have the capabilities to meet all requirements necessary for PVConnect.

 Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Responses should be submitted within 10 days of publication of this notice.  Written responses can be faxed to (951) 413-2432 or e-mailed to Bill.Gilmore@dodmedia.osd.mil.

<DESC>The U. S. Coast Guard (USCG) intends to negotiate a sole-source contract with the Smithsonian Institution, Office of Sponsored Projects, 750 Ninth Street N.W., Washington, DC 20560.  The USCG has a requirement for the operation of the National Ballast Information Clearinghouse (NBIC) and support for the USCG Ballast Water Management (BWM) program.  Pursuant to Section 1102(f) of the National Invasive Species Act (NISA) of 1996 (Pub. L. 104-332), the USCG is required to develop and maintain a NBIC in consultation and cooperation with the Smithsonian Institution, acting through the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center (SERC).  The Smithsonian Institution has operated the NBIC since 1998 under a cooperative agreement with the USCG.  Under NISA and its implementing regulations (33 CFR 151 Subpart D), each vessel bound for ports or places of the United States, regardless of whether a vessel operated outside the Economic Exclusion Zone (EEZ), which includes the equivalent zone of Canada, is required to submit reports of BWM practices directly to the NBIC for entry into a database.  The NBIC is responsible for the management and timely statistical analysis of the data collected under the BWM program, assists in the development and implementation of appropriate data collection techniques, and supports the USCG’s efforts to prepare and submit biennial reports on BWM to the U. S. Congress.  The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.3.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, the Government will consider all responses received from interested responsible sources by 2:00 P.M., Eastern Standard Time, December 23, 2005 at USCG Headquarters, Commandant (G-ACS-2/EF), 2100 Second St., S.W., Room 11-0334 JR, Washington, DC 20593-0001.

A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The National Park Service, Historic Preservation Training Center, requires Architect-Engineer services for the design development, complete construction plans and specifications, Class "A" cost estimates, related studies, and all associated engineering services needed for a complete historically accurate rehabilitation of the Troy House located off Route 176, just southeast of the intersection with Interstate 95, Dorsey, Howard County, Maryland.  The Troy House a 2 ½ story stone masonry structure, rectangular in plan (approximately 36' x 40') with a walk-out basement.  The uncoursed rubble stone walls are continuous from foundation to eave and are topped with a side gable roof.  The building was constructed sometime in the first quarter of the 19th century by Vincent Bailey, a prosperous Howard County farmer, in the Georgian style with a traditional center hall plan.  Since that time it had undergone many renovations, including a Colonial Revival remodel in the 1940s.  In 1992 the structure was gutted by fire leaving only the stone exterior walls with window and door openings, brick chimneys and various fireboxes.  All of the interior and exterior wooden structural and decorative elements were lost; including the roof, windows, doors, trim and plaster work.  In an effort to preserve the remaining historic masonry shell, a contract was written with an architectural/engineering firm after the fire to stabilize the structure.  In the last few years, elements of the stabilization have failed.  In 2004, an Emergency Stabilization Plan to address the most critical deficiencies and the recommended treatments were performed.  It is the intent of this project, to return the building's exterior elevations, porch and roof to a specific period within its early evolution and then interpret the exterior envelope at that point in time.  The interior will be adaptively reconstructed to serve a new modern use, of which is yet to be fully determined.  Work will consist of the complete historically accurate rehabilitation of the 2 ½ story stone and brick building envelope, exterior doors and windows, the roof structure, roof covering and front porch.  The building interior will be all new construction including the floor, wall and ceiling structural and finish systems; new mechanical; electrical and plumbing, fire protection and security systems; all to meet the new building interior use needs.  The interior usable space is estimated at 5,000 square feet.  New underground utilities will be brought to the building and connected.  Work will also include grading around the building for site drainage, handicap accessibility, and turf restoration.  The estimated value of the construction project is between $500,000 and $3,000,000.  Award of a firm-fixed price contract is estimated to be made on or before February 10, 2006.  Design work shall begin on or before February 10, 2006 with completion by May 9, 2006.  Construction work shall begin on or before August 2006 with completion of all work by August 2007.

At a minimum, firms must submit qualifications that demonstrate design experience with historic building exterior restoration and complete interior adaptive reuse.  Specific experience should include restoration of stone and brick masonry; design of historically accurate exterior roof structures and coverings, porches, doors and windows.  Demonstrated ability and experience must also provide in client relations and design guidance in the development of a totally new interior structure, spaces and systems which meet client needs and work within an historic building envelope and footprint.  Evaluation will be based on the following criteria in descending order of importance: (1) Qualifications of all team members based on demonstrated experience with historic buildings and projects similar to the work proposed.  (2) Past Performance, demonstrating quality of work for projects similar to the work proposed, professional expertise, technical competence; quality control, and the ability to effectively schedule and manage a multi-disciplinary project team; (3) Demonstrated ability to provide cost effective design and construction solutions with emphasis on Green Building (Leeds), sustainable methods and technologies, and the ability to effectively manage budgets between a multi-disciplinary project team; and (4) Capacity to accomplish work within the required timeframe.

<DESC>NASA/GSFC has a requirement for the operations of the Interplanetary Monitoring Platform (IMP)8 Data Processing System (DPS). NASA/GSFC intends to purchase this service(s) from Fundamental Technologies in accordance with the requirements of FAR 13.106, for the acquisition of supplies or services determined to reasonably available from only one source. Fundamental technologies was orignally selected to develop, prove and operate the new IMP 8 DPS software.  The IMP 8 telemetry data will continue to be captured at the NASA ground station in Canberra, Australia. Fundamental Technologies is the only organization identified with the essential but very specific mission background and has the interest and willingness to undertake this software development effort. Given that some elements of the processing require manual oversight to correctly operate and given the age and orignal design of IMP 8 itself, only an organization highly familiar with the working of the new IMP 8 DPS and the new IMP program, data environment and instruments can continue successful operation of the new system.   Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact no later than 4:30 p.m. eastern standard time on the date listed above.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<RESPDATE>122305
<ARCHDATE>01232006
<CONTACT>Point of Contact, Scott Fogle, Purchasing Agent, Phone (513) 487-2049
<DESC>NAICS Code: 541330   The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Office of Research and Development (ORD), National Center for Environmental Assessment (NCEA), intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b), with Wilkes Technologies Inc.  This sole source award will address highly technical review comments on the structure and operation of the Total Exposure Model and physiologically based pharmacokinetic models employed in the NCEA-C-1691 report; to translate concentrations of trihalomethanes disinfection byproducts into human internal doses  and target tissue concentrations; and develop three draft manuscripts for submission to peer reviewed journals; provide textual, graphic and tabular input to the three manuscripts. Based on the EPA's knowledge of this requirement, there are features covered in the statement of work  that may have  unique capabilities to particular vendors.   Statement of Work Drinking Water Exposures and Internal Doses of Trihalomethanes in Humans   Background: While most human health chemical risk assessments are based on laboratory findings in animals which were exposed only to the chemical of interest  (a single-chemical exposure), humans are not so uniquely exposed.  Human exposures to chemical mixtures are the norm, in both therapeutic treatment (solvent, diluent, formulating agents, and active ingredients), environmental exposures to pesticides (active pesticide agents, synergists,  surfactants), and through the consumption of drinking water, which may contain more than one hundred disinfectant by-products, as well as pesticides and breakdown products, and other contaminants of ground- and surface water sources not fully removed by treatment. Given the differences in exposure  scenarios (acute versus chronic; daily versus seasonal), and in anticipated exposure route (oral, dermal and inhalation), exposures may vary by several orders of magnitude.  In addition, chemical specific differences in metabolism and solubility in blood and tissues modify the internal dosimetry of  these agents such that organs and tissues will be exposed to quantitatively different amounts (concentrations) and qualitatively different chemical moieties (parent chemical versus a metabolite).  These factors are the determinants of chemical-specific pharmacokinetics (PK) among and within animal  species.   NCEA and research partners have demonstrated the feasibility of using complex modeling approaches to characterize the oral, dermal and inhalation exposure to trihalomethanes drinking water disinfection byproducts based on the concentration of the contaminants in tap water, the  physicochemical properties of the chemicals, and information on household airflow and human water use and activity patterns.  These exposures have been successfully translated into measures of internal and target tissue doses through physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling.  Recently  the EPA report on this work was subjected to internal and external review in accord with Agency peer review standards.  The work received laudatory comments from each review, but some of the comments will require an appreciable amount of additional work in order to refine the report to its most  valuable stage.  Further, dissemination of the report's findings in the open, peer-reviewed literature through the publication of a series of journal articles was highly recommended by the external peer panel review.   For the present work, NCEA-Cincinnati project 6485a is concerned with refining  the report to address external reviewer comments and developing a series of journal articles on the work.   Objective: The purpose of this acquisition is to obtain contractor support in addressing highly technical review comments (Attachment 1) on the structure and operation of the Total Exposure  Model and physiologically based pharmacokinetic models employed in the report (NCEA-C-1691) (Attachment 2); to translate concentrations of trihalomethanes disinfection byproducts into human internal doses and target tissue concentrations.  Further, this acquisition will obtain contractor support  for the development of three draft manuscripts for submission to peer reviewed journals.  A brief summary of the three manuscripts, specifically indicating contractor contributions, can be found in Attachment 3. Description of Tasks Government Provided Data: The Government will provide external  panel review comments on the NCEA report, a copy of the draft report, outlines of three draft manuscripts for contractor contributions, and a copy of the NCEA Instruction Manual for Contractors, August 2005. Task 1:  Address the review comments on NCEA Report.  In a telephone conversation  initiated by the Project Officer (PO) the Contractor shall discuss with the PO each of the comments.  The contractor shall develop a specific response to each of the comments; that response shall identify the pages, sections, and/or paragraphs of the draft report revised to address the reviewer  comments.   Task 2:  Revise the NCEA Report to reflect changes.  The contractor shall revise the report to reflect the changes made, and shall clearly indicate the modified text.  Task 3:  Develop contributions to three draft manuscripts.  The Contractor shall develop specific text that  addresses the points in the summaries of the three draft  manuscripts.  Such text shall be free from grammatical errors and be constructed in an information-dissemination style consistent with such found in top-quality professional journals devoted to toxicology and human health risk assessment.   Pending a choice for journal submission, formatting of the draft contributions should not be a priority.   Task 4:  Address journal review comments.  Once submitted to the journal and the editor's reviews returned, the Contractor shall participate in addressing journal review comments that pertain  to the manuscript contributions developed by the Contractor.  The Contractor shall revise the returned draft manuscripts to address journal reviewer comments and develop a "response to comments" document for return with resubmission of the revised journal article.   Task 5:  Address Quality  Assurance in a Narrative Statement.  The Contractor must warrant this report contains, and the conclusions are based upon, the most scientifically-defensible data and methods available.  All data that serve as the basis for computations must be obtained from the peer-reviewed literature, and  referenced as such.  When data necessary for computations are required, but not available in the peer-reviewed literature, they are to be estimated using peer-reviewed procedures developed for that purpose.  Those methods must be properly cited.  The pharmacokinetic models must have either been  developed specifically to address the chemicals of concern and the tissue doses of interest in this acquisition, or have been adapted using properly referenced and peer-reviewed procedures in their adjustment.  Concentrations of contaminants in drinking water, which were provided by the US EPA from  published sources, will be properly referenced.  Other quality issues to be addressed within this narrative and throughout the document are detailed in the following two sections on quality assurance and quality requirements. Quality Assurance: This project requires some data to be generated.  The  Contractor shall demonstrate the application of peer-reviewed techniques and methods, and the application of peer-reviewed values for blood: air partition coefficients in the derivation of tissue:air PC values for THM compounds.  All critical steps in the developed approach and information  contained in the identification and justification for the chemical mixtures shall be clearly identified as to source, with the Contractor placing an emphasis on information available in the peer-reviewed literature.  Any information not found in publicly available EPA sources or in the  peer-reviewed literature shall be additionally and uniquely identified (as simple as an asterisk and footnote) as having its origin outside of the peer-reviewed literature.  All information shall be accurately  referenced.  Any adjustments made to existing pharmacokinetic models shall be fully  described and justified, whether based on scientific best judgment from experience or based directly on information obtained from the peer-reviewed literature.   Quality Requirements: This acquisition will use additional information to refine estimates of the internal doses of trihalomethane DBP  chemicals.  It will incorporate new empirically-derived  values for partition coefficients and will refine exposure to reflect temporal patterns, rather than average daily estimates of exposure.  Published and peer-reviewed works  on these subjects, developed for this purpose will serve as  reference material (see reference section), and the Contractor shall employ only methodology which has  previously been peer-evaluated and published in the open, peer-reviewed literature.  The final report from this acquisition shall clearly communicate the methods      employed, and sources of  information and/or data employed as reference material or values for underlying key equations and data serving as the foundation for the work.   Specific attention should be given, so that the report adequately demonstrates the advantage in estimating temporally-varying measures of exposure, rather  than time- weighted exposures.  An example of this justification may be related to the toxicity of peak- versus time-averaged measures of exposures.  Additional attention should be  devoted to demonstrating the impact of uncertainty in key biological or biochemical parameters of the PBPK model  (e.g., blood:air PC values for chemicals whose hepatic  metabolism is flow-limited) on risk-related model predictions.  In this work, consideration should be given to communicating the importance of assessing metabolic interactions, and presenting the underlying concepts and considerations which  guide the determination of the likelihood of metabolic interactions among these mixture components at the anticipated exposure (see Dobrev et al., 2002). To summarize, the final report shall contain a justification (and references) for the  water concentrations of trihalomethanes employed, shall  clearly identify the  physicochemical data and methods used to predict volatility, a description of the pecifics of the inter characteristics of the simulated domicile, the water use patterns for individuals residing in the home, and the activity patterns of the individuals whose internal doses are  simulated, and information clearly describing the patterns of  exposure to the trihalomethanes during the daily cycle.  The PBPK model portion of the report shall present references for PBPK models used with or without adaptation,  the values and references for values used for biological and  biochemical parameters.  A section of the report shall identify and justify (with references) the dose metric (i.e.,  AUC, area under the concentration-time curve, of parent chemical in kidney) for each of the THM chemicals which will serve as the risk relevant PK outcome employed in  determining  sensitivity to model parameters.  Finally, the report shall contain the results of a sensitivity analysis demonstrating the degree to which the risk-relevant pharmacokinetic outcome for each of the THMs is dependent on these parameters.  The report shall be developed and formatted so that minimal  changes are required for publication in the peer-reviewed literature. Milestones and Deliverables: Task    Deliverable	                                             Due Date 1          Response to Review Comments              on NCEA Draft Report and Revised              Report Text                                75 days after award 2          Contractor contributions to the first              manuscript	                              75 days after award 3          Contractor contributions to the              second manuscript	            150 days after award 4          Contractor  contributions to the              third manuscript	            150 days after award 5          QA Narrative Statement           150 days after award Acceptance Criteria: The contractor shall provide one hard copy of each for the deliverables.  The Response to Comments document for the report  shall be formatted in the manner supplied to the Contractor, accomplished by filling in the "response" section found in Attachment 1.  The contributions to each of the manuscripts shall be formatted in the manner usual for publication in the peer reviewed literature in accordance with the NCEA  Instruction Manual for Contractors (excepting the requirement to use Microsoft Word software for word processing), August 2005 (Attachment 4).   Conflict of Interest The Contractor warrants that, to the best of the Contractor's knowledge and belief, that there are no relevant facts or  circumstances which could give rise to a conflict of interest, as defined in FAR subpart 9.5, or that the Contractor has disclosed all such relevant information. The Contractor agrees to notify the Contracting Officer immediately, that to the best of its knowledge and belief, no actual or  potential conflict of interest exists or to identify to the Contracting Officer any actual or potential conflict of interest the Contractor may have. The Contractor agrees that if an actual or potential conflict of interest is identified during the performance, the Contractor will immediately  make a full disclosure in writing to the Contracting Officer.  This disclosure shall include a description of actions which the Contractor has taken or proposes to take, after consulting with the Contracting Officer, to avoid, mitigate, or neutralize the actual or potential conflict of interest.   The Contractor shall continue performance until notified by the Contracting Officer of any contrary action to be taken. Contract Publication Review Procedures (EPAAR 1552.237-70) (ARP 1984) The Contractor may not publish, present briefings or release any material resulting directly or indirectly  from work performed under this order in any conference, presentation, forum, publication or other discussions without the prior approval of the EPA Project Officer. However, any firm believing itself capable of meeting the EPA's requirement may submit technical documentation to establish the  potential of complying with the specifications.  Such documentation must be submitted to the point of contact within 15 days of the posting of this notice.  A determination not to compete the proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.   Information received will normally be considered only for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement or to proceed on a sole source basis.

The Board both because of its members, some with disabilities, and because it must set a perfect example can only use hotel space, including individual rooms and meeting rooms that meet or exceed the Board’s accessibility guidelines.  Given the sensitivity of this issue, the Board will only use a hotel for meeting and rooms after the Boards staff has checked the hotel for accessibility compliance.  After checking several hotels in the DC area, Access Board staff concluded the Marriott at Metro Center is the only hotel that meets the unique needs of the Access Board for their meeting and individual room service requirements.

Specifically, the hotel has meeting rooms of the size and with accessibility options needed by the board and sleeping rooms available on the dates needed by the Board (January 8-12).  The hotel has the required number of accessible rooms and most importantly, accessible rooms with roll-in showers.  All sections of the hotel have been found to meet or exceed the Access Boards standards.  The hotel is centrally located for the participants with great access for individuals with disabilities.  Fifteen occupants are planned from January 8-12, 2006 for the meeting space and each a room.  Needs vary but include roll-in showers, hearing impaired, and guide dog services.

<DESC>In accordance with simplified acquisition procedures the National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG), Genetic Epidemiology Branch (GEB), plans to procure on a sole source basis with Fabrizio Previdi, Via Cremagnani #16, Vimercate, Italy for continued development of the Environmental and Genetic Lung Cancer Etiology (EAGLE) study for a one year base period with one, one year option period.  Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer mortality in the US. Improved insight into the molecular pathogenesis of lung cancer may mitigate one of the greatest public health problems of our time. The cause of the large majority of lung cancers is tobacco; however, the precise molecular mechanism of smoking carcinogenesis is poorly understood. The GEB has a large population-based case-control study of lung cancer, the Environmental And Genetic Lung cancer Etiology (EAGLE) study, which explores the genetic determinants of lung cancer and smoking. Cases enrollment is conducted in Italy, within thirteen hospitals of the Lombardy Region. Controls are enrolled from the general population of the same catchment’s area of the cases. The study includes over 4,000 individuals and collects questionnaire data, clinical forms, measures of exposures, and blood and tissue specimens from each subject. Genetics analyses, including polymorphisms in candidate genes, expression arrays, proteomics and whole genome analyses. The follow-up of the lung cancer cases to collect data on therapy efficacy, toxicity, recurrence of the disease, and survival after the first diagnosis is planned. Thus, there are several thousands variables per subject to analyze.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>RIA has a need to purchase various paints, paint kits, primer and coatings to paint all vehicles, weapon systems, and related hardware.  MIL-C-53039 Chemical Agent Resistant Coating (CARC), is currently being used at RIA.  Due to environmental restra ints, RIA has eliminated the use of trichloroethane as a paint thinner as well as a degreaser.  At this time, RIA is not thinning with any of the approved thinners per MIL-T-81772 (methylethyl ketone, Toluene, or Xylene) due to the difficulties of testing for Volatile Organic Compound (VOC) levels in the paint department.  This solicitation will be issued electronically in accordance with FAR 4.502 and 5.102, therefore, hardcopies will not be provided.  Vendors wishing an electronic copy may down load it on  or after the issue date by accessing the following address via the internet: https://acquisition.army.mil.  Approximate issue date is 18 Dec 2005 and the closing date is 30 Dec 2005.  CAUTION:  This solicitation will be issued electronically as will any a mendments thereto.  Because of this, the Government is under no obligation and is in fact unable to maintain a bidders mailing list.  It is therefore the responsibility of any interested parties to periodically access the above Internet address in order to  obtain any amendments, which may be issued.  Failure to obtain any said amendments and to respond to them may render your bid nonresponsive.  Award can be made only to the contractor that is registered on the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) System.  The internet address to register is https://www.bpn.gov/CCR.  Solicitation is being conducted under FAR Parts 12 and 13.5, Full and Open Competition.

<DESC>This FEDBIZOPS notice is hereby modified to provide additional information that was inadvertently not included in the original notice.  Training Aids that were acquired for performance of training at the Ft. Gordon Signal Center (SIGCEN) under the DA AB07-86-D-K023 contract modifications included one (1) Joint Network Node Simulation Tool, one (1) Ku-Band Satellite System Simulation Tool, one (1) Unit Hub Node Baseboard Simulation Tool, one (1) TDMA/FDMA Master Reference Terminal (MRT) Simulation Tool,  and JNTC-S/JNN equipment to include Joint Network Node Open Racks, Ku-Band Satellite Trailer terminals, Unit Hub Node Base Band Open Rack, and Battalion Command Post Nodes.  All of the Simulation tools and equipment that were acquired under Increments 1, 2 and 3 via modifications to the MSE Requirements contract, were provided by either General Dynamics C4 Systems and/or GDC4S subcontractors.  In order to perform the training capabilities, the contractor must have access to the Mobile Subscriber Equipment  (MSE), the JNTC-S/JNN equipment and the Simulation Tools discussed above.  The JNTC-S/JNN equipment is owned by GDC4S and will not be available for use by third parties; however, the contractor will provide this equipment for Government use only in the co nduct of training.  The Programs of Instruction (POIs) and curricula that were formulated under the modifications to the contract were formulated to add JNTC-S/JNN modules to existing MSE courses and the formulation of new JNTC-S/JNN courses, thus the trai ning will be integrated into or be a follow-on to MSE courses taught at the SIGCEN.  Sole source award to GDC4S, is intended pursuant to FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source.  Based upon the limited rights in data and the non-availability of the MSE an d the JNTC-S/JNN Equipment to include the JNN Open Racks, the Unit Hub Node Base Band Open Rack and the Battalion Command Post Nodes, the Ku-Band Satellite Trailers, GDC4S is the only source available capable of providing the urgently needed training capab ilities for the SIGCEN.  In addition, the Government has limited rights and use in the Virtual Environment Engine (VEE) for the Simulation tool that will be used throughout the FY 06 training.  GDC4S is the only source that possesses the knowledge of the M SE and JNTC-S/JNN design and has access to the required MSE/JNTC-S/JNN equipment/technical data and Simulation tools/equipment. Training capabilities are needed immediately but no later than February 2006 to effectively utilize JNTC-S/JNN equipment that wi ll be used in support of Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom.  The FY 06 JNTC-S/JNN training place of performance for this effort will be the General Dynamics C4 Systems Resident School located at the US Army Signal Center and Ft. Gordon , in lieu of C-E LCMC Acquisition located at Ft. Monmouth, NJ.  The submission of this information is for planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to procure any items/services, or for the Government to pay for th e information received.  See numbered note 22.

<DESC>The Market survery posted on 12/06/2005 is replaced with the following: MARKET SURVEY- EXCALIBUR BLOCK Ib SD&D TACOM-ARDEC, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ is seeking qualified sources for a 24-36  month SD&D effort beginning in FY07 for the Block Ib objective unitary warhead  variant of the XM982 â€œExcaliburâ€, a 155mm artillery projectile.  Initial award  is anticipated in Early CY 2007. The Excalibur Program is for a Precision-Guided, 155mm projectile to deliver  precise, lethal, cost effective fires at ranges of up to 35 km and greater.   The 155mm Excalibur projectile will enable the maneuver commander to precisely  defeat critical targets while minimizing collateral damage and unexploded  ordnance.  Excalibur performance will be largely dependant upon accurate target  locating systems and sensors.  This program supports the requirements of the US  Army.  It uses an incremental development approach with time-phased  improvements in performance capabilities.   The first unitary warhead, Block Ia- 1, began production in FY05 and is currently in production.  The second unitary  warhead, Block Ia-2, is in SD&D phase, and is expected to begin production in  1QFY07.   The Block Ib objective unitary warhead variant will be a lower cost alternative  to the Block Ia projectile with equivalent or improved accuracy, range and  lethality.    It is expected to begin SD&D phase in 2Q FY07.   The draft performance specification PRF 12999870 is posted on ProcNet  (http://procnet.pica.army.mil/dbi/DynCBD/SourcesSought.cfm) for your review and  comment in response to this market survey. All responses to this market survey are required to be English.  To be  considered, all interested sources must provide requested information and data  in response to the following: a.	Provide a detailed description of your system to include physical  characteristic length, weight, etc.  (Weight must be less than or equal to 106  pounds.) b.

Must receive GPS  position, velocity and timing information from GPS satellites.   d.	Provide evidence of meeting the following Key Performance Parameters  when launched from US or Swedish howitzer systems:   1.	Accuracy:  Less than or equal to 10m CEP â€“ threshold and objective 2.	Reliability:  Greater than or equal to 90% - threshold, greater than or  equal to 96% objective 3.	Range:  35km threshold, 40 km objective from 155mm/39 cal cannons. e.	For FY09 or FY10 deliveries, do you anticipate requiring any waivers or  deviations from the performance specification?  If so, provide a list.   f.	Does a complete technical data package exist for your round? g.	Provide rough order magnitude estimated price per projectile in U.S.  dollars for annual production quantities based on assumptions for both $50M and  $100M of annual production funding amount for a 10 year period.   h.	Current /on-going development and test results for this round:   1.	What is the current state of development or  production? 2.	What is the maximum rate of production using current or future  facilities? 3.	Provide evidence of capability of current production line for this or a  similar munition.  If current production line is not capable of  production/delivery of estimated quantities for FY09 or FY10 and beyond,  provide list of facilitization required with estimated price.   4.	Provide evidence of ability to meet the specifications and quantity. 5.	Provide evidence of in-process development and testing to ensure item  quality in a gun-hardened environment. 6.

<DESC>The Government is seeking qualified small business concerns (all categories) in the effort to determine if a pending requirement can be set-aside for small business concerns. The purpose of the study is to produce a Geographic Information System (GIS) to be used for a hydrologic model representative of the numerous subbasins and routing reaches for the entire drainage area above the Central Arizona Project (CAP) Dikes known as Dike 1 and Dike 2 in northern metropolitan Phoenix, Arizona and Scottsdale, Arizona.     Contractors would essentially be evaluated on the basis of the following criteria:  a.  Will have successfully completed multiple subbasin analysis for large areas and drainage networks in urbanized areas of northern Phoenix and Scottsdale metropolitan areas in Arizona.  The studies will need to have used the Corps of Engineers HEC-1 Rainfall-Runoff to with kinematic wave unit hydrograph and kinematic wave channel routing parameters. These studies will have included the analysis of existing detention basins and analysis of split flows for various locations in the alluvial fan where flows may be directed in different directions.  The contractor will need to have completed drainage studies that have been submitted to and accepted by the cities of Phoenix or Scottsdale or FCDMC (Flood Control District of Maricopa County). b.  Possession of and ability to use currently available GIS tools to define subbasins and hydrologic parameters using digital land use maps, digital soils maps, and digital elevation models for subbasins in a manner that complies with current FCDMC (Flood Control District of Maricopa County) Drainage Manual criteria. c.  Demonstrated ability to use and modify the FCDMC DDMS (Drainage Design Management System) to store, display, help build appropriate hydrologic input variables to the Corps of Engineers HEC-1 model and display final results such that Reclamation requirements for this study are met.  All contractors are required to be registered in the government's CCR and ORCA to be considered for award purposes.  The respective web sites for each are as follows: CCR:  http://www.ccr.gov/ ORCA:  http://orca.bpn.gov Firms that qualify for a study of this scope are encouraged to provide the firm's name, address, business contact, business type (small business, small disadvantaged business, etc.).   Large Business firms may also forward information that would be considered if sufficient small businesses are not available.

The online application processing occurs on the NT server and is connected to the database on the mainframe through IBM WebShpere MQ (MQ) which utilizes CICS for processing.  The NT server requires installation of middleware and the MQ client or server software. An Application Programming Interface (API) is used to facilitate system-to-system communication and to share and update beneficiary demographic and entitlement data with other CMS systems. The online presentation and API development was done utilizing COBOL 390 and contains approximately 90 programs.  The batch application uses the CMS Data Center mainframe infrastructure for the runtime environment.  Automated job scheduling is done through the Automated Production Control and Scheduling System (APCSS).  The batch development was done utilizing COBOL 390. All batch programs, copybooks, Job Control Language (JCL) and procedures are stored within an Endevor library.

The MBD interfaces with the following business applications: EDB, Medicare Advantage and Prescription Drugs (MARx) System, Premium Withholding System (PWS), Recovery Management and Accounting System (ReMAS), Medicare Appeals System (MAS), Retiree Drug Subsidy (RDSS), Drug Data Processing System (DDPS), Enrollment and Entitlement Verification System (EEVS), Coordination of Benefits (COB), True Out of Pocket Costs (TrOOP) / Switches, Risk Adjustment Processing System (RAPS), 1-800 IVR, State Phasedown, Low Income Subsidy (LIS), Deemed, Next Generation Desktop (NGD), the Common Working File (CWF), and various reports and extracts.

The EDB is currently the System of Record for enrollment and entitlement data for Medicare beneficiaries.  The EDB data is stored in a relational DB2 data structure which resides on an IBM mainframe. The internal on-line EDB environment uses M204 user language code.  The Social Security Administration connects to the EDB via a CICS region. The batch programs are compiled using IBM Enterprise COBOL for Z/OS.  The EDB consists of approximately 150 programs, 400 batch jobs, 150 JCL Procs and more than 173,559 lines of code.  The Application Interface Facility (AIF) is a software product that controls all application access to the EDB.  There are approximately 3.5 Million AIF Lines of Code and 12,000 AIF Artifacts (Programs, Batch Jobs, Parms, Copylibs, etc.). The EDB Workbench is used by developers to define their EDB data and access needs.  The EDB Workbench generated modules are incorporated into the AIF.  There are approximately 100,000 Workbench Lines of Code and 800 Workbench Artifacts (Clists, Panels, Dialog Messages, etc.).

The EDB contains the following sub-systems: Enrollment & Entitlement System, Third Party System and Direct Billing System, HI Card System, End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) System, General Enrollment System, the Mass Mailing of Medicare Handbooks Operation, Distributed Index for Rejected Transactions (DIRT), and the Common Working File (CWF). The EDB receives and processes both batch and on-line transactions from the Social Security Administration (SSA), batch files from the Railroad Retirement Board (RRB), and batch files to and from the MBD. The EDB supports end users in a separate warehouse environment and produces various custom extracts and reports.

The purpose of the Enrollment Database (EDB) / Medicare Beneficiary Database (MBD) Migration Initiative is to facilitate the migration of the EDB sub-systems, data feeds, extracts, reports, Workbench and AIF functionalities to the MBD.  The computer software services required by the contract include developmental enhancements to the MBD to incorporate EDB functionality and special projects as approved by CMS. 

The minimum contractor requirements for this work are: (1) a CMMI-SW Level 2 or appropriate equivalent such as CMM-SW Level 2 or the ISO 9001:2000 family of standards; (2) in-depth experience with modifying a complex computer system with several million lines of code; (3) experience with writing requirements, designing, coding, testing, and implementing changes to a complex system; and (4) extensive knowledge of the Medicare program and the complexities associated with its frequently changing nature.

Furthermore, contractor requirements for this work include the ability to provide the following scope of services:
 (1) update the MBD software to include, but not limited to, CMS mandated changes or corrections for program code as well as user-related changes and enhancements, data dictionary updates, JCL development, and database updates; (2) provide Model 204 (M204) user language and database experienced programmers; (3) provide resources with extensive knowledge and experience using MQ; (4) provide resources with extensive knowledge and experience utilizing the CMS requirements management tool, Dynamic Object Oriented Requirements System (DOORS); (5) provide Endevor expertise which is the CMS standard configuration management tool; (6) provide experience interfacing large computer systems utilizing an MQ API; and (7) provide experience transitioning legacy systems to a new environment.

REQUIREMENTS DESCRIPTION
Interim Capability aircraft

PURPOSE/DESCRIPTION

        The purpose of this sources sought research is to analyze industry capabilities to convert seven existing C-130H2 aircraft into an Interim Configuration (IC) of an MC-130H Combat Talon II as defined in the attached file below.  The IC capability will be similar to that of the MC-130P.  In general terms, the program’s intent is the installation of one integrated Time Compliance Technical Order (TCTO) which incorporates approximately twenty-five (25) smaller TCTOs.    The Government estimates this IC conversion to be an approximately 40,000 hour installation labor effort which doesn’t include Group A manufacturing labor.  The intent is to be a build to print acquisition and a data/work package will be provided for installation.  A subcontractor for engineering support services may be directed.  Equipment/systems/support equipment needed may be provided GFE.  The government will be pursuing a firm, fixed price contract for this effort.  Further clarification of the individual TCTOs and other modifications that comprise the data package will be put out on PIXIS very shortly.  Please check for updates and amendments.

<DESC>Request for Information (RFI) for GROUND OPERATING EQUIPMENT (GOE) INCREMENT 1<br> <br> 1.  The Cryptologic Systems Group (CPSG), Special Projects Directorate at Lackland AFB, TX is soliciting your comments in response to several questions below.  This RFI is not a formal solicitation and is not a request for proposals.  Any formal solicitation will be announced separately.  This RFI is for information and planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government. <br> <br> 2.   CPSG is embarking on a major cryptographic modernization (CM) program for space telemetry, tracking and control (TT&C).  A major goal of the program is to avoid ground equipment offered uniquely for space applications. Utilizing standard terrestrial COMSEC products reduces non-recurring engineering (NRE) from unique development, reduces per unit production costs, reduces life cycle costs, and leverages standard logistics/sustainment practices.  The first step is to show that legacy space algorithms can be loaded and operated on existing CM compliant ECUs. Beginning in FY06, we anticipate initiating a spiral development approach for space algorithm capabilities on terrestrial COMSEC products. <br> <br> 3.   This effort is a proof-of-concept to demonstrate that terrestrial field re-programmable COMSEC products with CM features can replace legacy space COMSEC equipment.  Specifically, we want to demonstrate that the KG-46 and KG-57 algorithms can be loaded into and operate on existing CM compliant End Cryptographic Units.  We don't intend to preclude solutions which may require an external interface ancillary outside the INFOSEC boundary. <br> <br> 4.   Please provide answers to the following questions.  Your responses will be used in market research for this acquisition.  Please send responses via email no later than 14 December 2005 to: jeffrey.hardin@lackland.af.mil<br> <br> a.  Are you interested in competing for this requirement?  If so, will you be proposing as a Prime Contractor or Subcontractor? <br> <br> b.  Are you a Small Business?  If so, what is your small business status, e.g., 8(a), Small Disadvantaged Business, etc? <br> <br> c.  Do you have similar experience in development and/or production of these type devices?

<DESC>This is a sources sought notice for the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) Office of Safety, Health and Environment (OSHE).  TSA’s OSHE seeks a bio-based, non-alcohol cleaner to be used in tests to potentially replace those cleaning solutions used by screeners at checkpoints in airports throughout the country.  This sources sought notice represents the only synopsis or solicitation that will be issued for vendors that wish to have their products included for testing and a possible pilot program.  This solicitation is a small business set-aside.  Though TSA desires to select a product as a permanent cleaning solution, TSA reserves the right not to select any products that do not successfully pass each stage of testing and makes no commitment or guarantee to purchase any product or award a contract to any vendor.  For initial testing (as described below) interested vendors shall provide 1 pint of product at their own expense (including shipping) to the TSA Lab.  For those products that pass initial testing and move on to phase 2 TSA will purchase the needed quantities via purchase card.  Testing will be conducted as follows:


Background
The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) routinely inspects carry-on items and checked items for the presence of substances that are forbidden aboard passenger aircraft.  Many of the forbidden substances are related to explosive chemicals and produce residues of nitrate, nitrite, and other active groups associated with explosives.  Explosive trace detection devices are used to test the luggage for explosive residue content.  When the carry-on items and checked items are inspected they are placed on a flat surface that is usually a stainless steel table top.  The presence of forbidden substances leave residues on the table top which must be cleaned in order to not contaminate subsequent items placed on the table top for inspection.  The current product that is used to clean the residue from the table tops (normally 70% isopropyl alcohol/30% water) is volatile, flammable, and produces an odor that some screeners find noxious.


Statement of Objectives
TSA is seeking to evaluate surface cleaners that will successfully remove trace residues of explosive materials.  The surface cleaner must be manufactured from a renewable agricultural source and be a spray-on/wipe-off product that does not require rinsing with water. The evaluation will be done in 2 phases:

Phase 1 will be a test of the product(s) at the TSA Laboratory.  Interested participants shall submit, at their own cost, 1 pint of their offered product along with Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) to the TSA Laboratory in Atlantic City, NJ.  The address is:

Sheldon Brunk, Ph.D.
TSA, Transportation Security Lab
Wm. J. Hughes Technical Center, Bldg. 315
Atlantic City Airport, NJ 08405




The MSDS, at a minimum, must contain the following elements: Flash Point, Viscosity and Evaporation Rate as compared to water.  Products will be tested at least twice and on two different days.  All products will be tested in an identical manner.  Products that pass the TSA Lab test may be further considered for pilot testing at select airports. In order to qualify for this pilot program, products must not only pass the lab test, but must have a flash point higher than 140 degrees Fahrenheit and must have an evaporation rate no less than equal to that of water.  While these are the minimums required, those products that pass requirements and have a Flash Point greater than 200 F and have an Evaporation Rate greater than water, as clearly indicated on the MSDS, will receive priority consideration for participating in the pilot testing.  The Government reserves the right to not consider products that do not meet the above requirements or the requirements stated within this Statement of Objectives.  In addition, the product must meet the following criteria:

Properties of surface cleaner

a.	Biobased product derived from agricultural or renewable product sources
b.	Minimal human toxicity (The product shall not be required to be labeled because it is toxic or highly toxic, as defined by the Consumer Product Safety Commission, CPSC.)
c.	Will not contain carcinogens or reproductive toxins
d.	Pre-diluted and ready for use
e.	Will not require rinsing to clean metal surfaces
f.	Will not stain metal surfaces such as stainless steel
g.	Preferably will not  contain nitrogen compounds
h.	Will be phosphate free (Phosphates and phosphonates will not be present at more than 0.5 percent by weight.)
i.	The product shall not contain volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in concentrations exceeding 10 percent by weight of the product
j.	Will not contain reactive functional groups such as nitrates, nitrites, esters, ethers, and peroxides that may cause false positive responses from explosive trace detection devices
k.	Will not be formulated with heavy metals (arsenic, lead, cadmium, chromium, mercury, selenium, or nickel) 
l.	Will be biodegradable

Furthermore, the Government reserves the right to down-select product participation for those products that pass requirements and have a Flash Point greater than 170F or greater than 200 F and Evaporation Rate equal to Water dependent on the number of products that pass all requirements.

Phase 2 (to which this Statement of Objectives applies) will be conducted at select airport(s) for which samples of the most highly rated product(s) will be procured via a purchase order or purchase card.  In both phases, TSA reserves the right to test product(s) over a 2 month time period.
Requirements

1)	Delivery – Contractor(s) shall deliver to select Federalized Airports CONUS.  Locations to be determined.


2)	Provide material safety data sheet (MSDS) and documentation including the following information:
a.	Flash point (must be greater than 140 degrees Fahrenheit; preferably greater than 200 degrees Fahrenheit)
b.	Evaporation rate (compared to water = 1).  Must be at minimum equal to water, preferably greater.  


3)	Containers
a.	Surface cleaner to be provided in approximately 1-pint containers for direct use
b.	Plastic spray bottles of approximately 1-pint capacity with interchangeable trigger spray and bottle cap lids
c.	Aerosol cans are not acceptable
d.	Provide separate trigger spray lids to fit bottles (One trigger per five bottles)

4)	Delivery
a.	Cleaner – TSA shall receive product(s) within 15 days after receipt of order
b.	At least a 24-hour notice shall be given by the vendor to the designated TSA airport recipient prior to delivery.
c.	Within 72 hours after delivery, send an electronic notice sent to TSA OSHE office confirming delivery has been completed.  The notice will include the following information:
i.	Name of person that accepted shipment
ii.	date of delivery

5)	Order method – Regardless of the order method (P-card or Purchase requisition) the same requirements apply

6)	Evaluation Criteria – vendors shall be evaluated on the following:
a.   Availability of products that meet the required specifications:  Product will be evaluated on a “pass/fail” basis as to whether they cause false positive readings on the explosive trace detection devices and whether they meet the other required specifications.



All interested vendors must first contact TSA’s Office of Acquisition (OA) before submitting a product for testing.  The point of contact for TSA is Mark Urciuolo, 571-227-4213 or mark.urciuolo@associates.dhs.gov.  Once OA has been notified vendors may send products to TSA Laboratory at the address listed above.  Vendors may submit more than one product if desired, however, all products must meet the stated specifications and a separate MSDS must accompany each sample submitted.  It is the responsibility of the vendor to confirm that the product has been received by the TSA Lab in Atlantic City.  TSA will notify each vendor in writing at the end of phase 1 testing as to whether or not the submitted product(s) passed initial testing to be included in Phase 2.  All vendors must notify the TSA point of contact and all products must be received by the TSA Lab no later than January 8, 2006.

DRAFT TESTING PROCEDURES FOR SURFACE CLEANER 
FEASIBILITY STUDY

1.	Begin with a table top that is known or believed to be clean.
2.	Calibrate and zero an explosives detection device.
3.	Using swipes appropriate to the ETD make 4 wipes randomly across the table top.
4.	Place the swipe in a calibrated and zeroed ETD.  Confirm that the reading is zero (or less than the lower detectable limit of the ETD).
5.	Repeat steps 3 and 4 two more times.  
6.	Spray the table top with the test cleaner solution and wipe dry.
7.	Repeat steps 3 and 4 three times.
8.	Completely clean the table top using alcohol, acetone or other suitable solvent.
9.	Smear an explosive compound on the table top, and repeat step 3.
10.	Using swipes appropriate to the ETD make 4 wipes randomly across the table top.
11.	Place the swipe in a calibrated and zeroed ETD.  Confirm that the ETD registers an explosive compound in the detectable range.
12.	Repeat steps 10 and 11 two more times.
13.	Spray the table top with the test cleaner solution and wipe dry.  If there is any visible explosive compound wipe it away.  Treat the table top exactly as if isopropyl alcohol is being used.
14.	Using swipes appropriate to the ETD make 4 wipes randomly across the table top.
15.	Place the swipe in a calibrated and zeroed ETD.  Confirm that the reading is zero (or less than the lower detectable limit of the ETD), and mark the sample as “passed” or else mark the sample as “failed”.
16.	Repeat steps 14 and 15 two more times.
17.	Repeat the entire experiment on two more different days.

Observe the table top for oily or sticky cleaner residue.  Subjectively evaluate whether the cleaner would be easy and appropriate to use day to day at an airport.

Repeat the entire procedure on at least one other ETD.

If the sample passes all tests, mark the sample for luggage testing.

EFFECTS ON LUGGAGE

The purpose of the bio-based cleaner will be to clean a table top, and direct contact with passenger luggage will be a rare occurrence.  Passenger luggage will simply be placed on the clean table top for further inspection.  It is possible that from time to time a piece of luggage or a portion of a piece of luggage such as the bottom or wheels may be superficially cleaned to remove dirt, dust or residue that may be suspected of causing an alarm on an ETD, and there may be some remote possibility that luggage will be wetted by the cleaner spray in an accidental manner.  The wipe testing of the luggage with the swipes that are inserted into the ETD will confirm if there is alarm causing residue on the luggage or in the luggage.  

The components of the bio-based cleaner will be similar to most commercially available detergents, hand cleaners and fabric cleaners.  The bio-based cleaner will also be diluted and ready for use.  Therefore, it is not anticipated that any cleaner chosen for validation testing would have any effect on common luggage manufacturing materials, including nylon and other synthetic fabrics, cotton, wool or other natural fabrics, plastics and fiber reinforced plastics, and natural or synthetic rubber.

To confirm that a cleaner would be unlikely to cause luggage damage over a long period of time after many repeated contacts with a table surface (or even through direct contact of luggage with the cleaner) simple additional testing is required.  Using typical articles of luggage that are available to TSA, test cleaners that have passed the residue cleaning test in the following manner.

1.	Spray a portion of typical luggage material with the cleaner and vigorously wipe it with a paper towel or cloth.  Wait one hour.  Confirm that the luggage fabric does not become sticky or show signs of dissolving when compared to similar materials that have not been sprayed.

2.	Spray a portion of the bottom, feet or wheels of a typical piece of luggage.  Wait one hour.  Confirm that the luggage does not soften, become sticky or show signs of dissolving when compared to similar materials that have not been sprayed.

Note that dyes and appliqués may not be color fast when contacted directly by the cleaner.  This must be considered an acceptable risk by the passenger.


PILOT TESTING

Bio-based cleaners that pass the tests for the removal of ETD alarm causing residues from the table top and that do not cause obvious signs of luggage damage can be marked as suitable for testing in a pilot program.

Alcohol Substitution Pilot Testing Plan

Purpose

The purpose of this pilot testing program is to confirm in the field the safety and efficiency of certain bio-based biodegradable surface cleaners that have been preliminarily evaluated by the TSA Transportation Security Laboratory.  Several surface cleaners may be tested.

Goals

The primary goal of this program is to find suitable alternative safe and effective substitutes for isopropyl alcohol as a surface cleaning agent at TSA checkpoints and checked baggage areas.  Additional goals are to reduce the quantity of flammable Class 1-B material that must be stored by TSA, to reduce the quantity of volatile emissions to the atmosphere in the work area and to reduce the number of worker complaints regarding odor and in some cases the physical effects.  The tested materials will be odorless or have a pleasing, non-medicinal odor, generally colorless or perhaps mildly tinged with color and have no effects on the skin.

Project Scope

A bio-based cleaner will be substituted for isopropyl alcohol at select checkpoints and at select checked baggage screening areas.  The substitution shall be exact, and the existing standard operating procedures (SOP) shall be followed.  

There may be several or a few bio-based cleaners selected for testing.  In order to prevent confusion only one bio-based cleaner will be tested at any one airport during the testing period.  The testing period will be eight weeks if the cleaner is judged to be performing positively.  A cleaner that is judged to be performing negatively may be withdrawn from testing at a specific airport immediately.

Effects on Operations:  Personnel

Minimum effects on TSO duties
The testing program shall follow the existing SOPs for surface cleaning at the explosives trace detection (ETD) device examination tables, and no additional time or personnel will be required.  The TSO’s will be asked to supply their opinion of the products tested by filling out a survey.

Additional duties of lead screeners and/or screening supervisors
Lead TSO’s and/or TSO supervisors will be asked to assume some minor additional duties during this testing period.  The additional duties will include properly managing and dispensing the test materials to the ETD stations, answering a questionnaire or questionnaires on a periodic basis, observing the operations and noting any changes for good or bad that are a result of the tested materials.

The TSO’s who are certified to perform daily and periodic calibration and cleaning of the ETD devices will be asked to closely watch for any increases in required maintenance or calibration, and difficulties with the ETD operation that could be attributed to the tested materials, and any indications of long term effects on the devices.

Additional duties of Environmental Management Coordinators
Environmental management coordinators will be asked to assume some minor additional duties during this testing period.  The additional duties will include properly storing and dispensing the test materials for use to the ETD stations, maintaining a file of questionnaires, and observing the operations and noting and reporting on any changes for good or bad that are a result of the tested materials.

Effects on Operations:  Airport Screening Areas

It is expected that any larger airport with multiple screening areas which is asked to participate in the testing program will be asked to evaluate the products across multiple screening areas with the intention of obtaining input from as many personnel as possible.  However, in order to protect the integrity of the existing system not all screening locations will be evaluating the potential replacement products at the same time.  In the event that a problem is discovered with the test product as it relates to the ETD devices the screening location not included in the test will remain operational.

If it is determined that a smaller airport with only one screening location should participate in the testing, supervisors will be asked to be extra vigilant with regard to noticing any effects of the test product on the ETD devices.

It is expected that the questionnaire that will be developed to accompany the testing will include the identification of the screening location, as well as the brand identification and machine identification of the ETD device used at that screening location.  This will result in useful information regarding each brand of ETD and each model of each brand of ETD that is in use at an airport.  All successful vendors will receive a copy of the blank questionnaire as well as the TSO survey prior to the beginning of phase 2 testing.  

ETD Portals
Testing will also be conducted on both brands of ETD portals, which have been certified and are used by TSA.  

Selection of Airports for Testing

Airport Selection Criteria
TSA Reserves the right to choose airport selection criteria.  It is currently anticipated that airports selected for testing will meet the following criteria:
1.	Have enough false alarms at the ETD devices at the passenger screening areas to provide historical data.
2.	Have enough inspections at the checked luggage inspection area to provide historical data.
3.	Have some variation in the cause of ETD false alarms; i.e., medical, construction and agricultural as opposed to mostly medical.
4.	Have cooperative and willing personnel.

However, TSA may choose other criteria for selection of airports.  In that event, all vendors whose products have reached phase 2 will be notified of the criteria and all products placements will subject equally to the same criteria.  

Airports will be selected so that all brands of ETD devices are in the test.  TSA will alert those vendors whose products have successfully passed phase 1 testing that the products will be used in phase 2.  All products will be used at an equal number of airports.  TSA will alert all vendors as to the total number of airports involved and the number of airports at which each product will be tested.  

Depending on the number of candidate biobased cleaners that are given a positive result by laboratory testing, some airports may be requested to repeat the testing on additional products.

Testing Tools and Other Requirements

Testing tools will consist of spray bottles of biobased cleaner that are prediluted and ready for use, and log forms, questionnaires and survey forms that are not presently developed.  When developed, identical log forms, questionnaires and survey forms will be used for all products.  No special apparatus or equipment will be required.

Information Retrieved

Each ETD device records alarms.  The numbers and times of alarms will be recorded and compared against historical data in order to compare.

Any “event” will be noted on a daily log form.  For instance, if there is an alarm and the table is cleaned and the table top is sampled and another alarm sounds, this will be an event.  The number of times that cleaning is required to clean the table top will be recorded.

Conclusions to be Reached

The conclusions to be reached are: (1) is the tested product suitable for alcohol replacement, (2) is the quantity of use and cost competitive with alcohol, and (3) are there any other benefits of the tested product such as a reduction in the number of worker complaints.

At the end of testing, including the initial laboratory testing, the vendors of successful biobased biodegradable cleaners will have their products listed for use as a consumable item for the screening lines, and the further use of isopropyl alcohol will be discouraged.





Other Uses for Isopropyl Alcohol

The manufacturer’s specifications for daily maintenance and calibration will not be affected by these tests.  Where isopropyl alcohol is specified by the equipment manufacturer isopropyl alcohol will continue to be used.

<DESC>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Office of Acquisition Management (OAM) is conducting market research, FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY, to identify any Small Businesses (Sbs), Non 8(a) Small Disadvantaged Businesses (SDBs), SBA 8(a) Program Businesses, Hubzone Businesses, Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses (SDVOSBs) and/or Women Owned Small Businesses (WOSBs) that possess the necessary technical capabilities to perform Targeted Brownfields Assessments (TBAs) under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) as amended by the Small Business Liability Relief and Brownfields Revitalization Act of 2002 (Public Law 107-118) for the EPA?s Office of Brownfields Cleanup and Redevelopment. Any subsequent contracts, if any, will be managed out of EPA?s ten Regional offices which are located in Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Kansas City, Denver, San Francisco, and Seattle.  TBAs will consist of performing Phase I and/or Phase II environmental assessments at Brownfields sites throughout the United States.   Phase I environmental assessments shall be performed in accordance with EPA?s final regulations governing All Appropriate Inquiries (40 CFR 312) and ASTM International?s E1527-05 "Standard Practice for Environmental Site Assessments: Phase I Environmental Site Assessment Process," and governing State/Tribal regulations.  Phase II environmental assessments shall be performed in accordance with ASTM International?s E1903-97 (2002) "Standard Practice for Environmental Site Assessments: Phase II Environmental Site Assessment Process," and other governing State/Tribal regulations.  Depending on the extent of the investigations already performed at the site, or the findings of those investigations, the contractor may be tasked to perform either a Phase I or Phase II environmental assessment, or both.   A Phase I environmental assessment is a preliminary site inspection that includes among other things, a review of property uses and past ownerships, a review of relevant government records, a historical records investigation, and an on-site visual site inspection. The Phase I investigation, through a comprehensive records search and visual inspection, seeks to identify any Recognized Environmental Conditions (RECs) or conditions indicative of releases or threatened releases of hazardous substances which may impact the property.  A Phase II environmental assessment is a more in depth site investigation that, in most cases, includes sampling and analysis to determine the type and extent of contamination present at the site.  The Phase II guidelines direct the environmental professional to design the Phase II investigation according to the observations and findings of the Phase I investigation.   Findings of the Phase I and Phase II environmental assessments will be used by EPA to enable property owners to determine future site actions.  Additional information about the Brownfields Program and TBAs can be found at www.epa.gov/brownfields/tba.htm.  A draft Statement of Work is available at www.epa.gov/oamsrpod/hcsc/tba/index.htm. The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541620 with a size standard of $6 million for potential socioeconomic program businesses.  Any interested small business concerns are advised of the language in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Section I Clause 52.219-14 "Limitations on Subcontracting" paragraph (b)(1) which states that under a small business set-aside contract for services "at least 50 percent of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the concern."  Therefore, the Capabilities Statement should realistically demonstrate how the small business concern would be able to comply with this clause which would be included in any potential contract.  Please also note that consultants are considered subcontractors and not employees of the prime contractor. Interested socioeconomic program concerns who believe they have the capability of providing services as defined in the draft SOW are invited to submit, in writing, a Capabilities Statement with sufficient information within the 9 page limitation.  Responses shall demonstrate capabilities/expertise with consideration to the SOW requirements, including experience in performing Phase I and II environmental assessments, a summary of the credentials and experience of the personnel who will serve as the environmental professional(s) and manage the assessments, the specific geographical areas where the firm can provide TBA support, and the firm=s business status (e.g.: small, small disadvantaged, minority owned, 8(a), Hubzone, SDVOSB, WOSB etc).  Responses should be sent to Tanya S. Stevens at one of the following: (1) U.S. POSTAL SERVICE ADDRESS:  U.S. EPA - Ariel Rios Building  ATTN: Tanya S.

<CONTACT>Erin Goldstein, Contracting Officer, Phone 301-496-6423, Fax 301-402-0972, Email EG108r@nih.gov - Erin Goldstein, Contracting Officer, Phone 301-496-6423, Fax 301-402-0972, Email EG108r@nih.gov
<DESC>The NIAID supports a broad range of basic, translational, and clinical research on the underlying mechanisms of immune tolerance, and the evaluation of tolerance induction strategies in animal models and in clinical trials.  Tolerance induction strategies aim to selectively block or prevent deleterious immune responses, while leaving protective immunity intact.  The successful induction of immune tolerance to treat and prevent immune-mediated disorders is a major goal of these efforts.  Advances in tolerance induction will provide valuable new therapeutic strategies that will not require life-long, systemic immunosuppressive therapy with its deleterious side effects.  For example, in transplantation, donor-specific immune tolerance - a selective blockade of immune responses directed against the graft - would enable long-term graft survival without the complications and risks of systemic immunosuppressive therapy (e.g., infection, malignancy, and atherosclerosis).  In asthma and allergic diseases, the goal of tolerance research is to develop methods to prevent immune responses to allergens, such as cockroach and house dust mite, that cause or exacerbate these diseases.  In autoimmune diseases, researchers are developing novel approaches to block the immune responses that cause the body to mistakenly attack its own organs, tissues, or cells. 
The purpose of this solicitation is to recompete the “Collaborative Network for Clinical Research on Immune Tolerance,” first awarded in 1999, and to expand the required work to include nonclinical research and product development, bioinformatics, and data collection, validation, and analysis.  One award is expected to be made in response to this solicitation.  The NIAID recognizes that no single organization or institution may have the expertise and facilities required to perform all requirements set forth in the Statement of Work; consequently, the Contractor may need to utilize the expertise and services of subcontractors to perform the tasks required.  The Contractor shall be responsible for all work performed under this contract, including that performed by subcontractors.

The scope of work to be performed by the Network includes:

•	The design and conduct of Phase I-IV clinical trials of  investigational approaches intended to lead to a functional state of immune tolerance;

•	The design and conduct of mechanistic studies and the development of tolerance assays as integral components of these clinical trials; 

•	Focused product development and nonclinical studies (e.g., toxicology, pharmacology, and pharmacokinetics, etc.) essential for the subsequent evaluation of experimental tolerance induction therapies in humans; and

•	The provision of bioinformatics, data management and analysis resources.  

The Network will require strong leadership to provide for the overall scientific direction, coordination and management of complex research studies involving a large number of geographically distributed facilities, subcontractors, and Network personnel.  The Network will also establish collaborations with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, other NIH sponsored clinical research programs, and private research organizations to identify and evaluate tolerance induction therapies, conduct mechanistic studies, and perform assays to assess the induction, maintenance, and loss of tolerance.

<DESC>The NAVAIR Orlando Training Systems Division is responsible for acquisition, fielding and life cycle support of Navy and Marine Corps Aviation training systems suitable for effective training.  Life cycle support includes ensuring the availability of an initial material support package at time of device fielding and the acquisition of spare and repair parts attributable to device modifications and upgrades.  These Navy and Marine Corps Aviation training systems spare and repair parts are the focus of this pre-solicitation notice.  NAVAIR Orlando TSD intends on negotiating and awarding several spare and repair parts buys on a sole source basis from 1 January 2006 through 31 December 2006.  The total estimated amount of these purchases is expected to approach $10 million.  The Navy and Marine Corps Aviation training system platforms and major subsystems to which this synopsis applies are annotated in Attachment (A).  Furthermore, the sole source original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) of spare and repair parts within these subsystems are enumerated within Attachment (B).  Attachments (A) and (B) may be found at the NAVAIR Orlando Business Opportunities web site at.  http://www.ntsc.navy.mil/EBusiness/BusOps/Acquisitions/Index.cfm?client=NAWCTSD
Once linked to the web site you must change ENTRY TYPES to “All”.  The attachments will be located under the heading “Navy and Marine Corps Aviation Training Systems Spare and Repair Parts”.  While this synopsis serves as a pre-solicitation notice of the sole source acquisitions for spare and repair parts from the OEMs listed in Attachment (B), it is not intended to preclude the Government from acquiring spare and repair parts through the training system design/build contractor as this strategy may serve the Government’s best interest.  See numbered note 22, which is modified as follows.  The proposed contract actions are for supplies for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only the Attachment (B) sources under the authority of FAR 6.302.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however, interested parties not identified within Attachment (B) are encouraged to express their interest and capability to respond to the requirements.  Responses to this Sources Sought notice shall be received NLT 23 December 2005.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether respondents should be added to the Attachment (B) pool of sole source OEMs.  In those situations where the Government determines that identical parts are available from more than one OEM, it will compete these acquisitions among the OEMs.  A determination by the Government not to compete these proposed contract actions based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<SUBJECT>99 -- Development of an Automated System for Improved Glucose Monitoring and Reporting
<DESC>Notice of Opportunity for Collaboration with the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases for
Development of an Automated System for Improved Glucose Monitoring and Reporting

The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) of the National Institutes of Health is seeking a collaborator to develop an automated system from a set of specified variables for improved blood glucose monitoring and reporting.  The ultimate goal is to foster real-time, two-way communication between the patient with diabetes, and the health care team providing advice to that patient such that better glycemia control is achieved.   
BACKGROUND:  The NIDDK investigators have developed communication and education techniques capable of restoring excellent glycemia control to nearly all appropriately motivated patients,  even those with difficult to control and long-standing diabetes.
SUMMARY:  The system is expected to be used in intensive insulin therapy since normoglycemia is now proven to prevent diabetes complications and to decrease mortality.  In addition to monitoring and recording functions, this system must be capable of transmitting the information to a web-based data management system available at all times to both the patient and the patient’s health care provider(s).  Salient characteristics of the system are as follows.

•	A reliable, easy-to-use, sensitive instrument for home blood glucose testing, 

•	An integrated mini-computer that will perform the following functions:

o	Record the time and date that a patient checks his or her blood glucose level, 
o	Record the blood glucose level,
o	Calculate, and suggest to the patient, how much (if any) additional insulin should be given if the blood glucose reading is high, 
o	Ask the patient if the blood glucose measurement was before or after a meal,
o	If the answer is after a meal, prompt the patient to record how many carbohydrates were consumed and the insulin dose (and, if relevant, the insulin type) given for those carbohydrates, and
o	Be able to be down loaded to the patient’s home computer.

•	An integrated mini-PDA to wirelessly transmit the data contained in the meter “real time” to a password-protected web-based data management system accessible by both the patient and the patient’s physician.  

•	Data management software that uses the transmitted data to populate an informational display.  

•	Software capable of triggering an alert to the patient’s blood glucose care provider(s) if the blood glucose level falls into a predetermined (high or low) critical range. 

•	Secure areas at the web-based data management system where patients can post questions or comments for the health care team, the health care team can comment, and the questions and comments can be captured, along with other identified information such as the date and time of the posting and, preferably, the identity of the individual recording the comments.

CAPABILITY STATEMENTS:  The NIDDK will use the information provided in the Collaborator Capability Statements received in response to this announcement to help in selecting a Collaborator. It is the intention of the NIDDK that qualified applicants will have the opportunity to provide information to the Selection Committee through their Capability Statements.  The Capability Statement should not exceed 10 pages and should address the following selection criteria:  1. The Statement should provide specific details of the System proposed by Collaborator.  2.  The Statement should provide details concerning the expertise and experience of Collaborator that is relevant to the development of the System proposed.  3. The Statement should include a detailed plan demonstrating the ability of the Collaborator to provide and implement that which it is proposing. 

TERMS:  The Collaborator will be expected to execute a collaboration agreement.  NO FUNDING FROM THE GOVERNMENT IS AVAILABLE.

DATES:  Only written capability statements received by the NIDDK on or before January 31, 2006 will be considered.  Applicants meeting the criteria set forth in this announcement will be notified on or about March 30, 2006.

SUBMIT CAPABILITY STATEMENTS to Rochelle S. Blaustein, J.D., Director, Technology Transfer and Development, National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, 9000 Rockville Pike Building 12A, Suite 3011, MSC 5632, Bethesda, MD 20892-5632, phone: (301) 451-3636, fax: (301) 402-7461, e-mail:  rochelle.blaustein@nih.gov   For questions concerning the System, contact David Harlan, M.D., National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases,  (301) 594-3047, e-mail: davidmh@mail.nih.gov

<SUBJECT>R --  Renewal of Current State and Local Criminal Record Searches
<DESC>Notice of Intent: Pursuant to FAR 6.302-1, "Only One Responsible source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements", the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM), Federal Investigative Services Division (FISD) intends to renew sole-source agreements to obtain detailed and complete law enforcement and traffic record information through various State and Local law enforcement agencies throughout the Country.  The States and Localities provide detailed law enforcement and traffic record data with substantially greater accuracy than third party vendors that were previously researched; this information is utilized in analyzing investigative information for security and suitability adjudication. The information provided under this service contains information available only to other Government agencies. Therefore, the States and Localities are the intended source for these services. OPM FISD deems it appropriate to award fixed-price agreements on other than a full and open competitive basis to various State and Local authorities. The State and Local law enforcement authorities are the available responsible sources and no other types of services will satisfy the needs of the Agency. The North American Standard Industrial Classification System (NAICS) Code for action is 519120 - Libraries and Archives. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS, AN INVITATION FOR BIDS, OR A REQUEST FOR QUOTATIONS. FURTHERMORE, IT DOES NOT REPRESENT A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT TO PAY FOR COSTS INCURRED IN PREPARATION AND SUBMISSION OF DATA OR ANY OTHER COSTS INCURRED IN RESPONSE TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. This is not a solicitation for offers but rather a notice of OPM's intent to negotiate sole source awards to various State and Local law enforcement agencies. This notice is for information only, and may represent the only official notice.

<DESC>CONTRACT INFORMATION:  The USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) in South Dakota requires the services of an appraiser for the performance of appraisal services in the acquisitions of easements under the Wetlands Reserve Program and the Emergency Watersheds Protection Program.  This announcement constitutes the only notice.

All appraisals completed for this program shall comply with Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice (USPAP), Uniform Appraisal Standards for Federal Land Acquisitions (UASFLA aka Yellow Book) and Supplemental Standards as issued by NRCS.  
Yellow Book and USPAP Conflicts:  Conflicts between Yellow Book and USPAP are minimal.  When there is conflict, Yellow Book takes precedence.  It may be necessary to invoke the Jurisdictional Exception Rule to USPAP to meet certain standards of the Yellow Book.  Invocation of the Jurisdictional Exception Rule should never be invoked lightly and must include citation of the over-riding Federal policy, rule, or regulation that requires it.  Any jurisdictional exceptions not specifically cited in the Yellow Book shall be discussed with the assigned review appraiser.

PROJECT INFORMATION:

The Government contemplates the award of three indefinite delivery-indefinite quantity contracts in three areas of South Dakota.  The three areas are as follows:

Area 1:  Buffalo, Jerauld, Sanborn, Miner, Lake, Moody, Lyman, Brule, Aurora, Davison, Hanson, McCook, Minnehaha, Tripp, Gregory, Charles Mix, Douglas, Hutchinson, Turner, Lincoln, Bon Homme, Yankton, Clay and Union.

Area 2:  Brown, Marshall, Roberts, Day, Spink, Clark, Codington, Grant, Hamlin, Deuel, Beadle, Kingsbury, Brookings, Campbell, McPherson, Walworth, Edmunds, Potter, Faulk, Sully, Hughes, Hyde, and Hand.

Area 3:  Harding, Perkins, Corson, Butte, Meade, Ziebach, Dewey, Haakon, Stanley, Jones, Mellette, Todd, Bennett, Jackson, Shannon, Fall River, Custer, Pennington, and Lawrence.

The initial contract period will be for one year and the government may, at its option, extend the contract to a maximum of five years by exercising each of the four, one year renewal options.  Work under each contract will be subject to satisfactory negotiation of individual task orders.  Task orders will be negotiated as firm fixed price procurements for the following acreage increments:

1-500 acres
500-1000 acres
1000-1500 acres
1500-2000 acres

APPRAISER QUALIFICATIONS
 
Appraisers shall be a State Certified General Real Property Appraiser or obtain a temporary practice permit in the state(s) where the subject property is located and be in good standing with the licensing authority where the credential was issued.  Appraiser must have demonstrated competency in compliance with USPAP in conducting appraisals of agricultural properties with and without conservation easements of the requested type.  Documentation of appraisal education courses attended, such as eminent domain or conservation easements, and Yellow Book course shall be provided to the NRCS authorized official prior to issuing any work order.  

PURPOSE OF THE APPRAISAL REPORTS

The purpose of the appraisals is to provide an opinion of market value, as defined below, of the entire subject property (larger parcel) before acquisition of an easement (before value) and an opinion of market value of the entire subject property remaining after the proposed easement has been placed (after value) as of a current date of value. The appraiser shall recognize that in a before and after appraisal, the partial interest being acquired is not actually being appraised.  What is appraised is the larger parcel before and after the conveyance of the partial interest.  
The purpose of two opinions of value is to establish the effect on value resulting from imposition of a conservation easement.  The price of the easement is the before value of the entire property (larger parcel) minus the value of the entire property as encumbered by the WRP or EWP Warranty Easement Deed, after value, provided there are not adjustments such as excess irrigation water rights explained below, which would equal the price of the easement.  A key concept in this appraisal process is defining the larger parcel is required to begin the appraisal process. The appraisals must be completed in compliance with Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice, Uniform Appraisal Standards for Federal Land Acquisitions and Supplemental Standards issued by NRCS. 

 For the purpose of these appraisals, the Federal Rules for acquisition will be used.

The market value definition that will be stated and used in developing and reporting this assignment is the definition as stated in the Yellow Book;
“Market value is the amount in cash, or in terms reasonably equivalent to cash, for which in all probability the property would have sold on the effective date of the appraisal, after a reasonable exposure time on the open competitive market, from a willing and reasonably knowledgeable seller to a willing and reasonably knowledgeable buyer, with neither acting under any compulsion to buy or sell, giving due consideration to all available economic uses of the property at the time of the appraisal.”  

This definition makes no linkage between the estimated market value and exposure time.  A specific exposure time shall not be cited in an appraisal report prepared under Yellow Book standards.  Invoke the Jurisdictional Exception Rule to avoid a violation of USPAP standards, which require a specific exposure time.

No other definition of market value is acceptable.

(Please see the Statement of Work for detailed information relative to the format, etc. of the appraisal report)
 SELECTION CRITERIA:  (a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:

1.  Professional qualifications necessary for satisfactory performance of the required services; 2) Narrative of the offieror’s technical capability to meet the Government requirement; this may include descriptions of other similar or related projects performed or currently being performed and a list of personnel qualifications; a narrative proposal on how to perform the work required; 3) Price; a list of potential personnel who will be performing the requirements of the contract and the corresponding per acre rate must be included for evaluation;  4) Past Performance; list of references and letters of recommendation with company seal or logo may be submitted for evaluation purposes.

Technical and past performance, when combined, are equal to price

(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).

(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

In order to comply with the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996, all contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) to be considered for an award of a Federal Contract.  For information regarding registration, contact the CCR website at www.ccr.gov.  

SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS:  Proposals submitted in response to this solicitation shall be furnished in the following format with the numbers of copies as specified below.

(1) The proposal must include a technical proposal and business proposal. Each of the parts shall be separate and complete so that evaluation of one may be accomplished independently from evaluation of the other. The technical proposal must not contain reference to cost; however, resource information (such as data concerning labor hours and categories, materials, subcontracts, etc.) must be contained in the technical proposal so that the contractor's understanding of the statement of work may be evaluated.

(2) Offerors may, at their discretion, submit alternate proposals or proposals which deviate from the requirement; provided, that an offeror also submit a proposal for performance of the work as specified in the statement of work. Any "alternate" proposal may be considered if overall performance would be improved or not compromised, and if it is in the best interest of the Government. Alternate proposals, or deviations from any requirement of this RFP, must be clearly identified.

(3) The Government will evaluate proposals in accordance with the evaluation criteria set forth in Section M of this RFP.

(4) Offerors shall submit their proposal(s) in the following format and the quantities specified:

(a) 4 copies of the completed, signed offer (Sections A through K of the solicitation package)

(b) 4 copies of the technical proposal 

(c) 4 copies of the business/cost proposal 

(b) Technical Proposal Instructions. The technical proposal will be used to make an evaluation and arrive at a determination as to whether the proposal will meet the requirements of the Government. Therefore, the technical proposal must present sufficient information to reflect a thorough understanding of the requirements and a detailed, description of the techniques, procedures and program for achieving the objectives of the specifications/statement of work. Proposals which merely paraphrase the requirements of the Government's specifications/statement of work, or use such phrases as "will comply" or "standard techniques will be employed" will be considered unacceptable and will not be considered further. As a minimum, the proposal must clearly provide the following:

1.	Narrative of the offeror’s technical capability to meet the Government requirement; this may include descriptions of other similar or related projects performed or currently being performed and a list of personnel qualifications; a narrative proposal on how to perform the work required.

 (c) Business Proposal Instructions.

In addition to any other requirements for cost/pricing information required in clause FAR 52.215-20, Requirements for Cost or Pricing Data or Other Than Cost of Pricing Data (OCT 1997), the following is required: 

(Contracting Officer shall identify additional information required if appropriate.) 

(2) Business Proposal. 

(a) Furnish financial statements for the last two years, including an interim statement for the current year, unless previously provided to the office issuing the RFP, in which case a statement as to when and where this information was provided may be furnished instead. 

(b) Specify the financial capacity, working capital and other resources available to perform the contract without assistance from any outside source. 

(c) Provide the name, location, and intercompany pricing policy for other divisions, subsidiaries, parent company, or affiliated companies that will perform work or furnish materials under this contract.

Deck area must be free of all obstructions, and must have no permanent structures protruding higher than 20 feet above the water line which cannot be quickly stowed (e.g. antennas).

1.2.3  Vessel Equipment:  The vessel shall have at a minimum all equipment required by law including a fathometer, radar, VHF-FM multiple frequency capable 2 way marine radio with specified frequencies / channels and minimum ranges, a cell phone for secondary communications to the Air Station Miami Operations Center, GPS, and a long distance high beam search light. 

1.2.4  Safety Equipment:  The vessel shall be outfitted with contractor furnished first aid kit and approved Type III Personal Flotation Devices for crew and passengers.  Survival suits shall be provided, by the contractor, as needed for crew members allowing them to operate on the weather deck / under rotor downwash continuously in temperatures ranging from 5 degrees C. to 40 degrees C. (41 degrees F. to 105 degrees F.).  The contractor shall provide helmets, goggles, and grounding rods for use by crew members during helicopter ops.

1.2.5  Required Docking/Mooring Facilities:  Contractor will also be responsible for providing docking / mooring facilities for their vessel.  The vessel shall be located within a distance from the geographical areas of operation not to exceed a total round trip time of one hour.

1.3.2.1  Coxswain:  The Coxswain shall be licensed, at a minimum, for the size of vessel being operated, including the carriage of six passengers, and shall be qualified in CPR.  The crew members shall be capable of operating and maneuvering the vessel during helicopter hoist operations and for aerial dewatering pump pickup as well as any required rescue operations.

1.3.2.2  Deckhands: The Deckhands shall be knowledgeable in shipboard operations, rigging for helicopter operations, and deck seamanship.

1.4  Operational Requirements / Sites:  The schedule required for the operating site is as follows:

1.4.5  Weather Criteria:  The vessel must be capable of completing training requirements in sea states of up to 4 feet and wind speeds of up to 30 knots.

1.4.6  Functions / Tasks:  The contractor shall support training operations for helicopter crew hoist, rescue swimmer, and objects deployed or hoisted from government aircraft.

1.5  Performance Evaluation Meetings:  The Contractor’s project manager shall meet at least biweekly with the Contracting Officer, COTR or QAE during the first two months of the contract to discuss performance problems and review contractor corrective actions.  The operational log will also be used to verify the contractor’s timely arrival on station.  If the contractor fails to meet the scheduled training events or is unable to complete the training activity, the frequency of not fulfilling the scheduled requirements may be the basis for a deduction in the charter hire.   Meetings will be held thereafter at intervals to be established by the COTR or QAE.

1.8  Invoicing for Service:  A set payment will be established for each three hour training block.  The payment will be the same regardless of whether the Coast Guard actually uses the full three hour training block.  Unused training time may be added onto any future training block for a total time of up to a maximum of six hours.  Unused training time may not be used to set up a separate trip.  Any unused training time at the end of the contract will be forfeited.

(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held- 

(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or 

(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 

(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 

”Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 

(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 

(i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or 

(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 

(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases.

(i) warrants; 
(ii) options; 
(iii) contracts to acquire stock; 
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and 
(v) others similar interests. 
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. 

(f) Disclosure. 
By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107- 296 of November 25, 2002.

The incumbent performs staff duties and responsibilities to ensure the effective development and implementation of country programs and activities.  The incumbent assures that field mission and Washington views are taken into account during the design, development, and implementation of strategies, programs and projects. The Team Leader also backstops Mission personnel and budgeting, external relations and information and country-specific donor coordination.   


DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

1.  Provides continuing guidance to USAID/W and field personnel on new and established Agency and Bureau policy and procedures on program development and implementation.  Monitors developments associated with U.S. assistance to Armenia, Georgia and Azerbaijan. Facilitates release of funds to these countries. Represents the Missions and interprets their positions on issues, problems, and programs. 

2.  Reviews and recommends for approval proposed assistance strategies and activities requiring “performance funds,” taking into account the country economic, political and social situations; development plans, programs and priorities of recipient countries; U.S. objectives, USAID strategy, and ongoing assistance programs; and contributions made by other organizations and third countries. 

3.   Prepares narrative and statistical descriptions and analyses on the status of activities in desk countries for Bureau, Agency, State, OMB, and Congressional reviews and presentations; prepares briefing papers and Congressional testimony. 

4. In collaboration with the Bureau's Program Office, assesses progress in achieving Bureau strategic objectives, particularly in the Caucasus region. Recommend modifications of the Mission’s approach, if necessary. 

5.  Assists in Mission implementation of approved strategies by coordinating and expediting technical assistance provided by Bureau and USAID offices.

•	Comprehensive knowledge of USAID's country program strategy and planning systems, with particular reference to FREEDOM Support Act requirements, as well as a thorough working knowledge of the Agency’s project design and implementation systems.

•	Thorough working knowledge of U.S. foreign aid legislation and trends and Executive Branch policies and directions.

•	Knowledge of relevant economic and social issues of assigned countries.

•	Solid knowledge of USAID management systems and administrative procedures.

•	Strong skill in adapting analytical techniques and evaluation criteria to the identification, consideration, and resolution of issues and problems of a procedural and factual nature.

•	Strong skill in conducting interviews with supervisors and employees to obtain information about organizational missions, functions and work procedures.

*Note – PSCs may represent the agency, except that communications that reflect a final policy, planning or budget decision of the agency must be cleared by a US Direct Hire employee.

SUPERVISORY CONTROLS

Under the supervision and policy direction of the Office Director, the incumbent has a degree of independence to act within overall Agency and Bureau policies and objectives and is held accountable for timeliness and quality of finished products.  The incumbent coordinates and monitors Caucasus programs both at the policy/strategy level and on a daily basis. The supervisor furnishes advice and guidance in problem cases, reviews work products for technical adequacy and conformance to policy, and evaluates overall effectiveness in terms of contributions to established goals.  The employee plans, coordinates, and carries out the successive steps in accordance with accepted office policies, applicable precedents, organizational concepts, management theory, and occupational training.  


GUIDELINES

Guidelines include laws and legislative initiatives, Agency rules and regulations, US government foreign and domestic policy directives, country-specific policies, and strategy and program planning issues, which are subject to interpretation.  Incumbent is expected to use independent judgment in determining the application of current foreign assistance legislative provisions and executive policies to assigned responsibilities. The employee must use independent judgment in researching regulations and in determining the relationship between guidelines and organizational efficiency, program effectiveness, or employee productivity.


COMPLEXITY

Work includes technical analysis, particularly economic policy review, country strategy formulation, project proposal analysis and program implementation review. The necessary analytical role requires awareness of U.S. Government political complexities and changing host country circumstances.  Tasks often require departing from past approaches and dealing with unstructured circumstances. Task objectives may depend on an assessment of competing demands.  Experienced judgment is needed to provide appropriate advice for E&E management. The myriad pressures for access to the program and decision-makers create an unusual combination of technical, administrative and policy issues at all times. 





SCOPE AND EFFECT

The expertise provided by the incumbent contributes to Mission analysis and identification of the key economic and social problems in the Caucasus region.  His or her input helps to define what is appropriate for USAID’s attention and guides the development of strategic and project approaches.  Such input keeps the Mission abreast of Washington agencies’ views of the region. The incumbent's findings and recommendations are vetted with the Office Director and senior E&E management.  These findings and recommendations heavily influence the position that the Agency takes regarding program strategy, composition and funding.


PERSONAL CONTACTS

Incumbent maintains close contact with appropriate staff in the field, the E&E Bureau, and central bureaus, in particular Global and Legislative and Public Affairs.  Outside contacts are with staff of the State Department Office of the Coordinator for U.S. Assistance for Europe and Eurasia, and other State Department offices and bureaus.  The incumbent will also have frequent contact with high government officials, host country representatives and NGO's.  Host country embassy contacts are often at the ministerial level and include ambassadors.  Frequent contacts are also made with the IMF and World Bank officers in charge of specific country programs for these institutions.  Public contacts are extensive, and may include association leaders, corporate officers, lobbyists, diaspora group members, university representatives, and non-profit foundation executives.


PURPOSE OF CONTACTS

The purpose of contacts is to cooperate with colleagues and counterparts to assure the completion of necessary actions, to advocate specific positions and to explain and/or justify U.S. Government policy position.  Contacts typically involve such matters as: identification of decision-making alternatives; appraisals of success in meeting goals; and recommendations for resolving problems. Incumbent must be skilled in negotiating and presenting policy/strategy options and in effecting a consensus on solutions.


PHYSCIAL DEMANDS

The work is essentially sedentary and does not pose undue physical demands.




WORK ENVIRONMENT

Work is performed in an office setting.  Occasional requirements for field trips could expose the incumbent to disease, challenging work conditions, and security risks. 

SUPERVISION/OVERSIGHT OF OTHERS

Incumbent provides guidance to two Caucasus Region desk officers.  One is responsible for Georgia and Azerbaijan.  The other desk officer is responsible for Armenia.  As a Team Leader, the incumbent’s leadership, technical and program management skills coupled with hands-on experience are important to ensure that the desk officers can perform their functions in a highly efficient and knowledgeable manner.  The incumbent is responsible for offering timely feedback to the Office Director regarding the desk officers’ performance.

<DESC>NASA/MSFC has a requirement for following brand name only items: 1. VMEbus Analyzer, VG-VMEP0, manufactured by VMETRO – 2 each 2. Exercise Module, -VE option, manufactured by VMETRO – 2 each  3. Protocol Checker, -VP option, manufactured by VMETRO – 2 each  All with the original manufacturer’s standard warranty.   This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation, which is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ); quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Offerors are required to use the On-Line RFQ system to submit their quote.  The On-line RFQ system is linked above or it may be accessed at	http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/eps/bizops.cgi?gr=C&pin=   .  The information required by FAR Subpart 12.6 is included in the on-line RFQ. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12 and the Simplified Acquisition Procedures set forth in FAR Part 13. This acquisition is for brand name only, pursuant to FAR 11.105, for the acquisition of a particular brand name, product, or feature that is essential to the Government's requirements. Maximum competition is impractical for the following reasons:  1. The items are additional units of equipment already in service in the Space Shuttle Main Engine Controller (SSMEC) Hardware Simulation Laboratory (HSL).  Analyzers from different companies have different interface requirements which would require re-design and re-implementation of existing equipment. Alteration of the existing equipment is not technically feasible within the cost and schedule constraints of the project.  An internet search has determined that no other manufacturer’s parts fit the existing interface. 2. Marshall Space Flight Center has a substantial investment, estimated to be at least $50,000, in the software which interfaces with this board, and other company’s products would require re-design of the software, which is not technically feasible within the cost and schedule constraints of the project. Questions regarding this acquisition must be submitted in writing (e-mail is preferred) no later than December 14, 2005.  It is the quoter's responsibility to monitor this site for the release of amendments (if any).  Potential quoters will be responsible for downloading their own copy of this notice, the on-line RFQ and amendments (if any). An ombudsman has been appointed - See NASA Specific Note "B".

<DESC>TITLE:  A Study on the Role of Well-Designed Transportation Projects Enhancing Communities*

ACTION:  As prescribed by SAFETEA-LU, Section 1925 entitled “Community Enhancement Study,” this is a notice of availability of funding for transportation research under a program to encourage relationships among transportation, community, and system preservation plans and practices and identify private sector-based initiatives to improve such relationships.  The FHWA anticipants awarding one cost reimbursement contract of up to 16 months in duration and $2 million to a national organization representing architects who have expertise in the design of a wide range of transportation and infrastructure projects, which include the design of buildings, public facilities, and surrounding communities to conduct the study.*

SUMMARY:  The FHWA will fund transportation research to conduct a study on the role of well-designed transportation projects enhancing communities in:
1.	Promoting economic development;
2.	Protecting public health, safety and the environment; and
3.	Enhancing the architectural design and planning of communities; and the positive economic, cultural, aesthetic, scenic, architectural, and environmental benefits of such projects for communities.*  

The study shall address the following:
1.	The degree to which well-designed transportation projects have positive economic, cultural, aesthetic, scenic, architectural, and environmental benefits for communities.
2.	The degree to which such projects protect and contribute to improvements in public health and safety.
3.	The degree to which such projects use inclusive public participation processes to achieve quicker, more certain, and better results.
4.	The degree to which positive results are achieved by linking transportation, design, and the implementation of community visions for the future.
5.	Facilitating the use of successful models or best practices in transportation investment or development to accomplish each of the following:
a.	Enhancement of community identity.
b.	Protection of public health and safety.
c.	Provision of a variety of choices in housing, shopping, transportation, employment, and recreation.
d.	Preservation and enhancement of existing infrastructure.
e.	Creation of a greater sense of community through public involvement.*

GENERAL REQUIREMENTS

Responses submitted for this Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) must adhere to the format and content instructions set forth below. These instructions have been specifically tailored to the process and the evaluation criteria to be applied during proposal evaluation. Failure to submit any of the information requested by this BAA may be cause for unfavorable consideration. Any inconsistencies between the various sections of an Offeror’s response must be fully explained. A significant inconsistency, if unexplained, may raise a fundamental question of the Offeror’s understanding of the work required, and ability to perform the contract.*

The Offeror’s response should demonstrate their understanding of this procurement and capability for performance in a concise, logical manner and should not contain superfluous material, which is not directly related to this procurement.*

The Government will process late submissions of proposals in accordance with FAR 52.215-1. If a proposal is received late and is not eligible for consideration, then the Government will reject that proposal without evaluation.*

BUDGET/COST PROPOSAL

The total value of the award will not exceed $2,000,000 as follows: $1,600,000 basic requirement + $400,000 option.*

The budget for the basic requirement is $1,600,000.  All Offerors shall propose to complete the required deliverables as specified below within this budget.*  

FHWA acknowledges that requests for special studies could arise during the course of this effort.  Therefore, an optional financial set aside is available to support such analysis.  Each Offeror shall propose an unburdened plug number of $400,000 as a line item in the cost proposal entitled “Special Studies.” The Special Studies option may be exercised at the Government’s discretion and negotiated with the contractor during the course of this effort.*

NOTE: Cost sharing is encouraged.  Proposals may exceed the basic requirement budget ceiling and total budget ceiling if the additional resources are proposed as cost share.  Any cost share shall be included in detail in the Cost proposal.* 

DELIVERABLES

At a minimum, the Offeror shall provide the following deliverables.  The Offeror is not limited to these deliverables, and may elect to propose additional deliverables as part of their proposal.* 

The Contractor shall provide quarterly status reports to the Government providing an increasingly detailed outline of the Community Enhancement Study, including research undertaken and proposed for each 3-month period of the task.  The Government will meet with the Contractor at 4-month intervals to discuss progress on the study and to assess the need for “Special Studies.”  These meetings may occur via telephone, videoconference, or in person.  The Contractor will provide at the end of the contract a final report detailing the findings from the Community Enhancement Study.*

 The Contractor shall provide all report deliverables in camera-ready hard copy and an electronic copy in Microsoft Office 2000 or equivalent on a CD-ROM(s). In addition, electronic files containing the word processing, graphic, and table data may be required as deliverables. The Contractor shall establish electronic file transfer capabilities such that correspondence and deliverables can be communicated electronically to the FHWA Program Office.*

All products submitted under this announcement become the property of FHWA and may be disseminated or used for government purposes subsequent to the completion of the work.  The developer of the material also may have continued incidental use of the products for the purpose of additional research or marketing but may not sell or offer the products without prior approval of FHWA.*

REPORTING

The Contractor shall submit a brief monthly report until the work is completed.  The report should describe in brief (e.g. in outline format) work completed the prior month, work anticipated in the upcoming month, approximate percent of work completed and approximate amount of resources expended.*    

INSTRUCTIONS FOR PREPARATION AND SUBMISSION OF PROPOSALS

Each proposals shall include:

1.	The full name, address, point of contact, a telephone number, fax number and an electronic mail address for the organization.
2.	A detailed description of proposed work describing
a.	Need or problem statement (1 page)
b.	Technical approach (30 pages) 
c.	Past performance relevant to current proposal with points of contact (up to two pages and may include references to readily accessible documents)
3.	The period of performance (time line) for the work and submission of deliverables (up to one page);
4.	Tailored biographies of key staff including relevant expertise (1 page for each key researcher and 1 page (inclusive) for all other staff);
5.	Description of facilities and equipment needed to support the proposal (2 pages); and
6.	A cost proposal indicating staffing levels, hours, hard costs for the total project and amount of funding expected from FHWA (Not To Exceed $2,000,000 in Federal funding).*

DATES:  Please be aware that the security procedures in the Nassif Building prohibit individuals from delivering material directly to offices in the building. Individuals visiting the building must report to the southwest guard station at the Nassif Building. All materials left there will be examined and x-rayed before being delivered to Room 4410 through the normal internal mail delivery procedures. As this can take up to several working days, offerors must make allowances to assure that proposals arrive in Room 4410 by 4:00 p.m. on January 16, 2006. Proposals received after the due date and time will be considered late in accordance with FAR 52.215-1.*

If so requested, the guard will call the Acquisition Office (x66714) to have someone come down and accept the material once it has been examined. Offers must be received and date/time stamped in Room 4410 by the prescribed date and time to be considered timely, not just delivered to the guard station, the Nassif mailroom or loading dock. While we will do our best to accommodate such requests, FHWA is not responsible if someone is not immediately available to pick up your proposal.*

Further, please be advised that all of our mail (items handled by the US Postal Service) is sent out of town for scanning and irradiation prior to delivery to this building. This process can take several days, so even if you mailed us something from across the street, it may be a week before it actually arrives here. FedEx and United Parcel Service do have direct access to the building and offices. Please keep these factors in mind as you determine the best means to deliver your proposal so as to ensure delivery in room 4410 by no later than 4:00 PM (local time).*

Submittals must be printed hard copies consisting of one original and four copies along with one electronic copy on CD-ROM.*

CONTRACT TYPE:  FHWA anticipates awarding one cost reimbursement type contract.*

ADDRESSES:  Proposals must be delivered to Christian Hellie in the FHWA Office of Acquisition Management, 400 7th Street, S.W., Room 4410, Washington, DC 20590 (Mail Stop HAAM-30E).  Please not that current security procedures may result in delays of USPS mail delivery.* 

For further information about the Community Enhancement Study, please contact Kenneth Petty in the FHWA Office of Planning at 202-366-6654 or kenneth.petty@fhwa.dot.gov.*   

EVALUATION GENERAL

The Government will award a contract to an acceptable Offeror who is the best overall value, basing its source selection decisions on three factors – Technical, Cost/Price, and Business Factors  among the competing offerors.
	
1.	The Government may reject any or all proposals if such action is in the Government’s best interest.

2.	The Government may waive informalities and minor irregularities in proposals received.

3.	Exchanges with offerors after receipt of a proposal do not constitute a rejection or counteroffer by the Government.

4.	A cost realism analysis may be performed, and the source selection authority may consider cost realism in evaluating performance or schedule risk.*

EVALUATION CRITERIA*

QUALIFICATION
To be considered for award, as prescribed in SAFETEA-LU, SEC. 1925, the Offeror must be a national organization representing architects who have expertise in the design of a wide range of transportation and infrastructure projects, which include the design of buildings, public facilities, and surrounding communities.  Proposals from Offerors who do not meet this criterion will not be evaluated and not considered for award.*

The Government will evaluate the qualified competing offers on the basis of the following factors:

A)	TECHNICAL IMPORTANCE AND INNOVATION (listed in descending order of importance) 
1)	Alignment with planning program and Agency research goals 
2)	Justification of need or problem identification
3)	Realistic work plan and technical approach/ Demonstrated likelihood of successful completion
4)	Demonstration of necessary facilities and equipment to successfully perform the work
5)	Clear identification of a specific audience or audiences*


B)	COST/PRICE (listed in descending order of importance)
1)	A relative reasonableness and realism to determine the Offeror’s understanding of the work 
2)	Overall value of deliverables in support of FHWA planning research*

C)	BUSINESS FACTORS (listed in descending order of importance)
1)	Demonstrated knowledge and experience on other projects of a similar nature 
2)	Demonstration of completing deliverables and meeting project objectives
3)	Demonstrating a commitment to subcontracting goals (i.e. small Disadvantaged Business Enterprise firms (DBE), small Women-owned Business Enterprise firms (WBE), and Minority Institutions (MI))
4)	Demonstrating of a commitment to customer satisfaction*

BASIS FOR AWARD
The Government will accept the offeror that is considered the best value and most advantageous to the Government. Of the three evaluation factors, Technical importance and innovation, Cost/Price and Business Factors, Technical is more important than Cost. Business factors are of less importance than Technical or Cost. As the ratings of competing Offerors approach being essentially equivalent in any of the three areas, the remaining areas will become more important in the selection decision.

<DESC>Question: To confirm, the gases will only be monitored not controlled, correct?  At no point are you going to want to ability to test the fuel cell without the BOP on this station, correct?  Regarding the measurement of reformate, is this coming stra ight off of a reformer?  If yes, do you know the gas temperature that will need to be maintained?  Also, it is difficult to give a measured flow rate of a reformate, due to the varying compositions.  Do you have a GC in house to periodically analyze the ga s composition so that the meters are reading as accurately as possible? Answer: Correct, the gases will be monitored.  We plan to use it for BOP only.  We plan to use it for multiple purposes...with a reformer, with hydrogen.  We are working on a GC for our lab.
