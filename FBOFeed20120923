<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION WILL BE ISSUED ON A LATER DATE.
<p>Background<br />The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Occupational and Environmental Epidemiology Branch (OEEB) in the Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG), is anticipating re-competing a full and open competition contract for support for interdisciplinary studies. A major objective of DCEG is to identify and understand mechanisms of carcinogenesis. Occupational and environmental investigations play an important role in this effort because well-documented, high-level exposures to potential carcinogens occur in the workplace and because environmental exposures can impact a large segment of the population. <br /><br />The fundamental mission of the OEEB is to identify and clarify causes of cancer, with a focus on occupational and environmental exposures. To achieve its goals, OEEB's approach has been to (1) merge epidemiology, quantitative exposure assessment, and biologic and genetic components into multi-disciplinary investigations to identify carcinogens, clarify exposure-response relationships, and enhance our mechanistic understanding of carcinogenesis; (2) conduct investigations to develop and improve methods for exposure assessment and to evaluate and incorporate state-of-the-art biomarker assays into its molecular epidemiology studies; (3) facilitate the development of consortia to efficiently create scientific opportunities that are difficult to achieve in any one study; (4) develop and maintain resources for occupational and environmental epidemiology and exposure assessment; and (5) assist in training the next generation of occupational, environmental, and molecular epidemiologists.<br /><br />The philosophic focus of OEEB is to conduct high-impact epidemiologic studies that integrate quantitative exposure assessment and molecular epidemiology to provide new insights into cancer etiology, chemical carcinogenesis, and mechanisms of action. Approximately twenty-five studies will likely receive support under the contract.</p>
<p>This work is currently being conducted under contract HHSN261200700044C held by Westat, Inc. <br /><br />Project Requirement<br />This support services contract is essential for OEEB to conduct high-impact epidemiologic studies that integrate quantitative exposure assessment and molecular epidemiology to provide new insights into cancer etiology, chemical carcinogenesis, and mechanisms of action. The NCI/OEEB requires the assistance of an organization highly experienced in providing technical support for all phases of occupational and environmental epidemiologic studies, including support for exposure assessment and molecular components, and coordination of activities related to genome-wide association studies (GWAS); and in conducting and simultaneously managing concurrent, multiple, large (including international) epidemiologic investigations of cancer etiology. The contract will establish a mechanism to provide all the services required to conduct a wide variety of domestic and international and field (case-control, cohort, and cross-sectional) studies. <br /><br />Some of the major activities of the contract include:</p>
<p>a. pilot test data collection forms and instruments, including computer-assisted personal (CAPI) and computer-assisted telephone (CATI) interviews; <br />b. train interviewers and abstractors, including development of training documents under guidance of NCI;<br />c. interview study subjects and their family; <br />d. trace study subjects; including locating cancer patients and/or their relatives, selection of controls through such methods as random digit dialing and acquisition of appropriate study population rosters or files (e.g., departments of motor vehicles); <br />e. abstract medical records and other relevant data sources; <br />f. trace to determine vital status or locate subjects; <br />g. obtain death certificates and cancer incidence records; <br />h. obtain medical records; <br />i. select appropriate molecular epidemiology procedures to understand cancer etiology with guidance from NCI; <br />j. edit and maintain quality control and standardization of data to ensure appropriate and valid results; <br />k. arrange for the collection, handling, transport, and storage of biologic, industrial hygiene and environmental samples; <br />l. coordinate and monitor a biologic specimen program; <br />m. prepare data management systems that monitor study progress and data flow;<br />n. assess occupational and environmental exposures using various techniques, including (for the environmental assessment) geographic information systems;<br />o. develop and monitor subcontracts; <br />p. conduct coding of records, questionnaires and death certificates; <br />q. prepare and maintain computer databases;<br />r. provide documentation of study decisions and study procedure manuals; <br />s. identify qualified industrial hygienists and exposure assessors; <br />t. identify qualified laboratories to analyze biologic, industrial hygiene and environmental samples; <br />u. develop files and reports of work to allow efficient and easy transfer of data and knowledge to the next support services contractor;<br />v. develop coordination and liaison at the local or international level with collaborating investigators or institutions whose cooperation is needed for the conduct of a study<br />w. close coordination of GWAS efforts with the relevant NCI repositories and laboratories, including trouble shooting all aspects of data and DNA sample preparation; prepare and maintain subject data logs and DNA manifests; selection of DNA samples for analysis based on review of pre-genotyping quality control reports; coordination of the post-GWAS replication efforts including selecting DNA samples for analysis; coordinating data collection and harmonization across studies for subsequent gene-environment interaction analyses; and preparation and QC/QA of phenotype data linked to GWAS data sets for submission to dbGaP.</p>
<p>The services will be acquired through full and open competitive procedures under NAICS 541990. It is anticipated that a cost reimbursement, term type contract will be awarded with a 1-year base period and four (4) 1-year options of performance beginning on or about September 28, 2012.</p>
<p>The RFP will be available electronically on or about April 26, 2012 and may be accessed through the FedBizOpps at www.fbo.gov. All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by the Agency. This notice does not commit the Government to award a contract. No collect calls will be accepted. No facsimile or email transmissions will be accepted. IT IS THE OFFERORS RESPONSIBILITY TO MONITOR THE ABOVE INTERNET SITE FOR THE RELEASE OF THE SOLICITATION Mil ANY AMENDMENTS.</p>

<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00).

<p>Past Performance: The Government will evaluate the Offeror's past performance information and, if appropriate, its proposed subcontractors' past performance to determine its relevance to the current requirement and the extent to which it demonstrates that the offeror has successfully completed relevant contracts in the past five years. In assessing the offeror's past performance information, NIST will evaluate, as appropriate, successful performance of contract requirements, quality and timeliness of delivery of goods and services, cost management, communications between contracting parties, proactive management and customer satisfaction.. Evaluation of this factor will be based on information contained in the technical portion of the proposal and information provided by references. The Government will evaluate past performance information by contacting appropriate references, including NIST references, if applicable. The Government may also consider other available information in evaluating the Offeror's past performance. The Government will assign a neutral rating if the offeror has no relevant past performance information.</p>
<p>Price: The Government will evaluate price for reasonableness.</p>
<p>Past Performance and Price shall not be evaluated on proposals that are determined technically unacceptable under the Technical Capability Evaluation factor. <br />Non-Governmental Acquisition Support <br />The Government may utilize non-Governmental acquisition support for processing of proposals submitted in response to this solicitation. These individual(s) will have access to the proposal information and will be assisting the Contracting Officer in the procurement process by performing services including, but not limited to, preparing the proposals for submission to the technical evaluators, performing past performance checks, and preparing award documents.

If applicable, evidence that the Offeror is authorized by the original equipment manufacturer to provide the item(s) in the quotation should be included.</p>
<p><br />Past Performance: The offeror shall provide past performance information regarding relevant contracts over the past five (5) years with Federal, state, or local governments, or commercial customers. If the offeror intends to subcontract with another firm(s) for part of this requirement, that firm's past performance information shall also be provided. If the offeror has no relevant past performance, it may include a statement to that effect in its quotation. The government reserves the right to consider data obtained from sources other than those described by the offeror in its quotation. It is recommended that approximately 3-5 contracts be referenced.</p>

<p>QUOTATION EVALUATION:</p>
<p>Evaluation Factors</p>
<p>Award shall be made to the offeror whose quotation offers the best value to the Government price and other factors considered.

All non-price factors, when combined, are approximately equally important to price.</p>
<p>Technical Capability: No prototypes, demonstration models, used or refurbished instruments will be considered. Evaluation of technical capability shall be based on the information provided in the quotation. NIST will evaluate whether the offeror has demonstrated that its proposed equipment meets or exceeds all minimum requirements. Quotations that do not demonstrate the proposed equipment meets all requirements will not be considered further for award. If an offeror does not indicate whether its proposed equipment meets a certain minimum requirement, NIST will determine that it does not. NIST will give preference to offerors who demonstrate that their proposed equipment exceeds NIST's requirements.</p>
<p>Past Performance: The Government will evaluate the Offeror's past performance information and, if appropriate, its proposed subcontractors' past performance to determine its relevance to the current requirement and the extent to which it demonstrates that the offeror has successfully completed relevant contracts in the past five years. In assessing the offeror's past performance information, NIST will evaluate, as appropriate, successful performance of contract requirements, quality and timeliness of delivery of goods and services, cost management, communications between contracting parties, proactive management and customer satisfaction.. Evaluation of this factor will be based on information contained in the technical portion of the quotation and information provided by references. The Government will evaluate past performance information by contacting appropriate references, including NIST references, if applicable. The Government may also consider other available information in evaluating the Offeror's past performance. The Government will assign a neutral rating if the offeror has no relevant past performance information.</p>
<p>Price: The Government will evaluate price for reasonableness.</p>
<p>Past Performance and Price shall not be evaluated on quotes that are determined technically unacceptable under the Technical Capability Evaluation factor.</p>

The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk.

The full text of the referenced FAR clauses may be accessed electronically at https://www.acquisition.gov/far/. <BR> <BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ?have?, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>The Government will not be responsible for returning equipment with a full tank of gas or paying to refuel the equipment at the end of the Period of Performance. DELIVERY/PICKUP AND REFUELING COST MUST BE INCLUDED IN THE QUOTE. <BR> <BR>

All non-price factors, when combined, are approximately equally important to price.</p>
<p>Technical Capability: No prototypes, demonstration models, used or refurbished instruments will be considered. Evaluation of technical capability shall be based on the information provided in the proposal. NIST will evaluate whether the offeror has demonstrated that its proposed equipment meets or exceeds all minimum requirements. Proposals that do not demonstrate the proposed equipment meets all requirements will not be considered further for award. If an offeror does not indicate whether its proposed equipment meets a certain minimum requirement, NIST will determine that it does not. NIST will give preference to offerors who demonstrate that their proposed equipment exceeds NIST's requirements. Stronger consideration will be given to equipment capable of providing the following additional capabilities: <br />1. As stated in specification 10, stronger consideration will be given for a smaller laser head.<br />2. As stated in specification 11, stronger consideration will be given to systems that include Lab View drivers.</p>
<p>Past Performance: The Government will evaluate the Offeror's past performance information and, if appropriate, its proposed subcontractors' past performance to determine its relevance to the current requirement and the extent to which it demonstrates that the offeror has successfully completed relevant contracts in the past five years. In assessing the offeror's past performance information, NIST will evaluate, as appropriate, successful performance of contract requirements, quality and timeliness of delivery of goods and services, cost management, communications between contracting parties, proactive management and customer satisfaction.. Evaluation of this factor will be based on information contained in the technical portion of the proposal and information provided by references. The Government will evaluate past performance information by contacting appropriate references, including NIST references, if applicable. The Government may also consider other available information in evaluating the Offeror's past performance. The Government will assign a neutral rating if the offeror has no relevant past performance information.</p>
<p>Price: The Government will evaluate price for reasonableness.</p>
<p>Past Performance and Price shall not be evaluated on proposals that are determined technically unacceptable under the Technical Capability Evaluation factor. <br />Non-Governmental Acquisition Support <br />The Government may utilize non-Governmental acquisition support for processing of proposals submitted in response to this solicitation. These individual(s) will have access to the proposal information and will be assisting the Contracting Officer in the procurement process by performing services including, but not limited to, preparing the proposals for submission to the technical evaluators, performing past performance checks, and preparing award documents.

<DESC><p>The products and services that are to be purchased from Ariba are crucial to the ongoing operation of the Integrated Logistics Management System (ILMS). ILMS, developed under the auspices of A/LM/PMP, is the State Department's comprehensive supply chain management system. ILMS has been developed over many years at a substantial cost. ILMS is composed of an assortment of customized off-the-shelf software products as well as certain purpose-built software modules that have been linked and integrated with one another, and with the State Department's Financial Management System. In the course of design and development of ILMS for the State Department, the systems integrator selected and incorporated into ILMS the products and support services provided by Ariba. ILMS will not function without these components.</p>
<p>One of the key components of ILMS is the Ariba Spend Viz software. It allows the department to control costs and risks by providing a comprehensive analysis of domestic and overseas spending, enhanced with reliable supplier data and available on demand.</p>
<p>Ariba Spend Viz is the only unified solution that provides a consolidated and classified analysis of the Department's spend and suppliers enriched by insights from D&amp;B's global database. Ultimately allowing the Department to make better buying decisions.</p>
