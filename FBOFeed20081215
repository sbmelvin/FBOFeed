<DESC><p>NOTICE OF CONTRACT ACTION FOR NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD SOLE SOURCE PROCUREMENT FOR Semiconductor-Tuned High Temperature Superconductor Filters for Ultrasensitive RF Receivers (SURF) Program. This is an announcement that the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) intends to award a Sole Source contract to Teledyne Scientific &amp; Imaging (TSI) LLC, Thousand Oaks, CA for a new effort under the (Phase 2) Semiconductor-Tuned High-Temperature Superconducting Filters for Ultra Sensitive RF Receivers (SURF) Program. The concept of SURF program is to develop the technologies needed for the next generation of high-temperature superconducting (HTS) filters, enabling them to be tuned at microsecond speeds, and with other parameters (high quality factor "Q', low insertion loss, high out-of-band rejection, etc.). Under the DARPA SURF phase 1 initiative, TSI demonstrated first generation switches and delivered parts to STI for insertion into their prototype HTS filters. These challenging circuits required the creation of new and unique modeling techniques and tools to allow the design and simulation of ABCS circuits. Recently, TSI has also been developing high-performance, broadband amplifiers for phased-array antennas signal intelligence applications. Experience gained from these efforts will directly impact the work proposed here for the development of the SURF phase 2 switches. In the Phase II effort Teledyne Scientific will act as a prime contractor and plans to develop next generation Antimonide Based Compound Semiconductor (ABCS) devices to build switches and amplifiers in support of Superconductor Technologies Inc. (STI) SURF Phase 2 effort focused on the development of the technology necessary for a new type of High Temperature Superconductor (HTS) planar thin film tuned filters. These filters will be very small, integrated, reconfigurable cryogenic planar HTS filters that are cost effective for military applications. The filters are intended to initially work over sub-bands in the approximate frequency range of 0.5 GHz to 2 GHz, but these limits are not hard and future applications may be outside of this range. Vendors who are capable of providing the services stated above shall fully identify their interest and submit, in writing, information documenting their qualifications and capabilities to meet the requirements stated above within 15 days after publication of this synopsis. Responses must be submitted to Dawn M Ross, Contracting Officer, via email at dawn.ross@wpafb.af.mil. Responses received after 15 days or without the required information will be considered non-responsive to the synopsis, and will not be considered. Other business opportunities for the Air Force Research Laboratory are available at www.fedbizopps.gov. The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within forty-five days (thirty days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

This is an announcement that the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) intends to award a Sole Source contract to the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA), for a new effort under the (Phase 2) Semiconductor-Tuned High-Temperature Superconducting Filters for Ultra Sensitive RF Receivers (SURF) Program. The concept of SURF program is to develop the technologies needed for the next generation of high-temperature superconducting (HTS) filters, enabling them to be tuned at microsecond speeds, and with other parameters (high quality factor "Q', low insertion loss, high out-of-band rejection, etc.). Under the DARPA SURF phase 1 initiative UCLA designed and fabricated complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) RF switches and a deserialzer ASIC as well as a cryogenically compatible CMOS deserializer which was delivered, but not tested in Phase I. Also designed, delivered and not tested under the Phase I portion of this effort were several cryo-optimized single pole single throw (SPST) switches. In the proposed work under Phase II, UCLA will extend capability in the high frequency characterization of transistors/circuit blocks at temperatures from 77K to 300K., develop high speed CMOS controllers for reconfigurable RF systems operated at reduced temperatures, investigate switch architectures to enable a broad frequency range that leverages the availability of an array of ultra high-Q filters. investigate optimizing the switch circuit architectures at 77K as well as developing circuits that have both low-temperature (LT) CMOS digital circuits (for controllers as well as other signal processing) and RF switches.

2.  Exhibit Booths to be identified and numbered 1001  1201 (for a total of 200 exhibit booths) and Interview Booths to be numbered 2001  2301 (for a total of 300 interview booths).  Layout of Exhibit and Interview Booths on exhibit floor to be discussed prior to drafting floor plan.  Previous Job Fair layouts accommodated needs; however, this year we would like the Exhibit and Interview Booth sections to be separated by a row of skirted round tables (provided by conference venue) to expand the distance between these two sections.  Orientation of floor plan and booth locations to be discussed under separate cover, once a conference venue has been identified.

3.  We intend to use this floor plan as the map for participants to follow and identify booth locations.  It is preferred the booths and numbers appear in the largest font possible to fit on an 8.5x11 standard sheet of paper when used as a floor map for participants. The floor plan will need to be adjusted several times and provided in Adobe Acrobat (.pdf) file format until a final version is approved by the conference venue and OPM, and ready for distribution.

4.  Production of an initial floor plan will need to be done upon award of contract, in efforts to consult with conference venue for any possible approvals and/or edits.

<DESC>NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) intends to issue a Request for Proposal(RFP) for the development of a conceptual telescope design to meet the requirements ofthe Joint Dark Energy Mission (JDEM).  The JDEM is a jointly funded and developed missionby NASA and the Department of Energy (DOE) and is a space-based, medium aperture, widefield, optical telescope with visible and near-infrared (NIR) imaging and spectroscopicinstrumentation.  JDEM will survey the sky to accurately measure the magnitude andredshift of a large sample of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), spectroscopic redshifts of alarge, uniform sample of galaxies for Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) studies, andaccurate shape parameters and photometric redshift measurements of a very large sample ofgalaxies for Weak Lensing (WL) studies.  The Telescope Assembly portion of theobservatory is expected to be an afocal Three Mirror Anastigmat (TMA) with 3 tertiarymirrors that will provide the optical train to the Government developed JDEM instruments(4 focal planes and a fine guidance sensor).  The JDEM telescope is expected to have aprimary mirror size of ~1.5 meters in diameter and operate at a temperature of 253Kelvin.  The JDEM observatory is expected to be launched aboard a NASA provided EELV inlate 2015 to an orbit around the Sun-Earth second Lagrange point (L2) and be operated fora minimum of 5 years.  NASA contemplates evaluating and selecting multiple offers(approximately 3) based on the proposals as submitted and providing each of the studyparticipants a not to exceed cost of $300K for a three month study.    This studyactivity is intended to determine feasible telescope concepts based on the preliminaryJDEM science requirements, assess the critical cost and schedule drivers, and developcost and schedule estimates for the design, build and test of the JDEM telescope. Requirements for a collimated beam at the instruments pupils will be provided and aconceptual telescope design will be developed in the course of this study.  The studywill also request results of trade studies performed in the course of the study, arecommendation on the level of integrated modeling required for the proposed concept, adescription of the telescope integration and test flow along with a recommended opticaltest approach at temperature.  Additionally, the study will request an alternativeconcept for the entire optical system be developed from the primary mirror through theinstrument optics given a set of requirements on the instrument focal planes.  It isanticipated that in the near future the information relative to this concept study, willbe posted to the JDEM website at http://jdem.gsfc.nasa.gov    .The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See Note26.All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.The anticipated release date of the RFP is on or about Monday, January 5, 2009 with ananticipated offer due date of on or about Thursday, February 5, 2009.An ombudsman has been appointed.The solicitation and any documents related to this procurement will be available over theInternet.

<DESC>This is a notice of intent, not a request for a proposal. A solicitation document will not be issued and proposals will not be requested.

National Institute on Drug Abuse, Office of Acquisitions- Neurosciences, Station Support/Simplified Acquisition, on behalf of the National Institute on Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), intends to award on a sole source basis to BD Biosciences, 2350 Qume Drive, San Jose, CA, 95131-1807, for acquisition of a LSR digital flow cytometer.  The cytometer is to be used to analyze and phenotype immunce cell populations that migrate into the central nervous system as well as peripheral tissues. The BD Biosciences is the only known cytometer which permits simultaneous analysis of up to 18 colors.  This is an important feature because very few cells can be extracted from the central nervous system.   With one central nervous system sample, the BD Biosciences cytometer has the capacity to analyze up to 18 colors.

The acquisition is being conducted under simplified acquisition using FAR 12 procedures and is exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6, Competition Requirement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this synopsis. The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely with the discretion of the Government.

Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>This Sources Sought Notice is for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).  The purpose of this Notice is to identify potential sources that may be interested in and capable of performing the work described herein.  The NHTSA welcomes Corporate Capability Statements from all individuals and organizations.  The NHTSA does not intend to award a contract on the basis of responses nor otherwise pay for the preparation of any information submitted or NHTSAs use of such information.  Acknowledgement of receipt of responses will not be made, nor will respondents be notified of NHTSAs evaluation of the information received.  As a result of this Notice, the NHTSA may issue a Request for Proposals (RFP).  However, should such a requirement fail to materialize, no basis for claims against the NHTSA shall arise as a result of a response to this Notice.  

BACKGROUND

Deterring alcohol-impaired driving is a critical component of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administrations (NHTSAs) strategy to reduce the number of motor vehicle crash fatalities and injuries.  To be effective, programs to accomplish traffic safety goals should be based on sound data that describe the current characteristics of the problem and provide direction for interventions.   Contributing substantially to this knowledge base over the past 15 years in the alcohol area has been a national telephone survey sponsored by NHTSAs Office of Behavioral Safety Research (OBSR).   That survey has collected data on the publics attitudes, knowledge, and behavior regarding drinking and driving.

NHTSA has conducted its national survey on drinking and driving on a periodic basis since 1991.  In order to be more efficient in carrying out the surveys, the most recent alcohol surveys were included as individual Tasks under Contract DTNH22-02-C-05027.  The final Task under the Contract was the data collection for the 2008 National Survey of Drinking and Driving Attitudes and Behavior, and accompanying data collection for the response bias analysis.  The Contractor (The Gallup Organization) conducted the pretest in August 2008, and the field data collection began mid-September.  However, insufficient time remains within the existing period of performance for analyses, report preparation, and report editing.  Regulatory requirements preclude adding time to the Contract to carry out those necessary functions due to limits on the period of performance for Contracts.  In order to utilize the data that have been collected and report them in a timely fashion, NHTSA requires a new Contract to complete work on the 2008 National Survey of Drinking and Driving Attitudes and Behavior.  This procurement serves that contractual function.   

OBJECTIVE

The objectives of this procurement are to conduct the following activities for the 2008 National Survey of Drinking and Driving Attitudes and Behavior:

Analyze the collected data;

Report the results of the analyses to NHTSA through submission of formal Reports.

Format of Corporate Capabilities Statement:

Any interested organizations should submit the Corporate Capability Statement which demonstrates the firms ability and interest in no more than 10 pages to perform the key requirements described above.  All proprietary information should be marked as such. 

All respondents are asked to indicate the type and size of their business organization, e.g., Large business, Small Business, Small Disadvantaged Business, Women-Owned-Business, 8(A), Historically Black College or University/Minority Institution (HBCU/MI), educational institution, profit/non-profit organization, in their response. Interested offerors shall respond to this Sources Sought Notice no later than 15 calendar days from date of posting. E-mail is the preferred method when receiving responses to this Notice.

<DESC><p>This Sources Sought Notice (SS) is for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the National Institute of Aging (NIA) or the National Institutes of Health (NIH).</p>
<p>The purpose of this Sources Sought Notice is to identify qualified small businesses including 8(a), HUBZone, Women Owned Small business, Small disadvantaged Business, and/or Service-Disabled Veteran-owned business concerns that are interested in and capable of performing the work described herein.  Teaming and partnering among small businesses is encouraged.</p>
<p>The NIA does not intend to award a contract on the basis of responses to this Sources Sought Notice, nor otherwise pay for the preparation of any information submitted.  As a result of this Sources Sought Notice, the NIA may issue a Request for Proposal (RFP). THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.  However, should such a requirement materialize, no basis for claims against NIA shall arise as a result of a response to this Sources Sought Notice or the NIA's use of such information as either part of our evaluation process or in developing specifications for any subsequent requirement.</p>
<p>If an RFP is issued, it is anticipated that one (1), cost-reimbursement, completion type contract will be awarded for a period of five (5) years, with an option for yearly extensions up to two (2) additional years and/or additional quantities.  This contract may include incentives, award fees, and/or be performance based.  <br /> <br />The National Institute of Aging is seeking qualified small businesses to provide support to the Longitudinal Studies Section (LSS), Clinical Research Branch (CRB), Intramural Research Branch (IRB), of the National Institutes of Aging (NIA) within the NIH, to provide recruiting and screening support as described below.</p>
<p>The proposed project is aimed at enrolling 500 new Exceptionally Healthy and Long Lived (IDEAL) participants, ages 80 years and over, into the ongoing Baltimore Washington Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) over a 5-year period.  It is expected that approximately 50% of individuals who are invited for screening though a preliminary questionnaire-based self evaluation will be eligible for the study and of those about 50% will join the BLSA. Based upon these assumptions, an average of 400 screening visits per year will be required to enroll 100 Elite Aging individuals per year in the BLSA.</p>
<p>The prevalence of individuals with these characteristics in the general population cannot be reliably estimated from existing studies, either because these studies selected subgroups of the population (for example Health ABC or WHAS) or because some of the inclusion criteria described above were not collected.  Based on the few available data, it can be conservatively estimated that approximately 1% of those 80 years or older fit the characteristics for inclusion in the IDEAL study.</p>
<p>The catchment area identified for recruitment into the IDEAL cohort is the Baltimore/Washington metropolitan area.  This is a highly populated area, with more than 15 million people living within 150 mile radius of the Baltimore Washington area.  Since the percentage of those 80+ in the general population is approximately 4.0%, there are approximately 600,000 people in the 80+ category, and it can be estimated that about 6,000 of them are Elite (one percent)</p>
<p>If an RFP is issued, proposals will be sought to recruit, screen, consent and enroll 500 extremely healthy older individuals from the Washington-Baltimore area for participation in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging over a 5 year period. The work to be performed includes implementing and monitoring an extensive advertising campaign, designing and conducting a screening protocol either in the participant's home(s) or in the BLSA Clinic at Harbor Hospital in Baltimore, MD, and facilitating enrollment of IDEAL aging individuals into the Baltimore Longitudinal study of Aging, the oldest and most prestigious longitudinal study of aging maintained and sponsored by the NIH National Institute on Aging.</p>
<p>Capability Statements for this requirement shall address the following five (5) areas:</p>
<p>1.	Location:  At time of award, the presence of a recruiting location/office is needed within or around the Baltimore/Washington area.  The government believes a local presence is necessary to perform this contract effectively. After recruitment, subjects must periodically be evaluated at Harbor Hospital, Baltimore, MD., and therefore must be recruited within this general geographic area.  At times the potential subjects will be screened in their homes.  The contractor should discuss how it can effectively perform these functions based upon its location.</p>
<p>2. General Experience: Experience with contracts of a similar size and scope to this proposed project.  Cite all experience with similar contracts. Contract(s)/project(s) listed may include those entered into with the Federal Government, agencies of state or local governments, and commercial concerns.  For informational purposes, it is estimated that about 5,500 direct labor hours of effort will be required on a yearly basis.</p>
<p>3. Specific Experience:  The Contractor and their proposed personnel should have specific experience in recruiting, screening and consenting human subjects, and related advertising experience and web site development to recruit subject participants. The Contractor should have experience designing a screening protocol, in collaboration with the client. Proposed personnel should demonstrate that your organization has the necessary expertise to perform the requirements of the project.</p>
<p>4. Equipment:  The Contractor is expected to have any necessary equipment to perform the project available for immediate use (e.g. information technology, hardware, software, etc.).</p>
<p>5. Human Subjects' Regulations:  All NIH human subjects' regulations will apply to this project.  Offerors must have an established local Institutional Review Board (IRB) at time of award, and after approval of the protocol obtain and provide to the NIA Project Officer and Contracting Officer documentation of local IRB approval to conduct all human subjects protocols involved in this project.</p>
<p>Interested qualified small business organizations should submit a capability statement for this requirement not to exceed ten (10) single sided pages, excluding any attachments, resumes, charts, etc. (single spaced, 12 point font minimum) that clearly details the ability to perform the aspects of the notice described above.  Responses will be reviewed only by NIH personnel and will be held in a confidential manner.  In the event an RFP is issued, North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 541720 with a size standard of 6.5 Million is being contemplated.</p>
<p>Capability statements should be submitted no later than 2:00 p.m. eastern prevailing time on Wednesday January 07, 2009.  Please submit one (1) original and four (4) copies of your response (no Facsimiles please).   Electronic responses, via e-mail, are encouraged in addition to hardcopies. All responses, including electronic responses, should be received at NIH NIDA OA by the specified due date and time.  Responses received after that date may not be considered.</p>

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION:  THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION; no award will be made as a result of this request.  This request for information is for informational purposes only; this is not a Request for Proposal (RFP).  All interested parties are encouraged to respond to this RFI. The Government will not pay for information and materials received in response to this RFI and is in no way obligated by the information received.<BR><BR>1.  Background:  The mission of the U.S. Army Rapid Equipping Force (REF) is to rapidly increase mission capability while reducing risk to Soldiers and others by equipping operational commanders with off-the-shelf (government or commercial) solutions or near-term developmental items that can be researched, developed and acquired quickly.  The REF receives requirements from operational commanders in war zones setting forth the capabilities needed.  The REF is chartered by the Senior Army leadership to provide material solutions to meet these requirements in a significantly reduced timeline compared to traditional Department of Defense acquisition procedures.<BR><BR>The purpose of this RFI is to obtain potential solutions to provide both detection and deterrence of intruders by way of illumination.  The REF believes that Counter-Insurgency Operations (COIN) in Iraq and Afghanistan will require the use of enhanced imaging devices in order to accomplish these efforts.  Alternative solutions submitted by companies responding to this RFI will also be considered. <BR><BR>2. Scope:  The REF has a need for a technology or system that will provide the capabilities of detecting items emplaced in culverts.  Once triggered the sensors will either provide a local alert (to approaching vehicles) and long-distance alert (to a central monitoring station) or both (local and long distance).  The sensors will operate day and night, 24/7, in all weather conditions.<BR><BR>2.1.	The system must detect disruption of culverts.<BR>2.2.	The system must provide real-time coverage<BR>2.3.	The system shall be covertly emplaced and not easily detectable/covert<BR>2.4.	The system will include anti-tampering system    <BR>2.5.	The system will provide location at ranges greater than 200m and/or long distance notification <BR>2.6.	Battery life will be 6 months or greater<BR>2.7.	System will be environmentally rugged to withstand water/moisture<BR>2.8.	The system must be significantly robust to operate in a rugged environment.<BR>2.8.1.	Operating Temperature Range: -25 celsius to +48 celsius<BR>2.8.2.	Storage Temperature Range:  -46 celsius to +71 celsius<BR>2.8.3.	Must be able to sustain extensive dust, sand, and wind.<BR>	2.8. 	Identify number of days for your proposed delivery of two (2) systems that meet the above requirements.<BR><BR>3. Deliverables:  Specific information on industry capability to produce a system that can meet the requirements identified in paragraph 2 above, or otherwise solves the problem of identifying and detecting objects being emplaced.<BR><BR>Experience and information obtained from this request for information will be provided to Army Product Manager REF who will evaluate the information and feasibility of issuing a procurement action to resolve the stated problem.<BR><BR><BR>This is NOT a Request for Proposal. Companies who desire to participate in this market survey are encouraged to submit a white paper which supports the companys claim that it presently has the technology, qualifications, and capabilities to satisfy one or more of the performance and technical objectives described above.  The white paper should discuss the companys ability to develop and or provide existing technologies to detect items placed in culverts in Iraq and Afghanistan and should provide a ROM (rough order of magnitude) price and its anticipated delivery for the solution proposed.<BR><BR>The white paper should also discuss related company experience and include point(s) of contact.  The white paper should be prepared in MS Word, limited to ten (10) pages, and submitted electronically to the contracting officer at gregory.wagenknecht@us.army.mil.  The company shall be responsible for any costs associated with preparing responses to this market research.  All requests for further information must be made in writing or via email; telephone requests for additional information will not be honored.

<SUBJECT>An Evaluation Of States Monitoring And Improvement Practices Under The Individuals With Disabilities Education Act
<SOLNBR>ED04CO0140EXT
<RESPDATE>122908
<CONTACT>Sharon K. Masciana, Contract Specialist, Phone 202-245-6132, Fax 202-245-6298, Email sharon.masciana@ed.gov
<DESC>The Department of Education intends to issue a 12-month extension to existing contract # ED-04-CO-0140.  The current period of performance ends on September 30, 2009.  The purpose of the extension is to enable members of the Westat team to assist the Institute of Education Sciences (IES) in reviewing and finalizing deliverables in the procurements scope of work, including a final report and a database. 

On September 21, 2004, The Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services (OSERS) of the U.S. Department of Education (ED) awarded contract ED-04-CO-0140 to Westat of Rockville, Maryland to conduct a 5-year evaluation of states monitoring and improvement practices under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). The ultimate goal of this evaluation is to provide information about states monitoring and improvement systems, including strengths and weaknesses of current monitoring activities as well as possible improvements in monitoring policies and procedures. In July 2005 this project was relocated from OSERS to a newly-established center in the Institute of Education Sciences (IES)the National Center for Special Education Research (NCSER).

The evaluation is divided into three phases. Phase 1 consisted of a mail survey to all 50 states and the District of Columbia to gain a general understanding of their monitoring and improvement systems for Parts B and C of IDEA. Phase 2 was composed of two rounds of site visits to a systematic random sample of 20 states to gather in-depth information on the design and quality of Part B and Part C monitoring systems. The first round of site visits was conducted in 2006 and focused on state monitoring activities in 2004-05. A second round of site visits occurred in 2008 and focused on state monitoring activities in 2006-07. Phase 3 will involve detailed analysis and reporting on the design and quality of states monitoring and improvement systems and their compliance with Part B and Part C of IDEA, as well as development of possible improvement strategies.
When the project was relocated from OSERS to NCSER, a number of organizational review policies were introduced that had not been included in the original project schedule. The 12-month extension will allow Westat to incorporate the NCSER and IES review procedures in its completion of Phase 3. This will allow the resulting report and database to be publicly released in accordance with IES policies.

This notice is for informational purposes only.  A request for proposal is not available.  Interested parties may, however, request further information no later than December 29, 2008 by email to Contract Specialist Sharon Masciana at Sharon.Masciana@ed.gov.

Background information -
The West Coast Shallow Water Training Ranges are Undersea Warfare (USW) training systems that will provide real-time track positions of exercise participants in two areas on the west coast.   The In-water Subsystem (IWS) of this SWTR will provide the link between the Range Operations Center (ROC), which is a shore-based facility, and the undersea range areas which are to be located off-shore San Diego, CA. 
The USWTR is an Undersea Warfare (USW) training system that will provide real-time track positions of exercise participants on the east coast.   The IWS of this SWTR will provide the link between the ROC, which is a shore-based facility, and the undersea range area, which is to be located off-shore Jacksonville, FL.  
These SWTRS will be permanently-installed, fixed location range systems with a design life of 20 years.
The IWS is composed of the Ocean Sensor Subsystem (OSS) and the Shore Electronics Subsystem (SES).
The OSS is comprised of acoustic and telemetry subsystems, electro-mechanical optical cables (EMOC), deep-water electronic pressure housings, and related hardware components. 
The SES provides required power to the OSS, receives and processes the in-water sensor data, and provides analog and digital outputs for each of the sensor nodes.  The SES also controls all in-water hardware functions, provides system status, and interfaces to the display subsystem at the ROC.

<p><br />SECTION K - REPRESENTATIONS AND CERTIFICATIONS Beginning January 1, 2005, the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) will require the use of the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) in Federal solicitations as a part of the proposal submission process. All offerors must be registered in ORCA. ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitations. With ORCA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information, at your convenience via the Internet athttp://orca.bpn.gov. In addition, rather than receiving and reviewing paper submissions, government contracting officials can access ORCA and review your information online as a part of the proposal evaluation process. You will no longer have to submit representations and certifications completed in ORCA with each offer. Instead, a solicitation will contain a single provision that will allow you to either certify that all of your representations and certifications in ORCA are current, complete and accurate as of the date of your signature, or list any changes. Although architect-engineer firms can voluntarily submit the Standard Form (SF) 330 Part II through ORCA, they still must submit this form to each agency for which it wants to be considered for projects that are not publicly announced. To prepare for this requirement and to register in ORCA, you will need to have two items: an active Central Contractor Registration (CCR) record and a Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) identified in that CCR record. Your DUNS number and MPIN act as your companies ID and password into ORCA. (Visit www.ccr.gov for more information on creating and entering your MPIN). The basic information provided in your CCR record is used to pre-populate a number of fields in ORCA. Vendors are reminded to protect their MPIN from unauthorized use. Once in ORCA you will be asked to review pertinent information pre-populated from CCR, provide a point of contact, and answer a questionnaire that contains up to 26 questions. The questionnaire is to help you gather information you need for the clauses. The questionnaire is not the official version. Be sure to read the provisions carefully. The answers you provide are then automatically entered into the actual FAR provisions. You are required to review your information, as inserted, in context of the full-text provisions for accuracy; acknowledge three additional read only provisions; and click a time/date stamp before final submission. You will need to review and/or update your ORCA record when necessary, but at least annually in order to maintain its active status.

<p>EVALUATION OF PAST PERFORMANCE - In accordance with FAR 15.305(a)(2), the Contracting Officer will evaluate factors for award of the offeror's record of past performance, adherence to contract schedules, cooperative behavior and commitment to customer satisfaction, evaluation factors based on detailed information received from the Business Questionnaire in Section L, and information received from past contracts and any additional data obtained by the Government, i.e., current contracts.</p>
<p>Offeror has the opportunity to submit, in their proposal, any problems and resolutions to those problems that Offeror has had with past customers. Recent contracts will be examined to ensure that corrective measures have been implemented. Prompt corrective action in isolated instances may not outweigh overall negative trends.</p>
<p>BASIS FOR AWARD - The Contracting Officer will make award to the offeror whose proposal represents the best overall expected value and that is considered most advantageous to its interests based on the criteria specified in this solicitation. The Contracting Officer will develop a level of confidence assessment rating for each offeror. This rating will be used to adjust the Government's evaluation of the offeror's proposal, and may highly influence the determination of which offeror represents the best overall expected value. If an offeror, or the proposed offeror do not have any past performance history relating to this solicitation, neither a favorable or unfavorable evaluation will be given. In determining which offeror represents the best overall value, the Contracting Officer will consider the following factors:</p>
<p>Past Performance. The offeror's records of past performance, and to what extent the performance has been satisfactory. The Offeror's cooperative behavior and commitment to customer satisfaction with the Government, public and private agencies. The timeliness of performance taking into account excusable delays. With past performance being the most important factor in the level of confidence assessment rating.</p>
<p>Poor Unfavorable<br />Marginal More unfavorable than favorable<br />Good More favorable than unfavorable<br />Excellent Entirely favorable</p>
<p>Firms lacking relevant past performance history: neither a favorable or unfavorable evaluation</p>
<p>Price - Those subfactors, as set forth in "Evaluation Criteria", upon which a comparative ranking of proposals will be based in accordance with relative order of importance accorded each factor:</p>

<p>Offerors are advised that the Government intends to evaluate proposals and award without discussions. Therefore, the initial proposal should contain the offerors best terms from a cost or price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary.</p>
<p>Tradeoff Process: It may be in the government best interest to consider award to other than the lowest priced offeror or other than the highest technical rated offeror. This process may include tradeoffs among cost/price and non cost factors and allows the Government to accept other than the lowest prices proposal if the perceived benefits of the higher priced proposal are determined to merit the additional cost.</p>
<p>All Offerors must complete the ACH form and the CCR Registration, which can be found on UNICOR's webpage at www.unicor.gov. For the ACH form click on business commercial opportunities, navigate to, procurement forms and click on ACH form and print.

<p><br />SECTION K - REPRESENTATIONS AND CERTIFICATIONS Beginning January 1, 2005, the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) will require the use of the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) in Federal solicitations as a part of the proposal submission process. All offerors must be registered in ORCA. ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitations. With ORCA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information, at your convenience via the Internet athttp://orca.bpn.gov. In addition, rather than receiving and reviewing paper submissions, government contracting officials can access ORCA and review your information online as a part of the proposal evaluation process. You will no longer have to submit representations and certifications completed in ORCA with each offer. Instead, a solicitation will contain a single provision that will allow you to either certify that all of your representations and certifications in ORCA are current, complete and accurate as of the date of your signature, or list any changes. Although architect-engineer firms can voluntarily submit the Standard Form (SF) 330 Part II through ORCA, they still must submit this form to each agency for which it wants to be considered for projects that are not publicly announced. To prepare for this requirement and to register in ORCA, you will need to have two items: an active Central Contractor Registration (CCR) record and a Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) identified in that CCR record. Your DUNS number and MPIN act as your companies ID and password into ORCA. (Visit www.ccr.gov for more information on creating and entering your MPIN). The basic information provided in your CCR record is used to pre-populate a number of fields in ORCA. Vendors are reminded to protect their MPIN from unauthorized use. Once in ORCA you will be asked to review pertinent information pre-populated from CCR, provide a point of contact, and answer a questionnaire that contains up to 26 questions. The questionnaire is to help you gather information you need for the clauses. The questionnaire is not the official version. Be sure to read the provisions carefully. The answers you provide are then automatically entered into the actual FAR provisions. You are required to review your information, as inserted, in context of the full-text provisions for accuracy; acknowledge three additional read only provisions; and click a time/date stamp before final submission. You will need to review and/or update your ORCA record when necessary, but at least annually in order to maintain its active status. Detailed information regarding ORCA, how to submit your record, and whom to call for assistance can be found on ORCAs homepage at http://orca.bpn.gov under Help.

Please see http://w3.nexis.com/sources/ for a complete list of the resources offered.

b.  Researchers and librarians need access to all of the resources below and must be able to search selected resources with one query and one interface.
c.  Customers require a single access interface to search across multiple fields.   This type of simultaneous searching reduces the need for multiple searches and saves the agency time.

BASE PERIOD        : 01/01/2009  12/31/2009

Contractor shall provide online tutorials.  Contractor shall also provide on-site training, briefings and updates to FDA researchers, in the DC area as well as selected remote offices.

(viii)   The provision at FAR 52.212-1 titled, "Instructions to Offerors Commercial" (JUN 2008), applies to this acquisition and is available at website: http://farsite.hill.af.mil/reghtml/regs/far2afmcfars/fardfars/far/12.htm#P257_45709.

(ix)  The provision at FAR 52.212-2, titled, "Evaluation of Commercial Items" (JAN 1999), is applicable to this acquisition.  

The following factors shall be used to evaluate quotes and are listed in descending order of importance:

TECHNICAL UNDERSTANDING:
To determine technical merit, each quotation will be evaluated against the requirements listed in this solicitation. All vendors offering an "Equal To" product must provide supporting documentation that their product can meet the requirements listed in this solicitation.  1)  The proposals will be graded subjectively with final scores of, Acceptable, or Unacceptable.  A score of Acceptable would mean that the proposed product fully met the requirements.  An Unacceptable score means that the offer will not be considered for award.

PRICE:

The Government will evaluate proposed prices for a base period plus four options.  Price is of less importance than technical capabilities and past performance combined.  Award will not be automatically made on the basis of the highest technical merit. However price may become an important factor as the degree of equality between technical proposals becomes closer.  FAR Provision 52.217-5, Evaluation of Options (Jul 1990) applies to this procurement.  The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. Evaluation of options will not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).

PAST PERFORMANCE: 
Vendors should provide two references of similar efforts performed during the last three years. This will include a description of the project, project title, contract number, contract amount, client identification including agency or company name, contracting and technical reviewing official name(s), address and telephone number. The government is seeking to determine whether an offeror has consistently demonstrated a strong commitment to customer satisfaction and high performance of services.  This is a matter of judgment.  The government will assess the relative risks associated with each offeror.  Performance risks are those associated with an offerors likelihood of success in performing the acquisition requirements as indicated by that offerors past performance record.  Rating of positive, neutral, and poor will be given.  A positive past performance will take precedence over neutral or poor past performance.  Neutral past performance takes precedence over poor past performance.  A contractor with no past performance will be given a score of neutral, which will neither be used to the advantage nor disadvantage of the offeror. The Government will assess the relative risks associated with each offeror.  Performance risks are those associated with an offerors likelihood of success in performing the acquisition requirements as indicated by that offerors record of past performance. 

(x) Vendors shall complete FAR 52.212-3, Offerors Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items (JUN 2008).   This can be done electronically at http://orca.bpn.gov.  The contracting officer will review the vendors online certifications at http://orca.bpn.gov to ensure that they are accurate and complete.  If the vendor does not have active representations and certifications registered online they will be disqualified from being considered for award.

<DESC><p>17.	This is a combined synopsis/solicitation Notice of Intent for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are not being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued for the solicitation number NOI9020 issued as a Notice of Intent. The incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC 2005-29).  This acquisition will be processed under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) and is not a Small Business Set-Aside. The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 334516, which has a small-business size standard is 500 employees. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID) intends to procure a AKTA Crossflow Filtration System from the only known source. Item/Description/Quantity: 1) AKTA Crossflow, qty-1. The AKTA Crossflow is proposed as a sole source purchase on the basis that NIH laboratories already owns 3 identical systems, which are shared with post-docs whose users have knowledge on how to use the equipment and the software package that is included with the system. The systems are in use 100% of the time imposing constraints with experiments being delayed because of not enough systems to handle all of the experiments. This is a fully automated filtration system for cross flow membrane screening, process development and small scale processing. This filtration system eliminates operator errors in cross flow filtration to ensure more reliable results. It also evaluates data automatically in hours rather than days, which is important in the labs research. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: 1) price, 2) warranty, 3) technical capability to meet required specifications. The government will award a fixed price purchase order to the responsible contractor.  The FOB terms are "Destination" and Net 30.  FAR provisions and clauses that apply to this acquisition: FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors, Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items; FAR 52.212.5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes of Executive Orders, Commercial Items; FAR 52.225-1, Buy American Act-Supplies; FAR 52.204-7, Central Contractor Registration; and FAR 32.703-2, Availability of Funds, FAR 52.232.34, Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer-Other than Center Contractor Registration.

This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.

POSITION DESCRIPTION

BACKGROUND

The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) is the office within USAID that is responsible for providing non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters.  OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) and is organized into three divisions under the management of the Office of the Director (OD).  The Program Support Division (PS) provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDAs Washington and field offices.  The Disaster Response and Mitigation Division (DRM) is responsible for coordinating with other organizations for the provision of relief supplies and humanitarian assistance.  DRM also devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human caused disaster situations. DRM hires sector specialists to provide technical expertise in assessing the quality of disaster response.  The Operations Division (OPS) develops and manages logistical, operational, and technical support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations.  OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue Teams (SAR), Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs).

INTRODUCTION

Since Fiscal Year 2003, USAID/OFDA has contributed more than $300 million in humanitarian assistance to vulnerable populations in Iraq.  USAID/OFDA-funded activities include direct relief support in the form of the distribution of emergency relief supplies to displaced and vulnerable populations; infrastructure projects to improve the quality of and access to water and sanitation facilities, provide shelter, and expand educational facilities to families of internally displaced persons (IDPs); health projects, including medical provider training, construction and rehabilitation of health facilities, support for mobile medical clinics, and the supply of essential medical equipment; and efforts to improve the employability of IDPs through vocational training. Many USAID/OFDA-funded projects are implemented as income generation mechanisms for IDPs, using IDP labor for their execution. In addition, USAID/OFDA-funded programs include provisions to allow partners to rapidly respond and adapt to emerging needs. Additionally, USAID/OFDA provides assistance to support capacity-building within the government of Iraq.

According to the International Organization for Migration (IOM), more than 2.8 million Iraqis are internally displaced and an additional 2.2 million have sought refuge in neighboring countries. Displacement rates have stabilized in recent months due in part to the sectarian homogenization of communities, districts, and neighborhoods, and an overall decrease in security incidents. Restrictions on movement in many governorates, bans on accepting new IDPs in some areas, and depletion of family resources prevent many Iraqis from leaving insecure or deteriorating areas, thereby also contributing to the low displacement rate.

The Senior Humanitarian Advisor will serve as part of OFDAs Europe, Middle East and Central Asia (EMCA) regional team and will support the USAID/OFDA Program Office in Baghdad as part of the USAID Mission to Iraq.  

OBJECTIVE

The EMCA Regional Team requires the services of a Senior Humanitarian Advisor to be based in Baghdad, Iraq, to ensure that OFDAs objectives for disaster assistance, strategic reporting, interagency coordination, and situational analysis are met.  

9.  CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY

DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

This position requires an individual who is able to reside in Baghdad, and, subject to U.S. security considerations, willing to travel within and outside of Iraq on short notice for up to two-three weeks at a time, or longer, on a regular basis.  The incumbent will serve as the primary contact and liaison for OFDA's ongoing humanitarian assistance activities in Iraq, as well as for other disaster risk reduction and training programs.  The incumbent will work closely with the USAID/Iraq Mission, international organizations (IOs), non governmental organizations (NGOs), the United Nations (UN) and the Multi National Force (MNF) where appropriate, to respond to humanitarian needs and sudden onset disasters. The Senior Humanitarian Advisor, together with OFDAs Program Officer, will be responsible for program analysis, program monitoring, oversight of program implementation, as well as reporting to OFDA Washington, USAIDs Regional Missions, as required, and U.S. Embassy staff. 

The Senior Humanitarian Advisor will serve as the primary point of contact for OFDA implementing partners working in Iraq and will monitor, evaluate and report on OFDA-funded programs while helping to coordinate with other USAID-funded programs.   This position requires substantial coordination with representatives from other USAID offices, the Government of Iraq (GOI), Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRTs), as well as with relevant UN and NGO agencies, therefore requiring a highly collaborative work style.  The Senior Humanitarian Advisor must be prepared to function effectively in a challenging and restrictive work environment and be willing to strictly adhere to U.S. Embassy security guidelines.  

Working under the guidance of USAID/Iraq and the additional guidance and supervision of the Regional Coordinator for EMCA at OFDA/W, the incumbent will:

	Serve as the principal point of contact for OFDA in Iraq for humanitarian issues, and serve as a liaison on program issues, coordinating among the USAID mission, U.S. Embassy, Multi-National Force  Iraq, OFDA/Washington and the overall humanitarian community.
	Lead efforts to identify and assess humanitarian assistance requirements and target beneficiary groups and locations, and existing relief programs, and recommend the types of interventions and budget levels necessary to support OFDAs programs in Iraq. 
	Monitor ongoing programs and the overall humanitarian assistance landscape in Iraq.  Regularly review partners reports, coordinate with OFDA/Washington on issues of mutual interest, and provide coordinated Washington and field feedback to the partners.
	Coordinate closely with OFDA/Washington, the USAID Mission, PRTs, U.S. Embassy in Baghdad, and Multi-National Force - Iraq as well as the UN and NGO agencies working in Iraq.
	Coordinate collection of information and provide updates and recommendations through written reports on issues related to the humanitarian situation, including the following:
o	Capacity and level of activity of indigenous institutions to carry out relief programs;
o	Capacity and ability of UN, IOs, and NGOs to carry out programs;
o	Capacity of the logistics infrastructure to support programs;
o	Security situation of personnel, convoys, and relief operations in general;
o	Impact of GOI activities on humanitarian programs;
o	Contributions by other donors, problems arising from implementation of relief programs, and any other issues that require the attention of OFDA; and
o	Humanitarian coordination issues and any recommendations for change.
	Provide guidance to organizations that are developing proposals for OFDA, based on OFDAs Guidelines for Unsolicited Proposals and Reporting; review concept papers and proposals and provide timely recommendations/comments to OFDA/ Washington.
	Present OFDA perspectives to NGOs, IOs, and UN agencies relating to humanitarian assistance strategies and priorities, including OFDAs approach to humanitarian protection.  Work closely with OFDA/Washington to discuss and understand sectoral priorities.
	Visit OFDA-funded projects on a regular basis, as security permits, and report on a timely basis to OFDA/Washington on the quality of grantees work, noting deficiencies, attributes and evolving operational conditions.  
	Represent U.S. Government (USG) humanitarian interests at national and international meetings and conferences, and facilitate, as requested, travel and briefings for official USG visitors interested in humanitarian issues.
	Maintain regular liaison with UN, NGOs, IOs, the GOI, and other organizations regarding humanitarian activities.
	Maintain regular, close coordination and communication with OFDA/Washington.  
	Contribute to field reports on trends, individual agency programming issues, and topics such as humanitarian protection and coordination.
	Submit situation reports and assessment reports whenever necessary.
	Ability to operate standard field communications equipment; may be required to operate a four-wheel drive, standard shift vehicle in cross-country conditions.

SUPERVISORY RELATIONSHIP:
The Senior Humanitarian Advisor will report directly to the OFDA Regional Coordinator for the Europe, Middle East, and Central Asia Region in Washington.  However, for many activities, the Senior Humanitarian Advisor will coordinate tasks directly with personnel within USAID/Iraq, and in collaboration and consultation with the OFDA Program Officer in Baghdad.  

SUPERVISORY CONTROLS:
Supervisory controls will be minimal.  The Senior Humanitarian Advisor is expected to act independently with minimal direction and will have wide latitude for the exercise of independent judgment.  The EMCA Regional Advisor, presently based in Washington, D.C., will provide direction in terms of broadly defined program goals and objectives.

10.  PHYSICAL DEMANDS

The work is generally sedentary. However, the incumbent should be prepared for a potentially physically demanding environment, which could include the need to evacuate an area on foot or spend lengthy periods of time in body armor.  During site visits, there may be some additional physical exertion including long periods of standing, walking over rough terrain, or carrying of moderately heavy items (less than 50 pounds).  OFDA staff serving in Iraq are strongly encouraged to maintain their physical well being. The USAID compound offers several options including a fitness center and pool. Walking and jogging within the compound is also an option.

11.  WORK ENVIRONMENT

Most work activities take place in an office setting, although a fair amount of work can take place outside of the office, including visits to counterpart offices and project sites in Baghdad, trips to various governorates, as allowed by security, and/or travel to Amman and Washington, D.C., for consultation and meetings with USG and partners.  During site visits, the work may additionally involve special safety and/or security precautions, wearing of protective equipment, and exposure to severe weather conditions.

12.  START DATE:  Immediately, once necessary clearances are obtained.

13.  POINT OF CONTACT:  See Cover Letter.

ATTACHMENT 1

ACQUISITION & ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10
PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY

General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY
(OCTOBER 2006) 

(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16
FAM 116 available at http://www.foia.state.gov/REGS/fams.asp?level=2&id=59&fam=0 .

Note:  personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.

(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES.

(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurers liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).

(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:

(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;

(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and

(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.

(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation.  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.

(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractors invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.

(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individuals behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.

(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.

(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).

<DESC><p>SOLICITATION</p>
<p>AMENDMENT 001- THE FOLLOWING CLARIFICATIONS ARE PROVIDED IN RESPONSE TO VENDOR QUESTIONS, READ BELOW:</p>
<p><span>
<p>QUESTION: Our company is interested in subject solicitation and want to know if Federal Excise Tax should be added to our price quote and if it is applicable to this solicitation.</p>
<p>ANSWER: Although 26 U.S.C. Section 4181 imposes an excise tax on the manufacturer, producer, or importer on the sale of "...shells and cartridges," 26 U.S.C. 4182 provides that "No ... shells and cartridges purchased with funds appropriated for the military department shall be subject to any tax imposed on the sale or transfer of such articles." Thus, it is our opinion that no excise tax is due. Please note that this is the opinion of our in-house legal counsel and is not binding on the Internal Revenue Service. In taking any position with respect to taxes, recommend that you consult your own tax counsel.</p>
<p>THE DATE FOR RECEIPT OF QUOTES IS NOT EXTENDED.</p>

BACKGROUND

The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) is the office within USAID that is responsible for providing non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters.  OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) and is organized into three divisions under the management of the Office of the Director (OD).  The Program Support Division (PS) provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDAs Washington and field offices.  The Disaster Response and Mitigation Division (DRM) is responsible for coordinating with other organizations for the provision of relief supplies and humanitarian assistance.  DRM also devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human caused disaster situations. DRM hires sector specialists to provide technical expertise in assessing the quality of disaster response.  The Operations Division (OPS) develops and manages logistical, operational, and technical support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations.  OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue Teams (SAR), Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs).

INTRODUCTION

Since Fiscal Year 2003, USAID/OFDA has contributed more than $300 million in humanitarian assistance to vulnerable populations in Iraq.  USAID/OFDA-funded activities include direct relief support in the form of the distribution of emergency relief supplies to displaced and vulnerable populations; infrastructure projects to improve the quality of and access to water and sanitation facilities, provide shelter, and expand educational facilities to families of internally displaced persons (IDPs); health projects, including medical provider training, construction and rehabilitation of health facilities, support for mobile medical clinics, and the supply of essential medical equipment; and efforts to improve the employability of IDPs through vocational training. Many USAID/OFDA-funded projects are implemented as income generation mechanisms for IDPs, using IDP labor for their execution. In addition, USAID/OFDA-funded programs include provisions to allow partners to rapidly respond and adapt to emerging needs. Additionally, USAID/OFDA provides assistance to support capacity-building within the government of Iraq.

According to the International Organization for Migration (IOM), more than 2.8 million Iraqis are internally displaced and an additional 2.2 million have sought refuge in neighboring countries. Displacement rates have stabilized in recent months due in part to the sectarian homogenization of communities, districts, and neighborhoods, and an overall decrease in security incidents. Restrictions on movement in many governorates, bans on accepting new IDPs in some areas, and depletion of family resources prevent many Iraqis from leaving insecure or deteriorating areas, thereby also contributing to the low displacement rate.

The Senior Humanitarian Advisor will serve as part of OFDAs Europe, Middle East and Central Asia (EMCA) regional team and will support the USAID/OFDA Program Office in Baghdad as part of the USAID Mission to Iraq.  

OBJECTIVE

The EMCA Regional Team requires the services of a Senior Humanitarian Advisor to be based in Baghdad, Iraq, to ensure that OFDAs objectives for disaster assistance, strategic reporting, interagency coordination, and situational analysis are met.  

9.  CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY

DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

This position requires an individual who is able to reside in Baghdad, and, subject to U.S. security considerations, willing to travel within and outside of Iraq on short notice for up to two-three weeks at a time, or longer, on a regular basis.  The incumbent will serve as the primary contact and liaison for OFDA's ongoing humanitarian assistance activities in Iraq, as well as for other disaster risk reduction and training programs.  The incumbent will work closely with the USAID/Iraq Mission, international organizations (IOs), non governmental organizations (NGOs), the United Nations (UN) and the Multi National Force (MNF) where appropriate, to respond to humanitarian needs and sudden onset disasters. The Senior Humanitarian Advisor, together with OFDAs Program Officer, will be responsible for program analysis, program monitoring, oversight of program implementation, as well as reporting to OFDA Washington, USAIDs Regional Missions, as required, and U.S. Embassy staff. 

The Senior Humanitarian Advisor will serve as the primary point of contact for OFDA implementing partners working in Iraq and will monitor, evaluate and report on OFDA-funded programs while helping to coordinate with other USAID-funded programs.   This position requires substantial coordination with representatives from other USAID offices, the Government of Iraq (GOI), Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRTs), as well as with relevant UN and NGO agencies, therefore requiring a highly collaborative work style.  The Senior Humanitarian Advisor must be prepared to function effectively in a challenging and restrictive work environment and be willing to strictly adhere to U.S. Embassy security guidelines.  

Working under the guidance of USAID/Iraq and the additional guidance and supervision of the Regional Coordinator for EMCA at OFDA/W, the incumbent will:

	Serve as the principal point of contact for OFDA in Iraq for humanitarian issues, and serve as a liaison on program issues, coordinating among the USAID mission, U.S. Embassy, Multi-National Force  Iraq, OFDA/Washington and the overall humanitarian community.
	Lead efforts to identify and assess humanitarian assistance requirements and target beneficiary groups and locations, and existing relief programs, and recommend the types of interventions and budget levels necessary to support OFDAs programs in Iraq. 
	Monitor ongoing programs and the overall humanitarian assistance landscape in Iraq.  Regularly review partners reports, coordinate with OFDA/Washington on issues of mutual interest, and provide coordinated Washington and field feedback to the partners.
	Coordinate closely with OFDA/Washington, the USAID Mission, PRTs, U.S. Embassy in Baghdad, and Multi-National Force - Iraq as well as the UN and NGO agencies working in Iraq.
	Coordinate collection of information and provide updates and recommendations through written reports on issues related to the humanitarian situation, including the following:
o	Capacity and level of activity of indigenous institutions to carry out relief programs;
o	Capacity and ability of UN, IOs, and NGOs to carry out programs;
o	Capacity of the logistics infrastructure to support programs;
o	Security situation of personnel, convoys, and relief operations in general;
o	Impact of GOI activities on humanitarian programs;
o	Contributions by other donors, problems arising from implementation of relief programs, and any other issues that require the attention of OFDA; and
o	Humanitarian coordination issues and any recommendations for change.
	Provide guidance to organizations that are developing proposals for OFDA, based on OFDAs Guidelines for Unsolicited Proposals and Reporting; review concept papers and proposals and provide timely recommendations/comments to OFDA/ Washington.
	Present OFDA perspectives to NGOs, IOs, and UN agencies relating to humanitarian assistance strategies and priorities, including OFDAs approach to humanitarian protection.  Work closely with OFDA/Washington to discuss and understand sectoral priorities.
	Visit OFDA-funded projects on a regular basis, as security permits, and report on a timely basis to OFDA/Washington on the quality of grantees work, noting deficiencies, attributes and evolving operational conditions.  
	Represent U.S. Government (USG) humanitarian interests at national and international meetings and conferences, and facilitate, as requested, travel and briefings for official USG visitors interested in humanitarian issues.
	Maintain regular liaison with UN, NGOs, IOs, the GOI, and other organizations regarding humanitarian activities.
	Maintain regular, close coordination and communication with OFDA/Washington.  
	Contribute to field reports on trends, individual agency programming issues, and topics such as humanitarian protection and coordination.
	Submit situation reports and assessment reports whenever necessary.
	Ability to operate standard field communications equipment; may be required to operate a four-wheel drive, standard shift vehicle in cross-country conditions.

SUPERVISORY RELATIONSHIP:
The Senior Humanitarian Advisor will report directly to the OFDA Regional Coordinator for the Europe, Middle East, and Central Asia Region in Washington.  However, for many activities, the Senior Humanitarian Advisor will coordinate tasks directly with personnel within USAID/Iraq, and in collaboration and consultation with the OFDA Program Officer in Baghdad.  

SUPERVISORY CONTROLS:
Supervisory controls will be minimal.  The Senior Humanitarian Advisor is expected to act independently with minimal direction and will have wide latitude for the exercise of independent judgment.  The EMCA Regional Advisor, presently based in Washington, D.C., will provide direction in terms of broadly defined program goals and objectives.

10.  PHYSICAL DEMANDS

The work is generally sedentary. However, the incumbent should be prepared for a potentially physically demanding environment, which could include the need to evacuate an area on foot or spend lengthy periods of time in body armor.  During site visits, there may be some additional physical exertion including long periods of standing, walking over rough terrain, or carrying of moderately heavy items (less than 50 pounds).  OFDA staff serving in Iraq are strongly encouraged to maintain their physical well being. The USAID compound offers several options including a fitness center and pool. Walking and jogging within the compound is also an option.

11.  WORK ENVIRONMENT

Most work activities take place in an office setting, although a fair amount of work can take place outside of the office, including visits to counterpart offices and project sites in Baghdad, trips to various governorates, as allowed by security, and/or travel to Amman and Washington, D.C., for consultation and meetings with USG and partners.  During site visits, the work may additionally involve special safety and/or security precautions, wearing of protective equipment, and exposure to severe weather conditions.

12.  START DATE:  Immediately, once necessary clearances are obtained.

13.  POINT OF CONTACT:  See Cover Letter.

ATTACHMENT 1

ACQUISITION & ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10
PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY

General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY
(OCTOBER 2006) 

(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16
FAM 116 available at http://www.foia.state.gov/REGS/fams.asp?level=2&id=59&fam=0 .

Note:  personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.

(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES.

(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurers liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).

(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:

(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;

(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and

(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.

(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation.  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.

(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractors invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.

(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individuals behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.

(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.

(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).

<DESC><p>BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT<br />BAA_RV_08_02<br />Air Force Research Laboratory Space Vehicles Directorate
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />ANNOUNCEMENT OVERVIEW</p>
<p>BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT TITLE: Autonomous Space and Ground Systems for Space Superiority</p>
<p>BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT NUMBER: BAA_RV_08_02</p>
<p>CATALOG OF FEDERAL DOMESTIC ASSISTANCE (CFDA) NUMBER(S): 12.800 AIR FORCE DEFENSE RESEARCH SCIENCES PROGRAM and 12.910 RESEARCH AND TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT</p>
<p>BRIEF PROGRAM SUMMARY: <strong>This is a 35 day Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) to solicit research proposals for the United States Air Force Research Laboratory's (AFRL) Spacecraft Component Technology Branch</strong>, which is supporting the advanced decision support and autonomy efforts in Space Situational Awareness (SSA), Command and Control (C2), and Defensive CounterSpace (DCS). The technologies developed under this solicitation will provide affordable and reliable solutions to enable the next generation of Air Force space systems. This effort will require access to classified information up to and including SECRET/NOFORN; therefore, foreign owned firms are precluded from submitting proposals. This acquisition is anticipated to result in multiple awards for contracts or assistance instruments using an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract. The Government anticipates awarding a Cost-Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) completion type contract for Task 1; it will be issued concurrent with the contract award and will constitute the contract's guaranteed minimum order requirement. The anticipated ordering period for individual award(s) resulting from this BAA is up to 48 months in duration with individual task order period of performance ranging from 18 - 48 months.</p>
<p>PROPOSAL DUE DATE AND TIME: This BAA will remain open for a period of 35 days from the date of publication. The due date for proposals submitted in response to this BAA is no later than 12:00 p.m. MST on 19 JANUARY 2009. Proposals received after the due date and time shall be governed by the provisions of FAR 52.215-1(c)(3).</p>
<p>ESTIMATED PROGRAM COST: Anticipated funding for this BAA (not per contract or award) is: FY09-$1.5M; FY10-$1.5M; FY11-$1.4M; FY12-$1.0M. This funding profile is an estimate only and will not be a contractual obligation for funding. All funding is subject to change due to government discretion and availability. All potential offerors should be aware that due to unforeseen budget fluctuations, funding in any or all areas may change with little or no notice.</p>
<p>GENERAL INFORMATION: The applicable NAICS code for this announcement is 541712 with a size standard of 500. This acquisition is unrestricted and is issued under the provisions of Federal Acquisition Regulation paragraph 6.102(d)(2) that provides for the competitive selection of research proposals. Proposals submitted in response to this BAA that are selected for award are considered to be the results of full and open competition and in full compliance with the provisions of PL 98-369, the Competition In Contracting Act of 1984. There will be no other announcement issued for this requirement. Offerors MUST monitor FedBizOps/EPS http://www.fbo.gov and/or Grants.gov/FIND http://www.grants.gov in the event this announcement is amended. Due to past problems with posting notices to Grants.gov/FIND, offerors are advised to monitor both websites to ensure timely receipt of notifications.</p>
<p>TYPE OF CONTRACTS/INSTRUMENTS: The Air Force reserves the right to award the instrument best suited to the nature of research proposed. Accordingly, the Government may award any appropriate contract type under the Federal Acquisition Regulation or Other Transaction (OT) for Prototype, grant, cooperative agreement, or OT for Research. The Air Force may also consider award of an appropriate technology transfer mechanism if applicable. Specific instructions for assistance awards are in paragraph 7 of this BAA. It is anticipated that award under this BAA will be a Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF)/Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) completion contract which requires successful offerors to have an accounting system considered adequate for tracking costs applicable to the contract.</p>
<p>ANTICIPATED NUMBER OF AWARDS: The Air Force anticipates awarding multiple contracts or assistance instruments. However, the Air Force does reserve the right to make one award or no awards pursuant to this BAA.</p>

<SOLNBR>IPAWSISS1208
<RESPDATE>013009
<CONTACT>Sandra K. Bucher, Contracting Officer, Phone (540) 542-2303, Fax (540) 542-2632, Email sandra.bucher@dhs.gov
<DESC>1.0	Purpose:  The Federal Emergency Management Agency is seeking information that will help the Agency define its future contracting approach for providing implementation support services for the Integrated Public Alert and Warning Program (IPAWS).   This Request for Information (RFI) is issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future.   This RFI does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever.   Respondents are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative cost incurred in response to this announcement. Furthermore, those who respond to this RFI should not anticipate feedback with regards to its submission, other than acknowledgement of receipt if requested by the submitter.

2.0     Background: Executive Order (E.O.) 13407, Public Alert and Warning System, dated June 26, 2006, directed the Secretary of Homeland Security, to ensure that under all conditions the President of the United States can alert and warn the American people. FEMA is implementing projects to modernize and integrate the existing Emergency Alert System (EAS) and National Alert and Warning System (NAWAS) programs to provide a national-level all-hazards warning system. Collectively these systems will constitute the Integrated Public Alert and Warning (IPAWS) Program.  IPAWS will utilize current national-level warning systems, support state, territory, tribal, and local warning needs, and integrate new technologies, standards, partnerships, and policies to improve public warning over all media, to all people, at all times, in all situations. Planned projects to be implemented over the next five years include investments in communications infrastructure across the United States. Efforts to support these activities may require collection and analysis of information on legacy alert and warning systems, engineering and specialized technical services, acquisition of hardware and software, site design and construction, installation, testing, integration, delivery and operations and maintenance support. FEMA will use the information received through this RFI to help define the appropriate contractual mechanism for acquisition of IPAWS implementation services.
3.0   Information Requested:  The following questions are intended to help structure a potential acquisition to provide a flexible, cost effective solution to IPAWS implementation. 
1.	FEMA is contemplating award of an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract for these services.  A draft IPAWS Implementation Support Services Statement of Work (SOW) is provided as an attachment to the RFI for this proposed requirement.  Please submit your comments and recommendations to the proposed SOW.   
2.	A service type contract is anticipated and FEMA is interested in adapting a performance based scope for the contract.  What considerations are important when considering performance based contracts for this type of support services? Do you have any recommendations for specific performance incentives that have achieved the desired results on current or previous commercial or government contracts?  What specific progress reporting (such as ANSI 748) would you recommend?
3.	How should the purchase of any required hardware and software be accomplished (e.g., time and material type approach?)?
4.	What are some lessons learned FEMA should consider from other similar contracts with commercial or Government customers youve supported?   What features limited the effectiveness of these contracts? 
4.0     FEMA is also interested in assessing level of interest within the industry for this future support services acquisition.  Interested firms are invited to submit a statement of capability addressing their interest in serving as either a prime or subcontractor for this potential procurement. Therefore, in your response please provide the following information.

4.1	 Demonstrated experience in the following areas:
1.	Design, deployment, integration, test and delivery of emergency alert and warning or similar type systems.
2.	Design and construction of facilities to support operation of alert and warning or similar type systems. 
3.	Operational support of alert and warning or similar systems.
4.	Ability to carry out the services outlined in 1-3 above in a classified environment.
4.2	Certain aspects of the IPAWS are classified.  How is your company positioned to support classified work under this potential procurement, specifically, available personnel with U.S Secret or U.S Top Secret Clearances and an approved Facilities Security Clearance with a level up to Top Secret? Do you have staff to support this effort with appropriate clearances for access to White House facilities?
4.3 	Please provide information on your companys size and capacity including total annual revenues and number of direct employees.
5.0     All small businesses including Small Disadvantaged, HUBZone, Women-Owned and Service Disabled are strongly encouraged to provide timely responses to this RFI. A response to this RFI is necessary in order to assist FEMA in determining the potential levels of interest, adequate competition, and technical capability within the Small Business Community to provide the required services.     In addition, this information will also be used to assist FEMA in establishing a basis for developing any subsequent potential subcontract/small business participation plan small business goal percentages.

6.0     Questions regarding this RFI shall be submitted via e-mail to the FEMA Contracting Officer, Sandra Bucher (see email address below).  No telephone questions will be accepted.     All questions will be answered via posting responses to the FEDBIZOPPS website.     

7.0     Please submit replies by 01/30/09, 1:30 PM/EST.  Email responses are preferred and should be submitted to Sandra.bucher@dhs.gov.  No telephone responses will be accepted.   Please limit replies to 20 pages (including cover page), 8.5 x 11 inch, one-sided, with 1 inch margins and font no smaller than 12 point.  

8.0     Proprietary information and trade secrets, if any, must be clearly marked on the documentation submitted.  All information received that is marked Proprietary will be handled accordingly.  Please be advised that all submissions become Government property and will not be returned.  The Government shall not be held liable for any damages incurred if proprietary information is not properly identified.

<DESC>The following changes are made to the Synopsis:
The 5th sentence of the synopsis is changed to read: ".  To meet the goals of the modernization program, the Maritime Administration will contract for services to evaluate various niche market opportunities, perform programming and planning, devise and manage multiple interrelated schedules, coordinate with the community, obtain environmental permits and records of decision, manage design and construction activities, direct and oversee contractor activities, interface with the major stakeholders, acquire Port Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) and security equipment and services, and maintain budgets and program progress. 
The following sentence is inserted between the 5th and 6th sentences of the synopsis: "Oversight and monitoring of contractor performance and compliance shall be accomplished by the Maritime Administration staff in consultation with PAG staff."
REVISION TO THE SCOPE OF WORKFOR THE PORT OF GUAMIMPROVEMENT ENTERPRISE PROGRAM 
Part 1 - OVERVIEW - The Jose D. Leon Guerrero Commercial Port is a vital asset to the economy of Guam and to the national security of the United States.  The Port was originally constructed by the U.S. Navy in the 1960's and was turned over to the Government of Guam in the 1970's.  Since that time, the Port has remained largely unchanged and requires substantial improvements in order to continue providing the level of service required by the community and other stakeholders.  Further, the timely completion of this improvement program is necessary in order to provide modern and efficient transportation access to the island of Guam and to the region to meet the Department of Defense requirements for the Guam build-up.
The Port Authority of Guam has recently completed a Master Plan which is currently under consideration by the Guam Legislature.  Additionally, the Government of Guam has just entered into an agreement with the U.S. Department of Transportation, Maritime Administration to facilitate the expansion and modernization of the Jose D. Leon Guerrero Commercial Port.  
One of the key critical first steps is the acquisition of a Program Management Team (PMT) to oversee the entire project from initiation to completion.  Part 2 - BACKGROUND - The Port Authority of Guam (PAG) is planning and conducting a variety of modernization activities to enhance the transportation of goods and people within the Territory of Guam and to improve and expand needed services to its citizens and the military.  Potential modernization activities are scheduled to occur over approximately the next ten years using Federal, non-federal, and private funds administered by the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) Maritime Administration.  Expansion objectives include, but are not limited to:"	Expansion of commercial dock space,"	Providing facilities necessary to support rapid military deployment from western pacific military bases,"	Additional bulk and break-bulk capacity,"	New Gate Processing System,"	New Terminal Information Technology Systems,"	Warehouse demolition,"	Utility improvements,"	Road connections to Commercial Port,"	Improved terminal operations, layout, and traffic flow, and"	Acquisition, installation, and operation of security equipment and services.The Maritime Administration, working with the PAG intends to initiate implementation of this expansion program through multiple projects to accomplish multiple goals in a relatively short time period.  To meet the goals of the modernization program, the Maritime Administration will contract for services to evaluate various niche market opportunities, perform programming and planning, devise and manage multiple interrelated schedules, coordinate with the community, obtain environmental permits and records of decision, manage design and construction activities, direct and oversee contractor activities, interface with the major stakeholders, acquire Port Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) and security equipment and services, and maintain budgets and program progress.  Oversight and monitoring of contractor performance and compliance shall be accomplished by the Maritime Administration staff in consultation with PAG staff.  Accomplishment of all of these activities within a finite timeframe represents a significant challenge for the Maritime Administration and PAG.
Part 3 - OBJECTIVE.  To meet this challenge, a Contract is required for program management, environmental support, engineering and design services, and construction management for the duration of the modernization and expansion process.  The objective of this contract scope of work is to provide the contractual framework that addresses specific management needs while also providing contractual and technical flexibility to address a range of services that may be required.  This contract scope of work defines the types of services to be provided through an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contract under which individual task orders (TOs) can be issued as needed. 
Part 4 - SERVICES.  4.1 The contractor will provide technical management, and staff augmentation support services, as directed by TOs, for the duration of the project.

<a href="mailto:Honegger.Harold@epamail.epa.gov">U.S. Environmental Protection Agency</a>
<DESC>NAICS Code: 541620   Title: Project to Synthesize Climate Change Impacts and Scope Adaptation Planning and Management Options for the U.S. Southeast
The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Office of Acquisition Management, intends to award a purchase order for a project to synthesize climate change impacts and scope adaptation planning and management options for the U.S. Southeast.  The Southeastern United States (defined initially for this project as the eight states of EPA Region 4-Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Tennessee) is predicted to experience significant and potentially highly costly climate change impacts.  A window of opportunity exists for these states to "get in front" of the impacts curve, minimizing long-term damage and cost while maximizing welfare for the citizens of the U.S. Southeast.
In order to determine if this procurement can be set aside for small businesses, any small businesses who feel they are capable of performing this statement of work should submit their capabilities and experiences in relation to this scope of work to honegger.harold@epa.gov prior to December 28, 2008.
The primary purpose of this project is to begin to create the conditions for success for the U.S. Southeast on climate change adaptation, by synthesizing impacts, scoping adaptation planning and management options, and bringing together practitioners and principals to assess and develop these options.  In so doing, adaptation efforts in the Southeast will be greatly aided and the planning and management lessons learned from the project will be available to be applied in other parts of the country.
The scope of work related to this project will involve five distinct phases, with each building upon the phase before it.  These phases are outlined below:
Phase I - A draft background paper will synthesize existing literature on the impacts of climate change on the Southeast.
Phase II - A second draft background paper, informed by the first paper, will analyze and outline the challenges and options for adaptation planning and management in the Southeast.
Phase III - A three-month feedback and planning period, during which the draft background papers will be distributed for comments and suggestions in conjunction with identifying Southeast adaptation principals and practitioners across sectors.  Using this information, a planning process will take place to determine the optimal size, location, and invited participants for a gathering of adaptation principals and practitioners later in the year.  That is, the feedback and comments that are received on the background papers, as well as the information from the identification process, should be used to design the gathering.  At the end of this phase, final background papers, a final agenda for the gathering, and a final list of participants will be developed.
Phase IV - A gathering of principals and practitioners.  The structure of this meeting will be determined based on responses to draft background papers and other discussions, to include assessment and development of options for adaptation planning and management in the Southeast United States.
Phase V - A project summary report will be produced, which will allow both the distribution of the dialogue and lessons learned from the project as well as the informing of potential future efforts like this one across the country.
The Statement of Work (SOW) for this project can be found on the web at http://www.epa.gov/oamhpod1/adm_placement/sapcbd/climate.htm.  A Request for Quotes (RFQ) will also be posted to the same website sometime after 28 December 2008.  All interested firms should visit the above mentioned website to review the statement of work for this project to determine if they are capable of performing the statement of work and to download the RFQ once it is available.
Telephone calls will not be accepted or acknowledged.  All questions should be sent via email to honegger.harold@epa.gov.
