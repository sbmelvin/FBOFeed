She was involved in all aspects of the study including study design, planning, direction and sample collection and analysis.  This dataset cannot be duplicated.  No one else has been as closely involved and has the understanding of these data than Ms. Matsui.  It would be in the best interest of the government, both technically and economically, to award this contract to Ms. Matsui.   THIS NOTICE IS FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY.

These kits will provide guided-weapon capability for a modified warhead, the BLU-113 P3I, which will be procured separately.

The scope of the effort shall include evaluation and assessment of the BLU-113 P3I throughout design, development and test to ensure interoperability with the GBU-28 B/B kits and to minimize SEEK EAGLE certification costs. This effort includes hardware modifications to the GBU-28 B/B to accommodate a modified nose shape, a slightly longer BLU-113 with slightly increased diameter, reduced cost telemetry kit redesign, future in-flight fuze reprogramming capability and the production of up to 350 guidance and tail kits.

<DESC>The Air Force Center for Environmental Excellence (AFCEE), Brooks City-Base TX, is in the process of determining the acquisition strategy for the follow-on to its Global Engineering, Integration & Technical Assistance (GEITA) contracts, entitled ‘GEITA05’.  The team solicits your comments to the attached questions.  We would greatly appreciate any feedback that industry has to offer.  This announcement is not a formal solicitation and is not a request for proposal. Formal solicitations will be announced at a later date. This RFI is for planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government. The current GEITA statement of work (SOW) will define the scope of actions that may be carried out under task orders at various locations (primarily U.S. Air Force installations) worldwide. The SOW is intended to encompass the entire range of advisory and assistance services (A&AS) for all AFCEE components in a worldwide manner regarding technical complexity, breadth and depth of coverage, disciplines, domains, programs, projects, and with maximum geographic application in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements.  The value of this program is estimated to be $300 Million with a possibility to increase to $750 Million.  We anticipate awarding multiple Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts, approximately four (two full and open and two small business set aside) using NAIC’s Code 541620.

<DESC>Solicitation Notice:  This requirement is for the procurement of a construction firm to provide all supervision, labor, materials and equipment necessary for the Alterations and Building Upgrade of the Norris Cotton Federal Building, Manchester, NH.  The facility is a seven story building over two basement parking levels, with a total of 14,325 square meters.  The building exterior façade is constructed of granite and insulated aluminum panels with small operable windows.  The work includes but is not limited to demolition; alterations; installation and commissioning of new roof; replacement of windows with a new curtain wall system; new entrance; finishes, HVAC systems, power distribution, lighting, telephone and data components, lightning protection, fire protection, energy management systems, fire alarm; asbestos abatement, and tenant space fit-up.  The project will be completed in two phases to accommodate a partial occupancy by the government during construction, with disruptive work being performed after normal business hours. This project includes options, which will be evaluated as part of the award.  The contract performance period is 36 months.

The successful firm must have previous experience with similar size and scope of construction projects with particular emphasis on phased occupied renovations & alterations.  GSA has defined similar size and scope to be: renovation of an occupied office building (Governmental, Courthouse, or Institutional) of approximately $10 million dollars or more and/or phased construction renovation projects in occupied buildings of approximately $10 million dollars or more. The contractor's personnel will be required to obtain security clearances prior to working on this project.  This project is designed using metric units and the estimated cost is more than ten million dollars ($10,000,000).  Award will be a firm fixed price contract and the procurement method will be a competitive negotiated Request for Proposal (RFP). Source Selection Procedures as identified in FAR PART 15.3 will be utilized in the selection of a firm offering the “best value” to the Government in terms of price and technical merit,  and whose performance is expected to best meet stated Government requirements. Accordingly, offerors will be evaluated based on technical merit with respect to demonstrated successful past performance, qualified/experienced personnel, management plan/technical approach,  subcontracting opportunities, and on their price proposals.   

The acquisition process shall consist of five phases: Phase 1- receipt and evaluation of technical proposals utilizing a draft RFP with the technical evaluation factors. Phase 2 - development of an advisory short list based on technical qualifications/proposals of the most technically qualified firms. In this stage, GSA will advise each respondent that participates in Phase 1, in writing, as to whether or not they will be invited to participate in Phase 3, or that they are unlikely to be a viable competitor. GSA will advise the responding firms considered not to be viable competitors, and the basis of GSA's opinion. GSA will inform all respondents that not withstanding the advice provided by GSA in response to their submission in Phase 1, they may participate in Phase 3. Phase 3- receipt and evaluation of price proposals based on 100% construction documents (a competitive range will then be developed by the Contracting Officer). Phase 4 - oral presentations and interviews of firms in the competitive range. Phase 5 negotiations and receipt and evaluation of final offers. Upon receipt and evaluation of all technical and price proposals, a formal selection of a firm will be made that offers the greatest value to the Government based on a combination of technical evaluation and price factors. Failure of offerors to submit a technical offer during Phase 1 will preclude further participation on this acquisition. For this procurement, technical evaluation factors are equal to price related factors. The Government has reserved the right to make an award at completion of Phase 4. The technical factors for the evaluation process are, in descending order of importance: 
1. Past Performance, 
2. Management and technical approach to completing
    phased/building occupied construction projects.
3  Qualifications and Experience of Key Personnel.
4. Subcontracting Plan including management control, quality 
    assurance, coordination and small business category goals.

The NAICS code applicable to this project is 236320 (SIC Code 1542), Size standard is $28.5 million.  This procurement is being conducted on an unrestricted basis in accordance with the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program. This announcement also constitutes the synopsis of the pre-invitation notice.

PART I   INTRODUCTION


				
The Campus Challenge problem solving competition is an effort sponsored by the Air Force Research Laboratory’s Munitions Directorate.  The purpose of the competition is to solicit innovative, potentially paradigm-shifting ideas that have the potential, upon maturity, to successfully address specific real-world problems of interest to the Air Force research community.  This is accomplished through direct competition, ultimately among a small number of participants.  Campus Challenge is a recurring event that could feature a different selection of participants each time.  But the charter will always be the same—a challenge to match wits in devising solutions to real problems through the advent of new technology.

This is the Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) of the Air Force Research Laboratory Munitions Directorate (AFRL/MN) under the provisions of paragraph 6.102(d)(2) of the Federal Acquisition Regulation that provides for the competitive selection of research proposals. Proposals submitted in response to this BAA that are selected for award are considered to be the results of full and open competition and in full compliance with the provisions of PL 98-369, the Competition in Contracting Act of 1984. For purposes of this announcement, research is defined to be scientific study and experimentation directed at increasing knowledge and understanding in relation to long term national security needs. It is an enhancement to related exploratory and advanced development programs. 

PART II   RESEARCH PROBLEM STATEMENT

COMPACT ENERGY SOURCE MANAGEMENT FOR MUNITIONS APPLICATIONS

The Munitions Directorate is developing systems with electrical requirements that can exceed the energy and power densities of known compact power sources, both on a volumetric and gravimetric basis.  The Directorate’s immediate applications for compact power sources include electric propulsion for loitering platforms including unmanned aerial vehicles, battlefield sensors, autonomous terrestrial micro-robots, and burrowing devices.  In these cases, electrical loads are pushing the present capacity of conventional sources that power sensors, artificial intelligence systems, telemetry systems, navigation and guidance systems, propulsion/locomotion systems, fuzing systems, and unconventional payloads.  These electrical-based systems are a key element of the Air Force’s present and future technological advantage, with weapon and system miniaturization requirements leading the need for more compact – though highly energetic – power sources with discharge durations ranging from tens of minutes to months.  Aside from the nominal evolutionary advances in cell chemistries and construction techniques that provide performance gains that are typically tens of percent per design cycle, the Directorate seeks revolutionary advances in net energy performance from a compact power source that can advance the state-of-the-art by a factor of ten when compared to commercial units; the energetic goal is thus to meet either ~5kWhr/kg or ~10kWhr/L including energy source or harvesting mechanism, conversion technique(s) and integrated, intermediate storage if necessary. This is to be evidenced by the experimental performance of a prototype compact power source in the standard size and profile of a commercial cell; examples of such are the "AA," "AAA," "C," or "D" cell sizes.  The candidate technologies of interest are not restricted to those normally defined as "batteries" but must nonetheless be totally self-contained in one of these typical cell sizes (or comparable volumes), have a shelf life of at least 5 years, pose no unmanageable health or environmental hazard, be thermally stable under load ranges from short circuit to open circuit, and have a nominal terminal voltage of at least 1VDC and a minimum sustainable terminal current of at least 1mA/cc for the life of the cell. Candidate units with enhanced pulsed-power capabilities, energy harvesting mechanisms and rechargeable characteristics are welcomed.  Overall, a tenfold-increase in practical performance as a power source for a munitions-related application is the metric of prime importance. 
 
The physical theory, engineering design, anticipated lifetime, energetic performance, operational regime, and environmental impact of the alternative compact power source are among the specific items of interest.   The Directorate is not restricting technologies based on estimated costs of production.  


PART III CAMPUS CHALLENGE PROCEDURES


PHASE I LETTERS OF INTENT AND WHITE PAPERS 

This competition will be divided into two phases.   Phase I will culminate with the selection of two white papers.  The white paper is the most important factor in the Phase I competition.  It should be specific and complete.  While it is realized all of the technical factors cannot be addressed in advance, the following should be included and emphasized accordingly:

(1)	Demonstrate a thorough understanding of the Problem requirements.

(2)	Describe the proposed technical approaches to comply with the requirements specified in the Problem.

(3)	 Particular emphasis should be directed toward identifying existing or emerging technologies that may be used singularly or in combination to provide an innovative means to solve the Problem.  All technologies or suggested approaches should be available for advanced or system-level development by the Air Force within 8 to 12 years or sooner after completion of this competition given the investment criteria discussed below under the paragraph entitled PHASE II – PROPOSAL SUBMISSIONS, AWARDS, DELIVERY OF DEVELOPMENT PLANS.

All participants intending to submit a white paper should first submit a letter of intent with a maximum length of one page to the AFRL/MNK address below not later than 31 Mar 04.  The letter should include a one-page synopsis of the proposed idea.  These synopses will be reviewed, and no more than ten participants will be asked to submit a follow-up white paper.  The criteria for this initial down select will be technological innovation and likelihood of successful system-level development within a nominal 8 to 12 year timeframe, as evaluated by the Air Force.  The participants representing the down selected synopses will be informed and invited to attend a meeting to be held at or near Eglin AFB, FL to discuss the problem and the competition requirements in greater detail prior to their submission of white papers.

All students (undergraduate or graduate) and faculty of universities are eligible and encouraged to participate.  The goal is to produce the best possible solution to the stated problem regardless of who participates.  Participation from industry, and various schools and departments within Universities is encouraged.  However, only one letter of intent per university or industry should be submitted.  The anticipated date for the down selection decision and request for white papers from the ten selected participants is 31 May 04. The anticipated date for submission of white papers to AFRL/MNK is 31 Dec 04.  The white paper shall be limited to 10 pages or less, including title page, narrative, tables, figures, and references.  The typewritten pages shall be double spaced, and typeset shall be no smaller than 10pt.  Standard 8.5’"x 11.0" paper shall be used.  The title page may be of a thicker stock than the ensuing pages.  Ten copies of the white paper shall be submitted; each must bear the signatures, names and departments of those persons who actively participated.  No Air Force funding is available for preparation of the white papers.  Submit white papers to the following address:  Air Force Research Laboratory Munitions Directorate Contracting Division, AFRL/MNK, Attn: Ms. Donna Moran or Mr. Mark Fitzgerald, 101 West Eglin Boulevard, Suite 337, Eglin AFB FL  32542-6810.  


BASIS FOR EVALUATION OF FINAL 10 WHITE PAPERS  

The evaluation team will be composed of Air Force officers and senior civilians.  Each member of this team will have an advanced technical degree at the masters or doctorate level.   This team may call upon other Air Force resources for analysis, evaluation, modeling, or costing expertise.  Two white papers will be selected as Phase I winners.  The two winning white papers will be those that offer the highest probability of solving the Problem according to the weighted evaluation factors presented below.  All decisions made by the Air Force evaluation team shall be final.  The factors for evaluation of the submitted white papers shall be the following in descending order of importance: (1) Feasibility, (2) Innovation, (3) Cost to Develop, (4) Time to Develop, and (4) Likelihood of Ultimate Adoption/Acceptance by the Air Force munitions research community.  All proprietary technology or data, whether in a white paper or in a follow-up development plan, should be clearly labeled.

PHASE II – PROPOSAL SUBMISSIONS, AWARDS, DELIVERY OF DEVELOPMENT PLANS

The two winners of the Phase I white paper competition will be asked to submit proposals describing how they will develop the ideas presented in their respective white papers.   The anticipated date for the Government's request for proposals is 28 Feb 05, with proposals from the Phase I winners due 31 Mar 05.  Two awards will be issued—one to each Phase I white paper winner.  The estimated amount for each award is not less than $150,000.  For technical and cost proposal preparation instructions, see Part III.

Approximately eight months after receipt of this award, each participant shall deliver a well-structured development plan.  These development plans shall, as a minimum, consist of a technology investment roadmap, a development and transition schedule, and a detailed cost estimate.  Their purpose shall be to provide the Air Force with a comprehensive strategy whereby the least amount of Government dollars can be best invested to provide all of the technologies necessary to realize the Problem solution within a nominal 8 to 12 year development period. Emphasis shall be placed on developing technologies with a high likelihood of successful transition to Air Force systems at the end of this period.  Hence, an investment roadmap that merely recommends extended research grants would be unacceptable.  The development plans shall include specific suggestions as to domestic technology vendors. Emphasis should be placed in two areas.  The first is the innovative application of emerging technologies to solve the Problem.  The second area of emphasis should be placed on describing a transition strategy that moves a technology from laboratory experiment to a systems level power source.  These power sources should be at a level of maturity so that the Air Force can begin to integrate them into actual sub-system or prototype demonstrations at the end of the 8-12 year period, if not sooner.  The intent is to accomplish this technology development for a potential aggregate investment of between $4M and $6M total over the 8 to 12 year period.  The Air Force will reserve the right to accept, reject, or modify some or all of the recommendations presented in either or both development plans and is under no obligation to provide further funds.  These development plans shall be delivered to the Munitions Directorate within approximately eight months of the winning participants receiving their Air Force awards. More specific requirements for these development plans shall be forwarded to the two Phase I winners once they have been chosen.    The Air Force will ultimately evaluate each of these two development plans and determine an overall (Phase II) competition winner.  The overall winner will be notified, and will be presented the "Okaloosa Sword."   				

BASIS FOR EVALUATION OF DEVELOPMENT PLANS

The evaluation team will be the same or similar to the one used to evaluate the Phase I white papers.  The team will evaluate both Phase II development plans using the following factors in descending order of importance:  feasibility, technology maturity, transition strategy, and Air Force investment cost.  For purposes of this competition, feasibility is the Air Force assessment of the probability that the proposed solution will be successful.  Technology maturity is the Air Force assessment of the degree of investment risk associated with a particular technology.  Transition strategy is the step-by-step process that will logically mature a technology to the point that it becomes a viable component within a larger system.  Investment cost is the total Air Force funding on a year-to-year basis that would be required to provide the requisite mature technology and to transition it to the point that it could be successfully demonstrated at the integrated system level.  The winning development plan will be the one that clearly and simply provides the more credible, preferably less expensive, means to arrive at an effective solution to the problem for one or more munitions applications.   It should be noted that tangible, proof-of-concept demonstrations that serve to verify a competitor’s overall concept are encouraged as an adjunct to the development plan.  These successful technology demonstrations would enhance the Air Force's confidence in the feasibility of a given approach.  All decisions made by the Air Force evaluation team shall be final.

<DESC>THIS SOLICITATION IS ISSUED ON AN UNRESTRICTED BASIS, INVITING FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION.  The project involves all labor, material, transportation, equipment and supervision for the design and construction of a Passenger Terminal.  These facilities shall contain shops, ground electronics, air cargo storage, arresting gear, passenger terminal, and administrative spaces.  The approximate size of the Passenger Terminal is 1,226 square meters.  Type of construction is masonry, single story building with standing seam metal roof on pier foundation.  The total estimated value of this acquisition is between $3,000,000 and $3,800,000.  The design and construction requires completion in approximately 365 days.  Proposals will be evaluated using two—phase source selection procedures that will result in award of a firm-fixed price design/build contract to the responsible proposer whose proposal, conforming to the solicitation, is the BEST VALUE to the Government, price and technical factors considered.  Phase I of the procurement process is a narrowing phase to a maximum of five offerors, design-build firms or teams, based on design-build factors that include: Past Performance, Small Business Subcontracting Effort, Technical Qualifications, and Management Approach.  Only those offerors selected in Phase I will be allowed to proceed into Phase II.  In Phase II, the competitive field will be required to submit technical and price proposals for the project.  The price proposal will be a lump sum price for the project, and may include the evaluation of scope-design options within the Governments published budget for award. The Phase II Technical Factors include Past Performance, Small Business Subcontracting Effort, Technical Qualifications of Key Personnel and Technical Solution.  The Government reserves the right to-reject any or all proposals at any time prior to award; negotiate with any or all offerors; award the contract to other than the offeror submitting the lowest total price; award to other than the offeror submitting the highest technically rated proposal; and award to the offeror submitting the proposal determined by the Government to be the most advantageous BEST VALUE to the Government. PROPOSERS ARE ADVISED THAT THE GOVERNMENT INTENDS TO EVUALUATE PROPOSALS AND AWARD WITHOUT DISCUSSIONS OR ANY CONTACT CONCERNING THE PROPOSALS RECEIVED.  Therefore, proposals should be submitted initially on the most FAVORABLE terms. Proposers should not assume that they would be contacted or afforded an opportunity to qualify, discuss, or revise their proposals. FIRMS SUBMITTING TECHNICAL AND PRICE PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE COMPENSATED FOR SPECIFICATIONS OR DOCUMENTATION.

<DESC>THIS SOLICITATION IS BEING ADVERTISED AS ONE SOLICITATION RESULTING IN THE AWARD OF UP TO FOUR SEPARATE INDEFINITE DELIVERY INDEFINITE QUANTITY, IDIQ, DESIGN-BUILD CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTS OF WHICH ONE MAY POTENTIALLY BE AWARDED TO A SUCCESSFUL 8A OR HUBZONE FIRM AND THE OTHER THREE ARE INTENDED TO BE UNRESTRICTED. The Solicitation Number is N62467-04-R-0095. The NAICS Code for this Solicitation is 236220-Commercial and Institutional Building Construction. The Size Standard is $28,500,000. Work covers general building type projects, new construction and renovations, including but not limited to, administrative, aircraft support facilities, industrial buildings, marine construction, mechanical and electrical improvements, civil construction, grading, drainage, and sewage, potable water – storage and transmission, training, dormitory, family housing renovation, community support type facilities, and maintenance for the Resident Officer in Charge of Construction Fort Worth, TX, area of responsibility. The work will be at the following primary locations-Naval Air Station-Joint Reserve Base Fort Worth, TX, outlying reserve stations throughout eastern and central Texas.   Proposers will be evaluated using the Two-Phase Design-Build, Request for Proposal, RFP, procedures that result in awards based on Best Value to the Government, price and other factors considered. It is the intent of the Government to award up to four contracts.  Each contract is for one year with four option years. The anticipated workload is $1-$10 million over the life of the four contracts, and the maximum combined value of all contracts will not exceed $30 million. Projects will vary in size from around $50,000 to $3 million with the average project in the $500,000 - $1.5 million range. One contract will be awarded with a seed project, and the remaining with a minimum guarantee of $25,000 each.  The seed project is JOINT RESERVES POLICE STATION, NAS-JRB FORT WORTH, TX.  The estimated range for the seed project is between $2,150,000 and $2,650,000.  This procurement will include a potential award for one 8a eligible or one HUBZone eligible firm. These firms will be required to be rated as at least Acceptable in Phase I in order to proceed to Phase II. If an 8a or HUBZone firm is not able to meet the requirements to make them Acceptable in Phase I, the solicitation will be reverted to Unrestricted and awarded as such. The successful offerors will be expected to submit technical and price proposals on all future task orders. Lack of participation may result in the Government not exercising the option for extending the contract. Participation in Pre-Proposal Conferences or Site Visits for the initial award or any task orders is the responsibility of the offeror and is not directly reimbursable by the Government. Task orders may require multi-disciplined design services in all aspects of general building construction for new and renovation projects including comprehensive interior design, lead and asbestos abatement. Projects may also require incorporation of sustainable features. Multiple design teams may be proposed to satisfy a variety of building types projected to be awarded during the term of the contract. All professional disciplines shall be registered and-or certified in their discipline. In those states requiring specialized knowledge of local permitting or regulatory agency requirements, the professional discipline shall be registered or certified in that state. Phase I of the procurement process is a narrowing phase up to a maximum of seven proposers, design-build teams, based on design-build factors that include: Past Performance, Small Business Subcontracting Effort, Technical Qualifications-including proposed subcontractors, and Management Approach. Phase I Design-Build Factors relate to the five year IDIQ contract requirements for general building type projects-new construction and renovation-including, but not limited to administrative, aircraft support facility, industrial buildings, marine construction, mechanical, electrical improvements, civil construction, grading, drainage, sewage, potable water-storage, transmission, training, dormitory, family housing renovation and community support type facilities. Only those proposers selected in Phase I will be allowed to proceed into Phase II. An 8a or HUBZone firm, only 1, that receives at least an Acceptable overall rating in Phase I will automatically receive a contract award in Phase II. If more than one 8a or HUBZONE firm receives at least an overall rating of Acceptable in Phase I, the 8a or HUBZone firm with the highest rating will receive the award in Phase II. This successful 8a or HUBZone contractor will compete on the seed projects and all future task orders. If the successful 8a or HUBZone contractor does not receive award of a task order over the life of the contract, a project with a value of under $3 million will be negotiated on a sole source basis with this contractor to meet the minimum guarantee portion of the contract. In Phase II, a maximum of seven Phase I offerors will be allowed to submit technical and price proposals. Offerors who fail to submit technical and price proposals will not be considered for an award. The Phase II technical proposal will require preparation of a limited design solution, Small Business Subcontracting Effort, and other factors that define the quality of construction. Price proposals may include total price or evaluation of scope-design options with the Government’s published budget for award. The offeror with the best value proposal, for each seed project, if there is more than one, will be awarded the seed project under one of the IDIQ design-build contracts. An offeror may be awarded more than one seed project. All contractors awarded an IDIQ contract under Phase II will compete on subsequent task orders. Each awarded task order will indicate a specific completion date and associated liquidated damages. Subsequent task orders may be awarded on either the best value continuum or low price, technically acceptable. If the government decides to issue the task order as a best value, award factors may vary depending on the unique requirements for each task order. Should one of the IDIQ contractors be unable to competitively secure a task order to meet the minimum guarantee, then the Government reserves the right to negotiate a task order with only that offeror. The Government reserves the right to reject any or all proposals at any time prior to award; to negotiate with any or all offerors; to award the contract to other than the offeror submitting the lowest total price; and to award to other than the offeror submitting the highest technically rated proposal; and to award to the offeror submitting the proposal determined by the Government to be the most advantageous BEST VALUE to the Government. OFFERORS WILL BE ADVISED AN AWARD MAY BE MADE IN PHASE II, WITHOUT DISCUSSION OR ANY CONTACT CONCERNING THE PROPOSALS RECEIVED. Phase II proposals will be requested initially on the most favorable price and technical terms. Offerors should not assume that they will be contacted or afforded an opportunity to qualify, discuss, or revise their proposals. However, the Government reserves the right to clarify certain aspects of proposals or conduct discussions providing an opportunity for the offeror to revise its proposal. Firms submitting technical and price proposals will not be compensated for specifications or documentation. The Government intends to issue the solicitation on the WEB only. Phase I will be issued on or about 11 February 2004 with Phase I Proposals will due on or about 15 March 2004. Phase II will be issued at a later date.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 334511. The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center, San Diego intends to award an indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity type contract with cost plus fixed fee pricing to Lockheed Martin Perry Technologies at 100 East 17th Street, Riviera Beach, Florida. The procurement will be conducted using other than full and open competition pursuant to FAR 6.302-1. The proposed contract will initially consist of a two year base ordering period for the purchase of two Unmanned Underwater Vehicle (UUV) systems and the testing and evaluation of the two UUV systems. These systems will provide a capability to evaluate ship berthing areas, piers, and ship hulls for explosives or weapons of mass destruction while reducing manpower requirements and risks. Additionally, there will be a two year option period for the purchase of up to 10 more UUV systems and life cycle support for the UUV systems, and eight one year options for additional life cycle support of the UUV systems purchased. The total contract length, if all options are exercised, will be 12 years. The UUV systems have been developed over the past 7 years by Lockheed Martin Perry Technologies with sponsorship from Office of Naval Research for RDT&E efforts to support improvements in Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) and littoral mine warfare operations.  This UUV system is configured in a manner to enable precise maneuvering and hovering capabilities with upward looking sensors required for hull inspections.  They are small enough for two person operations from small craft of opportunity and are equipped with protection for thrusters to prevent fouling from kelp and seaweed when operating under hulls and around pilings.  Only the Lockheed Martin Perry Technologies UUV system contains these necessary operational and performance characteristics. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. See numbered notes 22 and 26.

Solum, 321-867-0299, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Kennedy Space Center, Mail Code OP-ES, KSC, FL 32899.    The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) at the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) is requesting proposals from universities and non-profit organizations for the development of virtual instruments to be included in NASA’s Learning Technologies Virtual Lab project.  The Virtual Lab project seeks to provide students an engaging free program that closely simulates actual handling of sophisticated instruments and provide teachers a tool that can easily adapt to their curriculum. To download the existing Virtual Lab software, contact Berta Alfonso at Berta.A.Alfonso@nasa.gov.  This version contains one instrument, the Scanning Electron Microscope.  This Scanning Electron Microscope is an excellent example of a completed virtual instrument.  Universities and non-profit organizations are invited to send proposals to KSC by March 1, 2004.  Development of these virtual instruments must be completed by September 2005 and adhere to the requirements below.	Requirements for all instruments: 1.	 All instruments shall provide a separate text file containing descriptive information such as the name of the instrument, a description of what it provides, and a list of sciences/applications where it is used.   2. All instruments shall provide a separate 3D graphical representation file to be used by the Virtual Lab program to display the instrument on the Virtual Lab’s workbench.  The file format will be 3D Studio Max.  (The Virtual Lab program is an existing Java 3D program depicting a building where the instruments are housed.) 3.   All instruments shall provide information (video, pictures, and/or text/links), callable from within the instrument software, on the instrument’s use in science and in particular at NASA.  The NASA technical representative will provide NASA specific content. 4.

This description should break down the main pieces of the instrument and the function that each provides to achieve the instrument’s purpose. 5.      All instruments shall provide career information, callable from within the instrument software, about the scientists and engineers that use the instruments. 6. All instruments shall provide information (video, pictures, and/or literature/links), callable from within the instrument software, about any specimen/sample preparations and/or hook-up that is needed prior to use.   7.     All instruments shall provide a print capability. 8.	  All instruments shall provide a help menu. 9.   All instruments shall provide a sample guided activity text file. 10.   The guided activity for all instruments shall be separate and independent of the instrument program and provide an example of a possible educational use of the instrument paired with a particular specimen. 11.       All instruments shall display the result of all modeled controls (dials, knobs, parameters, etc.) to create an interactive exploratory environment that simulates the use of the controls of the actual instrument.  The goal here is to achieve as much realism as possible, giving the user the sense of operating the actual instrument. 12. All instrument software shall be written in Java. 13.   Instrument software shall be able to be distributed freely without royalties or the purchase of any license. 14.

<DESC>Bechtel SAIC Company, LLC (BSC) herein known as the Buyer, intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) to provide the services described below to prequalified bidders only.  To be deemed prequalified to bid on the RFP, potential bidders must respond affirmatively to the "Prequalification Criteria" section, questions (1) and (2) addressing specific areas of expertise.  Further, potential bidders must respond affirmatively to Prequalification question three (3) or provide a written commitment to obtain an ASME N stamp for Section III, Class 2 as described therein. 

Summary Scope of Work:

The scope of work (SOW) for this Purchase Order will include the design, material procurement, fabrication, testing, and shipment of three prototype waste packages in accordance with ASME Code.  Only one prototype waste package will be awarded to each of the top three qualified bidders.  The ultimate purpose of the waste packages is to dispose of spent nuclear fuel in an underground repository.

The three prototype waste packages are of the same design.  The details of the prototype waste package are illustrated on page 5 of the complete solicitation, which can be found on the Internet at: http://www.bscupdate.com/supplier_subcontractor/prequal.html
and are listed below:  

1. The prototype waste package length is 200 inches, and the outer diameter is 65 inches and it weighs approximately 60,000 pounds.

2. The prototype waste package is composed of an outer corrosion barrier, an inner vessel, and a basket assembly.

3. The prototype inner vessel shall be constructed of 316 SA240 (UNS S31600) with extra restrictions on carbon and nitrogen, and have the ASME Code N Symbol Stamp in accordance with the requirements of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code Section III, Division 1, Subsection NC (Class 2 pressure vessel).  The Supplier shall furnish an ASME Design Report for this vessel.

4. The prototype outer corrosion barrier shall be constructed of SB-575 (UNS N06022) for corrosion protection, and shall be constructed using materials, welding, and nondestructive examination in accordance with the provisions of the ASME Boiler Pressure and Vessel Code Section III, Division 1, Subsection NC (Class 2 pressure vessel).  The outer corrosion barrier shall be built in accordance with Buyer supplied drawings and fabrication specification.  No ASME Design Specification will be provided, no ASME Design Report will be required, and the outer corrosion barrier will not be required to be ASME Code stamped.  It shall be inspected by an Authorized Nuclear Inspector and certified on a Buyer-supplied non-Code Data Report Form to meet the specified provisions of a Purchaser-supplied Fabrication Specification, which shall reference the specific provisions of the the ASME Code.

5. The prototype basket assembly is an "egg-crate" design that is composed of SB-209 A96061 T4 and Neutronit A978TM (borated stainless steel) with SA-516, Grade 70 (UNS K02700) for basket guides and tubes.  The basket assembly shall be constructed using ASME Code Section II for materials, ASME Code Section IX for welding.  Welds connecting basket assembly to the inner vessel shall be performed to Section III, Division 1, Subsection NC.  The basket assembly will not be required to be ASME Code Stamped.

6. The RFP will specify that the prototypes shall be fabricated from rolled and welded plate.  This specification is necessary to ensure that the prototype containers meet certain project requirements.  However, future prototype procurements will consider alternative fabrication techniques that meet all of the applicable waste package requirements (e.g., ASME Code, materials of fabrication, dimensions, surface condition, etc.), offer potential advantages over the baseline fabrication technique, and have been demonstrated for vessels of similar size to the prototypes.        

Location of the Work:

Work shall be performed at Supplier's or sub-tier supplier's facilities, unless otherwise directed by the Buyer.  This Work (design and fabrication) shall be performed within the United States of America. 

Period of Performance:

The estimated RFP issuance date is April 2004.  The anticipated planned date for award of the Purchase Order is September 30, 2004. The estimated period of performance is to commence work in December 2004, with an expected duration not to exceed eighteen (18) months.

Purchase Order Type:

It is anticipated that a firm-fixed price Purchase Order will be awarded for this procurement.

<DESC>DATES:   It is recommended that white papers be received by the following dates to maximize the possibility of award: FY 04 should be submitted by 1 July 04; FY 05 by 1 May 05; FY 06 by 1 May 06; FY 07 by 1 May 07; and, FY 08 by 1 May 08. White papers will be accepted until 2pm Eastern time on 6 Jan 2009, but it is less likely that funding will be available in each respective fiscal year after the dates cited.  FORMAL PROPOSALS ARE NOT BEING REQUESTED AT THIS TIME.  See Section IV of this announcement for further details.    I.  FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:  The intent of seeking advanced computing architectures is to explore computer architectures with greater capacity and sophistication for addressing dynamic mission objectives under constraints imposed by C2, ISR, and strike systems in order to establish, maintain, and exploit information superiority.  Evolution in computing performance, capacity, and adaptability will lead to extraordinary advances in warfighter capabilities and the systems they depend upon each day.  By broadening and increasing the cognitive capabilities of the computing infrastructure the advantages the warfighter has in filtering, detecting, tracking, fusion, and situational assessment can be unmatched.  Achieving, demonstrating, and fielding these cognitive advances in a constructive methodical manor is key to providing the information superiority necessary for future DoD mission success.  The overall objective of this BAA is to develop, integrate, and demonstrate advanced computing architecture technologies and applications. This effort will investigate the research, application and/or development of emerging advanced computing architecture technologies, products and standards as they relate to the following technical areas: (1) Development of appropriate information technology to enhance the processing capabilities of current and future Air Force C4I systems. This area encompasses all information processing technology both hardware and software that could potentially contribute to enhancing the functionality, performance, reliability, longevity, scalability and usability of legacy or planned Air Force C4I processing systems. Examples of hardware technologies include data intensive processing architectures, power aware processing architectures, polymorphic processing architectures, high productivity computing systems, clockless logic, grid computing, data storage, data visualization, data busses, mobile and wireless networks. Examples of software technologies include programming languages both new and existing, data retrieval/mining, data management, data delivery, software/system monitors, publish/subscribe mechanisms, decision making techniques, distributed databases, and resource management. (2) Development of novel computing architectures that facilitate evolutionary computing (EC) methods such as Genetic Algorithms (GAs), Genetic Programming (GP), etc. for solving hard, NP-complete optimization problems.  Research in this area could address design tools for mapping algorithms and fitness function evaluation engines onto hardware/software systems, achieving extreme solution speeds, problem size scaling, physical miniaturization and power minimization of the physical platform.  Also of interest would be research aimed at employing EC methods to enhance and optimize the design process for composing such hardware/software systems, and applications of these technologies to specific optimization problems of interest to the Information Directorate. (3) Development of technologies supporting utilization of hybrid computation systems such as quantum or biomolecular computing combined with conventional CMOS Silicon systems. New algorithms and architectures, for interfaces between conventional electronic systems and systems based on new operations paradigms, are needed to transduce information in the most efficient manner.  This will enable development of hybrid systems with unique capabilities beyond general computing, such as intrinsic contextual addressing and computing. (4) Modeling and Simulation. Development of virtual real time modeling and simulation methods to enable more human intuitive design processes. Research in this area would focus on demonstrating extreme speed-ups of modeling and simulation engines used in present or proposed design environments, in order to achieve near real time inspection of the effect of changes made to a device or information system design.  This research area would also encompass fast methods to cast models and simulation engines into parallel and embedded processing platforms. In addition this area includes the development of simulation technology to perform rapid assessment and course of action analysis of the predictive battlespace environment. Examples of these particular technologies include: real-time simulation systems, advanced simulation architectures, M&S for wargaming, behavior representation, predictive assessment of adversarial actions, adversary intent inferencing, and application of these, or other, technologies to the concepts of dynamic planning/execution, and real-time decision support. (5) Development of hardware and software processing architectures and techniques to enhance mechanisms of intelligence leading to cognizant computing.  Examples might be learning algorithms, knowledge creation techniques, storage or computation media physically addressed by a context mechanism such as resonance or stochastic summation, or distributed processing where each of many parallel sensing devices, has its own processor that does significant data interpretation/reduction. (6) Development of information technology leading to the advancement or demonstration of autonomous systems for enabling improved situational awareness, situational management, and situational control of the battlespace. This area includes all information technology that could potentially contribute to enhancing awareness and response through processing, reconfigurability, networking, communication, teaming, and control of ground, air, and/or space platforms.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION 1-04 - CONTRACTOR SUPPORT: OPERATIONAL CONCEPT DEVELOPMENT AND EXPERIMENTATION

1.0	Description

1.1	Allied Command Transformation (ACT) is issuing this Request for Information (RFI) announcement on behalf of the Deputy Assistant Chief of Staff Joint Experimentation, Exercises, and Assessment (DACOS JEEA). 
1.2	This Is A Request For Information (RFI) only. The intent is to only identify potential Vendors for on-site Contractor support in building an operational concept development and experimentation (CD&E) program for NATO.
1.3	This RFI DOES NOT constitute a current Request for Proposal (RFP) nor a promise to issue a future RFP. ACT is not seeking proposals at this time and will not accept unsolicited proposals prior to potential release of an RFP in late January 2004. Respondees are advised that NATO will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in responding to this RFI. All costs for responding to this RFI shall be borne solely by the responding Vendor. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP when issued. 
1.4	Planning, Vendors should consider potential Contractor support to consist of 15-25 on-site personnel with short-term surge capability of 5-10 additional personnel for fiscal 2004. Contractor personnel may be further increased in fiscal 2005 and the out years. Expected specialties will include: project management, contracting support, information technology support, concept developers, experimenters, and operations research analysts. 
1.5	Any future RFP that may be released shall be listed on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website (http://www.fedbizopps.gov). Vendors are responsible for monitoring this site for additional information on this requirement.

2.0	Background 
2.1	DACOS JEEA is seeking Contractor support to help design and conduct a credible NATO-wide CD&E program, and develop metrics to identify the program’s successes and deficiencies. The design and metrics must have sufficient detail to identify opportunities to improve warfighting capability, especially relating to the NATO Response Force (NRF). This RFI seeks responses that will be used in developing and issuing a proposed RFP for Contractor services by the end of January 2004. 
2.2	The mission of ACT is to lead Alliance Transformation. Experimentation works with Concept Development to be the highly adaptive engine to accomplish this Transformation mission. Experimentation is the intellectual engine for the entire Transformation process. For a Transformation Command, experimentation equals the ammunition and fuel to the warfighter. No new concept nor capability should (or will) be moved into doctrine, interoperability work, training, capability packages, or force proposals until validated through credible experimentation. Experimentation controls the pace of Transformation. In the Transformation environment, the effectiveness of the entire process depends on delivering credible products. 
2.3	ACT provides a common NATO setting for experimental activities. ACT expects to accomplish experimentation objectives in various ways including: building experimental venues in which future-looking concepts can be validated; using existing exercises in which mature concepts can be demonstrated by NATO agencies and nations; leveraging the efforts of others such as NATO nations, coalition partners, industry, business, and academia; and by being involved in training and innovation shown by operational commanders.

3.0	Requested Information
3.1	White Paper. Vendor companies and organizations are invited to provide a white paper, of no more than 15 pages, on their operational CD&E experiences; previous demonstrations of; and capabilities to design, develop, conduct, and assess capabilities to support an experimentation program. The white papers shall be due by 1600 hours on 5 Jan 2004. Information in the white papers will be considered in developing any potential final Statement of Work requirements. Proprietary information, if any, should be minimized and clearly marked as such. Please be advised that all submissions become NATO property and will not be returned. The white papers shall be in Microsoft Word for Office 2000-compatible format, and shall not contain classified information. The white papers shall address, at a minimum, the following concepts and methods to: 
·	Design a CD&E program.
·	Conduct a CD&E program. 
·	Assess the validity, successes, and deficiencies of the program.
3.2	White Paper Addendum. The white paper shall include the following information in a separate attachment, which will not be included in the 15-page limitation. 
·	Company or organization name
·	Complete mailing address
·	Overnight delivery address (if different from mailing address)
·	Phone number
·	Fax number
·	E-mail of designated point of contact
3.3 	Presentation. Selected RFI Vendor responders may be asked to provide one-hour, on-site presentations based on their white papers to current ACT CD&E and Contracting personnel during the period 6-9 Jan 04 (or shortly thereafter). Vendors must be prepared to answer in-depth questions regarding their past experiences and visions of CD&E in NATO at that time.

4.0	Question and Answers Briefing
4.1	Vendors are invited to send up to three company representative to a Question and Answer (Q&A) Briefing on this RFI from 9 - 11 am, 18 Dec 03 at HQ SACT in Norfolk, VA.

Participants also may ask questions about the white paper. Subject matter experts will be on hand to answer specific questions. This will be the only Q&A Briefing. The results of this Q&A will not be recorded nor made available to non-attendees. 
	Vendors interested in attending this Q&A Briefing are asked to E-mail LT COL Wayne Buck at buck.act.nato.int by close of business on 16 Dec 03 (in doing so, please also copy to Mr Kevin Mills at mills@act.nato.int). The E-mail should include the following information at a minimum:
	Full names, titles, and contact info for personnel attending
	Company name
	Mailing address and phone number
	This E-mail should address only the information to attend the Q&A Briefing, not the white paper. Unless noted in the E-mail, it will be assumed that the participants have the required vehicle decals to access HQ SACT. Participants who do not have the needed decals should note such in the E-mail. They will be contacted directly to arrange for an off-site location to be escorted to HQ SACT.
4.2	Following the Q&A Briefing, questions about this RFI announcement and white paper shall be submitted by E-mail only to Mr Kevin Mills at mills@act.nato.int. Verbal questions will NOT be accepted except during the Q&A Briefing on 18 Dec 03. Accordingly, questions in an E-mail shall NOT contain proprietary and/or classified information.

The information provided in this RFI is subject to change and is not binding on NATO. ACT has not made a commitment to procure any of the items described herein, and release of this RFI shall not be construed as such a commitment, nor as authorization to incur cost for which reimbursement will be required or sought.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

A) Background 

Nigeria is USAID’s largest development assistance program in sub-Saharan Africa.   USAID/Nigeria new five-year Country Strategic Plan (CSP) was recently approved by Washington for $400 million.  This CSP follows on the heels of the previous Transition Strategy, which began in September 1999, and was the direct result of USG re-engagement with Nigeria after six years of increasingly strained relations with the military government.  USAID's Transition Strategy, developed by a team of USG agency representatives, laid a foundation for democratic governance and economic and social transition.  While this approach has been successful in re-engaging the Government of Nigeria, private sector and civil society, the efforts of the new CSP are redirected towards achieving significant results and promoting sustainable development.  The new CSP is the first long-term strategy that USAID has developed for Nigeria in twenty years.  The CSP Results Framework has four strategic objectives:  SO11, Strengthened Foundations for Democratic Governance; SO12, Improved Livelihoods in Selected Areas; SO13, Increased Use of Social Sector Services; and SO14, Reduced Impact of HIV/AIDS in Selected States.  The strategy integrates seven crosscutting themes of gender, food security, conflict, transparency, HIV/AIDS, environment, and public/private partnerships. 

The new strategy offers a comprehensive program of assistance to Nigeria to help further its   democratic transition, and address the social welfare needs and improve the economic conditions of Nigerians. Within USAID/Nigeria the Office of Program and Project Development (PPD) has the lead in managing the implementation of the CSP.  PPD houses the Mission’s resident experts on project development, portfolio review, budget analysis, economic and social analysis, performance management, results reporting, and evaluation.  The incumbent manages the Strategic Analysis and Performance Management Unit within PPD and serves as the resident expert on all matters relating to sectoral policy analysis and performance management for the CSP in Nigeria.

<DESC>Additional Information:

From the site visit:  Air balance will not need to be done by the contractor.  Clean out ports will need to be installed in the roof-top air handlers.  Work will need to be done after 4:00 P.M. PST to 6:00 A. M. PST.  The bid closing date is changing from 2 February 2004 to 4 February 2004 by 3:00 P.M. PST.  All other terms and conditions of this solicitation remain the same.

1.  Are the bag filters a fiberglass bag filter or a synthetic bag
    filter?
           Synthetic

2. The specs for the filters that we are to provide say that you are
   asking us to provide you with (60) 24X24X3/4 bag filters and (25)
   12X24X3/4 bag filters.  Unfortunately my filter supplier says that
   they don't make bag filters in that size.  Can you please clarify the
   sizes for the bag filters and give us the proper sizes as well as the
   filter efficiency for the bag filters.

   There are 170 filters for the 6 roof-top air handlers: (60) 24x24x2,
   (25) 12x24x2, (60) 24x24x3/4 and (25) 12x24x3/4. The efficiency is 80%
   or greater.

3.  Could you confirm that this modification is adding the licensing
    to cut sheet metal to the job requirements?  (I have never heard of
    this being a requirement for a duct cleaning job before, so I just
    wanted to make sure.)   What part of the job will require the cutting
 of sheet metal?

The contractor must meet Part 1-Special Provisions A & B. Cutting the
sheet metal will be required to enter the duct and to add cleaning ports
throughout the duct.
 

4. What type of licenses will we need to get started?

   Please see 1.01(F) in the Statement of Work.

5. Can you confirm that we will be able to use resident aliens as well as citizens in our crew?

   Yes, as long as they are legal resident aliens.

<DESC>STATEMENT OF WORK
1.  SUMMARY

The Contractor shall provide a report to the U.S. Trade and Development Agency which will: assess whether or not USTDA should provide funding for feasibility studies of (or technical assistance for) any potential projects; assess any alternative activities which Contractor sees as viable options for USTDA consideration; and provide recommendations on the above information in a final report that analyzes all relevant issues as called for in the Definitional Mission (DM) Report Outline (Attachment 4).

Contractor’s recommendations should be based on the following considerations: 

Projects that qualify for USTDA funding must: (1) be national development priorities for the host country; (2) have significant U.S. export potential; (3) be likely to be financed; and (4) have some foreign competitive element that is addressed by USTDA funding of the study; and 
The project sponsor must be willing to allow U.S. companies to compete for contracts during project implementation unless the project is brought to USTDA on a sole-source basis.

2.  TERMS OF REFERENCE

The Contractor shall perform the following tasks:

1.	Upon award, meet with USTDA’s Contracting Officer’s Technical Representative (COTR) (see G.2. below) to discuss details of the contract assignment. The COTR will provide the Contractor with names and addresses of the project sponsors and other pertinent entities to contact in the United States and overseas. Unless otherwise advised, this meeting will be held at USTDA’s office in Arlington, Virginia. 

2.	Conduct discussions with relevant financial institutions and U.S. firms with experience in the pertinent sectors.

3.	At least five (5) business days prior to departure for Ghana and Cameroon provide COTR for approval a pre-visit written report of 2-4 pages containing preliminary findings on project viability, financing options, U.S. company interest in the projects, a list of contacts to be made during the visit and a pre-visit checklist of issues, information and questions to be utilized during the visit. This will include preliminary findings on funding technical assistance for this project.  The Contractor shall also provide a statement that he/she has obtained or will obtain before departure, the required Defense Base Act and Medevac insurance.
  
4.	Travel to Ghana and Cameroon to meet with relevant project officials. USTDA will advise the appropriate Embassies of the Contractor’s proposed travel itinerary prior to departure. The Contractor should contact the Commercial Section at the appropriate U.S. Embassies upon arrival and prior to departure to brief and debrief them on the visit. USTDA will request that the Commercial Section provide the Contractor with names and addresses of appropriate host country officials with whom to meet. While the Embassies may be able to assist the Contractor in arranging these meetings, the Contractor is ultimately responsible for arranging the meetings. Logistics for handling the visit, including hotel accommodations, transportation and translation services are also the responsibility of the Contractor. 

5.   Assess whether the proposed projects are economically, financially, and technically viable. This analysis should include: an assessment of each project’s risks, and consequently its financial viability; the priority of the project and the political/social support it has; the likelihood and potential sources of financing; and capability and experience of the project sponsor.

6.	Provide expert analysis on the potential procurement of U.S. goods and services for project implementation by categories and dollar values.

7.  Assist USTDA in planning a strategy aimed at achieving the maximum possible success for project implementation and enhancing the likelihood of U.S. export sales to the project. The Contractor should use a project life-cycle approach in formulating recommendations for USTDA. This means that the Contractor’s recommendations will take into consideration the entire range of USTDA program capabilities. Possible funding activities include feasibility studies, alternative technical assistance, and Orientation Visits. 

8.	Develop a sound budget and Terms of Reference (TOR) for the technical assistance and feasibility study (ies), if recommended, or for any other recommended USTDA-funded activity. The budget shall be developed according to the U.S. Trade and Development Agency Budget Preparation Guidelines for Submission of Definitional Mission/Desk Study Reports (Attachment 5). 

9.	Prepare a report to USTDA that addresses all the issues in the Definitional Mission Report Outline (Attachment 4). Since this report will be available for public distribution, any sensitive or proprietary information should be included in a separate confidential attachment to the report. The Contractor shall provide the report in draft form to USTDA within ten (10) working days after completion of the overseas visit. The report should be clearly marked “Draft” on the cover. Except in the case where C.2.10 (below) applies, within five (5) working days after receiving USTDA’s final comments on the draft report, including all comments from C.2.10 (below), the Contractor shall provide twenty (20) copies of the final version of the report, which incorporates the required changes/revisions, and an unbound original to USTDA. It is the responsibility of the Contractor to verify with the COTR that the report is considered acceptable and ready for the production of the appropriate number of copies. All reports must be paginated. All reports must be submitted on a 3.5-inch disk in Microsoft Word.

10.	a.  For any projects that include a full proposal submitted by a U.S. company on a sole-source basis, the Contractor will additionally prepare and provide to the COTR a first draft of that section of the Definitional Mission Report (fax is acceptable) based on the proposal and any additional information or clarifications provided by the U.S. Company, within ten (10) working days after the completion of the overseas visit.  The draft section must be clearly marked “First Draft” on the cover.  USTDA will review the first draft report and provide comments.

b.  The Contractor will then provide to USTDA and to the U.S. Company for its review and comment a second draft of this project’s section that incorporates USTDA’s comments on the first draft of the section (again, fax is acceptable) within one week of receipt of USTDA’s comments.  This draft report must be clearly marked “Second Draft” on the cover.  The U.S. Company will provide its comments on the second draft report to the Contractor.

c.  The Contractor shall discuss the comments from the U.S. Company with the COTR, and based on that discussion, prepare and provide to USTDA within five (5) working days the final version of this section in the Definitional Mission Final Report.  

3.  DELIVERABLES
The Contractor shall provide:

•	Verbal updates to the COTR, as required;
•	A pre-visit written report of 2-4 pages, at least five (5) business days before travel, providing preliminary findings on project viability, potential financing, U.S. market interest, a list of contacts to be made during the visit and a check-list of issues, information and questions to be utilized during the visit;
•	A draft report within ten (10) working days after completion of the overseas visit in accordance with the Definitional Mission Report Outline (Attachment 4). The draft report shall be clearly marked “Draft” on the cover and shall include a recommended feasibility study budget, prepared according to the U.S. Trade and Development Agency Budget Preparation Guidelines for Submission of Definitional Mission/Desk Study Reports (Attachment 5); 
Should the Definitional Mission examine a project for which a U.S. Company has submitted a full proposal, the Contractor shall provide a draft report for USTDA approval within ten (10) working days after the completion of the overseas visit.  After USTDA provides comments on the draft, The Contractor will then provide to USTDA and to the U.S. Company for its review and comment a second draft of this project’s section that incorporates USTDA’s comments on the first draft of the section. The U.S. Company will provide its comments on the second draft report to the Contractor.  The Contractor shall discuss the comments from the U.S. Company with the COTR, and based on that discussion, prepare the final report for USTDA.

E.  Relationships

This effort includes hardware modification to the GBU-28 B/B to accommodate future in-flight fuze reprogramming, modification to the GBU-28 telemetry system to reduce telemetry costs in production, and the production of up to 350 guidance and tail kits.  Interested parties are requested to submit a qualification package demonstrating in-depth knowledge of the GBU-28 weapon system to include intimate knowledge/expertise in the following areas:  GBU-28 B/B guidance and control functionality, GBU-28 B/B / BLU-113 interface, GBU-28 B/B interfaces with the B-2 and F-15E aircraft, GBU-28 telemetry system, GBU-28 B/B 6-DOF simulation, and GBU-28 legacy laser functionality.

<DESC>This sources sought notice does not constitute the solicitation of a proposal, authority to enter into negotiations to award a contract for the items has not been received and funds are not currently available. All letters of interest from potential sources will be reviewed and retained. The Naval Undersea Warfare Center Division Newport, Newport, Rhode Island, seeks interested sources to develop and provide an Electronic Information Control, Collection and Distribution System. The proposed system will be an unclassified, networked data system to provide up to date procedures and specific hardware processing direction to the production shop floor and to collect and verify step accomplishment, test measurement and inspection data. The proposed system shall be an electronic real time information control, collection, and distribution system.  It will provide for execution of maintenance and inspection procedures within a robust data management framework, resulting in a tool for workflow and process management.  It will address the full scope of the process and facilitate procedure execution, data collection, procedure documentation, process auditing, and quality inspections.  In real time, it will also define a process, measure the workflow, and compare measurement results to established standards and goals.  The system will provide secure and reliable document modification, review, and approval.  The system will allow for direct incorporation of procedure modifications and deviations and offer real-time workflow measurement, real-time documentation/data collection, work group information sharing and collaboration, as well as reduced use of paper. The system must operate at multiple facilities allowing both centralized and independent operations.

<DESC>The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) is seeking to sign a Memo of Understanding (MOU) to work with an electrical safety equipment manufacturer to design, test, and evaluate the marketability of the Electrical Injury Protection System (EIPS), a personal protective equipment for electrical workers and electricians, which is being developed by NIOSH.  The goal of this project is to improve the safety of electrical workers/electricians by bringing the EIPS into the marketplace.  This announcement is a business opportunity in that the partner selected will share expertise with NIOSH researchers toward making the EIPS a viable and profitable piece of safety equipment. 

An investigation of occupational electrocution fatalities showed that a large percentage of electrocution victims were working around an electrical circuit that was not de-energized and/or were working without the presence of a GFCI.  In order to address these risk factors to reduce the occupational fatality and injury rates related to contact with electrical energy, NIOSH is developing the EIPS which uses a radio-frequency (RF) sensor to detect the proximity of, or electrical contact from, an electrical worker to an energized power line or electrical circuit (<600 volts).  The system protects the worker by first providing an audible and visible proximity warning and in the event of contact, tripping the GFCIs if in place, and the circuit breaker by generating artificial excessive line-to-ground and line-to-neutral currents, respectively.

The project is currently in the system development phase.  NIOSH has conducted human subject tests for characteristics of RF signal transmission between a human and an electrical circuit, and for human RF exposure assessment.  The test results showed that it is feasible to use an RF sensor for human proximity and electrical contact detections.  The test results also showed that the human exposure to RF energy during proximity/electrical contact detection is well below the RF exposure limits specified by ANSI standards.  Electronic circuit and tripping mechanism development is also underway.  System development is scheduled to be completed in early 2005. 

Candidate companies, which appear to provide the most promise of meeting the requirements listed below, will be evaluated based on their capability to complete the research and development needed to bring the EIPS into commercial production.   This announcement does not obligate NIOSH to sign an MOU with any presented company.  NIOSH reserves the right to establish a partnership based on engineering analysis/evaluation capabilities found under this announcement or other searches, if determined to be in the best interest of the government. 

EIPS Commercialization Capabilities Parameters: (Companies should try to meet as many of these requirements as possible, but highly innovative solutions without testing are not discouraged from presentation or response.) 

(A) Providing significant intellectual, engineering, and technical expertise in manufacturing personal electrical-injury protection equipment.  This would include defining the cost and usability needs of electrical personal protective equipment market.  Also, assistance will be given in setting realistic product cost objectives and providing suggestions on how the EIPS can achieve product cost goals - Required; 

(B) Fabricating  prototypes for test and evaluation - Required; 

(C) Providing expertise to NIOSH in designing and conducting field evaluations  - Required; 

(D) Reviewing test results and recommending design modifications; 

(E) Reviewing testing methods and recommending appropriate, new testing criteria; 

NIOSH is seeking an innovative partner to address these major areas.  A company that is qualified and currently producing electrical personal protective equipment is highly desired.  However, past testing and design of equipment similar to EIPS is not required.  If prior testing has been performed the test information and results should be provided.  Interested parties responding to this request should provide detailed information regarding capabilities, test results, and cost data.  Presentation material may consist of literature, electronic presentation, or video. (Samples and data provided to the government as part of this solicitation will not be returned to vendors following the completion of this project.)  Vendors may be offered the opportunity to meet with representatives of the project team following a review of all submitted data. Data and/or product samples must be delivered to NIOSH within two weeks (10 business days) of the closing of this announcement.  Although every effort will be made to consider all information received, the government will not be obligated to evaluate information received after the two week period.  Vendors should note any proprietary data as such. If any data is to be excluded from exchange with any of the project participants, a statement of that fact shall be included with the statement of propriety.  Presentations from interested vendors are optional but encouraged. The government has identified March 10th and 11th, 2004 for these presentations to be conducted.  The Government reserves the right to identify an alternate meeting date if those identified are not viable for one or more interested vendors.

<DESC>The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) is seeking to sign a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to work with a wood chipper manufacturer to design, test, and evaluate the marketability of the Wood Chipper Safety System that NIOSH has previously designed and tested.  The goal of this project is to improve the safety of operators of wood chippers by bringing the Wood Chipper Safety System into the marketplace. This announcement is a business opportunity in that the partner selected will share expertise with NIOSH researchers toward making the Wood Chipper Safety System a profitable safety product.  

Present wood chipper safety systems are limited because the position of the safety bar is not reachable from inside the feed chute, making it nearly impossible for an operator to active it if caught inside the feed chute.  There is currently no form of passive protection, such as the Wood Chipper Safety System, available for protecting operators from fatal injury if caught inside the feed chute.  The Wood Chipper Safety System developed by NIOSH constantly monitors the capacitive charge inside the feed chute.  The sensing electrode is configured so that it is not affected by the normal passing of wood through the feed chute.  If an operator enters the feed chute, the capacitance changes and is sensed by the control circuitry.  If the capacitance increases to a predetermined level, indicating the possibility that the operator’s hand is in the feed chute, the control circuit will produce a warning signal.  If the level is high enough, indicating the operator’s body is in the feed chute, the control circuit will produce a shutoff signal to immediately stop the feed mechanism.

Simulated lab based testing has been conducted by NIOSH using a simulated feed chute.  The results of these tests show that the Wood Chipper Safety System is a viable device that could be used to help prevent deaths due to operators being caught inside a wood chipper’s feed chute.  The control circuitry has been updated based on the lab testing.

Candidate companies, which appear to provide the most promise of meeting the requirements listed below, may be evaluated by their capability to complete the research and development needed to bring the Wood Chipper Safety System into commercial production.  This announcement does not obligate NIOSH to sign an MOU with any presented company.  NIOSH reserves the right to establish a partnership based on engineering analysis/evaluation capabilities found under this announcement or other searches, if determined to be in the best interest of the government.

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulations Subpart 12.6 and the provisions of Subpart 13.5, Test Program for Certain Commercial Items, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a separate written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-18. The following provisions and clauses apply to this acquisition and are incorporated by reference: 1) 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors-Commercial; 2) 52.212-3, Offeror, Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items; 3) 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items, with an addendum; and 4) 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial Items. Solicitation Number 1435-04-04-RP-33449 applies; the solicitation is issued as a request for proposals (RFP).  BACKGROUND:  FCIC's Board of Directors approved the avocado pilot program in Ventura County, California, effective for the 1998 crop year, and expanded the program to the other counties in the pilot area for the 2001 crop year.  Over 1,100 policies earned premium in the pilot area for the 2004 crop year, with approximately 95 percent of the policies at the CAT level.  The rates and rating methodology were developed by Montana State University. A rating evaluation has been conducted previously.  Additional research is being contemplated at this time to develop a loss adjustment appraisal method for immature avocado fruit. This project is for a program evaluation that includes hard copy reports and oral presentations on the results of a comprehensive analysis and evaluation of the program.  The evaluation will be used to determine if the program should be continued as a pilot, modified, terminated, or converted to a permanent program. The SOW provides the framework for evaluating the program, and making recommendations for the program, including recommendations for the program as to whether it should be continued as a pilot, modified (recommendations for modifications to be included), terminated, or converted to a permanent program, with justification as to why these recommendations were chosen. The work will involve project planning; scheduling; quality control; interviewing techniques; categorizing, analyzing, and summarizing verbal information; data collection and review; data analysis; research; critical thinking; innovative problem solving techniques; oral presentations and report writing. The Government anticipates that this will be a firm fixed price award, except for the final deliverable, which shall be Time and Materials, and reserves the right to award without discussions.  For reference only, the Government cost estimate for this project is based on approximately 1700 professional labor hours of effort.

STATEMENT OF WORK

QYZH 01-2003 (DESC # MTH 02-5)

REPLACE EXISTING 600 GPM PUMPS, Facility 1317


1. GENERAL

This project is for the acquisition of three 600 gallon per minute (GPM) pumps to be installed inside Facility 1317.  The contractor shall remove and replace the existing 600 GPM JP-8 transfer pumps with new 600 GPM in-line centrifugal pumps, which must meet the API 610 standards (8th Edition).  These newly configured pumps will eliminate the need for two existing in-line mechanical seals with one easily replaceable seal.  They will also eliminate the need to realign the pump and motor every time the seals and/or the pump motors are replaced..  The new pumps must have a vertical drive transfer capable of delivering at least 400 GPM at 65 + PSI to the farthest outlet from the pump house.  The bidding contractors must do a site visit to calculate the pumps performance against the existing piping sizes and routes to the farthest outlet from pump house.  The calculated performance assessment must be submitted as part of the contractor’s bid. The top of the pedestal’s mounting plate filled with concrete on which the existing pumps stand must be removed.  They consist of a metal casing around Portland cement, which must be removed by jackhammer.  The pumps will be installed with all electrical and piping connections done by the contractor.   

2.  GOVERNMENT SUPPLIED MATERIAL

As-built drawings of the building 1317 piping will be made available for any of the bidding contractors to investigate.  Upon request, a copy of the as-built drawings will be made available to each potential bidder after the site visit meeting.  Other drawings or supplemental information will be provided as requested.  All drawings provided by the Air Force must be field verified by the contractor. 

3.  SPECIFICS:

Air Force personnel will remove the existing pumps from existing pump pedestals and remove any other associated items of the pumps as necessary for the new installation of pumps by contractor.  
   
Each bidder shall provide a complete cost estimate or price to provide and install the new pumps in Facility 1317.  Each bidder shall include their calculated performance assessment as part of their bid.
