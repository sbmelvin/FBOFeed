<DESC>The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, will be soliciting proposals from firms which have the capability to assist in implementing health care marketing of patient safety products and tools for the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.  

Sources must have the capability to implement traditional product marketing methods, but especially in face-to-face and one-on-one site visits with the intent of changing behavior in clinical practice. The contractor must demonstrate experience in health care marketing. The contractor shall have the ability to reach out to health care providers by personal contacts. The contractor shall make one-on-one contacts with specified target audiences and follow-up site visits to highlight AHRQ's products, thereby influencing the adoption of improved patient safety practices. In the project’s implementation phase, field staff employed by the contractor would be expected to accomplish at least the following tasks:
•	Contact potential audiences by mail, telephone, or e-mail;
•	Arrange face-to-face meetings with appropriate personnel;
•	Travel to the potential audiences to present information on patient safety products with the intent of getting these products adopted and used to improve patient safety;
•	Provide technical assistance as necessary; and 
•	Document successful implementation of AHRQ’s patient safety products.
The following list of AHRQ patient safety products http://www.ahrq.gov/qual/errorsix.htm is intended to provide a core set of materials for implementation teams to use in outreach to health plan executives, officers of large health care organizations, and clinicians in group practices to encourage them to use the latest evidence-based resources and tools from AHRQ to change behavior among their staffs and ultimately among their constituents---consumers and patients.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code that best describes the requirement is 541613.  The small business size standard is $7 million. It is anticipated that 1 contract will be awarded for a period of approximately 18 months. Award is expected no later than May 30, 2009. In addition to the solicitation be available on this site, it also will be available for downloading from the internet on AHRQ’s website at www.ahrq.gov. It is the Offeror’s responsibility to monitor this site for release of the solicitation, download their own copy of the solicitation, and monitor the site for any subsequent amendments. Since it is not known who is downloading the solicitation, a bidders’ list will not be available. All responsible businesses may submit a proposal, which will be evaluated by AHRQ. It is estimated that the solicitation will be issued on or about January 9, 2009, with proposals due 45 days thereafter.

<DESC>Sources Sought Synopsis.  This Sources Sought Synopsis is issued to assist the Air Force Electronic Systems Center (ESC) Electronics System Wing, Space and Nuclear Network Group in determining industry's interest and capability in satisfying the requirements of the GMT program to acquire a Non-Developmental Item (NDI) quad-band Large Aperture Antenna (Q-LAA).  Performance requirements for this Q-LAA can be found in the Q-LAA Technical Requirements Document (TRD), dated 16 September 2008, posted on the Hanscom Electronic RFP Bulletin Board http://herbb.hanscom.af.mil.Interested firms must provide two hard copies of a qualification package detailing your specific capabilities to 653 ELSW/SNNG/PK, 5 Eglin Street, Hanscom AFB MA 01731-2100 Attn:  A. John Sorgini Jr.  Please limit your qualification package to a maximum of 20 pages. Responses are requested no later than 1:00 pm EST on 30 January 2009.  Responses should include the company name, address, size of business (i.e., large business, small business, small disadvantaged business, 8(a) concern, veteran-owned small business, service-connected veteran-owned small business, women-owned business, or HUBZone small business), the identification of all major subcontractors (if any), whether U.S. or foreign owned entity, and a company point of contact. Your response must provide specific information about existing NDI Q-LAA capabilities you possess, including technical capabilities to meet the requirements, manufacturing capability and your ability to deliver the systems within the required schedule (delivery of the first two Q-LAAs within 3 months after contract award, and delivery of approximately 86 antennas within a period of two years) beginning in 2010.  Also include any warranty that is provided with the antenna.Your response must provide verification that your proposed NDI antenna has either already achieved necessary certifications [Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) X-band certification for Defense Satellite Communications Systems (DSCS) and US Army Strategic Command (ARSTRAT) Ka-band certification for Wideband Global SATCOM (WGS)] or  provide a detailed roadmap of how and when certification will be accomplished, to include test data (not simply specification data sheets) that clearly depicts how your antenna meets each/all the requirements contained in the TRD. The Q-LAA must interface with, and be controlled by, the GMT Vertex/RSI 123T Antenna Control Unit (ACU) and Power Drive Unit (PDU).  To provide detailed information regarding how antennas interface with GMT a companion document (Antenna Case C/F Interface Interconnections) has been posted on the HERBB.  Note that the GMT ACU/PDU currently supports the following antennas: 8 foot Vertex/RSI High Wind Antenna, OE-361 Quick Reaction Satellite Antenna (QRSA/20 ft), the Light Weight High Gain X-band Antenna (LHGXA/16 ft), and the Large Aperture, Multiband Deployable Antenna (LAMDA/16 ft).  To provide evidence of interoperability, please indicate whether your antenna's interface is similar to any of the above and if not, provide your plan for meeting that requirement.  Your response must also include a list of current US Government and/or Military users of your antenna, with points of contact; and a list of current US Government and/or Military contracts through which your antenna can be purchased, with points of contact.Questions and comments should be submitted electronically, independent of the qualification package, to john.sorgini@hanscom.af.mil.  The Government will consider and attempt to respond to all questions, but reserves the right not to respond.  All answers to submitted questions will be posted on HERBB on a non-attributional basis.Although the acquisition approach has not been finalized, current plans include a field demonstration of all candidate antennas as part of the evaluation process in the March to June 2009 timeframe.  At this time, it is the Government's intent to ask industry to bring their complete NDI antenna to a field evaluation location (TBD) within the U.S. and demonstrate that it meets all of the requirements listed in the TRD.  Please include a statement in your response confirming availability of an antenna to support this evaluation.This notice does not constitute a Request for Proposal; it does not restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach, nor should it be construed as a commitment by the Government. An Ombudsman, Col Russell Blaine, Director, Commander's Staff, (781) 377-5106, has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal and proposal development phases of this acquisition.  The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or the Contracting Officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate Government personnel.  The Ombudsman should be contacted only with issues or problems that have previously been brought to the attention of the program manager and/or Contracting Officer and could not be satisfactorily resolved at that level.

<CONTACT>Bobby Perry bobby.perry@gunter.af.mil

<a href="mailto:bobby.perry@gunter.af.mil">E-mail the POC</a>
<DESC>This is a formal announcement of the Air Force's 554th Electronic Systems Wing's intent to extend the existing contract FA8771-07-C-0001 with Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC) for a period of one (1) year with two (2) one (1) year options and a six month transition period to complete on-going Deliberate and Crisis Action Planning and Execution Segments (DCAPES) Increment 2a requirements on the basis of other than full and open competition. The proposed contract action is for technical requirements and integrated logistics support and sustainment for which the Air Force intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302.1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  Only CSC has the detailed technical knowledge of DCAPES Increment 2a tight coupling CSA interdependencies with GCCS-J, GCCS-AF, and JOPES; complex interfaces with other classified and u! nclassified C2 and CS information systems, embedded JCS, JFCOM, and USAF War Planning & Execution decision rules, and DISA Net-Centric SOA plans to be able to assess impacts of GCCS-J and JOPES changes, and develop, test, and field necessary changes into DCAPES Increment 2a hardware and software to remain interoperable with JOPES until loose coupling via Net-Centric SOA can be achieved in FY10 per DISA and USAF agreement.  This postures the Air Force for competing DCAPES Increment 2b requirements in FY10 on a full and open basis.  On-going Increment 2a requirements that require completion include delivery, test support (Government Development, Operational, Security, and Joint Interoperability), deficiency correction, and global fielding of DCAPES releases v4.1.0.3 in 2Q FY09, v4.1.0.4 in 2Q FY09, v4.1.0.5 in 3Q FY09, v4.1.x.x in 4Q FY09, and such other releases as necessary to sustain interoperability and support simultaneous net-centric migration of this classified Command!  and Control (C2) National Security System (NSS) with the following other classified and unclassified C2 and Combat Support (CS) information systems:  Joint Operational Planning and Execution System (JOPES), Military Personnel Data System (MILPDS), Defense Manpower Data System (DMDC), Global Air Transportation Execution System (GATES), War and Mobilization Planning System (WMP), Global Status of Resources and Training System (GSORTS), Logistics Module (LOGMOD), Air Expeditionary Forces On-line, Logistics Feasibility Assessment Capability (LOGFAC), Cargo Movement Operations System (CMOS), Manpower Programming and Execution System (MPES), Civilian Personnel Data System (CIVPDS), Personnel Accounting System (PAS), Joint Capabilities Requirements Manager (JCRM), Defense Integrated Military Human Resources System (DIMHRS), as applicable; and such other information systems (e.g., USAF War Planning and Execution Family of Systems; Defense Readiness Reporting System, Net-Enabled Command Capability) and Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) and Joint Forces Comm! and (JFCOM) information initiatives (e.g., Global Force Management-GFM; Force Management Improvement Program-FMIP), as may be directed by HQ USAF War Planning and Execution System (WPES) Governance.  On-going Increment 2a requirements also require global Tier 2 Help Desk, training, fielding, and maintenance of DCAPES software fielded at Global Command and Control System-Air Force (GCCS-AF) Strategic Server Enclaves (SSE), testing facilities, and training facilities across the globe.  On-going Increment 2a requirements likewise require parallel software development, testing, training, and fielding of incremental releases required for ending tightly-coupled software security, database, code, hardware, and geographic location interdependencies among Global Command and Control System-Joint (GCCS-J), GCCS-AF, JOPES and DCAPES; and replacing this over FY09-10 with Net-Centric Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) DCAPES components that appropriately use GCCS-AF, GCCS-J, Net-Centric!  Enterprise Services (NCES), and such other Air Force net-centric infrastructures as directed by the DCAPES Program Management Office, Force Projection and Readiness Directorate, 554th Electronic Systems Group, Maxwell AFB-Gunter Annex, Alabama, 36114.  The on-going Increment 2a requirements, prioritized by HQ USAF WPES Governance, require insertion of new and/or enhanced capabilities urgently required by USAF Warfighters or reasonably achieve migrating DCAPES into Net-Centric SOA; or achieve efficiencies and lower life cycle costs mandated by Clinger-Cohen Act (CCA) requirements. .  Included in these requirements is providing transition support to ensure continued interoperability (stability, effectiveness) during start-up and learning curve phase of the subsequent Increment 2b contract if another offeror is selected under the full and open competition.   DCAPES is the Air Force System of Record to present, plan, source, mobilize, deploy, account for, sustain, redeploy, and reconstitute Combat Air Power.  It is used 24 hours a day, 7 days a w! eek on the SIPRNET by 7,000+ HQ USAF, Major Commands, Numbered Air Forces, Air Components of Unified Commands, Field Operating Agencies, Direct Reporting Units, Air Force Reserves, and Air National Guard Combat Commanders and war planners in force projection operations that deploy 100,000+ airmen, weapon systems and associated equipment to 64+ countries annually.  DCAPES currently uses Client-Server Architecture (CSA) and is highly hardware and software interdependent with GCCS-J, GCCS-AF, and JOPES.  Each GCCS-J, GCCS-AF and JOPES release requires assessment of impacts to DCAPES and almost always requires changes to DCAPES software.  Each GCCS-J, GCCS-AF, and JOPES release creates the potential for loss of DCAPES operational capability due to the tight coupling interdependencies.  Ongoing Increment 2a requirements to migrate DCAPES from the tightly coupled interdependencies with GCCS-J, GCCS-AF, and JOPES to a net-centric SOA interoperability with JOPES using directed GCCS! -J, GCCS-AF, NCES, and other USAF infrastructures must be completed on an expedited basis and no later than FY10 per a Defense Information System Agency (DISA) and USAF formal agreement.  Migration to Net-Centric SOA will eliminate impediments to full and open competition and competitive advantages.  The DCAPES Increment 2a is very complex with point-to-point and other non-SOA interfaces and interdependencies with numerous other programs/projects outside the control of the DCAPES Program Management Office and the contractor. DCAPES Increment 2a requirements schedules and  the DCAPES Increment 2a software information (e.g., interfaces, interdependencies, infrastructures such as GCCS-J, GCCS-AF, NCES) is continually evolving and at this point in time architectural, engineering, and technical data is being gathered to provide sufficient details for any future competition. Interested sources may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement within 15 days after the publication date of this notice of contract action.  This no! tice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination by the Government not to compete this DCAPES Increment 2a contract action is solely within the Government's discretion.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this acquisition is 541511.  Inquiries can be mailed to the Contracting Officer, Harry Bryan, 201 East Moore Drive, Bldg 856, Room 162, Maxwell AFB-Gunter Annex, AL 36114 or a faxed to Mr. Bryan using (334) 416-3035or e-mailed to harry.bryan@gunter.af.mil.  Numbered Notes 9, 22, and 26 apply.

<DESC><p><br />1. 500 CBSS/GBLB, the Ground Theater Air Control System Support Office (GTACS SSO) located at Ogden Air Logistics Center (OO-ALC) is requesting information from (8)A Alaskan Native Corporations (ANC) to assist in the planning for the acquisition of Voice Control Access System (VCAS) Touchscreen hardware for the AN/TYQ-23 (V)5 command and control systems. As it is anticipated that this procurement will be set aside to an (8)a ANC, only (8)a ANC responses will be accepted and reviewed at this time.
<p>2. Current AN/TYQ-23 (V)5 trackball/mouse arrangement does not allow AN/TYQ-23 operator to effectively manipulate command assets to coordinate/deconflict air space issues during peak flying times. Operators cannot manipulate the mouse rapidly enough to perform the various switch actions required for manipulating the air picture and connecting them via telephone and radio to aircraft and outside air traffic control, command and control, and sister service organizations.</p>
<p>3. In 2006, Northrop Grumman Engineering Systems developed a temporary engineering solution to address the above requirement. This procurement will use that engineering solution as a baseline for fleetwide modifications to the entire AN/TYQ-23 fleet (70 Systems). The procurement will be based on a Facility Users Manual (FUM) and parts list. No software changes are anticipated.</p>
<p>a. Background. The Modular Control Equipment (MCE), AN/TYQ-23(V)5, was produced for the United States Air Force (USAF). Seventy MCE Operations Modules (OMs) were functionally upgraded from the (V)3 version and remain in active service.<br />b. The (V)3 to (V)5 upgrade included the capability to integrate software applications, running on the open architecture internal or external SSUs, with the native OM operational software system running in the legacy AYK-14 Computer Units (CUs). <br />c. The previous version of the OM (TYQ-23(V)3 had separate touchscreen panels for communication control and air picture manipulation, allowing the operator to use both hands to control these functions. The current configuration places both of these functions on one screen, controlled by one mouse/trackball.</p>
<p>4. Requirements: Procure, assemble, test, and deliver (70) permanent VCAS touchscreen modification kits, retrofit kits, and spares to be installed in the AN/TYQ-23 (V)5.<br />a. Update of installation drawings and instructions for the OM kits (as required).<br />b. Update of design and development of mounting solution (as required) <br />c. The touchscreen capability shall be implemented using the fixed mount computer model JLT 1205-PS or functional equivalent.<br />d. Based on current design, a swing arm (or equivalent) mounting shall be utilized so that the operator may move the JLT 1205-PS Computer screen (or functional equivalent) to any point around the outside edge of the upper portion of the existing Operator Console Unit (OCU) monitor. The mounting should allow the operator to tilt the screen at a slight downward angle and/or twist left or right in order to optimize viewing angle and location for ease of use while seated. <br />e. VCAS Touchscreen design shall be the same as EDM &amp; limited production systems, although it is expected that a limited amount of non-reoccurring engineering and testing will be required as a result of COTS obsolescence.<br />f. No changes to VCAS Touchscreen Operating System, Applications software, or firmware are anticipated. New COTS hardware devices might require unique device drivers that would have to be integrated into the system.<br />g. Effort is not a new design effort and will not address any current system deficiencies or implement corrections.<br />h. Retrofit kits for existing EDM &amp; four limited production VCAS Touchscreen systems to establish one VCAS Touchscreen configuration baseline.<br />i. Update T.O.s and drawings as necessary to establish one VCAS Touchscreen configuration baseline.<br />j. Procurement will be based on the USAF owned Facility Users Manual that includes operations and maintenance instructions as well as parts lists for the VCAS Touchscreens.<br />k. No changes to the current MCE Operating System software are anticipated.<br />l. Provisioning: Hold provisioning conference to assess requirements for operational spares and equipment to address long term supportability of VCAS touchscreens. <br />m. Redlines to the FUM for any new hardware will be required and a draft Time Compliance Technical Order (TCTO) for field level retrofit of the four existing VCAS touchscreens.</p>
<p>5. Please provide formal responses to the tasks listed above. Address your capabilities to accomplish the tasks and provide highlights of successful past experience on similar government contracts within the past 10 years. List name of contract, contract number, and assigned Administrative Contracting Office (ACO) name and phone number for past experience.<br />a. Describe your current manufacturing capability and experience <br />i. Describe Quality processes to manufacture a System<br />ii. Describe Quality Program Management processes to manufacture a System<br />1. Risk management to achieve program objectives<br />2. Cost control and accounting management</p>
<p>b. Describe your current capability and experience with COTS obsolescence and integration in currently fielded weapon systems.</p>
<p>i. Integration of COTS into fielded systems<br />ii. Retrofitting fielded systems with COTS<br />iii. COTS experience related to AN/TYQ-23 (V)3, (V)4, and (V)5 systems</p>
<p>c. Describe your capability and experience with weapon system supportability and sustainment</p>

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR), Patuxent River, Maryland intends to negotiate and award a sole source contract to Noetic Software, Inc of Willow Grove, Pennsylvania to expand the scope of the current effort under contract N000019-06-C-0114 to include adding software to the Control Display Unit (CDNU) installed on the CH-46E helicopter to access first responder frequencies and embedded secure voice capability in the 1851A version of the ARC-210 radio. Optional tasking will also be included for development of the CDNU control software that will allow integration of an Embedded GPS Inertial (EGI) navigation source to include the ability to command an alignment using information provided by the ARC-210 radio and to incorporate improvements to allow input of tourque system parameters via the CDNU keypad. The procurement of these services from Noetic will allow the government to rapidly integrate the most recent software loads into the CDNU software without expanding current code or lose current functionality. Noetic was competitively awarded the initial CH-46E CDNU software design and development contract in 2003. As a result, Noetic has gained the specific, in-depth knowledge of the CH-46E CDNU software code which is needed to perform the proposed effort within the timeframe necessary to meet current Fleet needs within budgetary constraints imposed upon PMA-226 due to the impending phase-out of the CH-46E helicopter. As a result, Noetic is able to preserve the ability to easily incorporate additional enhancements for the CDNU that are expected in the near future. The authority permitting other than full and open competition is Title 10, U.S. Code 2304(c)(1), as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The period of perfomance of the proposed effort shall not exceed 24 months. This 24 months will include a period of 12 months for CDNU Software development for ARC 210  RT1851A control with 2 options at 6 months each to include CDNU Software development for basic GPS control and CDNU Software development for Engine Torque gauge parameters.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

The Government-estimated potential total value of this acquisition is $10M or more over the four year period. The current 4 year contract has had approximately $13.8M obligated against it to date. In the event a multiple award ID/IQ contract is awarded, the potential amount available for any one awardee would be reduced by amounts awarded to all other awardees over the contracted life of this program segment.<BR><BR>Location: 1792 12th St.; Contracting Command, Fort Riley, KS <BR>Date: 21 January 2009 at 9:00 AM Central Standard Time.

The second is to solicit industry comments as to the merits and perceived weaknesses of Governments requirement from the Contractors perspective.  This includes any Government contractual or technical issues that the Contractor finds would limit or exclude it from participating as a prime contractor in any potential solicitation of this program. For example, one such possible industry response would be a comment that severing the asphalt paving requirement from the concrete paving requirement is a change that would increase the pool of vendors able to perform Governments requirement. Government desires to capitalize on Contractors expertise, business practices, and abilities to improve the Governments changeable requirements that will result in an increase of the supply, availability, and reliability of the work received. Government hopes that, in turn, adopted changes will translate into improved support to Government customers at a lower price and a shorter project concept-to-completion schedule for the Fort Riley installation overall.<BR><BR>The conference registration form, demonstration agreement, driving directions, and proposed specifications (PWS) are available for download at the following internet address: http://www.riley.army.mil/Services/Fort/Contracting.aspx .

The Department of Homeland Security, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Federal Protective Service (DHS/ICE/FPS), plans to enter into a contract for CCTV supplies.  

Currently, the Federal Protective Service (FPS) has a requirement for 12 CCTV (Closed-Circuit Television) receivers and 12 CCTV (Closed-Circuit Television) transmitters.  The receivers and transmitters need to interface with an existing security surveillance system, Vicon.  It is essential the required receivers and transmitters be compatible with the existing security surveillance equipment.  To maintain a functional security surveillance system, the required brand name and model for the receiver is American Fibertek RR 1400, and the required brand name and model for the transmitter is American Fibertek Mt 1400.  Due to compatibility concerns only the above mentioned name and models will meet this requirement.   

Supplies will be delivered to the Ronald Reagan building located at 1300 Pennsylvania Ave. NW Washington, DC 20004.  Supplies are expected to be delivered in 3 to 5 business days from award of Contract.   

At time of award, the contractor must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) website at www.ccr.gov. 

All questions shall be addressed to Christopher.kelly1@dhs.gov or call (215)521-22259 no later than close of business January 6, 2009.

<SUBJECT>LEAD-CONTAINING COATINGS ON FLEXIBLE SUBSTRATES FOR REFERENCE MATERIAL DEVELOPMENT
<SOLNBR>AMD-09-SS11
<RESPDATE>013009
<CONTACT>Todd D Hill, Phone 301-975-8802, Email todd.hill@nist.gov
<DESC>The National Institute of Standards & Technology (NIST) seeks information on commercial vendors capable of providing films of lead-containing coatings on flexible substrates for development as candidate reference materials for testing of children’s products by X-ray fluorescence spectrometry.  After results of this market research are obtained and analyzed and specifications are developed for lead-containing coatings that can meet NIST's minimum requirements, NIST may conduct a competitive procurement and subsequently award a Purchase Order.  If at least two qualified small businesses are identified during this market research stage, then any competitive procurement that resulted would be conducted as a small business set-aside.


NIST has a need for lead-containing coatings that would meet the following criteria:

1.	Production Size and Unit Dimensions:
The goal is to produce at least three different materials.  Each one will consist of a coating film on a polymer substrate.  The production run of each material will consist of at least 1500 samples.  Each material will have one of three Pb concentrations and one of two coating thicknesses applied.  It is envisioned that the final form of individual samples will be rectangular with dimensions in the range of 3.5 cm (1.4”) or greater on each side up to 8 cm x 13 cm (3” x 5”).  The coated area must be large enough for measurement of a circular area of 2.5 cm2 or greater at four or more distinct, non-overlapping locations on each piece.

2.	Pb Concentration:
The coating must contain lead (Pb) at concentrations up to 300 mg/kg in the dried or cured coating film.  The coating must be a reasonable simulant or an example of the types of paints, thermoplastics, lacquers and other coatings commonly used on toys and other children’s products.  In the coating layer, the Pb concentration must be uniform across each piece and across the entire production run.  Ideal location-to-location variability should be much less than 10 % relative standard deviation.  Target Pb concentrations are 90 mg/kg, and 300 mg/kg.  A third coating will not contain detectable Pb, preferably 3 mg/kg or less.

3.	Coating Thickness:
Coating films are sought with at least two different thicknesses after curing among the three films:  10 &#61549;m to 20 &#61549;m (0.4 mils to 0.8 mils) and 40 &#61549;m to 50 &#61549;m (1.6 mils to 2.0 mils).  The uniformity of each thickness should be controlled to within a range of 10 % relative to the nominal thickness across the surface of each piece and across the production run for each combination of Pb concentration and layer thickness.  It would be of benefit if the vendor can provide measurements of thickness and density using documented test procedures.

4.	Substrate Requirements:
The substrate would be a relatively thin polymer sheet with surface roughness similar to the expected uniformity of the coating thickness.  The polymer must not contain detectable Pb, preferably 3 mg/kg or less.  The coating must adhere strongly to the sheet under flexure.  The finished product should be flexible enough to conform to the surface of a cylinder 3 cm diameter or smaller without damage.  

5.	Packaging:
It is envisioned that these materials will be sold in sets having one piece of each composition in a container that protects the coating surfaces from abrasion when not in use.  A durable, yet inexpensive design is sought.  The goal is to improve the useful life of the material.


An example of the materials being sought is NIST Standard Reference Material 2579a, a set of six sheets of polyester each coated with a uniform paint film containing Pb.  The six Pb concentrations were tinted different colors with the SRM number printed in a corner.  The set includes a blank with clear lacquer used in place of paint.  SRM 2579a was created for use in building inspections and remediation of lead paint.  The concentrations are at least two orders of magnitude higher than required at this time.  Documentation on SRM 2579a may found at https://srmors.nist.gov/tables/view_table.cfm?table=105-13.htm/.  Click the small, blue C icons to view the certificates of analysis for SRMs 2570 through 2579a.


NIST is seeking responses from all responsible sources, including large, foreign, and small businesses.  Small businesses are defined under the associated NAICS code for this effort, 541712, as those domestic sources having 500 employees or fewer.  Please include your company’s size classification in any response to this notice.  

Companies that manufacture coatings of custom compositions or have capabilities to create the materials described above are requested to email a detailed report describing their abilities to todd.hill@nist.gov no later than the response date for this sources sought notice.  The report should include achievable specifications and any other information relevant to your product or capabilities.  The following information is requested to be provided as part of the response to this sources sought notice:  1. Name and address of the company providing the response.  2. A point of contact for the company (name, phone number, fax number and email address).  3. Any other relevant information that is not listed above which the Government should consider in developing its minimum specifications and finalizing its market research.

<DESC><p><strong>THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF CHILD HEALTH AND HUMAN DEVELOPMENT (NICHD)/NIH SEEKS CAPABILITY STATEMENTS FROM INTERESTED AND QUALIFIED POTENTIAL SOURCES TO PROVIDE LABORATORY SERVICES FOR THE NATIONAL CHILDREN'S STUDY. THE SUPPORT SERVICES BEING SOUGHT ARE RELATED TO THE ANALYSIS OF SPECIFIED CHEMICALS AND MICROBIOLOGICAL AGENTS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SAMPLES OF SOIL, DUST, AIR, WATER, AND FOOD THAT WILL BE COLLECTED THROUGHOUT THE STUDY (AS DESCRIBED BELOW). NICHD IS SEEKING INFORMATION ON THE CAPABILITIES OF SMALL (SB, SDB, WOSB, HUBZONE, VOSB, AND SDVOSB) BUSINESS ORGANIZATIONS INTERESTED IN PROVIDING THESE SERVICES.</strong>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>The Children's Health Act of 2000 authorized the NICHD and a consortium of other Federal Agencies to "...plan, develop, and implement a prospective cohort study, from birth to adulthood, to ...incorporate behavioral, emotional, educational, and contextual consequences to enable a complete assessment of the physical, chemical, biological, and psychosocial environmental influences of children's well-being." That study is now known as the National Children's Study (NCS). Investigators in the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS)--including the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD, the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS), and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)--and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), as well as other Federal agencies, have been planning and have begun to implement this study. The NCS will study the complex relationship between health and the environment through long-term follow-up of approximately 100,000 children and their families across the United States.</p>
<p>Study planners have identified the following child health areas as priorities for the NCS: pregnancy outcomes, neurodevelopment and behavior, injury, asthma, obesity, and physical development. As a result of the many study hypotheses being considered for the NCS, as well as the anticipation that other hypotheses will emerge during the course of the Study and afterward, several million environmental samples will be collected over the life of the project.</p>
<p>Environmental samples to be analyzed may include, but are not limited to: soil, dust wipes, vacuumed dust, particulate matter and gaseous air pollutants collected onto filters and passive samplers, tap water, and food samples. Many of these samples are expected to require immediate analysis. However, depending upon stability and Study needs, other samples will be stored between 6 and -80 &deg;C in the NCS Biological and Environmental Sample Repository (NICHD Contract). These samples will be withdrawn over time and sent to laboratories for analysis as required.It is expected that 90% of all environmental samples collected will be analyzed within one year after collection. In addition, the laboratory may be requested to package and ship unused portions of samples or prepared samples (ampulated vials of sample digestate or extract) to the NCS Repository. Laboratories must be able to provide results of analysis, quality control data, and raw data in an electronic data delivery format to be specified by the Government.</p>
<p>Plans for sample collection and analysis for the Study are evolving. At present, the specific types of environmental analyses required along with the analytes of interest within the first 5 years of collection are listed in Table 1.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A contract is anticipated to be used for the National Children's Study Environmental Laboratories.

<DESC>This Sources Sought Notice (SS) is for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the National Institute of Aging (NIA) or the National Institutes of Health (NIH).
The purpose of this Sources Sought Notice is to identify qualified small businesses including 8(a), HUBZone, Women Owned Small business, Small disadvantaged Business, and/or Service-Disabled Veteran-owned business concerns that are interested in and capable of performing the work described herein. Teaming and partnering among small businesses is encouraged.
The NIA does not intend to award a contract on the basis of responses to this Sources Sought Notice, nor otherwise pay for the preparation of any information submitted. As a result of this Sources Sought Notice, the NIA may issue a Request for Proposal (RFP). THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. However, should such a requirement materialize, no basis for claims against NIA shall arise as a result of a response to this Sources Sought Notice or the NIA's use of such information as either part of our evaluation process or in developing specifications for any subsequent requirement.
If an RFP is issued, it is anticipated that one (1), cost-reimbursement, completion type contract will be awarded for a period of five (5) years with an option for yearly extensions up to two (2) additional years and/or additional quantities. This contract may include incentives, award fees, and/or be performance based. 
The National Institute of Aging (NIA) is seeking qualified small businesses to provide support to the Intramural Research Branch (IRB), of the National Institutes of Aging (NIA) within the NIH, to provide drug development and toxicology screening support as described below.
This is a re-competition of the current contract with SRI International, Inc. which ends in September, 2009. This is the third re-competition of this contract. 
Efforts in developing and testing new drugs for the prevention and treatment of the cognitive impairment and behavioral symptoms associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) represent a major programmatic activity of the National Institute on Aging (NIA) but continue to be hindered by the lack of access of many academic investigators and small businesses to animal testing facilities to evaluate the preclinical toxicology of potential therapeutics. The present paucity of compounds which can uniformly slow or reverse the progression of AD or ameliorate the symptoms or delay the onset requires that every effort be made to facilitate the development and testing of new compounds. The need to develop therapeutics for other aging-related diseases is also apparent. Additionally, the advent of Positron Emission=2 0Tomography (PET) imaging agents for assessing brain beta-amyloid and other pathophysiological features of AD requires toxicological testing of these agents prior to human studies.
The contract provides toxicology resources to academic and small business investigators who believe they have promising compounds for the treatment or prevention of Alzheimer's disease or other aging-related diseases or have PET imaging agents but who do not have the resources to perform the required toxicology studies. This contact provides investigators access to toxicological evaluations that are required by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) when requesting an Investigational New Drug (IND) designation for clinical studies. This preclinical drug-development program expands the potential range of drug therapies and imaging agents for Alzheimer's disease and other aging-related diseases by making these resources available to a larger and more diverse group of investigators. 
This contract complements NIAs support of studies in preclinical drug discovery and development through a variety of grant and contract mechanisms for drugs to prevent and treat Alzheimers disease and other aging-related diseases and for imaging  agents. It provides NIA with the capability to translate basic science research into clinical trials by providing the resources needed by individual investigators and small companies to generate the toxicology data required to obtain an IND from the FDA to do initial human studies. Thus, the continuing availability of this contract is an important part of NIAs efforts to facilitate drug discovery, development, and testing for Alzheimers disease and other diseases of aging.
Capability statements from qualified small businesses should address their experience and capabilities in the following seven (7) areas: (1) analytical chemistry; (2) pharmacokinetics and bioavailability; (3) preliminary toxicity screens; (4) IND-directed toxicology studies; (5) safety pharmacology; (6) GLP and AAALAC accreditations; and (7) experience performing contracts of similar size and scope to this requirement. Capability statements should not exceed 10 single-sided pages (minimum 12 pt. font), excluding attachments.
Work assignment procedures may be utilized to control costs and effort.  Over the 5 year base period it is estimated that approximately 30,000 total labor hours would be required. Of these, approximately 7% would be professional staff hours and 93% support staff hours.
Your establishment must be in compliance with FDA Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) regulations and animal facilities must be accredited by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC).  For contract award you must have an Animal handling Certificate.

<p>***NOAA's Acquisition &amp; Grants Office, Mountain Region Acquisition Division, intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with the University Corporation of Advanced Internet Development (UCAID).</p>
<p>***The sole source determination is based on the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) requirement for WAN connectivity to both the commodity Internet and the Next Generation Internet (NGI, Internet2 or I2). Internet2 is a consortium of over 70 leading corporations, 45 government agencies, laboratories and other institutions of higher learning as well as over 50 international partner organizations working to develop and deploy advanced network applications and technologies, accelerating the creation of the future commodity Internet. Internet2 has built an advanced backbone network known as Abilene that connects regional network aggregation points, called GigaPOPs. Membership in I2 and connection to the I2 network are restricted to universities, research agencies, corporations and affiliate members. All other public network traffic must traverse the commodity Internet. Internet 2 is a project of the University Corporation for Advanced Internet Development (UCAID) which administers service for both NOAA Boulder and NOAA Silver Spring. UCAID/I2is the only such network that reaches multiple large NOAA sites and collaborative partners, providing a large-scale infrastructure for research collaboration.</p>
<p>***This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation package is available. However, firms that believe they can provide services that fully meet the Government's requirements may submit substantiating documentation in writing to the identified point of contact within 15 days after publication of this synopsis. Such documentation will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to conduct a competitive procurement, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. STATEMENT OF WORK<BR>FOR CELLULAR TELEPHONE SIGNAL<BR>PENETRATION IN SEMI-PERMANENT BUILDINGS<BR><BR>1.  BACKGROUND.  The semi-permanent buildings brought in for BRAC initiatives at the Brooke Army Medical Center, Fort Sam Houston, Texas, do not allow for voice and data signals to be accessed inside the buildings from mobile devices such as Blackberries and cell phones.  This requirement is to procure and install the necessary equipment to allow for the signal penetration in some of the key buildings.  The occupants of these key buildings include our Command Group and support staff, the Troop command, the SAMBIO Office, and the GPRCO contracting office.  <BR><BR>2.  DESCRIPTION.  The solutions to be deployed shall have the capability of enhancing both the 800MHz cellular band (Blocks A & B) and the full range of the PCS band although initially coverage for the E Block only is required.  Expansion to cover other bands within the PCS spectrum shall not require additional hardware.<BR><BR>3.  SPECIFIC TASKS.  <BR><BR>3.1  General.  The contractor shall provide all the necessary labor and materials to deploy a signal enhancement system that will allow AT&T cellular devices to operate satisfactorily in both voice and data modes in two separate groups of four buildings.  The groups of buildings are hereinafter referred to as the MWR group and the 1100 group.<BR><BR>3.1.1.  The signal enhancement devices shall operate in a full duplex mode and be capable of amplifying signals by as much as 85 db.  All devices to be used must be approved by AT&T Engineering.  The only AT&T nationally approved repeater manufacturers are CSI, Andrew, and Powerwave.  The amplifier/repeater must be from one of these manufacturers for approval from AT&T Engineering.  AT&T POC is Rodney Clayton, 512-879-7426.<BR><BR>3.1.2.  Only antennas specifically designed for dual band operation in an indoor environment shall be used within the buildings.<BR><BR>3.1.3.

All cables routed inside the occupied areas of the buildings shall be run in existing cable trays and shall be plenum rated air heliax.<BR><BR>3.2  MWR Group.  These buildings (numbers 3532, 3534, 3536, 3538) are located on Fort Sam Houston off of Trooper Road.<BR><BR>3.2.1.  The amplifier/repeater shall be installed in the communications room of Building 3536.<BR><BR>3.2.2.  Dual pickup antennas with 10-11 db gain shall be deployed on the input side of the signal enhancement device.<BR><BR>3.2.3.  The Government, from AT&T, will provide the information as to which cell site should be used for the system input.<BR><BR>3.2.4.  The signal shall be distributed from the amplifier/repeater through a four-port splitter with separate cable runs to each of the other three buildings.<BR><BR>3.2.5.  Digital attenuators shall be used as required in Buildings 3536 and 3534 to balance the system gain with the other buildings where longer cable runs are required.<BR><BR>3.3  1100 Group.  These buildings (numbers 1100, 1101, 1102, 1103)  are located on Fort Sam Houston off of Garden Ave.<BR><BR>3.3.1.

The Government, from AT&T, will provide the information as to which cell site should be used for the system input.<BR><BR>3.3.4.  The output signal from the amplifier/repeater shall pass through a two-port signal splitter to the manhole area outside the building (1100).<BR><BR>3.3.5.  A two-port weatherized signal splitter shall be installed in the manhole area and cable routed to Buildings 1103 and 1102 where another two-port weatherized signal splitter shall be installed.<BR><BR>3.3.6.  From the Building 1100 two-port signal splitter the signal shall be routed to Building 1101 and into the weatherized signal splitter in the manhole area and from the weatherized signal splitters to Buildings 1102 and 1103.<BR><BR>4.  PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE.  The period of performance for this requirement, to include lead time for equipment purchase and delivery, shall be sixty (60) calendar days from the date of award.<BR><BR>5.

0004 Period of Performance:
Base year (12 months from date of award) plus 4 x 1 year option upon satisfactory performance. 


Technical Requirements:

1.	This requirement is for training. Naval Special Warfare has but one broad requirement for selecting service providers for training its operators: We want the best training available. Period.
2.	In the interest of being good stewards of the government’s dollar, NSWG1 Mobility will select the best value proposal based on three criteria. The #1 priority is Technical Merit. We want the best training.  We do not wish to simply select a training provider that has (on paper) demonstrated capability to conduct the training but an ability to deliver the best quality of training specific to our mission needs. 
3.	The following criteria will be used to assess best value. This is a prioritized rating system:
a.	Technical Merit. The technical merit of a responder will comprise 50% of the total assessed value of the proposal. This is the number one priority in selection of training providers. Technical merit will drive source selection. Technical Merit will be demonstrated by the following criteria:
i.	Company Collective Experience in Off-Road Driving Instruction. Vendors will provide documentation to their collective experience in training SOF operators in tactical vehicle operation and employment.
ii.	Company Focus. NSWG1 Mobility is looking for an off-road, tactical vehicle training specialist. Vendors who demonstrate a more diverse background in areas other than tactical vehicle training will be rated negatively compared to those who focus solely on tactical vehicle training. Assessment on company focus will be determined by density of tactical vehicle training provided in FY08.
iii.	Platform Expertise.  Vendors who provide training on a diverse fleet of tactical vehicles will be rated positively. Vendors who provide training on a limited number of tactical vehicles, or only one tactical vehicle type will be rated negatively.
iv.	Instructor Expertise. Vendors will provide background biographies on their instructor cadre articulating qualitative and quantitative experience in mounted tactical vehicle operations, tactical vehicle training, tactical vehicle development, and off-road racing experience. Vendors who omit this information or provide less documented expertise will be rated negatively. Vendors with a better demonstrated experience level in their instructor cadre will be rated positively.
v.	Recent Experience. NSWG1 requires vendors demonstrate recent experience in the conduct of tactical vehicle training at a level stipulated in the scope of work. Recent is defined as within the last six months. This experience requirement is separate from past performance. Those vendors who omit or show a lack of recent experience will be rated negatively.
vi.	Program of Instruction. Each vendor will submit a Program of Instruction specific to the scope of work. At a minimum, the POI will include type of training (classroom discussion, hands-on practical exercise, hands-on evaluation, demonstration, etc…), instructor to student ratio, training venue, and training schedule. NSWG1 Mobility Technical representative will assess the POI to determine relevance to technical merit. As maintenance training is a requirement of the scope of work, Vendors will submit a technical inspection checklist specific to the HMMWV (M998/M1113) and SOF operations.
vii.	Demonstrated Technical Expertise. Vendors will provide answers to the following questions to demonstrate their technical expertise in the HMMWV:
1.	Define Brake Throttle-Modulation and perform brake-throttle modulation
2.	Describe the four primary factors in proper brake throttle modulation
3.	Define Line of Attack and demonstrate proper line of attack
4.	Identify the number and type of differentials standard on a HMMWV
5.	Define Side-Type Obstacles including proper positioning for each
These questions are part of a proficiency battery (written exam) currently in use by NSWG1. Vendors will provide their best answer to each question. Incorrect responses will be rated negatively and adversely affect Technical Merit assessment.  
viii.	Tactical Vehicle Training Clientele. Naval Special Warfare Group One is a Special Operations Force. Vendors will list all clients for which they’ve performed tactical vehicle operator training for in the past six years. Those vendors showing a greater clientele will be rated positively. Those showing a lesser clientele will be rated negatively.
ix.	Training facilities. 
1.	Vendors will at a minimum provide HVAC-equipped classroom facilities for 24 personnel.  Classroom facilities will be located within 10 miles of government-furnished lodging such as BOQ/BEQ. Lodging on the economy will not meet this requirement.  Training area must be within 600 miles of Coronado, CA.
2.	Off-road training venues will be characterized by high (4,000 ft ASL minimum) desert terrain as that found in Afghanistan.  
3.	For CLINs 0001 and 0002, vendors will list tactical vehicle training conducted on the identified venues in the past six months. At a minimum, vendors will identify unit trained and inclusive training dates the specified training venue was used. 
4.	For CLIN 0003, vendors will designate extreme trail to be navigated and its rating using an independent rating system commensurate with the California 10 scale as employed by Jeep Jamboree USA® organization. The Rubicon Trail is the habitual trail utilized by NSWG1 for CLIN 0003. Vendors failing to specify a trail or it’s adequately demonstrate its difficulty rating commensurate with the Rubicon trail will be rated negatively. Vendors failing to detail training conducted on the CLIN 0003 extreme trail specified will be rated negatively.  At a minimum, vendors will identify unit trained and inclusive training dates the specified training venue was used.

b.	Past Performance. Documented past performance will be rated 25% of the overall assessed merit of submitted proposals. Those vendors who show no past performance will not be rated negatively. Those vendors with documented past performance in tactical vehicle operator training will be rated positively determined by density and scope of past performance within the past year.
c.	Cost/Price. Price will be rated at 25% of the overall assessed merit of submitted proposals based on a simple ranking system of highest to lowest of responders.
4.	NSWG1 is soliciting professional, full-time tactical vehicle training specialists. The government is not obligated to award.
5.	NSWG1 Mobility requests LOGSU Contracting specify this requirement be Service-Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business set aside.
6.	The grading will go as follows:  50% technical merit, 25% past performance, 25% price.  Each bid category/subcategory will be graded on a scale of 1 to 10 by NSWG-1 Tactical Ground Mobility Proponent.  10 being the best and 1 being worst.

(a) Prohibitions.
Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause, or with any subsidiary of such an entity. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of national security.

Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for at least 80 percent each place it appears.
Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)—
(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held—
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.
Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.  (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.
(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:
(i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights.
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:
(i) warrants;
(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.

<DESC>The due date for offers is hereby extended to January 13, 2009 at 2:00 PM United States Eastern Standard Time (Fort Belvoir Local Time).  

This is a solicitation for worldwide laboratory testing and sampling at a central laboratory. As part of a coordinated Defense Energy Support Center (DESC), United States Navy (USN), and United States Coast Guard (USCG) effort to monitor commercial distillate fuel quality, approximately 49 USCG vessels have been equipped with in line fuel sampling flanges and several Navy ships are in the process of being equipped.  The sampling flanges, supplied as Government furnished equipment (GFE), have been installed in the vessel bunker manifold at the custody transfer point.  A continuous drip sample will be collected by ships’ personnel from the custody transfer point into a 10-liter disposable sample container.  The sample will be decanted into a 1-gallon shipping container for transport to the in-line sampling laboratory for analysis.  In-line bunkering samples will be obtained for every commercial fuel product taken onboard participating USCG vessels and in select ports for USN vessels.  This will include both DESC Bunker Contracts and Open Market purchases worldwide.  The in-line sampling shipping materials supplied by the Contractor shall include a set of domestic and international shipping labels so that the routine in-line bunker sample may be shipped from the vessel to the Contractor for analysis.  Therefore, the Contractor shall be responsible for a “turn-key” operation, which includes as a minimum assembling the in-line fuel sampling collection kit, shipping the kits to USCG and USN vessels worldwide, maintaining and updating the in-line fuel sampling instruction manual, the ability to ship fuel samples domestically and/or internationally to the designated analysis laboratory, conducting the required fuel sample analyses, and reporting of the results to DESC, USCG, and USN.

Base period of performance is April 1, 2009 through March 31, 2010 with three (3) successive one-year option periods.  This is an unrestricted procurement with full and open competition.  This will be a fixed price contract.

Offers must be mailed to the address in the attached solicitation document by the above date and time; no faxed or emailed offers will be accepted.  All responsible sources are invited to submit offers. DESC anticipates conducting negotiations with offerors submitting proposals under the subject solicitation listed above but reserves the right to make contract award based on initial offers submitted.

Please download the attached solicitation and all amendments.

ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS POSED 


“Access to the JOC requires as least a security clearance of SECRET. Obtaining security clearances is the responsibility of the contractor.”  Is this clearance required for all staff who may work on this project, or for specific staff who will work onsite at the JOC (if any). This is not a requirement we have obtained before. We run routine background checks on all our employees, but have not sought any federal clearances before. Could you please provide information on how to start this process?

Security Clearances ANSWER:  Per the JOC commander, "personnel onsite must be screened by the provost marshal. So we would need to see the results of their background checks. I think that would be a good compromise."  Accordingly, for situations involving personnel without Secret clearances, background check data would need to be forwarded to us for all onsite personnel, either via this e-mail address, or via postal services: ATTN: Scott Katherman, 2452 Fairview Dr., Carson City, NV  89701.

“Technical questions and industry responses are to be sent via email to Scott Katherman at scott.katherman@us.army.mil.”  Do we also need to mail a hard copy of our response?

Technical Questions ANSWER: It is sufficient to send questions to my e-mail address, and I forward said questions to the technical representatives.  Hard copies at this time are not required.

“Interested parties possessing the capacity/capability to deliver the above-outlined product and meeting the requirements are requested to provide a White Paper…”  Do you have a particular format you would like for us to follow? Is there any page limitation?

White Paper Format ANSWER:  There is no required format; however, it would be best to use the typical new project format (i.e. Description of the problem as understood by the vendor; organizational overview; proposed project timelines; qualifications; outcomes; evaluations; funding; past projects (much emphasis).  Ensure the aforementioned questions and any other questions and issues from the RFI are addressed.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health, Clinical Center is conducting a market survey/sources sought to help determine the availability and technical capability of qualified small businesses, veteran-owned small businesses, service disabled veteran-owned small businesses and/or HUBZONE small businesses capable of serving the needs mentioned below. This market survey/sources sought announcement is not a request for proposals and the Government is not committed to award a contract pursuant to this announcement. The information from this market research is for planning purposes only and will assist the Government in planning its acquisition strategy. This is strictly market research and the Government will not entertain questions concerning this market research. The Government will not pay for any costs incurred in the preparation of information for responding to this market survey.

The Clinical Center Physical Disabilities Section of the Rehabilitation Medicine Department, National Institutes of Health has a requirement to replace the 5-year old Motion Capture system and Analysis Software in patient care and human subject research.  Since 2003, Motion Capture Systems has made considerable technological advances in motion capture technology and the software that supports 3D movement analysis has transitioned to a next generation hardware/software system. The older generation system will no longer be able to adequately carry-out its patient care and human subject research responsibilities.
  The applicable North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 334510.  The Contractors response shall provide detailed information on the capability of Motion capture in your capability statement. Additionally the Contractors response shall also include any other specific and relevant information related to the requirements of this project that will enable the Government to determine the capabilities of the company’s to perform the requirements described in this synopsis: Create a motion capture system that allows the study of many different types and speeds of motion in patients or research subjects of different body proportions.
a)	Provide standard lenses (18 mm and 20 mm are acceptable) and  wide angle lenses (12 mm).  
b)	Have a frame rate at full resolution of at least 250 frames/second.

<DESC>The announcement is amended as follows:  In order to be considered for award of this IDIQ contract, firm(s) must demonstrate they possess all professional qualifications, including individual professional licenses, certifications, etc. for those states listed in the primary area of coverage.  Firms relying on NCARB or other means to meet this requirement must demonstrate that each state accepts the proposed method of obtaining additional registration for each discipline.
The following questions and answers are provided:1.	 Question:  Where may I locate the solicitation in regards to the efforts discussed under S2000081000?Answer: 	The announcements are posted at FedBizOpps.gov. www.fbo.gov/index?sopport;unity&mode=form&id=eedf589bdbda38874bd670c3332851a2&tab=core&_cview=0

2.	Question:  My question is regarding licensure. Are you asking that the applicant be currently licensed in all the regions and states listed? Or is the requirement that the "registration requirements can be met"? The phrase in quotes is from the solicitation and could be interpreted that the architect has the ability through NCARB and or the local jurisdiction to obtain additional registrations but may not currently have registrations in all those locationsAnswer:  In order to be considered for award of this IDIQ contract, firm(s) must demonstrate they possess all professional qualifications, including individual professional licenses, certifications, etc. for those states listed in the primary area of coverage.  Firms relying on NCARB or other means to meet this requirement must demonstrate that each state accepts the proposed method of obtaining additional registration for each discipline.  
3.	Question:  The requirements for this project are quite clear, but we write nonetheless to request consideration around professional licensure in all jurisdictions (primary area).  Maintaining licensure in multiple jurisdictions is expensive and time consuming, especially to small businesses, which are otherwise specifically targeted by this solicitation.  We ask that the government consider an arrangement, as it has done for the secondary area, that would allow proposers capable of securing timely registration in the primary localities (via NCARB certification, in our case) to respond to the solicitation without penalty.Answer:  The announcement has been amended to incorporate the clarification provided for the answer to Question No. 2.  
4.	Question:  Due to the Holiday season and scheduled time-off planned by some of our key staff, we would like to request a 2 week extension for responses to both the full-and-open and SB set-aside A/E IDIQ solicitations (i.e., N200009110 and N2000091000, respectively).  Answer:  Responses remain due by 4:00 p.m. Mountain Standard Time, January 12, 2009.
5.	Question:  Confirm whether or not the one you issued is or is not a small business set aside.Answer:  Announcement N2000091100 is a full and open competition and Announcement N2000091000 is a small business set-aside.
6.	Question.  Is the Presolicitation issued for an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity Contract for Multi-Disciplinary Architect-Engineer Services under N2000091100 for Sources Sought S2000081000, issued in November? Answer:  Yes.
7.	Question:  We understand that this is a PRE-solicitation notice and not a Request for Proposals. However, the SF330 is due in its entirety on January 14, 2009. Will NPS request RFPs from firms/teams submitting these LOIs and SF330s? Or will a separate RFP be issued publicly at a later date? Answer:  Following the evaluation of submittals, the most highly qualified firms will be asked to interview with the NPS.  After interviews are complete, the most highly qualified firms will be evaluated and final selections will be made.  An RFP will be issued to the selected firms.
8.	Question:  The advertisement indicates that we would need to be licensed in all of the primary states (8 listed) and two islands listed in the advertisement.  Answer:  In order to be considered for award of this IDIQ contract, firm(s) must demonstrate they possess all professional qualifications, including individual professional licenses, certifications, etc. for those states listed in the primary area of coverage.  Firms relying on NCARB or other means to meet this requirement must demonstrate that each state accepts the proposed method of obtaining additional registration for each discipline.  
9.	Question:  Could you please send me the Pre-solicitation/RFQ for N2000091100 and any amendments or relevant correspondents regarding the RFQ?  Answer:  Please see FedBizOpps for the Sources Sought and amendment to Sources Sought.  The link is provided in the answer to Question No. 1. 10.	Question:  Could you please add me to the list of potential respondents so I will receive any subsequent correspondence?Answer:  NPS does not maintain a list of potential respondents.  All correspondence will be posted on FedBizOpps.gov.
 11.	Question:  Could you confirm that Solicitation # N2000091100 is not limited to small businesses and, if you qualify as a small business you should submit under Solicitation # N2000091000?Answer:  Announcement No. N2000091100, the fifth to last paragraph states, "This RFQ is issued under full and open competition". 12.	Question:  The NAICS code 541310 listed in the information I have about the contract is for architectural firms.  Given your understanding of the potential services under this contract, could a Landscape Architecture firm be the prime/lead consultant?Answer:  It is anticipated an architectural firm will be the prime. 13.	Question:  The RFQ states "In order to be considered for award of this IDIQ contract, firm(s) must demonstrate they possess all professional qualifications, including individual professional licenses, certifications, etc. for those states listed in the primary area of coverage."  If a firm is lacking one or two of the states/territories listed in the primary area of coverage, but has filed the paperwork to receive all professional qualifications in those states/territories, will the firm be disqualified from consideration?Answer:  In order to be considered for award of this IDIQ contract, firm(s) must demonstrate they possess all professional qualifications, including individual professional licenses, certifications, etc. for those states listed in the primary area of coverage.  Firms relying on NCARB or other means to meet this requirement must demonstrate that each state accepts the proposed method of obtaining additional registration for each discipline.  
14.	Question:  Will all answers to questions submitted be distributed to potential proposers?Answer:  Yes. 15.	Question:  In the announcement under the 'place of performance' it is suggested to see the details for complete requirements.  I was not able to locate any specific requirements.  Could you please define the place of performance?Answer:  See first paragraph "The National Park Service (NPS), Denver Service Center (DSC), 12795 West Alameda Parkway, Denver, Colorado, 80225, is seeking qualified firm(s) or organization(s) to provide Multi-Disciplinary Architect-Engineer Design Services under an Indefinite Quantity contract for a variety of projects within areas of national significance at locations throughout the Southeast  Regions of the NPS, which includes the states, possessions and territories of Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, Florida, Tennessee, Kentucky, South Carolina, North Carolina, Virginia, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands.. (primary coverage area). The secondary area of coverage is nationwide,"   
16.	Question:  Regarding the above referenced solicitation and assuming it is for reselection, can you provide the name(s) of the incumbent firm(s)?Answer:  Grieves Worrall Wright & O'Hatrick Inc., is the incumbent firm.  
17.	Question:   Is it acceptable to be "in progress" with licensure (NCARB) in the remaining states at time of submission of our qualifications?Answer:  In order to be considered for award of this IDIQ contract, firm(s) must demonstrate they possess all professional qualifications, including individual professional licenses, certifications, etc. for those states listed in the primary area of coverage.  Firms relying on NCARB or other means to meet this requirement must demonstrate that each state accepts the proposed method of obtaining additional registration for each discipline.  
18.	Question:  Under Required Disciplines there is a listing for "Construction Engineering"; can you clarify what the responsibilities of this consultant are?Answer:  Construction engineering concerns the planning and management of the construction of structures such as highways, bridges, airports, railroads, buildings, dams, and reservoirs. Construction of such projects requires knowledge of engineering and management principles and business procedures, economics, and human behavior. Construction engineers engage in the design of temporary structures, quality assurance and quality control, building and site layout surveys, on site material testing, concrete mix design, cost estimating, planning and scheduling, safety engineering, materials procurement, and cost engineering and budgeting.Construction engineering is differentiated from construction management from the standpoint of the level of mathematics, science and engineering used to analyze problems and design a construction process.
19.	Question:  Under Required Disciplines you refer to "Hazardous Materials Abatement (primary lead, asbestos, and contaminated soil)". Is this consultant to be part of the evaluation and remediation requirement studies or expected to actually perform the remediation work as well?Answer:  Just a part of the evaluation and remediation requirement studies.
20.	Question:  "Licensed Mechanical Administrator" is not a term we are familiar with.  What are the requirements for this role?  Is this the same as a licensed Mechanical Engineer?  Similarly, is a "Licensed Electrical Engineer" the same as a licensed Electrical Engineer?  Please elaborate on the qualifications and certifications expected of the person(s) who will fill these roles.   Answer:  Similar to a mechanical engineer, however in some states the installation or design on HVAC type systems must be supervised by a licensed mechanical engineer. For the purposes of this IDIQ a licensed mechanical engineer will meet our requirements. Similarly, is a "Licensed Electrical Engineer" the same as a licensed Electrical Engineer?  Yes, a licensed electrical engineer is the same as a licensed electrical engineer. 
21.	Question:  Do section dividers (tabs) and the proposal cover and back count towards the page limit?  Answer:  No. 22.	Question:  Should SF 330 Part II's be included with our proposal? Answer:  Yes
23.	Question:  The solicitation states that the portfolio should consist of no more than 5 projects (versus the required 10 projects on SF 330 Part 1 Section F).  Please verify. Answer:  The portfolio should consist of no more than 5 projects.

Re:       FINAL Small Business Outreach Conference - New U.S. Courthouse Project
 
Attached is the flier for our final Small Business outreach event.  Please mark Thursday, January 8th from 1pm to 4pm on your calendar.  
 
This “Outreach Conference” will be different from our previous events.  Many of the regions leading and largest subcontractors are scheduled to participate in this event.  Their goal is simple - network with small business firms, you, and create new partnerships for the Courthouse project.
 
This project has very aggressive goals for Small Business.  45% of the subcontracted dollars must go to firms which fall under federal size guidelines.  The most common size thresholds are $14 million for sub-trades and $33.5 million for Engineering and General Contractors.  If you fall under these guidelines, you should not miss this event.  This project will create many 1st, 2nd, and 3rd tier subcontracting opportunities.  Don’t miss your chance to create new partnerships.
 
For more information on the project please visit our website at www.sdcourtproject.org

<DESC>The following information is being added to Paragraph 2:<BR><BR>Work may include the ability to develop and incorporate sustainable planning products and documents in accordance with Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) program directives.<BR><BR>The response date is also being extended to January 20, 2009.<BR><BR>1.  CONTRACT REQUIREMENT:  This contract is being procured in accordance with the Brooks A-E Act as implemented in FAR Subpart 36.6.   Firms will be selected for negotiation based on demonstrated competence and qualifications for the required work.  The A-E services are to provide Master Planning and Geographic Information System (GIS) related services to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) for various Federal, State and local agencies.  This would be an area of coverage for all major Federal agencies, States and local counties and municipalities within the South Pacific Divisions.  It is anticipated a majority of the work will be located within South Pacific Divisions existing military and civil works boundaries (states of California, Colorado, Idaho, Nevada, Utah, Arizona, New Mexico, Oregon, Texas and Wyoming).  However, to support USACE customers, Army Chief of Staff for Installation Management (ACSIM), Installation Management Command (IMCOM), Air Combat Command (ACC) and Global Strike Command, work may be required throughout the remainder of the Continental United States, and world-wide. This work will include all Architectural-Engineering (A-E) and related services necessary to complete the assigned task orders for master planning and GIS related services.  A specific statement of work will be issued with each task order. This procurement will be conducted under North American Industrial Classification System Code (NAICS) 541310, Architectural Services; SIC Code 8712, which has a small business size standard of maximum $4.5 million of average annual receipts for its previous 3 fiscal years.  This requirement is 100% small business set-aside.   Since the contract is set aside for Small Business, FAR 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting, will be included in the contract. The clause requires that at least 50 percent of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the concern.  One firm-fixed price indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity contract will be negotiated and the first is anticipated to be awarded in February 2009. If the February 2009 date is not met, the one negotiated contract will be awarded within one year after the required response date to this announcement. The contract will be for a maximum of a one-year base period from the date of award and will contain options to extend 4 additional one-year periods.  The contract amount shall be $9.8 million total with the base and each option year in the amount of $1,960,000. The options may be exercised at the discretion of the Government.  At the discretion of the Government, the option years may be exercised early if the Total Estimated Price is exhausted or nearly exhausted.  If the option  is exercised  prior to the one-year anniversary of the contract award date, or the anniversary of exercising an option, the new option year rates will take effect on the anniversary date of the contract award.  If the Total Estimated Price of the base year or any option year is not awarded within that years 12 month performance period and the Government has elected to exercise a subsequent option year, the remaining unused dollar amount may be added on to the Total Estimated Price of the option period contract amount. At the discretion of the Government, if an option year is exercised early and unused capacity is rolled over, the Government may extend the period of service to coincide with the anniversary date of that period. The minimum guarantee for the base year of the contract will be $39,200.  The wages and benefits of service employees (see FAR 22.10) performing under these contracts must be at least equal to those determined by the Department of Labor under the Service Contract Act, as determined relative to the employees office location (not the location of the work).  If a subcontracting plan is required, Sacramento Districts recommended goal for work subcontracted is 70.0% for small business.  The goal further states that of the 70.0% to be subcontracted to small business. 6.2% is for small disadvantaged business (subset to small business), 7.0% is for small business/woman owned (subset to small business), and 0.9% is for Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (subset to small business).  If the selected firm submits a plan with lesser goals, it must submit written rationale of why the above goals are not met.  These figures are the current FY08 goals.  These goals are subject to change upon the FY09 goals being published.  If the presolicitation is still open, an amendment will be done to reflect the new FY09 goals.  If the posting has closed, the new goals will be communicated to the selected contractor.   Firms should indicate personnel and subcontractors selected to work on the contract and state their management structure. Details of the selection process will be included in the resultant contracts. To be eligible for contract award a firm or joint venture must be registered in the DoD Central Contractor Registration (CCR).  Register via the Internet Site at http://ccr.edi.disa.mil or by contacting the DoD Electronic Commerce Information Center at 1-800-334-3414 and complete annual representations and certifications at http://orca.bpn.gov.  <BR>Contractor Performance Evaluations:  In accordance with the provisions of Subpart 36.604 (Performance Evaluation) of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), A-E contractors performance shall be evaluated throughout the performance of the contract.  The United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) follows the procedures outlined in Engineering Pamphlet (EP) 715-1-7 to fulfill this FAR requirement.  For A-E contracts awarded at or above $30,000, the USACE will evaluate contractor performance and prepare a performance report using the Architect-Engineer Contract Administration Support System (ACASS), which is now a web-based system. After an evaluation (interim or final) is written up by the USACE, the contractor will have the ability to access, review and comment on the evaluation for a period of 30 days.  Accessing and using ACASS requires specific software, called PKI certification, which is installed on the users computer. The certification is a Department of Defense requirement and was implemented to provide security in electronic transactions.   The certification software could cost approximately $110 - $125 per certificate per year and is purchased from an External Certificate Authorities (ECA) vendor.   Current information about the PKI certification process and for contacting vendors can be found on the web site:    http://www.cpars.csd.disa.mil/.     If the Contractor wishes to participate in the performance evaluation process, access to CCASS and PKI certification is the sole responsibility of the Contractor.  The Secretary of the Armys Contractor Manpower Reporting (CMR) requirement will be incorporated into the anticipated contract.  The annual CMR requirement will apply to each task order which is funded by Army dollars; supports an Army mission; which benefits or supports any Army military, civilian, or contractor personnel; or when the Army is the executive agency for the mission being support.  The A-E will be allowed to include their costs for compliance with the CMR requirement as a line item in their price proposal for each task order subject to the CMR requirement.
