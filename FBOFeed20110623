<DESC>1. This Request for Information (RFI) is published to obtain information for use by the United States Air Force Electronic Systems Center Cryptologic Systems Division (AF ESC/HNC), Lackland Air Force Base, Texas, for market research and planning purposes only. This RFI is not a Request for Proposal, Invitation for Bid, or an announcement of a solicitation. There is no bid package or solicitation document associated with this announcement. Response to this RFI is strictly voluntary and will not affect any potential offeror's ability to submit an offer if a solicitation is released. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or otherwise pay for the information solicited. No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of preparing submissions in response to this RFI and the Government's use of such information.


2. This RFI addresses a potential effort to develop and demonstrate a modular approach to building NSA Type I cryptographic Aerospace Vehicle Equipment (AVE) products with configurable functionality to quickly address various COMSEC and TRANSEC requirements optimizing size, weight and power (SWaP). Products would allow mixing and matching of modules to provide user-unique cryptographic solutions. The intent is to prevent product- and vendor-unique "stovepiped" cryptographic solutions while enabling modular and configurable approaches to crypto solutions.


3. The Government is specifically interested in learning more about any cryptographic modules implemented as integrated circuits, Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASICs), multi-chip modules, or circuit boards that can be built into an End Cryptographic Unit (ECU) or are embedded in an on-orbit host platform to provide cryptographic services and support. The cryptographic modules would be capable of performing TRANSEC and Telemetry, Tracking and Commanding (TT&C) cryptographic functions compatible with cryptographic modernization program initiatives. These modules will be optimized to be integrated into a configurable chassis (e.g. an ECU), and also be capable of being used independently for classified data encryption, decryption, authentication, and TRANSEC. The approach will enable the use of standardized protocols and interfaces relative to integration of the cryptographic modules into a spacecraft communications system or EC! U. When integrated into an ECU or space platform, any future AVE modular products will be able to operate in Geostationary Orbit (GEO), Low Earth Orbit (LEO), Medium Earth Orbit (MEO), and Highly Elliptical Orbit (HEO). The prototype design will have NSA certification in mind.


4. The Government is interested in solutions that do not require development of a new hardware technology for a cryptographic engine (e.g., FPGAs or ASICs). The intent is to encourage the building of the cryptographic modules around Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 6 or better in accordance with the DoD Technology Readiness Assessment Deskbook, http://www.dod.gov/ddre/doc/DoD_TRA_July_2009_Read_Version.pdf.


5. If the work described in paragraphs 2, 3, and 4 were to be competed, would you be interested in competing for this effort? If so, would you be proposing as a Prime Contractor or Subcontractor? Are you a Small Business? If so, what is your small business status, e.g., 8(a), Small Disadvantaged Business, etc? Would you partner with other companies? Is your company owned by a foreign entity?


6. Do you have experience in development, prototyping, test, and/or production of these types of devices that could be used in the concept described in paragraphs 2, 3, and 4? Briefly describe your experience, limiting such description to no more than one page.


7. Based on your experience in your product lines, is the above description in paragraphs 2, 3, and 4 feasible? If not, why?


8. What is your assessment of the maturity of the technology required to accomplish this effort? What challenges do you see in achieving our goals?


9. Responses should be sent via e-mail to brandon.jernigan@us.af.mil and javier.flores.5@us.af.mil no later than close of business on 24 Jun 2011.

<SUBJECT>Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing
<SOLNBR>2011-Q-13591
<RESPDATE>070711
<CONTACT>Maria S Shamburger, Email HEG9@cdc.gov
<DESC>CDC, in collaboration with several state health departments, conducts population-based, laboratory-based surveillance for invasive disease caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, group A streptococcus (GAS), and group B streptococcus (GBS) through the Active Bacterial Core surveillance (ABCs) program of CDC's Emerging Infections Program Network. ABCs is used to follow trends in disease rates, to assess the effectiveness of public health interventions (e.g., vaccination), and to conduct special epidemiologic and laboratory studies. As a result, timely susceptibility testing and shipping to CDC of these pathogens is an integral function of ABCs.
<p>CDC has a requirement for a contractor to conduct antimicrobial susceptibility testing on 1500-3000 pneumococci each year. The precise number cannot be predicted because future disease trends cannot be predicted. Up to 3000 additional isolates of group A and B Streptococcus may also require testing though, again, this number cannot be predicted with certainty. The contractor will then ship in a timely fashion all isolates to CDC for additional testing. Because ABCs conducts numerous special studies of antimicrobial resistance and vaccine impact, testing and shipping of isolates and electronic submission of susceptibility data at least monthly is critical. ABCs data is used by investigators external to CDC; as well as, international partners, including ministries of health, to formulate policies regarding treatment recommendations and vaccine programs. Therefore, strict adherence to Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines is expected.</p>
<p>The Contractor is required to perform the following: <br /><br />1. Confirm identification of isolates as Streptococcus pneumoniae, GAS, or GBS.</p>
<p>2. Store all isolates in a manner that will ensure future viability. The isolates will be received from the CDC Streptococcal laboratory or directly from surveillance sites collaborating with CDC. Isolates received from surveillance sites then need to be shipped to CDC for additional characterization, e.g., serotyping.</p>
<p>3. Ship additional subcultures of each isolate to the CDC and ATSDR Specimen Packaging, Inventory and Repository (CASPIR) for permanent storage.</p>
<p>4. Perform antimicrobial susceptibility testing of S. pneumoniae, GAS, and GBS as outlined below in the scope of work.</p>
<p><br />This is a full and open competition. The NAICS code for this procurement is 62511. A firm fixed price contract in accordance with FAR part 15 is contemplated. There will be a base period of twelve (12) months and four 12-month option periods.</p>
<p>CDC will consider all responsible sources responding to this Request for Proposal (RFP). The RFP number 2011-Q-13591 will be available on or about July 7, 2011. The due date for receipt of proposals will be 30 days after posting of the RFP. All questions about the RFP shall be submitted via email to heg9@cdc.gov. The complete solicitation package will be available and posted on fbo.gov for downloading when issued. No telephone request of the solicitation will be accepted.</p>

<ARCHDATE>08072011
<CONTACT>kathy sthill, 202-493-1408

<a href="mailto:kathy.sthill@faa.gov">kathy.sthill@faa.gov</a>
<DESC>Status Update on FAA Program Planning for the NAS Voice System (NVS)
The FAA is restructuring the implementation segments for the NAS Voice System (NVS) to accelerate the demonstration of NextGen operational capabilities and the associated benefits.    In our face-to-face meetings with industry in December 2010, we stated that Segment 1 of NVS would consist of 28 systems for FAA test and support facilities, replacement of the VSCS in the En Route Environment, and a limited number of systems in the Terminal Environment. The Segment 1 NVS systems were to have the functionality to meet the requirements of the En Route and Terminal Environments to demonstrate the full range of required capabilities. In addition, the NVS would need to provide the flexibility to meet future NextGen requirements. Segment 2 would have consisted of systems primarily for the Terminal Environment.
Since December, the FAA has continued to assess its operational needs and refine the acquisition strategy based upon market survey findings. While the program scope will still address the functional requirements of the En Route, Terminal, and NextGen Future Facilities operating environments, Segment 1 of the NVS program will now focus on acquiring test systems to achieve the objectives of: (1) demonstrating NextGen capabilities (e.g., resource sharing, load balancing, and enterprise management); and (2) having a production-ready system for deployment to the any of the target environments, but with the expectation that new systems will likely be required in the Terminal Environment in the nearer term. 
Supporting the NextGen concept of operations remains a fundamental objective of the NVS program. The restructuring of the implementation segments enables the FAA to continue to meet the strategic objectives for the NVS program and reduce risk through the spiral evolution of system capabilities. Initial deployments for Segment 2 are anticipated to focus on Terminal and NextGen future facilities since those two environments are expected to present the most pressing operational needs. 
Although the program execution approach is being defined in terms of two distinct segments, the structuring of the segments is not based on system functionality, but rather the dual objectives of reducing implementation risk while demonstrating how NVS can support the NextGen concept of operations in the near term. The segmented approach also provides a separate decision point for NVS deployments during Segment 2 as the FAA's needs in that timeframe come into focus.
NVS is anticipated to be an indefinite delivery indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract addressing the scope of Segments 1 and 2. As a result of this restructuring, the key dates to the NVS procurement have been revised as follows:
		Final SIR Release -----------> November 2011 		Operational Assessment ------> Spring 2012		Contract Award --------------> August 2012
The NVS SIR will articulate the importance of a scalable and flexible system architecture as well as the FAA's desire to establish a partnership relationship with the system provider to work collaboratively with the FAA to evolve to the enterprise environment.
The FAA understands that this restructuring may influence vendor preparations for the NVS procurement. The FAA anticipates providing more detail on the restructuring of the NVS program and intends to solicit feedback from Industry in August 2011 to support the release of the Final SIR in November 2011. In the interim, any questions regarding this announcement and the NVS program should be directed to the Contracting Officer at Dixie.Harper@faa.gov.

<DESC>Purpose of the Announcement: In accordance with the FAA Acquisition Management System (FAA AMS) paragraph 3.2.2.4, to inform industry on the basis of the FAA's decision to contact with a selected source via single source procedures. In accordance with AMS Policy 3.2.1.3.12.2, all procurements of products available from Federal Prison Industries (FPI) anticipated to exceed $10,000 must be publicly announced on the internet or through other means, including procurements where FPI products are determined not to be the best value to FAA at the market survey stage.
The FAA, William J Hughes Technical Center intends to award a single source contract to UNICOR.
The furniture is currently being used by the FAA to support their requirements and therefore unable to obtain through any other known source.
UNICOR brings the following essential data experience:
-	UNICOR products are compatible and offer interchangeability with existing standardized furniture components in use at the WJHTC. -	Furniture components from another source would not afford ability to integrate, repair, and reconfigure the office space in a cost effective and efficient manner.
A full and open competition is not available for this procurement. If you're firm does not agree with the single source determination, please provide evidence of you firm's capabilities and experience in providing the above services, the FAA will evaluate this accordingly. All responses to this announcement must be directed to Jason Kuo via email (jason.kuo@faa.gov), no later than 2:00 pm EST on July 1st, 2011.

The RFP will be released as performance-based for the purpose of contracting in accordance with FAR 15.202, Advisory Multi-Step Process. In utilizing the "SevenSteps to Performance-Based Acquisition" methodology, the purpose of FNS is to identify viable vendors to provide call center and printing support services for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, formally Food Stamp Program).

Such research (1) educated FNS on industry capabilities, best practices, and experiences of other organizations on similar endeavors, as well as acquisition approaches utilized, and (2) assisted in developing the solicitation and acquisition strategy (Step 3 of the Seven Steps). Potential sources for market research were identified through several means: (1) keyword search on internet and SBA database, and (2) company names provided by government and industry contacts, suitable for acquiring the required services from small, medium or large businesses. Written responses to the market research questionnaire were reviewed and assessed on the basis of overall assessment of proposed solutions to meet the stated objectives and experience of respondents in supporting requirements similar in nature, scope and complexity for as those envisioned for this requirement. One-on-one conference sessions were subsequently conducted to allow further exchanges in greater depth between industry and FNS for the call centerand printing services approach.<br /><br />Based on the information FNS received from all submissions and conference sessions, as well as the evaluation of viable sources, FNS determined an "unrestricted" acquisition strategyis best suited to support this requirement. Please be advised that FNS will request proposals from a select group of companies that were deemed to be viable competitors and are qualified and able to provide these services, collectively the "competitive pool" (Step 4 of the Seven Steps process). When the RFP is released, other firmsmay also submit a proposal,provided they meet the requirements of the RFP.<br /><br />The term of the awardand anticipated contract type will be provided in the solicitation announcement.</p>

Dibrom 14 is supplied annually by KSC to theBrevard County Mosquito Control District (BCMCD) in accordance with the Mosquito ControlAgreement between KSC, Air Force Eastern Test Range, US Fish and Wildlife Service(USFWS), and Brevard County. AMVAC Chemical Corporation, the manufacturer of Dibrom 14,has verified that Adapco, Incorporated of Sanford, Florida is the sole distributor ofthis product for the state of Florida. Other authorized distributors are prohibited fromdistributing the product beyond their state or assigned territory. NASA/KSC intends topurchase the 19, 30-gallon drums of Dibrom 14 from Adapco, Incorporated of Sanford,Florida. Dibrom 14 is an adulticide used to control mosquitoes. There are several areasat the Launch Pads and Launch Complex 39, where normal chemicals used at KSC cannot besprayed due to chemical corrosiveness and flight hardware. Moreover, these areas are alsovery large and impossible to spray without an aircraft, which KSC does not possess. TheMosquito Control Agreement provides the equipment (aircraft) to spray large areas ofwater in the KSC area to control mosquitoes without having to spray directly around thelaunch pads. KSC procures and supplies the Dibrom 14 to BCMCD for spraying. Dibrom 14 isthe only chemical that can be used, because it is the only chemical BCMCD is licensed tospray in the KSC and impound areas.

<DESC>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA), Division of Environmental Science and Assessment (DESA) in New York, NY, intends to award a sole source fixed-price purchase order under authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part Thirteen, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, to FLIR Systems, Incorporated of North Billerica, Massachusetts. This purchase order will provide a FLIR GF320 infrared (IR) camera, 6 Degree IR lens, and one year of service.
The EPA currently uses FLIR IR cameras in support of EPA's air toxics initiative. These cameras are specific and compatible with EPA investigative procedures for air toxics and volatile organic compound (VOC) monitoring under EPA Reference Method 21. The only other known manufacturer of gas imaging cameras does not offer a product that is suitably portable for DESA's investigative requirements.
The FLIR GF320 is only available directly from the manufacturer and, thus, FLIR Systems is the only source available for this purchase.
No solicitation or Request for Quote (RFQ) is available for this procurement. Nevertheless, any firm that believes it is capable of meeting the EPA requirements described herein may submit a response; which, if received before the closing date of this announcement, will be considered. 
Responses to this posting must be made in writing. A determination not to compete the described purchase order based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Federal Government. Any questions should be directed to Christine Cervellieri via email (see below).

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

At the south end of the alignment the floodwall transitions to an earthen levee section where an existing SMUD 20" Gas Pipeline crosses the existing Union house Creek levee (1B2) alignment.  The levee will be approximately 80-feet long with a 2:1 landside slope, 3:1 waterside slope and a 12-foot crest width.  A 12-foot wide aggregate base patrol road with a pre-cast concrete drainage system will run along the entire alignment along the waterside of the floodwall.  Due to the limited space between the floodwall/levee and the existing private properties a retaining wall will be constructed along the east side of the patrol road.   Finally, two earthen ramps will be constructed at the north end of the alignment to provide access to the levee/floodwall from Deertree Court and the waterside of the floodwall/levee.  The Project will require a construction area which will be located a minimum of 25' from the centerline of the main line track on the east side of the tracks, and will extend 2,944 lineal feet and is 75 feet wide (total area of 69,020 square feet)<br><br><br>Acquisition Information:<br><br>THIS ACQUISITION IS PROCEEDING AS A 8(A) SMALL BUSINESS COMPETITIVE, INVITATION FOR BID (IFB).

<DESC>SYNOPSIS
<p><br />This acquisition is being conducted under FAR 6.303-1, Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements. A sole source contract to Lockheed Martin is required because significant portions of C4ISR systems and subsystems are based on proprietary software and technology that is closely integrated into Coast Guard's surface platforms. The Coast Guard's Command, Control, Computers, Communication Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) systems have been deployed and are now operational on multiple Coast Guard vessels, aircraft and shore facilities. The C4ISR is a suite of sensors that provide situational awareness to commanders and other personnel. Additionally, the C4ISR software integrates the sensors and interfaces with various command and control systems (radar, navigation, fire control, etc.) In order to sustain the C4ISR outlined above, the Coast Guard will be issuing a solicitation for: maintaining and enhancing the command and control software baselines; maintaining and enhancing the C4ISR systems deployed on all Coast Guard assets; providing hardware support to include Diminishing Manufacturing sources and Material shortages (DMSMS) - monitoring and implementing corrective measures; providing Depot Level Maintenance Support and other supportive services. At this time, there are no other sources that can fully provide the required support necessary to keep these complex systems operational.</p>

Do not contact the Ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical requirements. Such inquiries shall be directed to the Contract Specialist.<br /><br />A Draft Request for Proposal (DRFP) is expected to be posted for review and comment at a later date. The entire solicitation will be issued on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website at http://www.fbo.gov. All prospective offerors are responsible for monitoring this site for the release of all other information pertaining to this solicitation.<br /><br />While the Small Business Specialist, Janis Norelli, is the focal point for receipt of the statements of capabilities, technical questions should be directed to the Laboratory Program Manager, James Sieffert, 315-330-2344 or email James.Sieffert@rl.af.mil.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS. This request is an announcement for information/market research for planning purposes. The synopsis does not constitute a request for proposal, request for quote, invitation for bid, nor does its issuance in any way restrict the Government as to its ultimate acquisition approach. <br /><br />The ICBM Systems Division, Hill AFB, Utah, is seeking potential sources to procure and install the Remote Visual Assessment (RVA) Terrestrial system and remove the RVA Satellite system at Minot AFB, ND and to maintain the RVA Network at three missile wings through Interim Contractor Support (ICS). RVA is utilized by Security Forces (SF) to assess security situations at Launch Facilities (LFs) in order to appropriately dispatch SF resources. <br /><br />The RVA network is currently deployed and maintained in two different configurations: Terrestrial at Malmstrom AFB, MT and Satellite at FE Warren AFB, WY and Minot AFB, ND. Northrop Grumman Corporation is currently transitioning FE Warren AFB, WY from RVA Satellite to RVA Terrestrial and currently maintains the RVA Network through an ICS contract.<br /><br />The RVA Terrestrial system at Minot AFB, ND will be a point-to-point radio communications system that connects 150 LFs, 15 Missile Alert Facilities (MAFs), Missile Security Control (MSC), and training locations to the overarching RVA Network. Tasks include installing concrete poles, cameras, infrared illuminators, and communications equipment outside the LF fence in order to observe the LF's Outer Zone area, removing and disposing of wood poles, satellite communications equipment, and cameras at the LFs, installing towers and monitoring equipment at MAFs and MSC and integrating each system into the RVA network.<br /><br />All three missile wings are connected to the RVA stand-alone network and maintenance is performed by deployed technicians (at each missile wing) for hardware replacement and power failure troubleshooting and remotely by trained system technicians for software upgrades, security updates, and software troubleshooting. This system is certified and accredited as a Mission Assurance Category Level III Sensitive asset and administrators must maintain appropriate training and certifications.<br /><br />Additionally, SuperTel Network Inc., and their affiliate Hexicom Corporation, must be utilized for the RVA installation at Minot AFB, ND by any potential source. This allows the Government to maintain proper configuration of the system's hardware and software ensuring ease of maintenance over the system's life cycle. SuperTel Network Inc. designs the LF data processing equipment and MAF monitoring equipment, while their affiliate, Hexicom Corporation, supplies the custom LF Digital Video Recorders with Hexicom software, Sight Commander software for the monitoring stations, and Net Commander hardware and firmware.<br /><br />THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP). Firms responding to this announcement should include company name, cage code, point of contact, address and indicate whether they are a small business, 8(a) concern, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, or women-owned small business. Potential offerors should submit a Statement of Capability (SOC) that addresses the offerors ability to provide the above requested system and services. The Government reserves the right to set-aside any subsequent acquisition based upon known sources and/or responses to this synopsis.<br /><br />SOC may be submitted by facsimile at 801-777-0990; e-mail: casey.wiseman@hill.af.mil; or mailed to 6014 Dogwood Ave, Bldg 1258, rm 25 Hill AFB UT 84056, Attention: Casey Wiseman.

<DESC>The Bureau of Land Management (BLM), proposes to noncompetitively issue a purchase orderwith Mr. Jim Nielsen, Woodland Forestry, Inc. 55510 Glen Aiken Creek Road, Coquille, OR 97423,for an update survey and mapping of pockets of live, dead, and dying Port Orford Cedar on District lands and on intermingled private ownerships within the range of this species. The JOFOC is posted at http://www.blm.gov/or/procurement. Requirement is for unique professional Silvicultural services, specializing in Port Orford cedar management.  Locations of live, dead, and dying Port Orford cedar shall be delineated on 1:12,000 color film positive transparencies of 9 in x 9 in aerial photographs. Photo interpretation and mapping requires a familiarity with the root disease Phytophthora lateralis, methods of root disease spread, typical patterns of infection, and experience using stereoscopic equipment to transfer information to maps and identify tree species. Using disease occurrence information from the 2003 PL survey as a base, new polygons shall be drawn on Mylar overlays of the 2010 color film positive transparencies of 9 in x 9 in aerial photographs around any group of two or more live, dead, or dying POC using a permanent red marking pen.  New polygons may be polygons from the 2003 PL survey that have enlarged due to root disease spread, they may be entirely new polygons that represent areas of infection that werent present in 2003, they may be polygons that are the same as the 2003 survey polygons, or they may be polygons that are only a portion of the 2003 survey polygons.  Lines shall be drawn on the photographs around groups of live, dead, or dying POC that are separated by a least twenty-five (25) feet on the actual site.  Ink width distance on the aerial photo shall average 1/40th of an inch or less, which is approximately equal to twenty five feet on the ground. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>Sources Sought-Pandemic Influenza Potency Antiserum
<p><br />The Food and Drug Administration intends to award a non-commercial, type contract on a non-competitive, sole source basis to the National Institute for Biological Standards and Control (NIBSC) for the delivery of Pandemic Influenza Potency Antiserum. The vendor will be required to ship the supplies to the following FDA location, 8800 Rockville Pike, Bethesda, Md 20892.</p>
<p>This request is for a contractor to produce a potency antiserum for a candidate pandemic influenza vaccine virus. The antiserum standard will be generated in sheep to purified hemagglutinin from a pandemic influenza virus vaccine generated by one of the World Health Organization (WHO) Essential Regularitory Laboratories or WHO Collaborating Centers for influenza. The potency antiserum will be used to determine the potency of influenza vaccines produced by various liscensed manufactorers.</p>
<p>A major effort in the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Pandemic Influenza Preparedness planning is to stockpile influenza vaccines and the reagents necessary to evaluate them for use should a pandemic influenza virus emerge into the population. Standardized reagents are required to measure the potency of the stockpiled influenza strain-specific antigen standard and a strain-specific antigen standard. Antiserum standards are currently made for each new strain for which there is a vaccine. Since HHS has contracted for pilot lots of several pandemic vaccines for the national stockpile, we are responsible for procuring and storing the potency antiserum standards required for the testing of the vaccine potency.<br /><br />This notice is issued for informational purposes and not a request for competitive proposals. Any interested party should submit a statement of capabilities in sufficient detail to determine if the requirements of this synopsis can be met, no later than 15 days from the date of this announcement and reference Sources Sought No. 11-223-SOL-00129 . The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 325414. A determination the Government not to compete the proposed work based on the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Responses to this notice must be sent via email to the Contract Specialist/Officer listed. No phone calls will be accepted. The FDA intends to make an award immediately after the response date of this notice.</p>

ICE/ERO upholds America's immigration laws at, within and beyond our borders through efficient enforcement and removal operations.

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Training Systems Division (NAWCTSD) in Orlando, Florida is responsible for acquisition, fielding, and life cycle support of training systems. The CH-53E Aircrew Procedures Trainer (APT) is currently undergoing a system upgrade, and the availability of a material support package after the trainer returns to operation is vital in fulfilling NAWCTSDs supportability requirements. The spare parts must meet form, fit, and function requirements and are commercially available only from the brand name vendors listed in the accompanying document, entitled 2F190-2 Spares Kit, dated 3 June 2011. While the brand name spare parts are the focus of this notice, these items shall be purchased as a kit through an 8(a) firm under the auspices of FAR part 19.
 The estimated total amount for this acquisition is $190,000.00.

Pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulations 6.302-1(c), application for brand name description, the proposed contract action is for supplies for which the Government intends to solicit for a specific brand name. This posting serves as a Sources Sought for this contract action. The intent of this notice is to meet the market research requirement and to justify that the use of such brand name descriptions are essential to the Governments requirements. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however, the Government welcomes rationale that objects to the use of a brand name source for any of the listed parts.
 Forward responses to this pre-solicitation notice to Mr. LaVenji Daniels by the close of business on 8 July 2011. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether respondents are capable of meeting the Governments requirements. In those situations where the Government determines that the brand name descriptions are not essential, and similar items would suffice, the brand name requirements will be replaced with brand name or equal requirements. Such changes, if made, will have no bearing on the mode of procurement; they shall serve only to expand the pool of suppliers for a given part in the kit. An 8(a) firm shall buy the kit in either case. 

As this procurement is subject to the authority of FAR Subpart 19.8, a synopsis of the proposed contract action is not required pursuant to the authority of FAR 5.202(a)(4).
 As such, no further synopsis will be provided. However, pursuant to FAR 6.305, the justification required by FAR 6.303-1 concerning the brand name requirement will be made available within 14 days after contract award.

<p><br />BACKGROUND<br />DMA has over 100 Cable headends and MMDS systems deployed throughout Afghanistan. The current Analog RF modulator is a Drake VMM-860AS agile stereo modulator. Frequency range includes VHF, UHF, and CATV. Current analog programs are assigned to VHF channels 2-13 for cable and superband EIA channels 30-41 for MMDS. RF output is +45dBmv minimum, adjustable from +32 to +45dBmv typical.<br />Outputs from the modulators are combined via a 16 port passive or active combiner.<br />Composite analog video and analog stereo audio is fed to the modulators from individual satellite decoders/IRDs. A total of 12 television programs are currently transmitted after processing by 12 decoders/IRDs and 12 modulators. All equipment is housed in a standard 19" 44RU rack for cable and 40RU rack for MMDS. Bidder can assume a minimum of 50 to 750MHz passband from combiners, launch amplifiers, splitters/couplers and cable. The current satellite decoder/IRD is an HD video capable Cisco D9865H (see Cisco data sheet for Y,Pb,Pr component, HDMI, etc for details as to current and future output capabilities).</p>
<p>CONCEPT<br />DMA is looking for an SD/HD solution to upgrade our analog cable headends and MMDS systems. We are requesting three different configurations as listed below. The Government will provide Racks, D9865H decoders, Drake Analog modulators and combiner systems representative of those that are located throughout the world. We are requesting a turnkey engineered system that will ideally be rack mountable within existing racks. The pre-wired and tested equipment should be readily shippable and easily installed by field personnel without difficulty. Vendors must have proven design engineering, manufacturing, construction, proof of performance testing and maintenance experience with cable headend and MMDS systems. The government will provide 12ea D9865H to the vendors for testing and wiring configurations. All Government Furnished Equipment will be consigned for a finite term and must be returned upon completion of this engineering phase.<br />SYSTEM 1: <br />10SD, 2 HD and 10 Analog<br />Cable headend should be QAM 256<br />MMDS must be QAM 64<br />SYSTEM 2:<br />10SD, 2 HD <br />Cable headend should be QAM 256<br />MMDS must be QAM 64<br />SYSTEM 3:<br />2 HD and 10 Analog<br />Cable headend should be QAM 256<br />MMDS must be QAM 64</p>
<p><br />SPECIFICATIONS AND DELIVERABLES <br />Must be compatible with the Cisco D9865H satellite decoder/IRD.<br />Up-converter needs to be capable of providing an output from +38 to 45dbmv. This is a site specific requirement to enable proper level setting and channel balancing. <br />Must be capable of both 64 and 256 QAM (site selectable).<br />Up-converters to Up-converter/encoder must be frequency agile. <br />Must have Dolby AC3 audio codec.<br />Must be 120/220VAC 50/60HZ capable with an auto switching power supply. <br />Must be rack mountable.<br />Auto bit rate selection is a plus.</p>

THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS, QUOTATIONS OR BIDS. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Honolulu District, requests letters of interest from PRIME CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTORS interested in performing work on a potential construction solicitation for the following projects:<br><br>Project Magnitude:  $25M to $100M.  FY12 MCA PN 59581, Central Vehicle Wash Facility, Schofield Barracks, Oahu, Hawaii.  Project Description:  This project will support the maintenance and operations for tactical vehicles stationed on Oahu.  The project is sited on 8.9-acres on Schofield Barracks.  The wash facility is intended for washing soil from the outside of tactical vehicles after returning from maneuver training.  Washing is required to prevent the soil on the vehicles from being deposited on the streets and roads within the cantonment area.  Washing is intended to be capable of cleaning vehicles sufficiently for inspection as well as preventing transport of weed seeds.  The proposed facility will consist of a pre-wash bath; ten wash stations, consisting of 6 single and two tandem wash bays; and a separate four bay maintenance facility to allow detailed washing of tactical vehicles prior to maintenance.  The wash process system will utilize a high-pressure wash system that will recycle water to reduce potable water consumption and minimize wastewater disposal.  The recycled water will flow through a sedimentation basin, an oil-water separators, an equalization basin, an intermittent sand filter, and then into two 740,000 gallon storage tanks.  Treatment will include oil and grease removal, grit removal, organic control, and chlorine disinfection.  The facility will also consist of a mechanical pump building and control building which will house an operator's office, restroom, and equipment storage room.  The project site currently houses two temporary motor pools which will be demolished as part of this project.  The temporary motor pools consisting of gravel driveways and parking areas, perimeter chain link fencing, and area lights and poles.  Project will also demolish an existing pavilion, restroom and paved parking area.  Supporting facilities include utilities, communications, storm drainage and erosion control measures, approximately 118,000 SF concrete paving, curbing, landscaping, fencing and site improvements.  As part of the sewer utility, the project will install approximately 7,500 lf of sewer line.<br>         <br>Responses to this sources sought announcement will be used by the Government to make appropriate acquisition decisions.  NO SOLICITATION IS CURRENTLY AVAILABLE.  Responses are to be sent via email to Dayna.N.Matsumura@usace.army.mil no later than 3:00 p.m., Hawaiian Standard Time 18 July 2011.<br><br>Interested PRIME CONTRACTORS shall submit a narrative demonstrating its experience in demolition and construction of a central vehicle wash facility that incorporates a recycle water system, gravity oil and grease separator, high-pressure pump systems, sedimentation/sand filter systems, installation of water storage tanks of similar size, on-site and off-site utilities, and site improvements  of similar value.  Contractor shall also demonstrate their ability and knowledge of sustainable designs/LEEDs to obtain Silver certification.  Include experience with abatement lead-based paint. Narratives shall be no longer than three (3) pages. Provide a letter from your surety stating your bonding capability for a single contract action and your aggregate capability.

<a href="mailto:roberta.d.williams@usace.army.mil">USACE District, New England</a>
<DESC>Description: The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New England District is issuing this Sources Sought Announcement to determine interest, availability  and capability  of  8(a), HUB Zone , Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned, and Small Business concerns. The NAICS code for the work described below is 237990 with a project cost in $1 to 5 million range. Work will begin in January 2012 and could extend over a 60-90 day period if options are exercised.<br><br>The replacement of the existing Chelsea Street Bridge by the Massachusetts Department of Transportation (MADOT) with a new vertical lift bridge allows the Corps to modify the existing Federal navigation channel in the vicinity of the bridge. The project area is located approximately 125 feet downstream of the bridge to approximately 350 feet upstream of the bridge. There are two channel widths that are currently under consideration for the channel.<br><br>The first alternative would create a minimum 140-foot wide channel in the vicinity of the new Chelsea Street Bridge. The second alternative is the creation of a minimum 175-foot wide channel. The 175-foot wide channel alignment is dependent on bulkhead modifications that must be completed before the navigation channel can be widened to 175 feet Both alternatives would widen the channel and bring the channel to its authorized depth of -38 feet MLLW.<br><br>This contract effort requires close coordination with the MADOT contractor as the widening effort has to be sequenced with the removal of the existing bridge fenders system. After the new bridge is in place, the MADOT contractor will begin the removal of the fender system starting on one side of the river. As soon as the fender system is removed from one side dredging will be required to begin on that side of the river. Immediately following the dredging effort, the area will be surveyed and a US Coast Guard (USCG) contractor will place aids to navigation. The<br>MADOT contractor will then remove the fender system on the other side of the river, and then dredging to widen the channel on that side of the river will commence, the area will be surveyed and the USCG will install additional aids to navigation.<br><br>Because there are three oil terminals upstream of the bridge with limited storage capacity, the dredging, surveying and installation of aids to navigation must be completed within five days. We are estimating that the dredging would have to occur in two to three days for each side of the river. <br><br>Approximately 34,700 cubic yards (cy) of material, which includes two feet of over depth dredging, would be removed by mechanical means to widen the channel to 140 feet. Of this amount, approximately 5,100 cy of surface material is unsuitable for ocean placement and will need to be placed into the existing CAD cell Cl2 which was constructed during the deepening of the Boston Harbor Navigation Improvement Project. This cell is located at the upper end of the navigation channel in the Chelsea River. The remaining 29,600 cy of material is parent material and will be placed at the USEPA Designated Massachusetts Bay Disposal Site located 20 miles offshore. The unsuitable material must be removed with an environmental (closed) bucket. The suitable material will be removed using an ordinary, toothed clamshell bucket. All of the dredged material will be placed in a split hull scow for transportation to either the CAD cell or the MBDS for placement. It is estimated that approximately 17,400 CY of both unsuitable and suitable would need to be removed from one side of the river within the 2 day period thereby requiring equipment that can dredge approximately 10,000 cy/day at a depth of up to 50 feet of water.<br><br>Approximately 53,000 cy of material, including two feet of over depth dredging, would need to be removed by mechanical means to widen the existing navigation channel in the Chelsea River to 175 feet. Of this amount, approximately 7,100 cy is unsuitable for ocean water disposal and would be disposed into CAD cell C 12. The remaining 45,900 cy of suitable material would be disposed at the MBDS. Although the dredging must be accomplished in a short duration, because the activities are being sequenced around the fender system removal and placement of aids to<br>navigation, the dredge could be on site for approximately 3-4 weeks.<br><br>The contract will also have an  option for  the removal of an old, abandoned concrete railroad counterweight which is located in the mud behind the fender system on the Chelsea Side of the river.

<DESC>The Marine Corps Systems Command (MCSC), Quantico, Virginia seeks sources sought for the Solar Portable Alternative Communication Energy System (SPACES).  Because the USMC fielded a previous version of SPACES, this new capability is being referred to as SPACES Generation II, or Gen II. 

The SPACES Gen II is to be a single person portable, renewable energy system.  The system should be able to utilize solar energy to perform the following functions: 

1.	Charge batteries (BB- 2590/U, AA, AAA, AN/PRC-153 battery, AN/PRC-152 battery, AN/PRC-148 battery) 
2.	Provide power directly to tactical radios and portable computers (AN/PRC-117F, AN/PRC-117G, AN/PRC-119A-D, AN/PRC-119F, AN/PRC-148, AN/PRC-152, AN/PRC-153)
3.	Provide power directly to portable computers (Panasonic Toughbook laptop computer)

In addition to the ability to accepting solar energy input, the SPACES Gen II system should be able to accept 28 volts direct current power from other sources, such as a tactical vehicle, to perform the above mentioned functions.
  

The Marine Corps is seeking input from companies for systems that can perform all tasks stated above, as well as a systems with a sub-capability to perform only task 1 stated above (either as an independent system or modular sub-component of the more capable system). 

MCSC is interested in tradeoffs between these two capabilities in determine the cost, weight, size and time frame needed to deliver this capability. Driving factors of interest to MCSC are ability to perform functions, size, weight and production unit cost (not in any particular order).  Other tradeoffs MSCS is looking with the above stated system are:

1.	Speed of battery charge (10% to 100%)
2.	Throughput electrical efficiency of system
3.	Peak and continuous power level of system
4.	Solar energy input options
5.	Recommended electrical connectors and commonality
 
Any other value added information that would be pertinent to a future acquisition program is also desired.
  This information will potentially be used to support the planned procurement initiative to field this capability.  The Governments seeks to ascertain the degree to which the SPACES Gen II system capability can be met and the rough order of magnitude costs to deliver up to 5000 systems system over a 5 year period.  

Potential offerors with the ability to meet the requirements listed are requested to provide information on their solution, whether it is data on existing systems or development approach for new systems.  

It is requested that interested parties provide a Rough Order of Magnitude on system cost, production quantity breaks, and manufacturing ramp up and sustainable rate. If the requested systems quantity over the timeframe described is unobtainable, please provide alternative best case delivery schedule.
  

For this procurement, MCSC does not intend to enter into development for new capability, but leverage the current high state of industrial readiness.  Information from this notice will also help shape downstream investment and procurement planning (Generation III).

MCSC does not intend to split the acquisition program into individual component procurements.  Only offerors who can address the full system capability are encouraged to respond.

It is requested that potential offers provide information on corporate position, to include the companys classification as a Small Business, if any, and whether you have any applicable products that are available on GSA Advantage.

This sources-sought is for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a Request For Proposal or as an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire follow-on acquisitions.
 The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this notice, or otherwise pay for the information requested.  No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of submission of responses to this notice and Government use of such information. 

The Government recognizes that proprietary data may be part of this effort.  If so included, clearly mark such data.  No classified data shall be provided or will be accepted.

Responses to this notice shall be appropriately labeled with the notice title and provided via electronic means only to the following:

<DESC>The Marine Corps Systems Command (MARCORSYSCOM) is conducting market research for potential sources and best practice information towards availability and potential user acceptance in a Tier 2 Pelvic Protection System (PPS) for use by USMC personnel.

Current operations expose USMC personnel to threats of Improvised Explosive Devices (IED) and the concurrent damages associated with these events.  Increased protection for the pelvic region is desired to protect against the effects of this threat.  MARCORSYSCOM intends to determine the availability and practicality of a system with design features that can provide increased protection to the groin, perineum and closely adjacent areas from high velocity fragmentation.
  These systems would be worn on the outside of the combat uniform from the trouser belt and be capable of being worn in a stowed configuration and easily deployed to an operational configuration by the user without tools.  Ease of transition to and from the stowed and deployed configurations is desired to accommodate the varying mission requirements encountered in current operations.  The system should be capable of meeting or exceeding the ballistic protection levels specified in CO/PD-22 G (Outer Tactical Vest).  The system should allow unimpeded mobility while stowed and be deployed within one minute with little to no mobility reduction.  The Tier 2 PPS shall not increase the infrared signature of the Marine and shall be made of materials that are non-corrosive and have a finish that is dull/non-reflective.
  It shall be fungus resistant and not degraded by water, salt water, insect repellent, petroleum, oil, and lubricant products.  The system must be water resistant, attach directly to the Marine Corps combat belt and fully compatible with Marine Corps combat uniform and service common body armor and load carriage systems.  The Tier 2 PPS must be available in no more than two sizes and must accommodate the 5th through 95th percentile male and female Marines and shall be coyote brown (threshold) or desert/woodland MARPAT (objective).  The outer carrier shall be constructed of a mid weight Nylon-Cotton (nyco) similar to that used in the Marine Corps Combat Utility trouser which meet the specifications outlined in attachment 1 (Tier 2 Pelvic Protector Outer Material Specifications).

Only responses from industry will be considered.
  All responses should include any available test data and a discussion on use or testing that has been conducted by the United States, or other allied military/government organizations.  Solutions/designs that have not been previously procured or subjected to official user evaluations or other testing conducted by United States military/government organizations, or other allied military/governmental testing and procurement organizations/activities, will NOT  be considered ready for production.  Information gathered under this request for information may be used by the Government to support an acquisition approach that may include the execution of available FY11 funds in order to begin delivery of a production ready capability before the end of the calendar year.
  Accordingly, all responses must include rough order of magnitude (ROM) pricing for an existing solution based on an estimated production quantity of between 14,750 and 45,150 systems.  ONLY  Berry Amendment compliant submissions that are production ready (i.e., beyond the developmental stage) will be considered under this request for information.  Any Berry Amendment compliance information shall be detailed and must be capable of addressing the approach that will be taken to satisfy all Berry Amendment requirements.  This discussion may include any of the following: licensing agreements, partnerships, joint ventures, manufacturing agreements or subcontracting plans.  Any discussion of the above must include how the proposed business arrangement will be capable of manufacturing a minimum of 4,000 Berry Amendment compliant end items a month not later than December 2011.
 In addition, each response must provide a detailed bill of materials with an acknowledgement that all end products or components to their solution have been grown, reprocessed, reused or produced in the United States IAW DFARS 225.7002.

WRITTEN RESPONSES

Respondents are requested to include literature, brochures, and capabilities summaries directly addressing their ability to meet the Tier 2 PPS attributes listed above.  Additional information is requested identifying business size, manufacturing capability and facilities.  Furnished written materials and any proprietary information will be protected when clearly identified as proprietary.  No telephonic responses will be accepted.  Responses shall be submitted not later than 05 July, 2011 to Leigh DLugos, at email address susan.dlugos@usmc.mil or via FEDEX/UPS deliveries to Command, Leigh DLugos, CT023LD, MARCORSYSCOM, 2200 Lester Street Quantico VA 22134-6050.

This nationwide effort will include provisions at 153 medical centers, seven (7) Consolidated Patient Account Centers (CPACs), and other offices providing centralized services.  

II. Background: 
The compliance date for implementation for ICD-10 is October 1, 2013.  ICD-10 will replace the ICD-9-CM diagnosis code set in all health care settings for diagnosis reporting with dates of service, or dates of discharge for inpatients, that occur on or after October 1, 2013.  VHA utilizes ICD-10 codes for a variety of purposes, such as: clinical studies, performance measurement, workload capture, cost determination, Veterans Equitable Resource Allocation (VERA), classifying morbidity and mortality, indexing of hospital records by disease and operations, data storage and retrieval, and reimbursement.

III. Requirements: 
The VA seeks support for the implementation of ICD-10 for all modes of operations, including but not limited to recording clinical diagnosis and procedures, reporting, reimbursement, and statistical analysis.  Depending on the results of Market Research, there may be multiple contract actions to meet the objectives identified in this request.  

The contractor shall demonstrate the ability and/or experience in the following areas:

"	Database Content Support - analyze existing databases with ICD-9 codes; identify the appropriate code equivalents; and recommend a strategy for a consistent implementation of ICD-10 across the databases.
"	Pre-release Content Updates - analyze existing content and recommend a solution for optimization of ICD-10 implementation for the following:
o	Encounter forms - used both to display relevant patient data for use during the visit, such as demographics, allergies, and problems; and to collect data about the visit, such as procedures and tests performed.  Its primary focus is clinical and to collect data for recording and reporting.
o	Clinical reminders - provides relevant information to providers at the point of care, for both preventive health care and management of chronic conditions, and helps ensure that timely clinical interventions are initiated for the Veterans. 
o	Problem List - The Problem List program is used to document and track a patient's problems in order to provide clinicians with a current and historical view of a patient's health care problems.   Problem list allows one problem list for a given patient with each problem tied to a coding system(s), Systemized Nomenclature Of Medicine - Clinical Terms (SNOMED-CT) with a mapping to ICD.

<DESC>This is a sole-source synopsis that provides tentative notification of the 30th Contracting Squadron's intent to extend contract, FA4610-06-C-0001, with Santa Barbara Applied Research, Inc., 2151 Alexandro Dr Ste 220, Ventura, CA 93001-3777 for a period of three (3) months. The period of performance for this extension will be from 1 October 2011 through 31 Dec 2011. This extension is needed to satisfy the requirements of the 576th Flight Test Squadron, Air Force Global Strike Command, to provide Minuteman Launch Support Services (MLSS) until the current MLSS solicitation (FA4610-09-R-0013) currently in progress can be awarded. The 576th FLTS MLSS contract provides for a wide range of support services for Force Development Evaluation Minuteman Launches at Vandenberg AFB. Support services include, but are not limited to: launch facility refurbishment, corrosion control services, vehicle issue and control, management services, and training services which support critical mission requirements. The extension will provide for the continuation of uninterrupted services of the above services at Vandenberg Air Force Base (VAFB) outlined above. This three-month extension of services is pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (1), "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements," as implemented by FAR 6.302-1.This notice is being posted since this option under FAR 52.217-8 was not previously evaluated as part of the initial contract award for FA4610-06-C-0001. This option exercise will be at the current rates specified in the current contract, as allowed by FAR52.217-8 and will extend the period of performance end date from 30 Sep 2011 to 31 Dec 2011. This option exercise will further allow for the current competitive procurement under FA4610-09-R-0013 (which is currently posted to FBO) to be accomplished and allow for a transition of services to a potential new contractor. Santa Barbara Applied Research, Inc. is the only responsible offeror for exercise of this option, as the Government would experience unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements if this option was not exercised before the current contract expiration date. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement specific to exercise of this option under FAR 52.217-8, "Option to Extend Services" within 15 days of this notice. The Government will not be responsible for any cost incurred by interested parties in preparation of information or documents related to this option exercise.

<DESC>Intent to Sole Source. The Department of Treasury's Bureau of Public Debt, on behalf of the Office of Financial Research (OFR), intends to negotiate on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with Emerging Portofolio Fund Research, Inc, 80 Sherman Street, Cambridge, MA 02140-3504 for EPFR Global Flows Package - weekly data subscription. The contract will be issued for a base year, and one option period.
<p><br />The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act established the OFR within the Treasury Department to improve the quality of financial data available to policymakers and facilitate more robust and sophisticated analysis of the financial system.</p>
<p>Emerging Portfolio Fund Research, Inc., is the only known data source of information on flows into and out of emerging market funds THAT IS NOT AN INVESTMENT FIRM. To attempt to reproduce this data would be prohibitively costly in terms of financial and personnel resources. Treasury does not collect this information from funds, and no other regulatory body collects the data.</p>
<p>The EPFR Global Flows Package subscription will proivde weekly global equity and fixed income fund flows, fund allocations (country allocation/sector allocations), and country flows. Includes all fund groups. Includes all current and historical data.</p>
<p>A request for more information will not be considered an affirmative response. If no affirmative written response is received, that clearly demonstrates the ability to meet all the requirements, and that is more advantageous to the Government, we intend to negotiate a sole-source award to Emerging Portofolio Fund Research, Inc. Telephone inquires will not be accepted.</p>
<p>No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, the Government will consider responses received by June 30, 2011 by 12:00pm ET. Responses shall be submitted to PSB3@bpd.treas.gov, Attention K. Marengo/S. Daugherty</p>

<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Serum Bank, National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases (NCID), has had an active, structured fresh blood and blood products acquisition program for the past decade. New requirements, especially testing of blood donations for hepatitis B and C and for antibodies to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), as well as, a need for strict confidentiality of records and donor counseling, when appropriate, dictate that the agency seek a contract for the acquisition of fresh human blood/blood products.<br />Blood collection and the need for fresh blood products are varied and important to the different programs at the CDC. Specialized fresh blood and blood products are used as reagents, biological products, control materials in research projects, and for reference diagnostic purposes. Thus, the purpose of this procurement action is to acquire, on a timely basis, the blood and blood products testing, counseling and the required degree of confidentiality for blood donation viable for the research quality of the CDC.<br />Emory University is the incumbent contractor and already has a list of eligible donors who have specific rare blood types and titers required by CDC laboratories. Emory has the blood donors, readily available, that fit the profile for the specific blood types needed for CDC to conduct studies on various biological agents. Because expediency is required for many of the specimens to be viable for the research, their proximity to CDC premises gives them the unique advantage of providing these blood specimens to the CDC laboratories in the timely manner. Based on the above, we believe that no other source, but the Emory University in Atlanta, GA can realistically meet our needs. However, interested parties who believe they can provide the same service in a timely manner are encouraged to send a capability statement via email to Bbiltz@cdc.gov by COB, July 7, 2011..<br />Award of a Blanket Purchase Agreement IAW/FAR Part 13 is being contemplated. Individual call orders will be placed against the resulting BPA on the basis of Firm-Fixed Price (FFP). The total period of performance shall not exceed 60 continuous months from date of award.<br />All questions/concerns about the solicitation shall be submitted via e-mail ONLY to BBiltz@cdc.gov. No telephone requests will be honored. The associated NAICS code is 621511 and the small business size standard is $13.5 Million. It is your responsibility to keep up with additional postings regarding the RFP on the Fedbizopps Website.<br />

<p><br /><strong>Background:</strong> <br />The NIST Information Services Office (ISO), through the Research Library and Information Program (RLIP) and the Electronic Information and Publications Program (EIPP), provides professional scientific and technical information assistance to a community of 3,000 researchers throughout their research and publishing cycles. The mission of the Research Library and Information Program (RLIP) is to make literature and published research information available to NIST scientists to assist in the research-discovery process. The journals are critical to the work of the NIST scientist and are available in electronic version only to all NIST staff on campus through the NIST Virtual Library. Over 200 NIST-authored articles are published in Elsevier journals annually, and NIST researchers require access to those articles to further the research at NIST. Extensive market research shows that the journals provided by Elsevier are not offered by any other vendor. This requisition is a renewal of the subscription for 250 Elsevier electronic journal titles that NIST currently subscribes to.</p>
<p>The NAICS Code is 511120. NIST anticipates negotiating and awarding a firm-fixed-price purchase order to Elsevier B.V. for this requirement for a base year plus four option years.<br /><br />Interested parties that believe they could satisfy the requirements listed above for NIST to provide the journals necessary may clearly and unambiguously identify their capability to do so in writing on or before July 6, 2011 at 4 pm EST. This notice of intent is not a solicitation. Information submitted in response to this notice will be used solely to determine whether competitive procedures could be used for this acquisition.

These services are essential and critical to comply with the mandate in the House Report N. 110-231, requesting NIH conduct a comprehensive management review of NIEHS; and, Coray Gurnitz Consulting, is the only contractor that can provide the continuity required for this endeavor. Thus, maintaining this service is in the best interest of the NIEHS mission to meet the requirements. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however, all responses received within 5 days from the date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract action based upon responses to this notice is solely with the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. If no affirmative responses are received within 5 days of this notice to determine whether a qualified source is more advantageous to the Government, the order will be issued to Coray Gurnitz Consulting, Inc.

MARKET SURVEY  SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS - The United States Government (USG) is issuing this sources-sought announcement as part of a market survey.  The Crane Division, Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWC Crane) is seeking inputs from parties interested in supplying a remotely operated lens cleaning system for potential incorporation into existing and future military tower mounted surveillance system programs.
 The lens cleaning system is needed to ensure unobstructed visibility, optimum utilization of optics performance, range, and help eliminate the operational down time with unplanned maintenance actions.  The lens cleaning system must be able to provide on demand, non-abrasive cleaning for systems with lenses mounted on fixed or telescoping towers of various heights up to 107 feet.  Lenses to be cleaned may operate in visible through long-wave infrared and should be expected to have coatings.  Neither lenses nor coatings can be damaged during cleaning.  Ideally the lens cleaning solution or supplemental reservoir would be located at the base of the tower to allow ease of access and replenishment of cleaning solutions to the system, and to reduce weight aloft.
  
Specific areas of interest/requirements for the proposed system are provided as an attachment 1 to this announcement. 
All interested parties should submit an initial synopsis (commonly referred to as "white paper") following format outlined in attachment 1.

<DESC>Request for Information in Support of a Planned Solicitation<br />Pertaining to <br />DIGITIZATION AND STORAGE OF VARIOUS MEDIA FORMATS
<p>Introduction<br />The Defense Imagery Management Operations Center (DIMOC) is developing requirements for digitization and digital storage of its media inventory as well as web-based search and retrieval capability. The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to gather information to assist the DIMOC in developing a Statement of Objectives (SOO) that allows for spirited competition, cost efficiency, proper care and handling of camera original media, and innovative approaches to preservation of archival media, cataloging, and making the digital products available to authorized customers. DIMOC requests the participation of industry to assist in formulating its requirements in such a manner that promotes competition, and in identifying qualified vendors who are able to meet our requirements. Information on business size and socio-economic status of interested and qualified offerors is also requested in order to determine the viability of the use of targeted set-asides.</p>
<p>The attached documents set forth objectives based on DIMOC's perspective and understanding of digitization of archival media holdings. This RFI requests evaluation of the Statement of Objectives for inherent fairness or lack thereof, and asks for suggested approaches that represent your firm's basic methodology and practices to accomplish these tasks.</p>
<p>DIMOC is open to alternative ideas. Respondents are encouraged to provide information about alternatives that can help DIMOC best accomplish the goals of the Statement of Objectives in a cost-efficient manner that does not sacrifice compatibility or availability of digitized media.</p>
<p>The Statement of Objectives and its attachments provide a starting point and general parameters of the requirement. Therefore, the SOO should be used as a guide, which illustrates requirements. It does not dictate a place of performance, workflows, methodology, or architecture. As a result, comments on how broad-ranging and disparate approaches can be evaluated fairly are also solicited.</p>
<p><br />This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a solicitation. Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Respondents are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI. Responses to this RFI will not be returned. Respondents will not be notified of the result of the review.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How to Respond<br />Please submit your response to this RFI to Bill Gilmore via email to bill.gilmore@dma.mil phone 951-413-2412 by Monday 25 July at 4:00 PM PT.</p>

<DESC>Notice of intent to issue a sole source Contract, this is not a request for competitive proposals.   The U.S. Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity, Fort Detrick, MD anticipates awarding a firm fixed price Contract to acquire consultative services to provide engineering details, structural and installation requirements of a Vertical Accelerator Tower (VAT), and to technically review the engineering architectural drawings such that the building design fully accommodates the VAT installation and function without redesign and rework. The intent is to make a sole source award pursuant to FAR 6.302(a) (1) only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  Services are deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of a follow-on contract for the continued development or production of a major system or highly specialized equipment, including major components thereof, when it is likely that award to any other source would result in additional cost, increased technical risk, and increased period of performance.  The Vertical Accelerator test system is unique and no other systems are known to exist.  The engineering details are proprietary knowledge retained by the original equipment manufacturer (OEM).  Award to a source other than the OEM would increase risk as the source would not have the inherent knowledge of the system design, function, and structural requirements, and much reverse engineering would be required.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes. No solicitation document exists. Any firm that believes it can provide the stated required product within the established timeframe is invited to submit written notification to the Contracting Officer by way of the Contract Specialist within fifteen (15) calendar days from the date of publication of this notice. Supporting evidence must be furnished in sufficient detail to demonstrate the firm's ability to provide the stated service within the established timeframe. Information can be sent to the Contract Specialist, Jennifer Jackson, at jennifer.jackson1@us.army.mil. No telephone requests will be accepted. Responses received will be evaluated; however, a determination by the Government not to compete the proposed procurement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. If no responses are received, USAMRAA will proceed with the sole source contract.

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--<br />(1) [_] Are, [_] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and<br />(3) [_] Are, [_] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<br />(4) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(ii) Examples.<br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.<br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).]<br />(1) Listed End Product<br />Listed End Product: Listed Countries of Origin:<br /><br /><br /><br />(2) Certification.

(Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to a central contractor registration database to be eligible for award.)<br />(1) All offerors must submit the information required in paragraphs (l)(3) through (l)(5) of this provision to comply with debt collection requirements of 31 U.S.C. 7701(c) and 3325(d), reporting requirements of 26 U.S.C. 6041, 6041A, and 6050M, and implementing regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).<br />(2) The TIN may be used by the government to collect and report on any delinquent amounts arising out of the offeror's relationship with the Government (31 U.S.C. 7701(c)(3)).

<DESC>The Air Force will issue a solicitation to obtain two (2) Image Generator (IG) Systems from Aechelon Technology, San Francisco, CA, CAGE 1JPD0, for the 519th for the Human Engineering Development System (HEDS) program. The solicitation will include a priced option to replace one (1) existing IG System located at Hill AFB. The IG System to be replaced is at end of life and due for replacement. The replacement IG System will include 24 visual channels rather than the 30 visual channels of the new system. The difference in visual channels is because the replacement IG is going into a dome that only has 280 degree field of view rather than 360 degrees. The replacement IG System option is interchangeable with and interfaces seamlessly using the same unique visual and sensor databases with the IG System mentioned above.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.<br />The solicitation RFQ-CFP-11-0038 is issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ).<br />Solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-52.<br />The NAICS code is 541910 and the size standard is $7.0 mil.<br />BACKGROUND<br />The Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (CFPB) will be an independent bureau within the Federal Reserve System that will help empower consumers with the information they need to make financial decisions that are best for them and their families. Created by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act), the CFPB will work to promote fairness and transparency for mortgages, credit cards, and other consumer financial products and services. The CFPB will set and enforce clear, consistent rules that allow banks and other consumer financial services providers to compete on a level playing field and that let consumers see clearly the costs and features of products and services. <br />Under the Dodd-Frank Act, the Secretary of the Treasury is responsible for standing up the CFPB until a Director of the Bureau is confirmed by the Senate. President Obama has appointed Elizabeth Warren to serve as an Assistant to the President, and the Secretary of the Treasury has appointed her as a Special Advisor, responsible for overseeing the development of the CFPB. The CFPB implementation team, currently housed within the Treasury Department, is hard at work putting in place the building blocks for the Bureau. <br />Within the CFPB, the Office of Research, Markets, and Regulation has been charged with the responsibility of monitoring developments within the markets for consumer financial services and providing a perspective on key trends and dynamics which is grounded in rigorous, evidence-based research and analysis.<br />SCOPE<br />The Bureau of the Public Debt on behalf of the CFPB has the requirement for a contractor(s) to provide Credit Card Marketing Research reports and data services in order to accomplish research and data reports with credit card originations marketing, existing customer marketing, and other customer communications. CFPB requires access for up to five users to the data underlying the reports.<br />With respect to originations marketing, the CFPB seeks to procure access to reporting and data that will provide insights into:<br />&bull; Originations mail volume<br />&bull; Distribution of mail solicitations by type of product (rewards, non-rewards etc.)<br />&bull; Distribution of mail solicitations by type of solicitation (pre-screen, invitation to apply)<br />&bull; Distribution of mail solicitations by demographics (e.g. income)<br />&bull; Pricing of products being marketed (fees, APR, promotional offers etc.)<br />&bull; Household penetration of mail volume<br />&bull; Distribution of mail solicitations by risk band<br />&bull; Household penetration of offers by risk band<br />&bull; Pricing of products by risk band
<p>The CFPB is also seeking to procure access to similar information with respect to other solicitation channels (e.g. e-mail, advertising).<br />With respect to existing customer marketing and communications, the CFPB seeks to procure access to reporting and data that will provide insight into:<br />&bull; Marketing of balance transfers<br />&bull; Marketing of purchase incentives<br />&bull; Increases and decreases in APR<br />&bull; Changes in terms</p>

<p>Performance Work Statement</p>
<p>Background &amp; Need:<br />The workplace and the health of the workers within it are inextricably linked. Ideally, workplaces should not only protect the safety and wellbeing of employees but also provide them opportunities for better long-term health and enhanced quality of life. Effective workplace programs, policies, and environments which are health-focused and worker-centered have the potential to significantly benefit employers, employees, their families, and communities. As the nation's premier public health agency, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) helps protect the health and safety of all people in our schools, communities, homes and workplaces through prevention. The workplace can specifically protect and promote health through programs, policies, and practices that have the potential of reaching millions of workers, retirees, and their families.</p>
<p>The Affordable Care Act of 2010 elevates prevention as a priority providing unprecedented opportunities for health promotion and disease prevention. For example, it establishes the National Prevention, Health Promotion, and Public Health Council, involving more than a dozen federal agencies, will develop a prevention and health promotion strategy for the country.; creates the Prevention and Public Health Fund (PPHF) to support evidence and practice-based community and clinical prevention and wellness strategies; and requires new plans to cover recommended preventive services at no cost.</p>
<p><br />Increasing health care costs and health-related decreases in worker productivity are leading American businesses to examine strategies to improve employee health and contain health costs that are largely driven by chronic diseases and related lifestyle choices. Employers are recognizing the role they can play in creating a healthy work environment and providing their employees with opportunities to make healthy lifestyle choices. They increasingly look to CDC and other public health experts for guidance and solutions to combat the effects of chronic diseases on their employees and businesses. Workplace health programs not only benefit individual employees but also make good business sense.<br />A top concern for many employers is health care costs:<br />&bull; In 2007, private health insurance obtained through the workplace for individuals less than 65 years of age was the major source of insurance covering 157.9 million people or 61.6% of the population.<br />&bull; In 2007, private health insurance paid for 36% of personal health expenditures, which include services such as physician visits, hospital care, dental care, prescription drugs, and nursing home care. Together these personal health expenditures account for 84% of national health care expenditures in 2007.<br />&bull; Since 2000, average health insurance premiums for a family of four have increased by 114% proving costly for both employers and employees.<br />&bull; In 2010, average annual premiums for employer-sponsored coverage were $5,049 for single coverage and $13,770 for family coverage.<br />The costs of health insurance can be even more of a burden for small employers as can the cost of premiums for their employees.<br />&bull; Sixty-eight percent of companies with fewer than 200 employees offered health insurance to their workers in 2010.<br />&bull; Fifty-four percent of small companies (3-199 employees) that do not offer coverage reported the high cost of health insurance as the reason for not offering health benefits in 2010. <br />&bull; While workers' contributions for single coverage in small (3-199 employees) and large (200 or more employees) companies was fairly similar in 2010 ($865 annually vs. $917 annually), employees of smaller employers paid substantially more annually than those of larger employers for family coverage ($4,665 compared to $3,652).</p>
<p>The Impact of Chronic Disease on Health Costs.</p>
<p>Each year in the United States, chronic disease such as heart disease, stroke, cancer, and diabetes cause 7 in 10 deaths and account for about 75% of the $2 trillion spent on medical care.<br />&bull; In 2010, the economic costs of cardiovascular diseases and stroke were estimated at $444.2 billion, including $272.5 billion in direct medical expenses and $171.7 billion in indirect costs.<br />&bull; In 2007, medical costs attributed to diabetes included $27 billion for care to directly treat diabetes, $58 billion to treat diabetes-related chronic complications attributable to diabetes, and $31 billion in excess general medical costs <br />&bull; In 2008, the estimated health care costs related to obesity were $147 billion <br />Indirect costs for employers associated with poor employee health, including absenteeism, presenteeism, disability, or reduced work output, may be several times higher than direct medical costs. Productivity losses related to personal and family health problems cost US employers $1,685 per employee per year, or $225.8 billion annually.<br />Preventing health problems is one of the few known ways to stem rising health care costs. When employers pay more for insurance and employee health care, they have less money to invest in the company and may be forced to pay lower wages or shift health care costs to their employees. The ACA aims to control health care costs for individuals and employers through evidence and practice-based prevention and wellness strategies that will lead to specific, measureable health outcomes to reduce chronic disease rates. The promise of this strategy would keep workers healthier for longer periods of time, help protect their economic security, reduce health care related burdens and expenditures, and improve disability and productivity outcomes. For most employers, chronic diseases-such as heart disease, stroke, cancer, obesity, and diabetes-are among the most prevalent, costly, and preventable of all health problems. <br />Much of the illness, disability, and death associated with chronic diseases are avoidable through known prevention measures such as:<br />&bull; Practicing a healthy lifestyle (e.g., regular physical activity, healthy eating, and avoiding tobacco use); and<br />&bull; Timely and appropriate access to clinical preventive services that can prevent disease, detect risk factors for a disease, and/or diagnose a disease in its earliest stages when it is easier to treat (e.g., screening for breast, cervical, and colorectal cancers, diabetes and its complications, and depression). <br />Narrowing the tremendous gap between what we know is effective and what employers do to improve the health, well-being, and productivity of their employees represents an important opportunity for improving the health of working adults. Health-related programs, policies, and benefits proven to prevent disease and promote health are available to employers. The Guide to Community Preventive Services (www.thecommunityguide.org) summarizes many effective health interventions applicable to worksite settings. However, studies suggest that many employers are not purchasing or implementing these evidence-based interventions. Possible reasons include cost, lack of understanding of health issues and effective interventions, inadequate staffing or capacity to implement programs, and a lack of publicly available tools and resources. Many of these reasons are particularly relevant for small- to medium-sized companies. Furthermore, the strategies companies use to address employee health vary by available resources, management and employee needs and interests, and by which health issues are a priority for them.</p>
<p>CDC is committed to utilizing sound science to improve the health of working adults while addressing the major concerns of today's employers. Within CDC's National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, the Workplace Health Initiative serves as the focal point for worker health. It includes promoting the following public health goals:<br />&bull; Creating the standard for what employers should do; and how to measure progress.<br />&bull; Increasing the number of employers that provide workplace health promotion programs.<br />&bull; Improving the quality of employer's efforts.</p>
<p>The Workplace Health Initiative promotes the following comprehensive approach to health promotion and disease prevention for working adults.</p>
<p>Comprehensive Workplace Health Programs</p>
<p>Building a workplace health program should involve a coordinated, systematic and comprehensive approach. A coordinated approach to workplace health results in a planned, organized, and comprehensive set of programs, policies, benefits, and environmental supports designed to meet the health and safety needs of all employees. A comprehensive approach looks to put interventions in place that address multiple risk factors (e.g., overweight, poor nutrition, lack of physical activity) and health conditions (e.g., diabetes, musculoskeletal disorders, heart disease and stroke) concurrently and recognizes that the interventions and strategies chosen influence multiple levels of the organization including the individual employee and the organization as a whole. <br />An integrated approach to total worker health<br />Workplace health promotion programs are more likely to be successful if occupational safety and health is considered in their design and execution, In fact, a growing body of evidence indicates that workplace-based interventions that take coordinated, planned, or integrated approaches to reducing health threats to workers both in and out of work are more effective than traditional isolated programs. Integrating or coordinating occupational safety and health with health promotion may increase program participation and effectiveness and may also benefit the broader context of work organization and environment. <br />The systematic process of building a workplace health promotion program emphasizes four main steps:<br />1. an assessment to define employee health and safety risks and concerns and describe current health promotion activities, capacity and needs <br />2. A planning process to develop the components of a workplace health programs including goal determination; selecting priority interventions; and building an organizational infrastructure <br />3. Program implementation involving all the steps needed to put health promotion strategies and interventions into place and making them available to employees <br />4. An evaluation of efforts to systematically investigate the merit (e.g., quality), worth (e.g., effectiveness), and significance (e.g., importance) of an organized health promotion action/activity</p>
<p>Statutory Program Authority<br />This program is authorized by section 1703(a)(2) and 1703(a)(4) of the Public Health Service Act as amended (42 U.S.C.300u-2).</p>
<p><br />Program Overview and Strategy <br />CDC is aware of the limitations among individual employers particularly small to medium-sized employers for implementing effective workplace health programs such as resource constraints, lack of understanding of health issues and effective interventions, inadequate staffing or capacity to implement programs, and a lack of publicly available tools and resources. The funds released through this mechanism are intended to support the establishment of a core workplace health program in small and large worksites. The focus of the workplace health program will be to build worksite capacity for sustained program continuation that introduces interventions that target the workplace environment and policies as well as employee lifestyle behaviors including those related to physical inactivity, poor nutrition, and tobacco use that lead to increased risk for chronic disease.</p>
<p>Specifically, the Contractor shall recruit cohorts of either small or large employers to participate in the program. The Contractor will plan, develop, and administer a core workplace health program in each participating worksite within the cohort forming a national network of employer cohorts (herein referred to as the national network). The Contractor will participate in activities including technical assistance and training, communications, networking/mentoring, partnership/coalition development, and a national evaluation of the program to provide broad-based support to the national network.</p>
<p>This initiative will use evidence-based and best practice workplace programs, policies, practices, and environmental supports to maximize employee engagement and participation; raise employee awareness and education around health; and establish a work environment to change unhealthy behaviors and lifestyle choices to reduce employee risk for chronic disease while ensuring that employees are protected against potential discrimination. Possible execution strategies include conducting health risk assessments, lifestyle counseling and coaching, tobacco free campus policies, creating worksite access and opportunity for physical activity.</p>
<p>Performance Objectives:<br />The purpose of this request is to obtain the services of a firm with the expertise, capacity and reach into the employer community on a regional basis to engage and recruit 7 groups of 10-15 employers (herein referred to as cohorts) and lead the cohorts through the process of building a core workplace health program (WHP) in each worksite within the cohorts which includes the following components: assessment of employer and employee needs, interests and existing capacity; a planning process resulting in a workplace health improvement plan to guide the worksite through program development; implementation and evaluation of programs, policies and practices to address employee lifestyle risk factors related to physical activity, nutrition, and tobacco use; building a program infrastructure within each worksite for long-term sustainability including evaluation, wellness committees, and leadership (CEO/C-Suite) support; and participation in activities facilitated by CDC to lend broad-based support to the national network. The following performance objectives have been established for this request: <br />1) Recruit and secure the commitment of employers forming 7 cohorts of 10-15 employers each to participate in the program;<br />2) Demonstrate organizational commitment and support of worksite health promotion at all levels of management in each employer in the cohort;<br />3) Create a work environment in each worksite setting in the cohort that promotes and supports positive work organization and health opportunities for employees and their family members; <br />4) Establish baseline data for each worksite setting in the cohort to enhance the sustainability of the workplace health program over time;<br />5) Implement all elements of a core workplace health program that are evidence-based, sustainable and replicable in all worksites in the cohort, while ensuring compliance with all applicable federal and state laws, including, but not limited to, the nondiscrimination provisions included in the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) of 1996, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) of 1974, and the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) of 2008;<br />6) Promote peer to peer healthy business mentoring among participating employers in the cohort;<br />7) Participate in activities to bring broad-based support to the national network, facilitated by CDC, which includes technical assistance and training, communications, and a national evaluation of the program.</p>
<p>Desired Outcomes:<br />At the end of the project period, the Contractor will be considered successful if the following outcomes have been achieved:<br />&bull; Participating worksites have a functional core workplace health program in place <br />&bull; Participating employers have created a viable work environment that supports a culture of health. <br />&bull; The Contractor has captured and reported key success drivers involved in the establishment of a core workplace health program including elements from assessment through evaluation. <br />&bull; Participating employers and employees have raised their level of knowledge and awareness of healthy lifestyle behaviors targeting physical activity, nutrition, and tobacco use as well as workplace and community resources that support healthy lifestyles.<br />&bull; Participating employers and employees have increased their access and opportunity to engage in healthy lifestyle activities through the workplace and surrounding community. <br />&bull; The Contractor maintains and complies with defined requirements, is effective managed, and is fully functional.</p>
<p>Description of Work:<br />The Contractor shall develop and implement a comprehensive workplace health protection and promotion program plan to recruit employers into cohorts and establish and administer a comprehensive workplace health program at worksites within the cohort that addresses key employee lifestyle risks including physical inactivity, poor nutrition, and tobacco use. The plan shall reflect the appropriate use of evidence-based and promising workplace health programs, policies, and practices to reach all employees in a given worksite.</p>
<p>A detailed description of the tasks and deliverables to be accomplished during the project period is outlined below. General requirements include the following:</p>
<p>&bull; The Contractor will furnish all necessary labor, materials, supplies, equipment, and services to perform the work set forth below.<br />&bull; The Contractor will secure all necessary clearances such as the Institutional Review Board (IRB) and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approvals related to data collection. <br />&bull; The Contractor must possess the national capacity and reach as well as expertise that will allow it to effectively recruit employers of various sizes and industry sectors and work with them to develop, implement, and administer workplace health programs of similar complexity and scope across the national network.</p>
<p>Task 1: Program Kick-Off and Regular Communications<br />The Contractor will meet with CDC staff within two weeks of the Effective Date of the Contract in a kick-off meeting in order to gain a thorough understanding of the Comprehensive Workplace Health Programs to Address Physical Activity, Nutrition, and Tobacco Use in the Employee Population; review procedures/guidelines for support of the national network; review the strategy, goals, objectives, and associated tasks related to this program; and form a cohesive group of program stakeholders that includes representatives from CDC, a national program evaluator, and other partners. <br />Following the kick-off, the Contractor will participate in regular biweekly teleconference meetings that will guide the development of the cohorts and national network. CDC will provide the names and contact information for the project team members. <br />The Contractor will work with CDC to establish a communication system for the program using, as appropriate, e-mail, conference calls, and face-to-face meetings to work with the CDC program team.<br />Task 2: Identify, Select, and Recruit Seven Employer Cohorts to Participate in the National Network<br />The Contractor shall produce an employer recruitment and marketing plan that includes the following components:</p>
<p>1. Determination of the 7 geographic region(s) - where the Contractor will establish employer cohorts. Each employer cohort will be confined to a localized geographic area such as a town, city, or county ensuring participating employers easy access to and hands on involvement with Contractor staff at the worksite and opportunities for networking and mentoring among employers in each cohort such as having regional offices and staff in or near localities where cohorts are established.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall ensure that the 7 employer cohorts are distributed across the country according to HHS Region Map (http://www.hhs.gov/about/regionmap.html). The Contractor shall establish 1 cohort representing HHS Regions 1-3; 1 cohort representing HHS Region 4; 1 cohort representing HHS Region 5; 1 cohort representing HHS Region 6; 1 cohort representing HHS Regions 7-8; 1 cohort representing HHS Region 9; and 1 cohort representing HHS Region 10. Given that all employers in the each cohort must reside in the same localized geographic area, the Contractor will need to select the specific locality within the multi-state HHS Regions where the workplace health programs will be established. For example, the Contractor could choose to establish a cohort in Travis County, TX home to Austin, TX and representing HHS Region 6.</p>
<p>2. Selection of the composition of the 7 employer cohorts. Each employer cohort will consist of 10-15 individual employers. Each cohort will either consist of small employers (100 or less full-time employees), mid-size employers (101-250 full-time employees) or large employers (more than 250 full-time employees). The Contractor must strive for diversity within the cohort with respect to the industry sector of the individual employers as well as localities with high population prevalence of obesity and/or tobacco use, or other known or health disparities (identified through a population health database).</p>
<p>Eligible employers must have the following characteristics:<br />&bull; Demonstrated leadership commitment and support from the CEO/C-Suite including a commitment to allow employees to fully participate in voluntary workplace health protection and promotion program activities such as by allowing flexible scheduling of program activities <br />&bull; Cannot currently have in place a workplace health program that consists of a majority of the interventions described in Task #5and will expand existing efforts by implementing interventions, as described in task #5, not currently in place as part of their worksite health promotion. <br />&bull; Only Domestic employees and worksites will participate<br />&bull; For the largest employers (those with 500 or more full-time employee), the ability of the employer to invest a matching amount of funds, equal to those provided by the Contractor $50,000, into the company's workplace health program. This can include staff time related to the workplace health council or committee or support for additional interventions implemented during the project period.</p>
<p>CDC desires to work with approximately equal numbers of small, medium-sized, and large employers across the 7 cohorts representing multiple industry sectors. For example the Contractor may propose to establish three cohorts of small employers each consisting of 10 companies (30 total); 2 cohort of 15 mid-size employers (30 total); and 2 cohorts of large employers each consisting of 12 companies (24 total).</p>
<p>3. A recruitment protocol including the employer identification and engagement strategy including prioritization selection strategies for high levels of employer demand, and marketing and advertising materials including actual copies of all advertisement materials that will be used to recruit employers. Such materials include but are not limited to, flyers, videos or audio presentations regarding the comprehensive workplace health programs and national network and the final copy of printed advertisements. CDC will review recruitment methods and materials in order to ensure that such materials/methods are non-coercive and do not unduly influence employers to participate or the Contractor to recruit ineligible prospective employers. COTR will review for compliance and respond to the Contractor within 5 business days.</p>
<p>a. The recruitment protocol must include information that the Contractor will use to explain to prospective employers the elements of the core workplace health program; the expectations of the participating employer and the benefits of participation, as well as a letter of support for the employer CEO/C-Suite to sign indicating commitment to the program and working with the Contractor over a 24 month project period.</p>
<p>4. The Contractor shall document the all steps involved recruiting employers to participate including any challenges or key success drivers of interest to the national evaluation and include these in their monthly, year-end, and project-end progress reports.</p>
<p>Task 3: Engage CEO/C-Suite Leadership in Participating Worksites and Conduct Baseline Worksite Assessment through Worksite Site Visits<br />The Contractor shall develop and execute a site visit and assessment plan that includes the following components:</p>
<p>1. The Contractor will ensure that the data collection tools and methods used during the assessment phase are coordinated with the national evaluation of the program such as consistent use of instruments allowing for comparison among and between employer cohorts.</p>
<p>2. Conduct a site visit and kick-off meeting for participating employers. The purpose of the site visit would be to engage employers and employees through structured meetings with the organization's leadership (CEO/C-Suite) to outline goals and expectations for the workplace health program; gaining input and feedback from employees, managers, and senior executive leaders on their health and safety needs, concerns or interests; begin to understand what health and safety risks are present, how are they monitored?, and what is currently being done to address them?; and begin to develop a trusting relationship with the employer and employees in order to garner high voluntary participation rates.</p>
<p>3. Conduct assessment activities to gather baseline data on employees and the organization. The Contractor shall collect appropriate worksite assessment information necessary for the successful planning , implementation, and evaluation of the core workplace health interventions. Worksite assessment will involve data collection at both the individual (3a below) and organizational level (3b below).<br />a. At the individual level, the Contractor will assess elements of an employee's health, such as their health behaviors related to physical activity, nutrition, and tobacco; health risk factors such as high blood pressure and overweight/obesity; and current health status. The Contractor will be required to conduct a health risk assessment with demographic questions to accomplish the employee assessment.<br />b. At the organizational level, the Contractor will assess elements of the workplace structure, culture, practices and policies related to health and safety such as health benefits, health promotion programs, occupational health programs, work organization, and leadership and management support (CEO/C-Suite) for workplace health and safety initiatives. Additionally, environmental elements of the physical workplace such as facilities and settings where employees work as well as access and opportunities for health promotion provided by the surrounding community where employees live will be explored. The Contractor will be required to conduct organizational readiness assessment, environmental audit, culture survey, and/or hold meetings with leadership, employee, and their representatives (e.g., unions if applicable) to accomplish the organizational assessment.</p>
<p>4. In order to get an accurate sense of the dynamics of the workplace and the key health issues of concern to employees and the employer, the Contractor will obtain a variety of viewpoints within each participating worksite and corroborate findings from several sources of information such as management interviews, employee focus groups, labor representatives, records and documents, or surveys.</p>
<p>5. Document the processes involved in collecting, maintaining, protecting the confidentiality, and reporting of individual employee and organizational health data in accordance with applicable laws and regulations, including, but not limited to, GINA, HIPAA, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) and the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH Act). The contractor will take steps to ensure that data collected on individual employees is only provided to the employer in an aggregate form so as not to identify individual employers as well as discriminate against any employee.</p>
<p>6. The Contractor shall document all steps taken in engaging company leadership (CEO/C-Suite) and conducting baselines assessment including any challenges or key success drivers of interest to the national evaluation and include these in their monthly, year-end, and project-end progress reports.</p>
<p>NOTE: As applicable, the Contractor shall prepare the Institutional Review Board (IRB) and/or Office of Management and Budget (OMB) clearance packages for data collection activities. The timeline for securing these packages can take months and need to be started as soon as the data collection instruments have been identified within the first 4-6 weeks of the award.</p>
<p>Task 4: Establish a Site-level Organizational Structure<br />The Contractor shall develop and execute a workplace governance and infrastructure plan that includes the following components:<br />1. Introduce the contract staff member who will serve as the workplace health coordinator for the employers within a cohort as well as any additional contractors who will support the coordinator. The coordinator will oversee the workplace health program, chairs and regularly convenes the workplace health committee, and oversees the program budget. The coordinator will be the primary liaison between the employer and Contractor.</p>
<p>2. Establish a workplace health council or committee. The committee should have representation from a broad range of organizational units, human resources and occupational health and safety personnel, workers and their representatives (e.g., unions), and supervisors (including managers from multiple shifts if appropriate). The level of influence by employees should reflect the level of authority and expertise they have in other business functions. The council or committee will assist the workplace health coordinator in developing a plan and design to guide actions to improve health and promote the program throughout the worksite.</p>
<p>3. Establish site-level champions. At least one champion will be a senior executive who can demonstrate organizational commitment to the workplace health program by consistently communicating to all levels of the organization the workplace health program's goals, objectives, and activities; serve as a role model to employees; dedicate additional resources or matching funds to the workplace health program.</p>
<p>4. Establish community linkages/leverage community resources and ongoing programs such as Communities Putting Prevention to Work (http://www.cdc.gov/CommunitiesPuttingPreventiontoWork/index.htmI), non-profits such as the American Cancer Society or Y-USA to help facilitate and enhance employee education and awareness; access and opportunity to participation in the workplace health program; and reinforce health messages and lifestyles skills outside of work. Additionally, each cohort of employers can drawn upon each other's experience and knowledge through networking and mentoring to advance the workplace health program at each site.</p>
<p>5. The Contractor shall document all steps taken in establishing the site-level organizational structure including any challenges or key success drivers of interest to the national evaluation and include these in their monthly, year-end, and project-end progress reports. <br />Task 5: Establish a Site-level Workplace Health Improvement Plan<br />The Contractor shall develop and execute a workplace health improvement plan for each participating worksite that includes the following components:</p>
<p>1. Specific, measurable goals and objectives for the workplace health program that are aligned with overall business objectives <br />2. Determination of the core set of interventions to be implemented. Each employer worksite within the cohort will implement a core set of 3-5 evidence-based interventions that include a mix of interventions such as health-related programs (e.g., education, seminar, and coaching), health-related policy, and environmental supports and are targeting physical activity, nutrition, and/or tobacco use in the employee population. The interventions selected are designed to change individual behavior and the work environment. <br />Examples of workplace health program components and strategies include:<br />a. Program - opportunities available to employees at the workplace or through outside organizations to begin, change or maintain health behaviors. <br />i. Classes or seminars on fitness, nutrition, tobacco cessation or stress management<br />ii. Weight management programs that offer counseling, coaching, and education<br />iii. Physical activity classes or walking clubs<br />iv. Tobacco cessation counseling through a quitline, or health plan<br />v. Lifestyle coaching or counseling<br />vi. Signage related to program components<br />vii. Information resources such as brochures, videos, posters, pamphlets, newsletters, or other information that addresses the risks of physical inactivity, poor nutrition, and tobacco use <br />b. Policy - formal or informal written statements that are designed to protect or promote employee health.<br />i. Company policies that promote healthy behaviors such as a tobacco-free campus policy<br />ii. A policy that healthy foods will always or exclusively be made available at all company meetings or functions where food is served. <br />iii. A food procurement policy that limits the sale of food and beverages high in sodium, calories, transfats, or saturated fats<br />iv. A policy allowing employees paid work time or flextime (i.e., flexible scheduling) to engage in workplace health program activities such as physical activity programs. <br />c. Environmental Support - refers to the physical factors at and nearby the workplace that help protect and enhance employee health. <br />i. Access to onsite or near-by fitness facilities<br />ii. Worksite stairwell enhancement and promotion<br />iii. Making healthy foods available and accessible through vending machines or cafeterias <br />iv. Menu labeling/signage including nutritional information on calories, sodium, transfats, and saturated fats.<br />v. Providing employees with food preparation and storage facilities such as a microwave ovens, sinks, refrigerators, and/or kitchens<br />vi. Establishing an onsite Farmer's Market<br />vii. Establishing environmental supports for recreation and exercise such as establishing walking/running trails; utilize multi-purpose space for physical activity classes, maps of suitable walking routes, bicycle racks, a basketball court, open space designated for recreation or exercise, a shower and changing facility <br />viii. Create a work environment free of recognized health and safety threats with a means to identify and address new problems as they arise</p>
<p>The interventions selected must be consistent across the employers in each cohort ensuring some uniformity and shared learning across the cohort to the extent possible taking into consideration unique contextual factors present at the worksite such as employee interests, industry sector, and specific workplace barriers and constraints. Additionally, interventions selected as the core set of interventions should include multiple strategies to address a common risk such as using a program element, policy element, and environmental support to address nutrition. For example, a cohort of small employers in Travis County, TX are all working with the Contractor on implementing interventions to improve the food environment in their worksites including establishing onsite Farmer's Markets (policy/environmental), nutrition education and weight management classes (program), and labeling on foods served in cafeterias and vending machines (environmental). The employers in a second cohort in Seattle, WA are all working with the Contractor on implementing interventions to improve physical activity access and opportunity including establishing a walking club (program), marking an outdoor walking trail around the worksite (environmental), and allowing employees flextime during the day to participate (policy).</p>
<p>All programs must be made available to all employees at no cost to them.</p>
<p>The contractor will use ready-made interventions and not use resources available through this task order to develop interventions (e.g., health education curricula, health coaching models, policy templates, methods for enacting environmental supports). Tailoring existing interventions and protocols to meet the unique needs of individual employers participating in the program is appropriate. The Contractor will need to be aware of the individual worksite employee population needs related to age, health literacy, or disability status and interests and identify appropriate interventions for the employee population. For example, a web-based education program would not be appropriate in certain construction firm work environments where the majority of employees do not have access to computers at work.</p>
<p>The Contractor should also be aware, especially during the selection of interventions and the designing of policies to protect, promote or implement such interventions, of any federal and/or state laws that may apply to worksite wellness programs, generally. Such laws include, but are not limited to, the nondiscrimination provisions included in the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), and the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA). All program elements must be consistent and comply with relevant workplace health laws and regulations. The contractor should document the steps taken to adhere to and comply with these relevant workplace health laws and regulations.</p>
<p><br />3. Timelines for action showing specific action steps and dates by which they will be completed and staff responsible. <br />4. A communications plan that includes:<br />a. Creating a brand identity for the program;<br />b. Creating materials and messages to reach all employees in support of the program goals <br />c. Leveraging multiple communications channels (e.g., email, print, kiosk, bulletin board, web, in person) to reach and engage all employees in support of program goals including newer technologies such as social media<br />d. Marketing the program to all employees <br />e. Processes to share the results and progress of the programs with leadership (CEO/C-Suite) and employees to build engagement and trust;<br />f. Raising employee awareness of workplace health and safety risks and opportunities for health protection and promotion. <br />5. An evaluation plan including process and outcomes measures<br />a. Measures related to the process of establishing and delivering the interventions and building the infrastructure as well as quality assurance of all program elements; <br />b. Methods to report on employee engagement through program participation and satisfaction with program delivery and services;<br />c. Pre/post assessment in aggregate employee health behaviors and risk factors; employee intention to make lifestyle changes;<br />d. Methods to capture lessons learned; success stories at individual worksites and across the cohort; and culture changes within the worksite;<br />e. Absenteeism Indicators and metrics pertaining to health-related productivity. <br />6. An itemized budget with key resources such as staffing, equipment, space, materials and programming to support the workplace health program beginning with assessment through program evaluation. The Contractor will budget approximately $50,000-100,000 per small and medium-sized employer worksite and approximately $50,000 for a large employer worksite with 500 or more full-time employees.<br />7. The Contractor shall document all steps taken in Establishing the Site-level Workplace Health Improvement Plans including any challenges or key success drivers of interest to the national evaluation and include these in their monthly, year-end, and project-end progress reports.</p>
<p>Task 6: Implement and Manage Each Site Level Workplace Health program <br />The Contractor shall ensure all elements of the workplace health improvement plan are implemented at each worksite within each cohort within 12 months of the contract award allow for employee participation during the second 12 months of the project period.</p>
<p>This includes:<br />1. The Contractor shall implement processes to maximize leadership (CEO/C-Suite) and employee engagement that consist of timelines with specific milestones that address the following:</p>
<p>a. The program's development and progress is regularly reported to the company's leadership (CEO/C-Suite) and employees to develop organizational support.<br />b. Within the parameters of applicable federal and/or state laws, efforts are made to maximize employee participation. (The use of financial incentives for participating employees within the cohorts is not authorized, however, the Contractor may propose the use of other non financial incentives or work with existing incentive structures already present as allowed by applicable federal and/or state laws). The Contractor will need to be aware of the individual worksite employee population needs related to age, health literacy, or disability status and interests and identify appropriate interventions for the employee population. For example, a web-based education program would not be appropriate in certain construction firm work environments where the majority of employees do not have access to computers at work. <br />c. The Contractor has regular interaction and an onsite presence with company leadership (CEO/C-Suite), the workplace wellness committee, and participating employees.<br />d. Ensuring the program interventions are effectively communicated and marketed no less than on a weekly basis throughout the company. <br />e. Monitors employee satisfaction with program offerings.</p>
<p>2. The Contractor ensures program delivery of all the workplace health program initiatives and interventions with support of company leadership (CEO/C-Suite) and the workplace health committee.<br />a. Activities occurring during the program implementation stage include participant registration, program orientation for employees, strategies to maintain employee motivation such as individual goal setting, development of social support systems, program tracking of goals and objectives</p>
<p>3. The Contractor shall document all steps taken in Implementing and Managing Each Site Level Workplace Health Program including any challenges or key success drivers of interest to the national evaluation and include these in their monthly, year-end, and project-end progress reports.</p>
<p>Task 7: Process and Outcome Evaluation<br />The Contractor shall be required to conduct process evaluations as part of the workplace health improvement plan to examine all the steps and activities taken in implementing the workplace health program and the outputs they generate, such as the number and type of educational materials for a nutrition education class that are developed and given to participating employees. Process measures will also determine employee exposure (reach and frequency) to the workplace health program. The Contractor shall also be required to conduct outcome evaluations to measure changes in organizational policy or practice; employee participation and engagement; pre/post assessment of employee health behaviors and risks, and behavioral intentions to make lifestyle changes, and absenteeism pertaining to health-related productivity. The Contractor shall work with the CDC program team to determine the most appropriate data collection methods (e.g., a customized survey, interview guide, environmental audit, etc.). Additionally, the Contractor shall work with CDC on the national evaluation of the program including all 7 employer cohorts in identified states and communities to gain an understanding of the impact of the program.</p>
<p>&bull; The Contractor shall create a workplace health program evaluation plan with objectives that are feasible and measurable. <br />&bull; In addition, outcome evaluation of workplace health program activities within the participating employer cohorts will be incorporated in the evaluation activities of the overall national network such as the development of employer case studies. The Contractor shall work with the national evaluator to nominate employers within the cohort to be the subject of the case studies. The Contractor shall ensure that any employer-based evaluation activities complement, and are not redundant with, national project evaluation efforts. <br />&bull; In particular, the Contractor shall be responsible for compiling and reporting to CDC data on the outcome measures identified in the following table. Frequency of reporting is also indicated.<br />&bull; The Contractor shall document all steps taken in establishing the process and outcome evaluations including any challenges or key success drivers of interest to the national evaluation and include these in their monthly, year-end, and project-end progress reports.</p>
<p>NOTE: As applicable, the Contractor shall prepare the Institutional Review Board (IRB) and/or Office of Management and Budget (OMB) clearance packages for data collection activities. The timeline for securing these packages can take months and need to be started well in advance. <br />Required Measures<br />Note: Baseline measures for participating employers within the cohorts will be established during the assessment period (Task 3).</p>

<p>Deliverables:</p>
<p>The attached table summarizes the deliverables required for this project based on the tasks therein. The focus of the tasks will be primarily on establishing the workplace health program within the Contractor's employer cohorts (recruitment, assessment, infrastructure building, planning, implementation and evaluation). Additional tasks focus on activities to support the national network (training, technical assistance, networking/mentoring, partnership development, national evaluation).</p>
<p>Criteria for Acceptance: <br />The contractor, as an independent party and not as an agent of the government, shall provide to the COTR the following when completing deliverables: timeliness; accuracy of data; and crosscheck to monthly/quarterly reports, narratives, and invoices.</p>
<p><br />Special Clearances:</p>
<p>Design of any data collection or evaluation measurement tools or activities must take into account the requirements for exemptions to OMB public survey clearance procedures. For any methods requiring OMB or IRB clearance, the Contractor shall prepare the appropriate packages for clearance.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall obtain Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval under the Paperwork Reduction Act for all information collection activities. It may be appropriate for the contractor to develop a generic clearance mechanism under which specific activities can be submitted to OMB; the Contractor is responsible for consulting with CDC and OMB to determine if and how a generic mechanism might facilitate the work in this SOW. The Contractor is responsible preparing the supporting statements and information collection instruments needed to obtain OMB approval under the PRA. The Contractor is responsible for consulting with CDC in the development of the instruments. Although the Contractor may wish to draw on questions that have been used in prior CDC studies, the Contractor should not limit their assessments only to survey items or questions that have been used previously. Even though questions/instruments may have been cleared by OMB for use in other studies, they must be submitted to OMB for clearance in the context of the study design and population specific to this project.</p>
<p>This is not intended to be a research contract. The Contractor shall not use these funds to engage in any form of research involving human subjects without express authorization from the CDC Project Officer and all necessary Institutional Review Boards, exemption-granting entities and/or other organizations whose approval may be required by the Code of Federal Regulations and other applicable state and federal regulations that may be in effect at the time of such proposed research.</p>
<p>IT Security <br />During any application development or enhancement, the contractor shall work closely with the NCCDPHP Office of Informatics and Information Resources (OIIRM) to ensure all CDC-related technical and security standards, processes and procedures are followed. This working relationship shall continue through full production.</p>
<p>Contractor's performance and resulting deliverables must adhere to all federal, HHS, and/or CDC IT security, privacy and Section 508 policies and procedures. Development or implementation of an electronic information system or any electronic data collection effort conducted in the performance of this contract will be required to complete Certification and Accreditation (C&amp;A) prior to operation resulting in an Authority of Operate (ATO) from CDC. The contractor shall be required to complete all security documentation and materials required to obtain an ATO. The contractor shall comply with all applicable HHS, CDC, FISMA, HIPPA, NIST, and other federal policies and regulations in the performance of the security requirements.</p>

All information systems development or implemented in support of this contract must adhere to the security controls outlined in the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication 800-53, Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems and Organizations (http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-53-Rev3/sp800-53-rev3-final-errata.pdf).</p>
<p>The Contractor must follow the guidance in NIST Special Publications, Guidelines on Securing Public Web Servers, NIST publication SP 800-44 (http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-44-ver2/SP800-44v2.pdf) and Guide to Secure Web Services, NIST publication SP 800-95 (http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-95/SP800-95.pdf). See the Web Application Security Consortium (http://www.webappsec.org) and the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP - http://www.owasp.org) for tips on how to avoid security problems in Web applications.</p>
<p>508 Compliance <br />All IT development must adhere to Section 508 of the 1986 addition to the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. <br />There are three regulations addressing the requirements detailed in Section 508: <br />&bull; The Section 508 technical and functional standards are codified at 36 CFR Part 1194 and may be accessed through the Access Board's Web site at http://www.access-board.gov<br />&bull; The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 39.2 requires that agency acquisitions of Electronic and Information Technology (EIT) comply with the Access Board's standards. The entire FAR is found at Chapter 1 of the Code of Federal Register (CFR) Title 48, located at http://www.acquisition.gov. The FAR rule implementing Section 508 can be found at http://www.section508.gov. <br />&bull; The HHS Acquisition Regulation (HHSAR) which can be found at http://www.hhs.gov/policies/hhsar/</p>
<p>Project Management<br />The contractor will follow the DHHS Enterprise Performance Life Cycle (EPLC) framework which will provide a standard structure for planning, managing, and overseeing IT projects over their entire life cycle. The framework consists of ten life cycle phases. Within each phase, activities, responsibilities, reviews and deliverables are defined. Exit criteria are established for each phase and Stage Gate reviews are conducted through the IT Governance process to ensure that the project's management quality, soundness, and technical feasibility remain adequate and the project is ready to move forward to the next phase. All IT projects in support of this task must adhere to the EPLC requirements and pass each State Gate as appropriate. More information about EPLC can be found at http://www.hhs.gov/ocio/eplc/.</p>

<p>Title: Formation and Maintenance of a Technical Advisory Group for United<br />States Representation on ISO Technical Committee 34 Subcommittee 9<br />BACKGROUND<br />The purpose of this contract is to form and maintain a technical advisory group (TAG) that will represent the United States on the International Organization for Standardization's (ISO) Technical Committee 34 (TC 34) Subcommittee 9 (SC 9). ISO is an international non governmental organization, based in Geneva, Switzerland, that is a network of 163 national standards institutes including the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) whose headquarters are located in Washington, DC. ISO's mission is to provide "International Standards for Business, Government and Society." A central role of ISO is to make trade between countries easier and fairer by harmonizing standards among nations. For example, ISO 17025:2005 (General requirements for the competence of testing and calibration laboratories) specifies the general competencies that microbiological and chemical testing laboratories must possess in order to be considered reliable for food testing. FDA laboratories are ISO L1025:2005 certified, as are the vast majority of regulatory laboratories around the world. This certification allows for a certain level of trust and confidence that would otherwise not be available if there were no common standards. ISO methods are internationally recognized and have a significant impact on trade. For example, ISO methods are recognized by organizations such as the European Committee for Standardization (CEN) which is comprised of the 31 member states of the European Union (EU). As enunciated by the CEN on its website http:i/rvu'w.cen,eulcer/AboutUs/Pages/defauh.aspx):<br />"These standards have a unique status since they also are national standards in each of its 31 Member countries. With one common standard in all these countries and every conflicting national standard withdrawn, a product can reach a far wider market with much lower development and testing costs. European Standards help build a European Intemal Market for goods and services and position Europe in the global economy. More than 60.000 technical experts as well as business federations, consumer and other societal interest organizations are involved in the CEN network that reaches over 480 million people." The Vienna Agreement signed by CEN in 1991 with ISO, its international counterpart- ensures technical cooperation by correspondence, mutual representation at meetings, coordination meetings, and adoption of the same text, as both an ISO Standard and as a European Standard. Thus, ISO methods, including those for food microbiology, are the official reference methods of the EU and all of its member states. ISO has an important and significant role in the standardization of food microbiological testing methods. It exercises this role through TC 34lSC 9. TC 34 is responsible for the international standards of "Food Products" and SC 9 is specifically responsible for food microbiology. SC 9 is comprised of 30 participating/voting nations and24 observing/non-voting nations, as well as 14 liaison non-governmental organizations. These liaison organizations include, but are not limited to, AOAC International, International Commission of Microbiological Specifications for Foods, and the World Health Organization. TC 34lSC 9 is responsible for 62 standards. Microbiological standards or methods, under the purview of TC 34lSC 9, include those for pathogens such as Salmonella (ISO 6579:2002), Listeria monocytogeres (ISO 11290, parts 1 and 2), and E. coli OI57:H7 (ISO 16654:2001) to name a few. All food microbiological methods relevant to the FDA arise from TC 34lSC 9. The United States is currently neither a participant nor observer nation on ISO TC 34lSC 9. Consequently, it has no official input regarding the adoption of microbiological testing methods for foods even though its public health and trade interests arc at stake. The intent of this statement of work is to remedy this situation by forming a TAG that would represent the interests of the United States on ISO TC 34lSC 9. TAGs represent the interests of nations and are composed of representatives from government, industry and academia who arrive at consensus positions regarding their areas of expertise. Members of US TAG for TC 34lSC 9 will, with the support of their organizations, participate in working groups that will develop and validate microbiological methods for the detection of bacterial pathogens in foods. Creation of a TAG will provide the US with a vote on TC 34lSC 9 and enable the US to share its knowledge and resources in the development and validation of ISO reference methods. Formation of this TAG will advance FDA's public health mission by allowing it, as an active participant, to ensure the accuracy and reliability of ISO reference methods. Having accurate and reliable ISO reference methods is a key step in making imported foods safer for US consumers.<br />SCOPE OF WORK<br />The contractor tasks include: Direct Administration of the US TAG for ISO TC 34l SC 9<br />Organization of the US TAG.Approval by ANSI of the TAG administrator and initial TAG membership list and accreditation of the TAG.

<p>BASIS FOR AWARD: The actual award amount will be $200,000 for this contract. Our objective is to obtain the highest possible quantity for this dollar amount. Your added rate per thousand "overs" will/could be used to either increase or decrease your firm's bid price to reach this dollar amount. The failure to provide an added rate will render your firm's proposal non-responsive.</p>
<p>QUALITY: Level 1 printing and finishing attributes are required for this specification. Reference GPO publication 310.1 for attribute requirements. Printing is the predominate production function and none shall be subcontracted. All con&not;tractors offering a bid shall have passed the NCI Requirements for New Bidders prior to consideration of their proposal for award.

<p>PROOFS: Provide a laminated, digital, color proof, stripped to show the full press sheet imposition, including colorbar, showing guide, gripper and ruled-up for all bindery marks on each form. Proofs shall have a PIA/GATF Proof Comparator (or similar process control) affixed to the back or face of the proof. Spot colors shall be a match of the Pantone reference books on the laminated proofs (with ink draw downs provided for approval, on the proposed substrates). Additionally, provide two inkjet "dylux-styled reader" proofs, with all elements in proper position, folded and trimmed to final size. NCI shall keep 1 digital dylux.</p>

<p>Only those papers listed above as approved equals will be considered. See 46th. edition (Spring 2010~2011 issue) of the Competitive Grade Finder. Both the text and cover stocks, when required, must be the same brand name items, and all the leaves within each book must be matching. American mill brand manufactured papers only, private label papers and or for&not;eign manufactured papers shall not be acceptable.</p>
<p>INKS: Four color process, PMS 364 Green and dense Black Ink. Solid inks required, no builds allowed. Inks shall contain minimum percentages of vegetable oil in com&not;pliance with federal procurement mandates.</p>

NOTE: "web-growth" shall not be acceptable.</p>
<p>SEPARATIONS: None required. Stochastic: 20 micron techniques are necessary, or 200 line screens minimum, if done through conventional offset lithographic print process.</p>
<p>FORMAT: 64 text pages (circle folioed) plus wraparound cover pages 1-4.</p>
<p>PRINTING: Print covers 1 and 4 in a bleeding all sides background of PMS 364 using various thin strips of tints in different percentages. Black overprint text and rules prints on both pages with a reversed to white border on cover one. An illustration appears on cover one, approximately 6" x 10" reproduced using all four process ink colors and centered in the white border. Cover 2 print with PMS 364, with Black type matter and a ghosted-back process illustration. Type matter only in both PMS 364 and Black inks for cover 3.

Print the balance in PMS 364 Green and dense Black inks only.</p>
<p>NOTE: Traps and varnish/coating masks are entirely the contractor's responsibility. Heavy ink coverage is required and the contractor must take any and all nec&not;essary precautions to prevent ghosting &amp; lay a smooth uniform ink film. This prod&not;uct shall be manufactured on a lithographic printing press capable of printing all the required colors with one pass through the press and the complete color bar as detailed on page 4 of these specifications. Do not assume "perfecting" is acceptable to the government. The inspector shall use the following criteria to determine acceptability. If the inspector is unable to determine by examination which side is first down, then press perfecting is acceptable. Web fed printing techniques shall be on dryer equipped presses only. Ghosting &amp; "in-line problems" shall not be acceptable.</p>
<p>COATING: Overall aqueous coat, satin finish, on outside covers pages 1 and 4 only. A "dry- trapped" overall varnish may NOT be substituted.</p>
<p>DISPLAY EXAMINATION: Examination of the furnished materials is an integral part of these specifications. No additional payment will be allowed, due the contractor's failure to examine the copy and thoroughly understand the nature and extent of the work to be performed.</p>
<p>PRESS INSPECTION: Press sheets shall be inspected at the contractor's printing facility for quality conformance. Each press sheet form must contain one color bar, at least 3/16" in width, for each ink color placed parallel to the ink rollers. Color control bars (such as, BRUNNER, GATF or GRETAG) must contain star targets, trapping, tint and dot gain patches, process built grays, if applicable, and extend the full width of the press sheet. Ink densities shall be constant across the full width of the sheet with no deviations to exceed plus or minus 1/2 of one percent. Light and heavy inking is not allowed. The contractor shall provide the correct viewing conditions for all press sheet inspections including 5000&deg; kelvin light sources housed in a completely enclosed neutral gray-booth and functional densitometers. If the presses are equipped with automatic scanners you are NOT relieved of the requirement for the customer colorbar as detailed above.</p>
<p>PREAWARD SURVEY: In order to determine the responsibility of the prime contractor, the government reserves the right to conduct a preaward survey, or to require samples to QATAP evaluate, or other evidence of technical, managerial, financial and similar abilities to perform, prior to the award of a contract.</p>
<p>PACKING: Plastic strap or shrink wrap in units of 10 copies only, paper banding shall not be allowed. Turn the items if necessary, to form a "neat" stack.

<p>&bull; The instrument will have an operating temperature range of at least -5 to 50&deg;C.</p>
<p>&bull; The instrument will have bottom tracking capabilities.</p>
<p><br />Data Specifications:</p>
<p>&bull; The output data stream will provide user selectable ensemble averaged binary data that can also be stored within the meter and binary or ASCII data simultaneously transmitted to the output port.</p>
<p>&bull; The internal data storage will be a first in first out (FIFO) configuration always holding the last data obtained in memory. Memory will be retained in the event of power failure. The recorder will have at least 128 Mbytes of storage.</p>
<p>&bull; Communications with the meter will be user selectable serial RS232, RS422. The baud rate will be selectable from 1200 to 115,200.</p>
<p>&bull; The ADCP will be capable of operating in a polled mode. At the end of each averaging interval the ADCP will automatically record the data on the internal recorder. The ADCP will also place the new averaged profile into an output buffer in user selectable ASCII or binary format. The last averaged profile will remain in the output buffer until the averaging time for a new profile is completed. At this time, the contents of the buffer will automatically be replaced with the new profile. Anytime during data collection, the ADCP can be commanded to transmit the contents of the buffer. This will be done by sending a single character command to the ADCP through the serial port. Additional single character commands will be provided to output a date/time string, incrementally adjust the clock by + - one second, and output the ensemble number. These commands can be done as often as wanted without affecting data collection.</p>
<p>&bull; The output data stream will provide the following information with each ensemble:<br />Date, time &amp; serial number<br />User selectable Earth or Beam coordinate velocity data<br />Heading, pitch, roll and temperature data<br />Echo intensity and an indication of signal quality</p>
<p>&bull; Each system will be provided with software to set up and test the meter, display real-time data, and decode the data from the meter in engineering units in a user selectable format.</p>
<p>&bull; Must have the capability of screening data using correlation.</p>

<DESC>A. This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This procurement is being issued in accordance with the procedures in FAR Part 12 and 15. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation. Proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.
<p>B. The United States Coast Guard (USCG) intends to procure up to twelve (12) Special Purpose Craft - Ice Rescue (SPC-IR) and associated support line items. The solicitation number is HSCG23-11-R-MOT008 and is being issued as a Request for Proposals (RFP) under NAICS Code 336612 (size standard: 500 or fewer employees). As set forth in more detail in the attached clauses at FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items (Jan 1999), the USCG intends to conduct a two-phase evaluation process to determine the offeror that represents the best value to the Government. The first phase will involve evaluation of written proposals as submitted by offerors, in accordance with the evaluation factors set forth in the FAR 52.212-2 clause herein, and the procurement under&nbsp;firm fixed price contracts of up to four (4) SPC - IR crafts and associated support line items from up to four (4) different offerors. USCG acceptance of these boats will mark the completion of those contracts and the end of Phase I. The second phase will involve physical testing and evaluation of the delivered boats of the initial awardees. Upon completion of the second phase evaluation process, the offeror that represents the best value to the Government, based on the evaluation factors set forth in the FAR 52.212-2 clause herein, will be awarded a single four (4) year Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) firm fixed price contract for up to twelve (12) SPC-IR boats and associated support line items. The minimum number of SPC-IR boats to be procured under this IDIQ contract is one (1). The contract will have four (4) ordering periods of up to one (1) year each. The Government reserves the right to hold discussions and establish a competitive range. All qualified and responsible sources may submit proposals which shall be considered by the agency. The solicitation document, and the incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-41.</p>
<p>C. The SPC-IR is required to fulfill the USCG ice rescue mission. The vessel shall be capable of traversing multi-terrain cold weather environments including open waters, rough water (up to three feet), solid ice, thin ice, broken ice and snow, emphasizing safety for the crew, passengers and personnel. The SPC-IR is used as a transport vessel, delivering an ice rescue team and gear to recover survivors stranded on an ice floe. There is a possibility that the SPC-IR could be used in emergency flood or hurricane conditions to recover stranded survivors. The SPC-IR will be used as a long-haul deployment craft and ice rescue cases where the response is greater than one-half of a nautical mile and less than ten miles from shore. While the primary mission of the SPC-IR is a delivery platform for ice rescue crews, it will also provide in some cases the only small-boat multi-mission response during ice conditions. Each SPC-IR shall be manufactured to satisfy the attached specification.</p>
<p>D. Offerors shall provide prices for the Contract Line Item Numbers (CLIN) on the attached CLIN price worksheet for the boat to be used for phase-one down select evaluation (page 1) and for the boats that may be ordered in support of the IDIQ contract. Offerors shall list additional CLINs (if any) they believe are necessary to successfully complete the requirement in accordance with the specification. In addition to listing the CLINs, the offeror shall list the price, the discounted price (if separately priced), and describe its necessity.</p>
<p>E. The following attachments are included and are hereby incorporated into this solicitation: (1) Specification, (2) CLIN Price Worksheet, (3) Past Performance Questionnaire, (4) FAR and Department of Homeland Security Acquisition Regulation (HSAR) Clauses and Provisions, and (5) List of Delivery Locations.</p>

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:<br />Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Commandant (CG-931)<br />U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters<br />Procurement Planning &amp; Oversight Division<br />1900 Half St., SW, JR11-0203<br />Washington, DC 20593-0001</p>

Contract award resulting will be a Firm-Fixed Price (FFP) Contract. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation. The solicitation and all supporting information is included in this posting.  The solicitation document and the incorporated provisions and clauses are in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 31. This procurement is issued as a 100% total small business set-aside. The applicable North American Classification System (NAICS) Code for this acquisition is 561410.

Schedule of Services:
CLIN 0001: Transcription Services Qty  300 hours 
This work effort is to transcribe 300 recorded hours of oral history and combat interviews covering a wide range of topics and subjects.  The interviews are not classified.  The contractor may not release any of the transcribed pages to anyone but the U. S Government, the Marine Corps History Division.  The original recordings will be returned to History Division upon completion with the transcribed interviews on CDs.

Statement of Work:  
Transcription Services

Background

To conduct a well-rounded history program, Marine Corps History Division (the government) collects a wide variety of oral history interviews.
  In recorded form, these interviews are difficult to use and cannot be electronically searched.  Transcribing the interviews into written documents is the key element in making oral histories useful for writers and historians.  The transcripts are a vital part of the official historical and operational record of the Marine Corps and are stored in the Marine Corps Archives.    
	
Objectives

Accurately transcribe 300 interview hours of oral history interviews.  

Scope 

Because the Marine Corps transcribes only 10  15% of all interviews, accuracy is a very critical element.  Inaccurate transcription could materially change the content, thus rendering the transcription useless.  Additionally, greater accuracy increases the transcripts versatility to the Marine Corps.
   Transcriptions are placed in the Oral History files for use and uploaded to the Marine Corps Sharepoint data base.  Although government property, the transcripts or original recordings may not be released to any other government agency; the contractor must return all transcripts and original recordings to History Division.    

Tasks

 Contractors price quote shall be per recorded (interview) hour; not by page, transcribing hour, character or line.  
 Demonstrate prior experience in transcribing military oral history interviews.  Marine Corps experience is preferred.     
 Include round trip postage costs in the bid.  The interview files are copied to compact discs (CD).  The contractor must return to the government the original interview CDs.
  
 Transcriptions of oral history interviews must be accurate and comply with specified formats (provided).  
 The government expects to review sample transcriptions during the task to maintain quality control.
 If the quality of a recording is so poor or there is so much background noise that the interview is difficult to hear or understand, the contractor should skip that recording and note that in a tracking file.  Skip interviews that cannot be readily understood to avoid expending resources on unintelligible material.  
 Work from video, cassette, .dss, .ds2 and .wav files.   
 Oral history interviews often contain sensitive (not classified) operational or personal information.
  Contractor must control all personally identifiable information contained in the interviews and protect under current regulations and public laws.  
 Return all sound recordings to the government. 

Provided by the Government

 The government provides a current acronym and terminology list.  The contractor will be expected to research and decipher any acronyms not on the list, add to the acronym list and return a copy of the updated list to the government at the conclusion of the contract.  

 Upon contract award, the government provides an example Word document template for the title page and instructions on formatting specifications.

Deliverables

The contractor shall deliver via email, interview transcripts using MS Word which meet formatting specifications with minimal errors in terminology, content and acronym use.
  The contractor will be expected to pace their work by providing at least 6 hours of audio transcription per week.  The work effort is complete after all transcripts have been emailed and upon the return of the original CDs containing the interviews.
  

Period of Performance     
	
The period of performance is no more than 150 calendar days after delivery to the contractor of the recorded interviews.

<DESC>Under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1 (Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements), the Washington, D.C. Department of Veterans Affairs medical Center (DC VAMC) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Corbett Technical Solutions, Inc. for Rauland Responder 5 system. A maintenance contract is needed for the current Rauland Responder System 5 to provide scheduled and unscheduled maintenance, and technical telephone support software enhancement, and parts exchange. A service center providing 24 hour technical support for hospital staff to contact is needed to ensure minimal downtime and quality patient care.  Live phone support is also needed to assist user and biomedical staff through issues that can assist through equipment malfunctions. The service contractor will provide parts and labor for equipment malfunctions, preventive maintenance, software enhancement, live phone support, and parts exchanges as needed. This piece of equipment cannot be serviced in house. A reduction in the hospital communication system compacity would place hospital service response time to an unacceptable level. The proposed contractor is the only original equipment manufacturer and maintenance provider that is authorized to install certified original manufacturer parts for the Da Vinci Surgical Robot.
 
This is a notice of intent and is not for competitive proposals. It is not a solicitation of a request for offers. No solicitation package is available. Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the government. A determination not to compete the proposed requirement based upon the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Responses must be received no later than June 28, 2011 @ 2:00 PM. Local time.  No telephone inquiries will be accepted. The mailing address for the Contracting Officer is Veterans Affairs Medical Center, VISN 5 Contract Satellite Office (90C), 50 Irving Street NW, Room BH-135, Washington, DC 20422, Attn:  Robert Perry.

Department of Veterans Affairs medical Center (DC VAMC) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Intuitive Surgical, Inc.. Emergency service is needed to establish a service contract with a vendor to maintain a Da Vinci Surgical Robot located at the Department of Veterans Affairs located at the Washington, DC medical Center.

<p>Performance Work Statement</p>
<p>Background &amp; Need:<br />The workplace and the health of the workers within it are inextricably linked. Ideally, workplaces should not only protect the safety and wellbeing of employees but also provide them opportunities for better long-term health and enhanced quality of life. Effective workplace programs, policies, and environments which are health-focused and worker-centered have the potential to significantly benefit employers, employees, their families, and communities. As the nation's premier public health agency, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) helps protect the health and safety of all people in our schools, communities, homes and workplaces through prevention. The workplace can specifically protect and promote health through programs, policies, and practices that have the potential of reaching millions of workers, retirees, and their families.</p>
<p>The Affordable Care Act of 2010 elevates prevention as a priority providing unprecedented opportunities for health promotion and disease prevention. For example, it establishes the National Prevention, Health Promotion, and Public Health Council, involving more than a dozen federal agencies, will develop a prevention and health promotion strategy for the country.; creates the Prevention and Public Health Fund (PPHF) to support evidence and practice-based community and clinical prevention and wellness strategies; and requires new plans to cover recommended preventive services at no cost.</p>
<p><br />Increasing health care costs and health-related decreases in worker productivity are leading American businesses to examine strategies to improve employee health and contain health costs that are largely driven by chronic diseases and related lifestyle choices. Employers are recognizing the role they can play in creating a healthy work environment and providing their employees with opportunities to make healthy lifestyle choices. They increasingly look to CDC and other public health experts for guidance and solutions to combat the effects of chronic diseases on their employees and businesses. Workplace health programs not only benefit individual employees but also make good business sense.<br />A top concern for many employers is health care costs:<br />&bull; In 2007, private health insurance obtained through the workplace for individuals less than 65 years of age was the major source of insurance covering 157.9 million people or 61.6% of the population.<br />&bull; In 2007, private health insurance paid for 36% of personal health expenditures, which include services such as physician visits, hospital care, dental care, prescription drugs, and nursing home care. Together these personal health expenditures account for 84% of national health care expenditures in 2007.<br />&bull; Since 2000, average health insurance premiums for a family of four have increased by 114% proving costly for both employers and employees.<br />&bull; In 2010, average annual premiums for employer-sponsored coverage were $5,049 for single coverage and $13,770 for family coverage.<br />The costs of health insurance can be even more of a burden for small employers as can the cost of premiums for their employees.<br />&bull; Sixty-eight percent of companies with fewer than 200 employees offered health insurance to their workers in 2010.<br />&bull; Fifty-four percent of small companies (3-199 employees) that do not offer coverage reported the high cost of health insurance as the reason for not offering health benefits in 2010. <br />&bull; While workers' contributions for single coverage in small (3-199 employees) and large (200 or more employees) companies was fairly similar in 2010 ($865 annually vs. $917 annually), employees of smaller employers paid substantially more annually than those of larger employers for family coverage ($4,665 compared to $3,652).</p>
<p>The Impact of Chronic Disease on Health Costs.</p>
<p>Each year in the United States, chronic disease such as heart disease, stroke, cancer, and diabetes cause 7 in 10 deaths and account for about 75% of the $2 trillion spent on medical care.<br />&bull; In 2010, the economic costs of cardiovascular diseases and stroke were estimated at $444.2 billion, including $272.5 billion in direct medical expenses and $171.7 billion in indirect costs.<br />&bull; In 2007, medical costs attributed to diabetes included $27 billion for care to directly treat diabetes, $58 billion to treat diabetes-related chronic complications attributable to diabetes, and $31 billion in excess general medical costs <br />&bull; In 2008, the estimated health care costs related to obesity were $147 billion <br />Indirect costs for employers associated with poor employee health, including absenteeism, presenteeism, disability, or reduced work output, may be several times higher than direct medical costs. Productivity losses related to personal and family health problems cost US employers $1,685 per employee per year, or $225.8 billion annually.<br />Preventing health problems is one of the few known ways to stem rising health care costs. When employers pay more for insurance and employee health care, they have less money to invest in the company and may be forced to pay lower wages or shift health care costs to their employees. The ACA aims to control health care costs for individuals and employers through evidence and practice-based prevention and wellness strategies that will lead to specific, measureable health outcomes to reduce chronic disease rates. The promise of this strategy would keep workers healthier for longer periods of time, help protect their economic security, reduce health care related burdens and expenditures, and improve disability and productivity outcomes. For most employers, chronic diseases-such as heart disease, stroke, cancer, obesity, and diabetes-are among the most prevalent, costly, and preventable of all health problems. <br />Much of the illness, disability, and death associated with chronic diseases are avoidable through known prevention measures such as:<br />&bull; Practicing a healthy lifestyle (e.g., regular physical activity, healthy eating, and avoiding tobacco use); and<br />&bull; Timely and appropriate access to clinical preventive services that can prevent disease, detect risk factors for a disease, and/or diagnose a disease in its earliest stages when it is easier to treat (e.g., screening for breast, cervical, and colorectal cancers, diabetes and its complications, and depression). <br />Narrowing the tremendous gap between what we know is effective and what employers do to improve the health, well-being, and productivity of their employees represents an important opportunity for improving the health of working adults. Health-related programs, policies, and benefits proven to prevent disease and promote health are available to employers. The Guide to Community Preventive Services (www.thecommunityguide.org) summarizes many effective health interventions applicable to worksite settings. However, studies suggest that many employers are not purchasing or implementing these evidence-based interventions. Possible reasons include cost, lack of understanding of health issues and effective interventions, inadequate staffing or capacity to implement programs, and a lack of publicly available tools and resources. Many of these reasons are particularly relevant for small- to medium-sized companies. Furthermore, the strategies companies use to address employee health vary by available resources, management and employee needs and interests, and by which health issues are a priority for them.</p>
<p>CDC is committed to utilizing sound science to improve the health of working adults while addressing the major concerns of today's employers. Within CDC's National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, the Workplace Health Initiative serves as the focal point for worker health. It includes promoting the following public health goals:<br />&bull; Creating the standard for what employers should do; and how to measure progress.<br />&bull; Increasing the number of employers that provide workplace health promotion programs.<br />&bull; Improving the quality of employer's efforts.</p>
<p>The Workplace Health Initiative promotes the following comprehensive approach to health promotion and disease prevention for working adults.</p>
<p>Comprehensive Workplace Health Programs</p>
<p>Building a workplace health program should involve a coordinated, systematic and comprehensive approach. A coordinated approach to workplace health results in a planned, organized, and comprehensive set of programs, policies, benefits, and environmental supports designed to meet the health and safety needs of all employees. A comprehensive approach looks to put interventions in place that address multiple risk factors (e.g., overweight, poor nutrition, lack of physical activity) and health conditions (e.g., diabetes, musculoskeletal disorders, heart disease and stroke) concurrently and recognizes that the interventions and strategies chosen influence multiple levels of the organization including the individual employee and the organization as a whole. <br />An integrated approach to total worker health<br />Workplace health promotion programs are more likely to be successful if occupational safety and health is considered in their design and execution, In fact, a growing body of evidence indicates that workplace-based interventions that take coordinated, planned, or integrated approaches to reducing health threats to workers both in and out of work are more effective than traditional isolated programs. Integrating or coordinating occupational safety and health with health promotion may increase program participation and effectiveness and may also benefit the broader context of work organization and environment. <br />The systematic process of building a workplace health promotion program emphasizes four main steps:<br />1. an assessment to define employee health and safety risks and concerns and describe current health promotion activities, capacity and needs <br />2. A planning process to develop the components of a workplace health programs including goal determination; selecting priority interventions; and building an organizational infrastructure <br />3. Program implementation involving all the steps needed to put health promotion strategies and interventions into place and making them available to employees <br />4. An evaluation of efforts to systematically investigate the merit (e.g., quality), worth (e.g., effectiveness), and significance (e.g., importance) of an organized health promotion action/activity</p>
<p>Statutory Program Authority<br />This program is authorized by section 1703(a)(2) and 1703(a)(4) of the Public Health Service Act as amended (42 U.S.C.300u-2).</p>
<p><br />Program Overview and Strategy <br />CDC is aware of the limitations among individual employers particularly small to medium-sized employers for implementing effective workplace health programs such as resource constraints, lack of understanding of health issues and effective interventions, inadequate staffing or capacity to implement programs, and a lack of publicly available tools and resources. The funds released through this mechanism are intended to support the establishment of a core workplace health program in small and large worksites. The focus of the workplace health program will be to build worksite capacity for sustained program continuation that introduces interventions that target the workplace environment and policies as well as employee lifestyle behaviors including those related to physical inactivity, poor nutrition, and tobacco use that lead to increased risk for chronic disease.</p>
<p>Specifically, the Contractor shall recruit cohorts of either small or large employers to participate in the program. The Contractor will plan, develop, and administer a core workplace health program in each participating worksite within the cohort forming a national network of employer cohorts (herein referred to as the national network). The Contractor will participate in activities including technical assistance and training, communications, networking/mentoring, partnership/coalition development, and a national evaluation of the program to provide broad-based support to the national network.</p>
<p>This initiative will use evidence-based and best practice workplace programs, policies, practices, and environmental supports to maximize employee engagement and participation; raise employee awareness and education around health; and establish a work environment to change unhealthy behaviors and lifestyle choices to reduce employee risk for chronic disease while ensuring that employees are protected against potential discrimination. Possible execution strategies include conducting health risk assessments, lifestyle counseling and coaching, tobacco free campus policies, creating worksite access and opportunity for physical activity.</p>
<p>Performance Objectives:<br />The purpose of this request is to obtain the services of a firm with the expertise, capacity and reach into the employer community on a regional basis to engage and recruit 7 groups of 10-15 employers (herein referred to as cohorts) and lead the cohorts through the process of building a core workplace health program (WHP) in each worksite within the cohorts which includes the following components: assessment of employer and employee needs, interests and existing capacity; a planning process resulting in a workplace health improvement plan to guide the worksite through program development; implementation and evaluation of programs, policies and practices to address employee lifestyle risk factors related to physical activity, nutrition, and tobacco use; building a program infrastructure within each worksite for long-term sustainability including evaluation, wellness committees, and leadership (CEO/C-Suite) support; and participation in activities facilitated by CDC to lend broad-based support to the national network. The following performance objectives have been established for this request: <br />1) Recruit and secure the commitment of employers forming 7 cohorts of 10-15 employers each to participate in the program;<br />2) Demonstrate organizational commitment and support of worksite health promotion at all levels of management in each employer in the cohort;<br />3) Create a work environment in each worksite setting in the cohort that promotes and supports positive work organization and health opportunities for employees and their family members; <br />4) Establish baseline data for each worksite setting in the cohort to enhance the sustainability of the workplace health program over time;<br />5) Implement all elements of a core workplace health program that are evidence-based, sustainable and replicable in all worksites in the cohort, while ensuring compliance with all applicable federal and state laws, including, but not limited to, the nondiscrimination provisions included in the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) of 1996, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) of 1974, and the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) of 2008;<br />6) Promote peer to peer healthy business mentoring among participating employers in the cohort;<br />7) Participate in activities to bring broad-based support to the national network, facilitated by CDC, which includes technical assistance and training, communications, and a national evaluation of the program.</p>
<p>Desired Outcomes:<br />At the end of the project period, the Contractor will be considered successful if the following outcomes have been achieved:<br />&bull; Participating worksites have a functional core workplace health program in place <br />&bull; Participating employers have created a viable work environment that supports a culture of health. <br />&bull; The Contractor has captured and reported key success drivers involved in the establishment of a core workplace health program including elements from assessment through evaluation. <br />&bull; Participating employers and employees have raised their level of knowledge and awareness of healthy lifestyle behaviors targeting physical activity, nutrition, and tobacco use as well as workplace and community resources that support healthy lifestyles.<br />&bull; Participating employers and employees have increased their access and opportunity to engage in healthy lifestyle activities through the workplace and surrounding community. <br />&bull; The Contractor maintains and complies with defined requirements, is effective managed, and is fully functional.</p>
<p>Description of Work:<br />The Contractor shall develop and implement a comprehensive workplace health protection and promotion program plan to recruit employers into cohorts and establish and administer a comprehensive workplace health program at worksites within the cohort that addresses key employee lifestyle risks including physical inactivity, poor nutrition, and tobacco use. The plan shall reflect the appropriate use of evidence-based and promising workplace health programs, policies, and practices to reach all employees in a given worksite.</p>
<p>A detailed description of the tasks and deliverables to be accomplished during the project period is outlined below. General requirements include the following:</p>
<p>&bull; The Contractor will furnish all necessary labor, materials, supplies, equipment, and services to perform the work set forth below.<br />&bull; The Contractor will secure all necessary clearances such as the Institutional Review Board (IRB) and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approvals related to data collection. <br />&bull; The Contractor must possess the national capacity and reach as well as expertise that will allow it to effectively recruit employers of various sizes and industry sectors and work with them to develop, implement, and administer workplace health programs of similar complexity and scope across the national network.</p>
<p>Task 1: Program Kick-Off and Regular Communications<br />The Contractor will meet with CDC staff within two weeks of the Effective Date of the Contract in a kick-off meeting in order to gain a thorough understanding of the&nbsp;Comprehensive Health Programs to Address&nbsp;Physical Activity, Nutrition, and Tobacco Use in the Workplace&nbsp;; review procedures/guidelines for support of the national network; review the strategy, goals, objectives, and associated tasks related to this program; and form a cohesive group of program stakeholders that includes representatives from CDC, a national program evaluator, and other partners. <br />Following the kick-off, the Contractor will participate in regular biweekly teleconference meetings that will guide the development of the cohorts and national network. CDC will provide the names and contact information for the project team members. <br />The Contractor will work with CDC to establish a communication system for the program using, as appropriate, e-mail, conference calls, and face-to-face meetings to work with the CDC program team.<br />Task 2: Identify, Select, and Recruit Seven Employer Cohorts to Participate in the National Network<br />The Contractor shall produce an employer recruitment and marketing plan that includes the following components:</p>
<p>1. Determination of the 7 geographic region(s) - where the Contractor will establish employer cohorts. Each employer cohort will be confined to a localized geographic area such as a town, city, or county ensuring participating employers easy access to and hands on involvement with Contractor staff at the worksite and opportunities for networking and mentoring among employers in each cohort such as having regional offices and staff in or near localities where cohorts are established.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall ensure that the 7 employer cohorts are distributed across the country according to HHS Region Map (http://www.hhs.gov/about/regionmap.html). The Contractor shall establish 1 cohort representing HHS Regions 1-3; 1 cohort representing HHS Region 4; 1 cohort representing HHS Region 5; 1 cohort representing HHS Region 6; 1 cohort representing HHS Regions 7-8; 1 cohort representing HHS Region 9; and 1 cohort representing HHS Region 10. Given that all employers in the each cohort must reside in the same localized geographic area, the Contractor will need to select the specific locality within the multi-state HHS Regions where the workplace health programs will be established. For example, the Contractor could choose to establish a cohort in Travis County, TX home to Austin, TX and representing HHS Region 6.</p>
<p>2. Selection of the composition of the 7 employer cohorts. Each employer cohort will consist of 10-15 individual employers. Each cohort will either consist of small employers (100 or less full-time employees), mid-size employers (101-250 full-time employees) or large employers (more than 250 full-time employees). The Contractor must strive for diversity within the cohort with respect to the industry sector of the individual employers as well as localities with high population prevalence of obesity and/or tobacco use, or other known&nbsp;health disparities (identified through a population health database).</p>
<p>Eligible employers must have the following characteristics:<br />&bull; Demonstrated leadership commitment and support from the CEO/C-Suite including a commitment to allow employees to fully participate in voluntary workplace health protection and promotion program activities such as by allowing flexible scheduling of program activities <br />&bull; Cannot currently have in place a workplace health program that consists of a majority of the interventions described in Task #5and will expand existing efforts by implementing interventions, as described in task #5, not currently in place as part of their worksite health promotion. <br />&bull; Only Domestic employees and worksites will participate<br />&bull; For the largest employers (those with 500 or more full-time employee), the ability of the employer to invest a matching amount of funds, equal to those provided by the Contractor $50,000, into the company's workplace health program. This can include staff time related to the workplace health council or committee or support for additional interventions implemented during the project period.</p>
<p>CDC desires to work with approximately equal numbers of small, medium-sized, and large employers across the 7 cohorts representing multiple industry sectors. For example the Contractor may propose to establish three cohorts of small employers each consisting of 10 companies (30 total); 2 cohort of 15 mid-size employers (30 total); and 2 cohorts of large employers each consisting of 12 companies (24 total).</p>
<p>3. A recruitment protocol including the employer identification and engagement strategy including prioritization selection strategies for high levels of employer demand, and marketing and advertising materials including actual copies of all advertisement materials that will be used to recruit employers. Such materials include but are not limited to, flyers, videos or audio presentations regarding the comprehensive workplace health programs and national network and the final copy of printed advertisements. CDC will review recruitment methods and materials in order to ensure that such materials/methods are non-coercive and do not unduly influence employers to participate or the Contractor to recruit ineligible prospective employers. COTR will review for compliance and respond to the Contractor within 5 business days.</p>
<p>a. The recruitment protocol must include information that the Contractor will use to explain to prospective employers the elements of the core workplace health program; the expectations of the participating employer and the benefits of participation, as well as a letter of support for the employer CEO/C-Suite to sign indicating commitment to the program and working with the Contractor over a 24 month project period.</p>
<p>4. The Contractor shall document the all steps involved recruiting employers to participate including any challenges or key success drivers of interest to the national evaluation and include these in their monthly, year-end, and project-end progress reports.</p>
<p>Task 3: Engage CEO/C-Suite Leadership in Participating Worksites and Conduct Baseline Worksite Assessment through Worksite Site Visits<br />The Contractor shall develop and execute a site visit and assessment plan that includes the following components:</p>
<p>1. The Contractor will ensure that the data collection tools and methods used during the assessment phase are coordinated with the national evaluation of the program such as consistent use of instruments allowing for comparison among and between employer cohorts.</p>
<p>2. Conduct a site visit and kick-off meeting for participating employers. The purpose of the site visit would be to engage employers and employees through structured meetings with the organization's leadership (CEO/C-Suite) to outline goals and expectations for the workplace health program; gaining input and feedback from employees, managers, and senior executive leaders on their health and safety needs, concerns or interests; begin to understand what health and safety risks are present, how are they monitored?, and what is currently being done to address them?; and begin to develop a trusting relationship with the employer and employees in order to garner high voluntary participation rates.</p>
<p>3. Conduct assessment activities to gather baseline data on employees and the organization. The Contractor shall collect appropriate worksite assessment information necessary for the successful planning , implementation, and evaluation of the core workplace health interventions. Worksite assessment will involve data collection at both the individual (3a below) and organizational level (3b below).<br />a. At the individual level, the Contractor will assess elements of an employee's health, such as their health behaviors related to physical activity, nutrition, and tobacco; health risk factors such as high blood pressure and overweight/obesity; and current health status. The Contractor will be required to conduct a health risk assessment with demographic questions to accomplish the employee assessment.<br />b. At the organizational level, the Contractor will assess elements of the workplace structure, culture, practices and policies related to health and safety such as health benefits, health promotion programs, occupational health programs, work organization, and leadership and management support (CEO/C-Suite) for workplace health and safety initiatives. Additionally, environmental elements of the physical workplace such as facilities and settings where employees work as well as access and opportunities for health promotion provided by the surrounding community where employees live will be explored. The Contractor will be required to conduct organizational readiness assessment, environmental audit, culture survey, and/or hold meetings with leadership, employee, and their representatives (e.g., unions if applicable) to accomplish the organizational assessment.</p>
<p>4. In order to get an accurate sense of the dynamics of the workplace and the key health issues of concern to employees and the employer, the Contractor will obtain a variety of viewpoints within each participating worksite and corroborate findings from several sources of information such as management interviews, employee focus groups, labor representatives, records and documents, or surveys.</p>
<p>5. Document the processes involved in collecting, maintaining, protecting the confidentiality, and reporting of individual employee and organizational health data in accordance with applicable laws and regulations, including, but not limited to, GINA, HIPAA, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) and the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH Act). The contractor will take steps to ensure that data collected on individual employees is only provided to the employer in an aggregate form so as not to identify individual employers as well as discriminate against any employee.</p>
<p>6. The Contractor shall document all steps taken in engaging company leadership (CEO/C-Suite) and conducting baselines assessment including any challenges or key success drivers of interest to the national evaluation and include these in their monthly, year-end, and project-end progress reports.</p>
<p>NOTE: As applicable, the Contractor shall prepare the Institutional Review Board (IRB) and/or Office of Management and Budget (OMB) clearance packages for data collection activities. The timeline for securing these packages can take months and need to be started as soon as the data collection instruments have been identified within the first 4-6 weeks of the award.</p>
<p>Task 4: Establish a Site-level Organizational Structure<br />The Contractor shall develop and execute a workplace governance and infrastructure plan that includes the following components:<br />1. Introduce the contract staff member who will serve as the workplace health coordinator for the employers within a cohort as well as any additional contractors who will support the coordinator. The coordinator will oversee the workplace health program, chairs and regularly convenes the workplace health committee, and oversees the program budget. The coordinator will be the primary liaison between the employer and Contractor.</p>
<p>2. Establish a workplace health council or committee. The committee should have representation from a broad range of organizational units, human resources and occupational health and safety personnel, workers and their representatives (e.g., unions), and supervisors (including managers from multiple shifts if appropriate). The level of influence by employees should reflect the level of authority and expertise they have in other business functions. The council or committee will assist the workplace health coordinator in developing a plan and design to guide actions to improve health and promote the program throughout the worksite.</p>
<p>3. Establish site-level champions. At least one champion will be a senior executive who can demonstrate organizational commitment to the workplace health program by consistently communicating to all levels of the organization the workplace health program's goals, objectives, and activities; serve as a role model to employees; dedicate additional resources or matching funds to the workplace health program.</p>
<p>4. Establish community linkages/leverage community resources and ongoing programs such as Communities Putting Prevention to Work (http://www.cdc.gov/CommunitiesPuttingPreventiontoWork/index.htmI), non-profits such as the American Cancer Society or Y-USA to help facilitate and enhance employee education and awareness; access and opportunity to participation in the workplace health program; and reinforce health messages and lifestyles skills outside of work. Additionally, each cohort of employers can drawn upon each other's experience and knowledge through networking and mentoring to advance the workplace health program at each site.</p>
<p>5. The Contractor shall document all steps taken in establishing the site-level organizational structure including any challenges or key success drivers of interest to the national evaluation and include these in their monthly, year-end, and project-end progress reports. <br />Task 5: Establish a Site-level Workplace Health Improvement Plan<br />The Contractor shall develop and execute a workplace health improvement plan for each participating worksite that includes the following components:</p>
<p>1. Specific, measurable goals and objectives for the workplace health program that are aligned with overall business objectives <br />2. Determination of the core set of interventions to be implemented. Each employer worksite within the cohort will implement a core set of 3-5 evidence-based interventions that include a mix of interventions such as health-related programs (e.g., education, seminar, and coaching), health-related policy, and environmental supports and are targeting physical activity, nutrition, and/or tobacco use in the employee population. The interventions selected are designed to change individual behavior and the work environment. <br />Examples of workplace health program components and strategies include:<br />a. Program - opportunities available to employees at the workplace or through outside organizations to begin, change or maintain health behaviors. <br />i. Classes or seminars on fitness, nutrition, tobacco cessation or stress management<br />ii. Weight management programs that offer counseling, coaching, and education<br />iii. Physical activity classes or walking clubs<br />iv. Tobacco cessation counseling through a quitline, or health plan<br />v. Lifestyle coaching or counseling<br />vi. Signage related to program components<br />vii. Information resources such as brochures, videos, posters, pamphlets, newsletters, or other information that addresses the risks of physical inactivity, poor nutrition, and tobacco use <br />b. Policy - formal or informal written statements that are designed to protect or promote employee health.<br />i. Company policies that promote healthy behaviors such as a tobacco-free campus policy<br />ii. A policy that healthy foods will always or exclusively be made available at all company meetings or functions where food is served. <br />iii. A food procurement policy that limits the sale of food and beverages high in sodium, calories, transfats, or saturated fats<br />iv. A policy allowing employees paid work time or flextime (i.e., flexible scheduling) to engage in workplace health program activities such as physical activity programs. <br />c. Environmental Support - refers to the physical factors at and nearby the workplace that help protect and enhance employee health. <br />i. Access to onsite or near-by fitness facilities<br />ii. Worksite stairwell enhancement and promotion<br />iii. Making healthy foods available and accessible through vending machines or cafeterias <br />iv. Menu labeling/signage including nutritional information on calories, sodium, transfats, and saturated fats.<br />v. Providing employees with food preparation and storage facilities such as a microwave ovens, sinks, refrigerators, and/or kitchens<br />vi. Establishing an onsite Farmer's Market<br />vii. Establishing environmental supports for recreation and exercise such as establishing walking/running trails; utilize multi-purpose space for physical activity classes, maps of suitable walking routes, bicycle racks, a basketball court, open space designated for recreation or exercise, a shower and changing facility <br />viii. Create a work environment free of recognized health and safety threats with a means to identify and address new problems as they arise</p>
<p>The interventions selected must be consistent across the employers in each cohort ensuring some uniformity and shared learning across the cohort to the extent possible taking into consideration unique contextual factors present at the worksite such as employee interests, industry sector, and specific workplace barriers and constraints. Additionally, interventions selected as the core set of interventions should include multiple strategies to address a common risk such as using a program element, policy element, and environmental support to address nutrition. For example, a cohort of small employers in Travis County, TX are all working with the Contractor on implementing interventions to improve the food environment in their worksites including establishing onsite Farmer's Markets (policy/environmental), nutrition education and weight management classes (program), and labeling on foods served in cafeterias and vending machines (environmental). The employers in a second cohort in Seattle, WA are all working with the Contractor on implementing interventions to improve physical activity access and opportunity including establishing a walking club (program), marking an outdoor walking trail around the worksite (environmental), and allowing employees flextime during the day to participate (policy).</p>
<p>All programs must be made available to all employees at no cost to them.</p>
<p>The contractor will use ready-made interventions and not use resources available through this task order to develop interventions (e.g., health education curricula, health coaching models, policy templates, methods for enacting environmental supports). Tailoring existing interventions and protocols to meet the unique needs of individual employers participating in the program is appropriate. The Contractor will need to be aware of the individual worksite employee population needs related to age, health literacy, or disability status and interests and identify appropriate interventions for the employee population. For example, a web-based education program would not be appropriate in certain construction firm work environments where the majority of employees do not have access to computers at work.</p>
<p>The Contractor should also be aware, especially during the selection of interventions and the designing of policies to protect, promote or implement such interventions, of any federal and/or state laws that may apply to worksite wellness programs, generally. Such laws include, but are not limited to, the nondiscrimination provisions included in the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), and the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA). All program elements must be consistent and comply with relevant workplace health laws and regulations. The contractor should document the steps taken to adhere to and comply with these relevant workplace health laws and regulations.</p>
<p><br />3. Timelines for action showing specific action steps and dates by which they will be completed and staff responsible. <br />4. A communications plan that includes:<br />a. Creating a brand identity for the program;<br />b. Creating materials and messages to reach all employees in support of the program goals <br />c. Leveraging multiple communications channels (e.g., email, print, kiosk, bulletin board, web, in person) to reach and engage all employees in support of program goals including newer technologies such as social media<br />d. Marketing the program to all employees <br />e. Processes to share the results and progress of the programs with leadership (CEO/C-Suite) and employees to build engagement and trust;<br />f. Raising employee awareness of workplace health and safety risks and opportunities for health protection and promotion. <br />5. An evaluation plan including process and outcomes measures<br />a. Measures related to the process of establishing and delivering the interventions and building the infrastructure as well as quality assurance of all program elements; <br />b. Methods to report on employee engagement through program participation and satisfaction with program delivery and services;<br />c. Pre/post assessment in aggregate employee health behaviors and risk factors; employee intention to make lifestyle changes;<br />d. Methods to capture lessons learned; success stories at individual worksites and across the cohort; and culture changes within the worksite;<br />e. Absenteeism Indicators and metrics pertaining to health-related productivity. <br />6. An itemized budget with key resources such as staffing, equipment, space, materials and programming to support the workplace health program beginning with assessment through program evaluation. The Contractor will budget approximately $50,000-100,000 per small and medium-sized employer worksite and approximately $50,000 for a large employer worksite with 500 or more full-time employees.<br />7. The Contractor shall document all steps taken in Establishing the Site-level Workplace Health Improvement Plans including any challenges or key success drivers of interest to the national evaluation and include these in their monthly, year-end, and project-end progress reports.</p>
<p>Task 6: Implement and Manage Each Site Level Workplace Health program <br />The Contractor shall ensure all elements of the workplace health improvement plan are implemented at each worksite within each cohort within 12 months of the contract award allow for employee participation during the second 12 months of the project period.</p>
<p>This includes:<br />1. The Contractor shall implement processes to maximize leadership (CEO/C-Suite) and employee engagement that consist of timelines with specific milestones that address the following:</p>
<p>a. The program's development and progress is regularly reported to the company's leadership (CEO/C-Suite) and employees to develop organizational support.<br />b. Within the parameters of applicable federal and/or state laws, efforts are made to maximize employee participation. (The use of financial incentives for participating employees within the cohorts is not authorized, however, the Contractor may propose the use of other non financial incentives or work with existing incentive structures already present as allowed by applicable federal and/or state laws). The Contractor will need to be aware of the individual worksite employee population needs related to age, health literacy, or disability status and interests and identify appropriate interventions for the employee population. For example, a web-based education program would not be appropriate in certain construction firm work environments where the majority of employees do not have access to computers at work. <br />c. The Contractor has regular interaction and an onsite presence with company leadership (CEO/C-Suite), the workplace wellness committee, and participating employees.<br />d. Ensuring the program interventions are effectively communicated and marketed no less than on a weekly basis throughout the company. <br />e. Monitors employee satisfaction with program offerings.</p>
<p>2. The Contractor ensures program delivery of all the workplace health program initiatives and interventions with support of company leadership (CEO/C-Suite) and the workplace health committee.<br />a. Activities occurring during the program implementation stage include participant registration, program orientation for employees, strategies to maintain employee motivation such as individual goal setting, development of social support systems, program tracking of goals and objectives</p>
<p>3. The Contractor shall document all steps taken in Implementing and Managing Each Site Level Workplace Health Program including any challenges or key success drivers of interest to the national evaluation and include these in their monthly, year-end, and project-end progress reports.</p>
<p>Task 7: Process and Outcome Evaluation<br />The Contractor shall be required to conduct process evaluations as part of the workplace health improvement plan to examine all the steps and activities taken in implementing the workplace health program and the outputs they generate, such as the number and type of educational materials for a nutrition education class that are developed and given to participating employees. Process measures will also determine employee exposure (reach and frequency) to the workplace health program. The Contractor shall also be required to conduct outcome evaluations to measure changes in organizational policy or practice; employee participation and engagement; pre/post assessment of employee health behaviors and risks, and behavioral intentions to make lifestyle changes, and absenteeism pertaining to health-related productivity. The Contractor shall work with the CDC program team to determine the most appropriate data collection methods (e.g., a customized survey, interview guide, environmental audit, etc.). Additionally, the Contractor shall work with CDC on the national evaluation of the program including all 7 employer cohorts in identified states and communities to gain an understanding of the impact of the program.</p>
<p>&bull; The Contractor shall create a workplace health program evaluation plan with objectives that are feasible and measurable. <br />&bull; In addition, outcome evaluation of workplace health program activities within the participating employer cohorts will be incorporated in the evaluation activities of the overall national network such as the development of employer case studies. The Contractor shall work with the national evaluator to nominate employers within the cohort to be the subject of the case studies. The Contractor shall ensure that any employer-based evaluation activities complement, and are not redundant with, national project evaluation efforts. <br />&bull; In particular, the Contractor shall be responsible for compiling and reporting to CDC data on the outcome measures identified in the following table. Frequency of reporting is also indicated.<br />&bull; The Contractor shall document all steps taken in establishing the process and outcome evaluations including any challenges or key success drivers of interest to the national evaluation and include these in their monthly, year-end, and project-end progress reports.</p>

<p>Deliverables:</p>
<p>The attached table summarizes the deliverables required for this project based on the tasks therein. The focus of the tasks will be primarily on establishing the workplace health program within the Contractor's employer cohorts (recruitment, assessment, infrastructure building, planning, implementation and evaluation). Additional tasks focus on activities to support the national network (training, technical assistance, networking/mentoring, partnership development, national evaluation).</p>
<p>Criteria for Acceptance: <br />The contractor, as an independent party and not as an agent of the government, shall provide to the COTR the following when completing deliverables: timeliness; accuracy of data; and crosscheck to monthly/quarterly reports, narratives, and invoices.</p>
<p><br />Special Clearances:</p>
<p>Design of any data collection or evaluation measurement tools or activities must take into account the requirements for exemptions to OMB public survey clearance procedures. For any methods requiring OMB or IRB clearance, the Contractor shall prepare the appropriate packages for clearance.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall obtain Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval under the Paperwork Reduction Act for all information collection activities. It may be appropriate for the contractor to develop a generic clearance mechanism under which specific activities can be submitted to OMB; the Contractor is responsible for consulting with CDC and OMB to determine if and how a generic mechanism might facilitate the work in this SOW. The Contractor is responsible preparing the supporting statements and information collection instruments needed to obtain OMB approval under the PRA. The Contractor is responsible for consulting with CDC in the development of the instruments. Although the Contractor may wish to draw on questions that have been used in prior CDC studies, the Contractor should not limit their assessments only to survey items or questions that have been used previously. Even though questions/instruments may have been cleared by OMB for use in other studies, they must be submitted to OMB for clearance in the context of the study design and population specific to this project.</p>
<p>This is not intended to be a research contract. The Contractor shall not use these funds to engage in any form of research involving human subjects without express authorization from the CDC Project Officer and all necessary Institutional Review Boards, exemption-granting entities and/or other organizations whose approval may be required by the Code of Federal Regulations and other applicable state and federal regulations that may be in effect at the time of such proposed research.</p>
<p>IT Security <br />During any application development or enhancement, the contractor shall work closely with the NCCDPHP Office of Informatics and Information Resources (OIIRM) to ensure all CDC-related technical and security standards, processes and procedures are followed. This working relationship shall continue through full production.</p>
<p>Contractor's performance and resulting deliverables must adhere to all federal, HHS, and/or CDC IT security, privacy and Section 508 policies and procedures. Development or implementation of an electronic information system or any electronic data collection effort conducted in the performance of this contract will be required to complete Certification and Accreditation (C&amp;A) prior to operation resulting in an Authority of Operate (ATO) from CDC. The contractor shall be required to complete all security documentation and materials required to obtain an ATO. The contractor shall comply with all applicable HHS, CDC, FISMA, HIPPA, NIST, and other federal policies and regulations in the performance of the security requirements.</p>
<p>Web Application development projects should follow the CDC Secure Web Application Coding Guidelines which can be provided by the Project Officer or ISSO. All information systems development or implemented in support of this contract must adhere to the security controls outlined in the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication 800-53, Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems and Organizations (http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-53-Rev3/sp800-53-rev3-final-errata.pdf).</p>
<p>The Contractor must follow the guidance in NIST Special Publications, Guidelines on Securing Public Web Servers, NIST publication SP 800-44 (http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-44-ver2/SP800-44v2.pdf) and Guide to Secure Web Services, NIST publication SP 800-95 (http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-95/SP800-95.pdf). See the Web Application Security Consortium (http://www.webappsec.org) and the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP - http://www.owasp.org) for tips on how to avoid security problems in Web applications.</p>
<p>508 Compliance <br />All IT development must adhere to Section 508 of the 1986 addition to the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. <br />There are three regulations addressing the requirements detailed in Section 508: <br />&bull; The Section 508 technical and functional standards are codified at 36 CFR Part 1194 and may be accessed through the Access Board's Web site at http://www.access-board.gov<br />&bull; The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 39.2 requires that agency acquisitions of Electronic and Information Technology (EIT) comply with the Access Board's standards. The entire FAR is found at Chapter 1 of the Code of Federal Register (CFR) Title 48, located at http://www.acquisition.gov. The FAR rule implementing Section 508 can be found at http://www.section508.gov. <br />&bull; The HHS Acquisition Regulation (HHSAR) which can be found at http://www.hhs.gov/policies/hhsar/</p>
<p>Project Management<br />The contractor will follow the DHHS Enterprise Performance Life Cycle (EPLC) framework which will provide a standard structure for planning, managing, and overseeing IT projects over their entire life cycle. The framework consists of ten life cycle phases. Within each phase, activities, responsibilities, reviews and deliverables are defined. Exit criteria are established for each phase and Stage Gate reviews are conducted through the IT Governance process to ensure that the project's management quality, soundness, and technical feasibility remain adequate and the project is ready to move forward to the next phase. All IT projects in support of this task must adhere to the EPLC requirements and pass each State Gate as appropriate. More information about EPLC can be found at http://www.hhs.gov/ocio/eplc/.</p>

<DESC>The MRC is the monthly recurring cost (lease) for the fiber optic connection.
<p><br />Q) This seems to be more in line with a Lit Fiber solution but in the solicitation it references Dark Fiber. Can you clarify whether only Dark Fiber solutions will be accepted or can vendors submit a Lit Fiber solution?</p>
<p>A) The fiber request is for one pair of dark fiber. If they (a vendor) have a better cost and solution the real requirement is one gig connections for mil and edu networks</p>

<p>(End Addendum)</p>
<p><br />FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation - Commercial Items (Jan 1999)</p>
<p>(a) Award Basis: The Government's evaluation of quotation will fully account for the evaluation factors identified and required under the Addenda to FAR 52.212-1 of 1.) Price and 2.) Technical Qualification 3) Past Performance. The evaluation of these factors will utilize the lowest price technically acceptable (LPTA) award basis. Quotes that do not meet the quote specifics, will be deemed technically unacceptable, and therefore not considered for award.</p>
<p>The Government intends to evaluate quotations and award a contract without exchanges or communications and therefore, quotations should contain the vendor's best terms.</p>
<p>(b) Evaluation: Evaluation factors for price and technical qualification as required under the addendum to 52.212-1 will be evaluated by the Government as follows;</p>
<p>i. Price: To evaluate price reasonableness, a comparison will be made amongst all received quotations and the Government's estimate.</p>
<p>ii. Technical Qualification: A vendor's quotation will be considered technically acceptable if it meets the requirements detailed in paragraph C5 above. Quotations that do not meet these requirements will be considered unacceptable and therefore, under the LPTA evaluation process, will not be considered for award.</p>
<p>iii. Past Performance : Past performance ratings will be evaluated using the list of current/recent and relevant contracts provided by vendors. The result of the assessment will determine if a vendor's past performance on recent and relevant contracts was favorable, or unfavorable. Failure by vendors to submit past performance information, or the inability to accurately reference points of contacts and respective contact numbers, may result not being selected for award.</p>
<p>The evaluation of past performance information will result in an overall assessment of satisfactory or unsatisfactory as follows:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Past Performance Evaluation Ratings<br />Rating Description<br />Satisfactory Based on the vendor's performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort<br />Unsatisfactory Based on the vendor's performance record, the Government has no reasonable expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p><br />(a) Award Determination: As a result of the Government's aforementioned evaluation, only those vendors whose proposals are determined to be technically acceptable and that have been assigned a satisfactory past performance rating, will be considered for award. Of those vendors found technically acceptable, and assigned satisfactory past performance ratings, award will be made to the lowest priced offeror whose price is determined reasonable and affordable.</p>
<p>(b) Options: The government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offerer within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not theere are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>
<p>(End Provision)</p>
<p><br />In accordance with FAR 13.004 -- Legal Effect of Quotations the following information is provided in regards to quotations.<br />A quotation is not an offer and, consequently, cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Therefore, issuance by the Government of an order in response to a supplier's quotation does not establish a contract. The order is an offer by the Government to the supplier to buy certain supplies or services upon specified terms and conditions. A contract is established when the supplier accepts the offer.<br />When appropriate, the contracting officer may ask the supplier to indicate acceptance of an order by notification to the Government, preferably in writing. In other circumstances, the supplier may indicate acceptance by furnishing the supplies or services ordered or by proceeding with the work to the point where substantial performance has occurred.<br />If the Government issues an order resulting from a quotation, the Government may (by written notice to the supplier, at any time before acceptance occurs) withdraw, amend, or cancel its offer. <br />If you have any questions or concerns, please contact one of the following:<br />Primary point of contact:<br />Contract Specialist: Wendell D.

<p>TITLE: Information Fusion Test-bed Technologies and Applications</p>
<p>ANNOUNCEMENT TYPE: Initial announcement</p>
<p>FUNDING OPPORTUNITY NUMBER: BAA #09-05-RIKA</p>
<p>CFDA Number: 12.800</p>
<p><br />I. FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:</p>
<p>The Air Force Research Laboratory is soliciting white papers for various scientific studies, analytical tools, algorithm developments, projects, and experiments focused on developing enhanced information fusion technology capabilities to provide the Air Force the means to better conduct Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR).</p>
<p>BACKGROUND:</p>
<p>One of the Air Force's key mission is to provide exacting Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) in Ground, Air, Space and Cyberspace. The significance of ISR is growing as our adversaries become more difficult to locate and identify and their intentions more difficult to analyze and predict. The transition from force-on-force confrontation of the past to today's asymmetrical warfare is challenging ISR force to anticipate, find, fix, track, and identify potential targets over broader areas, in less time and with more accuracy than at any other time in history. The goal of ISR operations is to provide accurate, relevant, and timely intelligence information to decision-makers at all levels.</p>
<p>ISR systems and methods must be flexible enough to accommodate diversity in the way we fight, who we fight, and the technology we employ. Specifically, Air Force ISR systems must be able to provide national and military decision-makers intelligence and information of higher fidelity, over a broader scope of operations, meeting a faster operations cycle and in an environment less tolerant of errors than in the past.</p>
<p>One of the desired effects of ISR is dominant Situational Awareness (SA) that allows commanders and their forces to make better-informed decisions and implement them faster than their adversaries can react. Dominant SA is the result of rapid, expert analysis and fusing of multiple sources of information gathered through surveillance and reconnaissance and its synthesis with existing contextual knowledge to produce assessments and predictions needed for superior planning, execution and evaluation of national security actions and joint force operations.</p>
<p>Significant increases in multi-sensor capabilities such as layered sensing will demand much more robust processing capabilities to refine and convert collected data into information products. Sophisticated analytical tools will be required to aid the analyst in fusing and integrating the vast amounts of data from these more capable and numerous ISR sources. Semi-automated and automated tools will be required to assist the analyst in finding the "golden nugget" in the vast array of information. <br /><br />The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate (AFRL/RI) has an established test-bed facility to develop, integrate, test, evaluate, and demonstrate fusion and information technologies to support Command and Control. The Information Fusion (IF) Test-bed facility is used to support algorithm development and evaluation, analytical studies, on-site and network distributed simulation exercises and demonstration of fusion technologies with real and simulated multiple source INTelligence (multi-INT) data. Capabilities include scenario generation, platform and sensor modeling (including JSTARS, LSRS, U2, and Global Hawk). Simulators have been developed for various intelligence data types such as Ground Moving Target Indicator (GMTI) information, ELectronic Signals INTelligence (ELINT) and Measurement and Signature Intelligence (MASINT). Highly developed multi-INT data fusion systems are available for application to the problem of ground target tracking and identification against a variety of operational scenarios. Analytical tools that quantify established Measures of Performance (MOPs) are available for target tracking and other applications. In total the Information Fusion test-bed helps to facilitate a broad range of Command, Control, Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance (C2ISR), and fusion technology developments.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE:</p>
<p>The overall objective of this BAA is to develop and demonstrate innovative and advanced information fusion technologies for dominant situational awareness and assessment. This effort will investigate the research and development, evaluation, and demonstration/application of emerging information fusion technologies, products or standards to; (1) automate the fusion of collected, or stored information in support of ISR applicable to the ground, air, space and cyberspace domains; (2) enhance the ability to fuse or correlate data from multi-platform, multi-intelligence sources; and (3) provide for situational awareness, threat assessment, and resource management derived from multiple intelligence sources and within a common operational picture.</p>
<p><br />For the purpose of the BAA, AFRL will focus on technologies to extend and enhance the capabilities of Information Directorate's Information Fusion Test-bed facility. Specific technologies should deliver advanced capabilities that include, but are not limited to advanced data fusion technologies, fusion analytical tools, fusion algorithm developments, fusion metrics and evaluation standards, fusion performance modeling, scenarios for fusion technology testing and the integration of fusion evaluation techniques into an information fusion design for legacy and future ISR systems.</p>

<p>1. CRITERIA: The following criteria, in which Criteria (1) through (3) are of equal importance and criteria (4) is of lesser importance than criteria (1) through (3), will be used to determine whether white papers and proposals submitted are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government: (1) Overall Scientific and Technical Merit -- Including the innovative approaches for the development, and/or enhancement of the proposed technology, processes for performing testing, evaluations, and demonstrations, (2) Related Experience - The extent to which the offeror demonstrates relevant technology and domain knowledge, (3) Openness/Maturity of Solution - The extent to which existing capabilities and standards are leveraged and the relative maturity of the proposed technology in terms of reliability and robustness, and (4) Reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees (if any). No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting white papers/proposals. Individual white paper/proposal evaluations will be evaluated against the evaluation criteria without regard to other white papers and proposals submitted under this BAA. White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.</p>
<p>2. REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS: Only Government employees will evaluate the white papers/proposals for selection. The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in the administrative support contract, which do not require the review, reading, or comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks." These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements. The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&amp;D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries. Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.</p>
<p>VI. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION:</p>
<p>1. AWARD NOTICES: Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email or letter will be sent by the technical POC. Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract. Those white papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner. Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.</p>
<p>All offerors submitting white papers will be contacted by the technical POC, referenced in Section VII of this announcement. Offerors can email the technical POC for status of their white paper/proposal no earlier than 45 days after white paper/proposal submission.</p>
<p>2. ADMINISTRATIVE AND NATIONAL POLICY REQUIREMENTS:</p>
<p>Depending on the work to be performed, the offeror may require a Top Secret facility clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to Top Secret information at the time of award. In addition, the offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility such as the AFRL Rome Research Site's Fusion Testbed located in the Corporate Collateral Facility to support work under this BAA. Data subject to export control constraints may be involved and only firms holding certification under the US/Canada Joint Certification Program (JCP) (www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp) are allowed access to such data.</p>
<p>3. REPORTING: Once a proposal has been selected for award, offerors will be required to submit their reporting requirement through one of our web-based, reporting systems known as JIFFY or TFIMS. Prior to award, the offeror will be notified which reporting system they are to use, and will be given complete instructions regarding its use. Please note that use of the JIFFY or TFIMS application requires customers outside of the .mil domain to purchase an approved External Certificate Authority certificate to facilitate a secured log on process. It is necessary to obtain an ECA certificate BEFORE obtaining a JIFFY or TFIMS user account. Additional information on obtaining an ECA is available at: http://iase.disa.mil/pki/eca/index.html .</p>

The closing date for this BAA will be 28 Sep 2012. FORMAL PROPOSALS ARE NOT BEING REQUESTED AT THIS TIME. See Section IV of this announcement for further details.</p>
<p><br />I. FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:</p>
<p>The Air Force Research Laboratory, in partnership with the Global Cyber Integration Center (GCIC) is soliciting white papers for various scientific studies, projects, and experiments focused on developing capabilities to provide the Air Force the means to conduct Global C2, including C2 of cyber assets. GCIC is a Field Operating Agency (FOA) reporting to the Secretary of the Air Force, Chief of Warfighting Integration and Chief Information Officer SAF/XC. GCIC is chartered to conduct innovation, integration, and standardization of current and future command and control systems and sub-systems across air, space AND cyberspace to enable decision superiority. For the purpose of this BAA, AFRL and GCIC will partner to address emerging cyber concepts, technologies, and experimentation to further enhance global and cyber C2 for the warfighter.</p>
<p>Cyber operations can be conducted at any level of war and across the entire spectrum of conflict in support of global and theater objectives. Global C2 provides a persistent, 24/7, collaborative environment comprised of people, systems, and tools to enable timely response to today's asymmetric challenges. Global C2 ties real-time intelligence, collaborative planning, and decision making to support a broad mix of military options - offensive, defensive, kinetic and non-kinetic. Global C2 and cyber C2 capabilities need to be designed, developed, and implemented that provide for the ability to monitor, assess, plan, and execute cyber operations. This BAA focuses on developing cyber concepts, technologies, and an experimentation framework to improve Air Force cyber C2 capabilities and integration of these capabilities with other Air Force and Joint systems.</p>
<p>To frame the intent of this BAA, we need to briefly discuss cyberspace. The National Military Strategy for Cyberspace Operations says, "Cyberspace is a domain characterized by the use of electronics and the electromagnetic spectrum to store, modify, and exchange data via networked systems and associated physical infrastructures."</p>
<p>For the purpose of this BAA, AFRL will focus on technologies to enable C2 of global and cyberspace assets and integrating their effects with kinetic operations. Specific technologies should deliver capabilities that include, but are not limited to Cyber C2 collaboration, interoperability, cross/multi domain, visualization and integration of friendly orders of battle, course of action development, experimentation, Integrated Task Order production, effects deconfliction, hybrid/joint effects, and assessment.</p>
<p>We assert that simply porting technologies developed for C2 in the air and space domain may or may not be directly applicable or useful in the cyber domain. Furthermore, we acknowledge that C2 of non-kinetic assets and the effects they produce and integrating them with kinetic assets/effects across the global spectrum is at a formative stage. With these two concepts in mind, we seek novel and unique approaches to enable Global C2 in an environment that is not confined by time or distance and an area of responsibility that is not constrained by geographical boundaries.</p>
<p><br />FY09 Focus Area - Integrated Tasking Order research</p>
<p>This FY09 focus area seeks novel research and development efforts that advance the state of the art in integrated battle planning to radically improve our ability to coordinate and synchronize air, cyber and space forces to achieve desired effects. Future decision-makers must ensure unity of effort across physical and virtual domains, as current static and deliberate planning struggles to keep up with fluid, highly volatile world states. Plans need to be built quickly, continuously assessed for validity, viability and feasibility, and dynamically updated according to the evolving world state. Plans also need to scale at the strategic level for kinetic and non-kinetic assets; provide enough structure to adequately synchronize, coordinate and deconflict assets at the operational level; and capture adequate fine-grained detail to conduct operations at the tactical level across multiple levels of security.</p>
<p>The Government is looking for technical solutions that provide the ability to represent plans that fully capture and describe air, cyber, and space activities (e.g., one plan representation for all or a collection of highly related representations); the ability to dynamically model and relate air, cyber, and space activities and the ability to automatically manage both plans and models at the pace of modern combat, within a Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) (e.g., a plan management service). Being able to plan among distributed enclaves is a desired attribute (e.g., a possible design constraint), but demonstration of such capability is left to other efforts. Submissions may propose tackling just one, several, or all of these abilities.</p>
<p>Resulting capabilities must fit within the evolving net-centric, service oriented USAF C2 enterprise. Therefore, efforts must be compatible with the Net-Centric Enterprise Solutions for Interoperability (NESI), the Net-Enabled Command Capability (NECC) and the concepts detailed in USAF Electronic Systems Center's Technical Implementation Architecture (TIA) while also demonstrating independence from specific products, web applications, and database servers. Resulting services are envisioned as being transitioned as a Capability Module (CM) in accordance with NECC guidelines. Information on these standards and guidelines can be found at the following web-sites: NESI Public Website (http://nesipublic.spawar.navy.mil/), DISA NECC Website (http://www.disa.mil/necc/), and USAF ESC TIA Website (http://www.herbb.hanscom.af.mil/tia/TIA_TRD-V1-for_HERBB.doc). Offerors may submit compelling arguments as to why their solution should not abide by these standards and guidelines.</p>
<p>Focus areas should include a series of Limited Technology Experiments (LTEs) to demonstrate and validate prototypes that resulting capabilities may enable. AFRL will evaluate delivered prototypes in our Command &amp; Control Concept Center. To reduce risk, AFRL is currently running the Office of Naval Research (ONR) SOA Reference Implementation (SOA RI). Consequently, delivered prototypes must work in that environment, although other SOA implementations may be considered, particularly ones that may have more advanced security infrastructures. Because it is expected that several efforts will be awarded to work on specific parts of the challenge, offerors must agree to establish associate agreements with pertinent team members.</p>
<p>All responses, unclassified/classified, to this FY09 Focus Area - Integrated Tasking Order Research must be sent U.S. Postal Service, registered mail and addressed to AFRL/RISF, Attn: Elizabeth Kean, 525 Brooks Road, Rome NY 13441-4505, and reference BAA 08-09-RIKA.

<p>SUBMISSION DATES AND TIMES: White papers for this focus area only will be accepted at any time until 2pm Eastern time on 28 Sep 2012. However, due to funding availability, it is recommended that white papers be received for this focus area only by 15 Jul 09.<br /><br />FY11 Focus Area - Cyber Asset Assignment</p>
<p>This FY11 focus area seeks novel research and development efforts that advance the state of the art in cyber asset assignment to improve the United States Air Force (USAF) ability to employ assets to achieve desired effects. It is imperative that decision makers have the capability to quantify and/or estimate the effectiveness of cyber assets and use it as a foundation for trade-off analyses. They will also require techniques and methods for optimizing assignment to maximize the likelihood of achieving desired effects, while minimizing undesired outcomes. The USAF needs to execute cyber C2 processes akin to the well understood kinetic processes to integrate across domains and services to support integrated operations. Prior work has been done in the area of cyber asset characterization, attribute identification, ontology development, and simulation. The Government is looking for technical solutions that focus on the analytical and empirical analysis of this foundational work with the objective of quantifying the effectiveness of various cyber assets to develop state of the art assignment techniques and validating the results in small-scale modeling and simulation environments.</p>
<p>OTHER SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS: DO NOT send white papers to the Contracting Officer.<br /><br />All responses, unclassified/classified, to this FY11 Focus Area - Cyber Asset Assignment must be sent U.S. Postal Service, registered mail and addressed to AFRL/RISF, Attn: Stephen Colenzo, 25 Electronic Parkway, Rome NY 13441-4505, and reference BAA 08-09-RIKA.

<p>SUBMISSION DATES AND TIMES: White papers for this focus area only will be accepted at any time until 2pm Eastern time on 28 Sep 2012.</p>
<p>OTHER SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS: DO NOT send white papers to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>FY12 Focus Area - Command and Control of Cyber Assets for Mission Assurance</p>
<p>Bidders should be conscious of our increasing focus on the use of Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) to maximize interoperability and reusability of AFRL-developed technologies. Offers should demonstrate an understanding of service development and, to the extent reasonable and possible, propose deliverables that are readily deployed as services (i.e., discoverable, well-defined, self-contained modules that are independent of state or context of other services). Where SOA is a viable part of an offeror's technical approach, offeror should be prepared to discuss SOA infrastructure requirements at program kickoff and updates to decomposition and implementation status discussed at technical program reviews. Potential SOA deliverables might include Web Service Description Language (WSDL) service definitions, documented service behaviors (dependencies, sequence diagrams, stateful assumptions), and configurable virtual machine service deployments.<br />This FY12 focus area seeks novel research and development efforts that will result in prototype capabilities that help AF cyber Command and Control (C2) operators proactively build and shape the portion of cyberspace employed in support of Mission Assurance (MA) objectives. The prototypes developed under this effort will be planning services that can be integrated directly into a services based infrastructure. These services will incorporate the capability to optimize cyber defensive postures that protect critical mission threads and the associated cyber resources to the maximum extent possible before packets fly, and develop resilient courses of action (manual and automated) to survive and recover when defenses are breached. Taken together, the planning services will implement a defense-in-breadth strategy that considers a large range of assets available on the Air Force network, the overall priority of supported missions across at least two "theaters," and the cyber capabilities at each of the nodes participating in or directly supporting mission objectives.<br />The Government is anticipating, but not mandating, technical solutions in three main components for this effort. The first component is the core resource allocation algorithm that will proactively generate optimized cyber defensive postures to support initial planning and can also later be dynamically reconfigured during execution to thwart and/or recover from cyber attacks. The focus of this component will be to develop defensive plans that avoid most attacks utilizing cyber defensive posture optimization but that could also be reconfigured to survive and recover when defenses break down during execution. The second component is the capture of mission essential functions and mapping of these functions to cyber systems supporting specifics missions. With these mappings, this component will be aligned to develop a capability to provide defensive cyber courses of action options and optimization techniques. This component could be structured in a manner that allows construction of interfaces to defensive component technologies that would support automated task flows and reconfiguration commands. The third component is the development of a service-based cyber defensive planner that ties the above components together to provide a user interface, data services, and Cyberspace Control Order (CCO) generation capability for tasking subordinate units. The mapping effort results will be applied to mature today's semi-structured text CCO into a formal grammar. Needed attributes for the production of the CCO will be defined to enable the required structure for planning while designing flexibility for potential future modification and the evolving CCO processes. The integration of the three components is expected to be encompassed in the planner component.</p>

<p><br />V. APPLICATION REVIEW INFORMATION:</p>
<p>1. CRITERIA: The following criteria will be used to determine whether white papers and proposals submitted are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government. Criteria 1.1, 1.2 and 1.3 are equally important and of greater importance than 1.4.</p>
<p>1.1. Overall scientific and/or technical merit, including technical feasibility, degree of innovation, understanding of the technical and operational approaches;</p>
<p>1.2. The effort's potential contribution for providing C2 capabilities that meet Air Force cyber requirements within a realistic and reasonable schedule;</p>
<p>1.3. The prospect for effective transfer of produced technologies into Air Force and joint C2 systems; and</p>
<p>1.4. The reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees (if any).</p>
<p>No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting white papers/proposals. Individual white paper/proposal evaluations will be evaluated against the evaluation criteria without regard to other white papers and proposals submitted under this BAA. White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.</p>
<p>2. REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS: Only Government employees will evaluate the white papers/proposals for selection. The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in the administrative support contract, which do not require the review, reading, or comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks." These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements. The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a.) assembling and organizing information for R&amp;D case files; b.) accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c.) handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries. Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.</p>
<p><br />VI. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION:</p>
<p>1. AWARD NOTICES: Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email or letter will be sent by the technical POC. Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract. Those white papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner. Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.</p>
<p>All offerors submitting white papers will be contacted by the technical POC, referenced in Section VII of this announcement. Offerors can email the technical POC for status of their white paper/proposal no earlier than 45 days after proposal submission.</p>
<p>2. ADMINISTRATIVE AND NATIONAL POLICY REQUIREMENTS:</p>
<p>CLASSIFIED SUBMISSIONS: AFRL/RISF will accept classified responses to this BAA when the classification is mandated by classification guidance provided by an Original Classification Authority of the U.S. Government, or when the proposer believes the work, if successful, would merit classification. Security classification guidance in the form of a DD Form 254 (DoD Contract Security Classification Specification) will not be provided at this time since AFRL is soliciting ideas only. After reviewing incoming proposals, if a determination is made that contract award may result in access to classified information, a DD Form 254 will be issued upon contract award. Proposers that intend to include classified information or data in their submission or who are unsure about the appropriate classification of their white papers should contact the technical point of contact listed in Section VII for guidance and direction in advance of preparation.</p>
<p>Depending on the work to be performed, the offeror may require a SECRET, TOP SECRET, or TS/SCI facility clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to classified information at the time of award. In addition, the offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility to support work under this BAA. Data subject to export control constraints may be involved and only firms holding certification under the US/Canada Joint Certification Program (JCP) (www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp) are allowed access to such data.</p>
<p>3. REPORTING: Once a proposal has been selected for award, offerors will be required to submit their reporting requirement through one of our web-based, reporting systems known as JIFFY or TFIMS. Prior to award, the offeror will be notified which reporting system they are to use, and will be given complete instructions regarding its use. Please note that use of the JIFFY or TFIMS application requires customers outside of the .mil domain to purchase an approved External Certificate Authority certificate to facilitate a secured log on process. It is necessary to obtain an ECA certificate BEFORE obtaining a JIFFY or TFIMS user account. Additional information on obtaining an ECA is available at: http://iase.disa.mil/pki/eca/index.html .</p>

<DESC>UNCLAS: Dist A Approved for public release<br />Market Survey Questionnaire<br />for<br />M48A1 - Gas Particulate Filter<br /><br /><br />GENERAL INFORMATION: The U.S. Government appreciates the time and effort taken to respond to this survey. The U.S. Government acknowledges its obligations under 18 U.S.C. 1905 to protect information qualifying as "confidential" under this statute. [To avoid possible confusion with the meaning of the term "confidential" in the context of Classified Information," we will use the term "PROPRIETARY."] Pursuant to this statute, the U.S. Government is willing to accept any trade secret or PROPRIETARY restrictions placed on qualifying data forwarded in response to the survey questions and to protect it from unauthorized disclosure subject to the following: <br /><br />1. Clearly and conspicuously mark qualifying data with the restrictive legend (all caps) "PROPRIETARY" with any explanatory text, so that the U.S. Government is clearly notified of what data needs to be appropriately protected. <br /><br />2. In marking such data, please take care to mark only those portions of the data or materials that are truly confidential (over breadth in marking inappropriate data as "PROPRIETARY" may diminish or eliminate the usefulness of your response - see item 6 below). Use circling, underscoring, highlighting or any other appropriate means to indicate those portions of a single page which are to be protected. <br /><br />3. The U.S. Government is not obligated to protect unmarked data. Additionally, marked data that is already in the public domain or in the possession of the U.S. Government or third parties, or is afterward placed into the public domain by the owner or another party through no fault of the U.S. Government will not be protected once in the public domain. Data already in the possession of the U.S. Government will be protected in accordance with the U.S. Government's rights in the data. <br /><br />4. Confidential data transmitted electronically, whether by physical media or not, whether by the respondent or by the U.S. Government, shall contain the "PROPRIETARY" legend, with any explanatory text, on both the cover of the transmittal e-mail and at the beginning of the file itself. Where appropriate for only portions of an electronic file, use the restrictive legends 'PROPRIETARY PORTION BEGINS:" and "PROPRIETARY PORTION ENDS." <br /><br />5. In any reproductions of technical data or any portions thereof subject to asserted restrictions, the <br />U.S. Government shall also reproduce the asserted restriction legend and any explanatory text. <br /><br />6. The U.S. Government sometimes uses support contractors in evaluating responses. Consequently, responses that contain confidential information may receive only limited or no consideration since the Respondent's marking of data as "PROPRIETARY" will preclude disclosure of same outside the U.S. Government and therefore will preclude disclosure to these support contractors assisting the evaluation effort. The U.S. Government will use its best efforts to evaluate those responses that contain confidential information without using support contractors consistent with the resources available. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />DESCRIPTION OF INTENT: <br /><br />THIS IS A MARKET SURVEY REQUESTING INFORMATION IN SUPPORT OF THE FOLLOWING PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENT: No contract will be awarded from this announcement. This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an announcement of a forthcoming solicitation. Also, it is not a request seeking contractors interested in being placed on a solicitation mailing list. Response to this questionnaire is voluntary and no reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to the market survey and any follow-on information requests. Data submitted in response to this market survey will not be returned. No solicitation document exists at this time, and calls requesting a solicitation will not be answered.<br /><br />PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENT: <br /><br />The purpose of this questionnaire is to obtain information on commercial industry capability to satisfy U.S. Army requirements for a Gas Particulate Filter (GPF). The requirement will be achieved in a single step versus an evolutionary series or steps.<br />1. Description:<br /><br />The M48A1 GPF is a two-part filter. One part is a carbon compartment and the other a compartment filled with HEPA media. The two components remove any chemical or biological warfare agents from the air stream passing through the filter before going to users. The versatile M48A1s are part of the collective protection overpressure system and is used in a variety of filter/blower applications' design for in-line airflow patterns, to include M1A1 Series Tanks and other similar vehicles, allowing vehicle occupants to work unencumbered by individual protective equipment. The M48A1 is also a component of the M93 Gas Particulate Filter Unit (GPFU) that provides filtered air and positive pressure to users inside a shelter. <br /><br />2. Mission:<br /><br />The M48A1 Gas Particulate Filter provides 100 CFM of clean air to occupants in a large vehicle or fixed shelter while protecting against chemical/biological warfare agents and radiological particles. <br /><br />3. Users: Department of Defense<br /><br />4. Capabilities:<br /><br />Removes chemical and biological agents from up to 100 CFM of air flowing through the specific system.<br />Uses ASZM-TEDA carbon that can be disposed of as non-hazardous waste, reduces potential health hazards to the end user if the filter is ruptured and carbon is released. <br />Filter components and media materials are resistant to fungus and mildew.<br />Effective filtration at temperatures ranging from -60 F to + 160 F. <br />Three-year shelf life.<br /><br /><br />INSTRUCTIONS FOR COMPLETING THE QUESTIONNAIRE: <br /><br />1. Number each response with the appropriate question number.<br />2. You do not have to repeat the question in your response. <br />3. If you cannot answer the question, please indicate "No Response."<br />4. If a response will satisfy another question, state: "See response to question XX." <br />5. Include relevant sales media and product manuals. If providing an ACROBAT formatted manual, annotate the manual to indicate which material is applicable to the questions. If preferred, include Internet Web links to locations where animations/videos may be viewed. <br />6. If your sales media and/or manuals contain a restricted distribution statement, issue a release statement indicating that the restricted material may be distributed to Army personnel involved with this Market Survey. <br />7. Spell out any acronyms in their first instance. <br />8. Clearly mark any confidential information.

<DESC>Request for Information/Comments:
This Request for Information (RFI) is for information and planning purposes only; it is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  A contract may not be awarded as a result of this RFI.  
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Air Traffic Organization's seek to acquire information from NAS users and vendors which will help the FAA develop Standards and Requirements for the Airborne Access to SWIM (AATS) concept. The FAA is soliciting information from all commercial sources. Information submitted in response to this RFI will be used to support and enhance the project concept and the project's services. 
The purpose of this Request for Information is to solicit comments from competent commercial sources regarding the FAA's plans to provide aircraft access to the System Wide Information Management (SWIM) system data via Internet Protocol (IP).  The RFI will allow the Federal Aviation Administration to determine what information would be best suited for aircrew use and the capabilities of IP/Satcomm vendors. The FAA has established an Aircraft Access to SWIM (AATS) Workgroup which will review each response received and utilize this information to establish requirements for subject project.
The AATS Program expects this RFI to help provide better understanding of potential solutions and the functional capabilities for AATS in fulfilling FAA's requirements by soliciting input from the airline, commercial, and vendor communities on the FAA's planned approach. Any information provided is strictly voluntary and will be provided at no cost to the Government.

Aircraft AccessTo SWIM Description
The New ATM Requirement Program addresses FAA's goal for capacity and the DOT Reduced Congestion Strategic Objective to "Advance accessible, efficient, inter-modal transportation for the movement of people and goods". It also supports the FAA's National Aviation Research Plan goal for "Fast, Flexible, and Efficient" which supports development of a system that safely and quickly moves anyone and anything, anywhere, anytime on schedules that meet customer needs. Also, this program fits the NextGen goal of expanding capacity by satisfying future growth in demand (up to three times capacity) as well as reducing transit time.
The need for extensive information sharing between collaborating decision-makers has been described in the NAS Concept of Operations. Flexibility in the distribution of roles and responsibilities in planning and Air Traffic Control (ATC) is essential to the achievement of dynamic collaborative decision making. Airborne SWIM integration of various NAS information systems, along with information from NAS users and other information producers, will benefit the NAS by ensuring information interoperability for seamless communications.
It is envisioned that NextGen will require Airborne SWIM-based exchange of flight, aeronautical and weather information between aircraft and ground-based FAA systems. There is currently not an appropriate air-ground data management and exchange mechanism for this information exchange. This program is needed to develop concepts and requirements for an air-ground, Airborne SWIM-based information exchange mechanism compatible with NextGen operational planning.  Airborne SWIM is part of the NextGen portfolio of programs and is critical to ensuring all stakeholders can communicate with each other. For example, Airborne SWIM will allow airline operations, air traffic managers and controllers, Federal Air Marshals, and the military to share information in near real-time. 
Aircraft Access to SWIM benefits include:
Standards and requirements for air-ground communications for non-safety criticalinformation exchange Well-understood concepts of use for air-ground SWIM-based information exchangeBetter weather information to ground-based processing systemsImproved Collaborative ATMImproved management and use of special-use airspace.

<DESC><p>AG-0116-S-11-0089 Kennel Creek Cabin Installation<br />Questions and Answers<br />No information given on this document amends the solicitation.</p>
<p>Question 1: I have a question pertaining to the woodstove. I spoke with the registered vendor and we were unable to find the height from the cabin floor to peak of the roof in the plan, which is needed in order to get the correct measurements for the stove's venting pipe. <br />Answer 1: Distance from the cabin floor to peak of roof is approximately to be 17' 9".</p>
<p>Question 2: Deck bull rail calls for 5/8"x13" lag bolts. What's the spacing?<br />Answer 2: There are 2 lag bolts per 2x4 block, 3" from each end (12" O.C.).</p>
<p>Question 3: Any finishing applied to the added deck, picnic table, sign posts or boards, or woodshed? We used cedar tint x100 (standard USFS cabin finish) on the cabin.<br />Answer 3: The standard USFS cabin finish should be applied to the woodshed and picnic table. Use Sikkens Cetol SRD, color: Cedar, or approved equal. Apply two coats to call exposed surfaces except signposts, according to manufacturer's directions.</p>
<p>Question 4: Decking plans call for 50d spikes to hold planks down. At 8 fathom we used 6" log screws on the deck (permachink LBC). Log screws have more holding power and are easier to install. Are we allowed this change for the deck?<br />Answer 4: Yes.</p>
<p>Question 5: Materials for the picnic table specs indicate they are rough sawn. Do you want them planed? <br />Answer 5: Yes. Lumber for the picnic tables should be S4S.</p>
<p>Question 6: The woodshed overhand. Roof overhang appears to be 12 inches on the sides, but all are undefined, clarify?<br />Answer 6: The overall dimensions of the roof are 9' deep (along the slope) and 10' wide. Back and sides have an overhang of 1'. Front overhang is 1'10".</p>
<p>Question 7: What amount is the bid guarantee?<br />Answer 7: The amount of the bid guarantee is 20% or $3,000,000, which ever is less.</p>
<p>Question 8: 6/20/11, In regards to SST toilet do the floor plan, elevation, foundation drawings, and Romtec building specifications supplied from the manufacturer (Romtec) meet the required submittal guidelines in section 01330?<br />Answer 8: 6/23/11, The manufacturer of the SST should be able to provide the required documents for the submittal as specified in section 01330.</p>
<p>Question 9: 6/20/11, Can you tell me if the cabin at Icy Straits Lumber in Hoonah is in a position to be trucked down the road? Can you tell us more details about that.<br />Answer 9: 6/23/11, The cabin is very large and requires a large trailer to be moved. The roads to the project site are narrow, have limited sight distance and sharp turns and may be difficult to truck the cabin over. It is the contractors' responsibility to determine. It is expected that most contractors will choose to barge the cabin to the site.</p>
<p>Question 10: 6/20/11, Also is there D1 in a stockpile that would work as government furnished materials? Or is there a commercial source nearby?<br />Answer 10: 6/23/11, The nearest, full-time commercial source for graded rock is in Juneau, Alaska. There are times where graded rock may be available in Hoonah. The government will not be furnishing D-1.</p>
<p>Question 11: 6/20/11, In regards to the removal of the existing cabin; are we demolishing it or transporting to a new site?<br />Answer 11: 6/23/11, The removal of the existing cabin is not a part of this contract.</p>
<p>Question 12: 6/20/11, For the stone blanket would you like the rocks to be rounded or are fractured rocks suitable?<br />Answer 12: 6/23/11, Crushed rock can be used for the stone blanket as long as it meets the specifications.</p>
<p>Question 13: 6/20/11, After the cabin is in place; will the government stake the remainder of all "project elements" or does the contractor need to stake and survey required elements as well?<br />Answer 13: 6/23/11, The government will stake one or more corners of the remaining site elements after the cabin is in place. Additional surveying and staking may be required for construction and is the responsibility of the contractor.</p>
<p>Question 14: 6/20/11, The Beach Access ramp on page 12 of the drawing plans does not give a length to the proposed beach access ramp; was that done intentionally? <br />Answer 14: 6/23/11, The Beach Access ramp is approximately 25' long over the horizontal distance, and has a change in elevation of approximately 5'. The ramp should be constructed to meet the specified slope.</p>

<DESC>The purpose of this notice is to update the status of two DNDO efforts: (1) Scientific, Engineering, and Technical Assistance (SETA) Support Services and (2) the System Engineering Support Program (SESP)<br /><br />For SETA, DNDO intends to award multiple Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs) against GSA Schedule 871, Professional Engineering Services (PES.) The RFQ is still on track for a release in early July 2011, with an Industry Day tentatively set for July 13, 2011 at DNDO's offices at 1125 15th Street NW, Washington, DC 20005. Socioeconomic Size Status will be an evaluation factor on the SETA effort.<br /><br />For SESP, DNDO intends to award multiple BPAs against GSA Schedule 871 PES. The RFQ is anticipated to be released in August 2011, with an Industry Day tentatively set for September 1, 2011, also at DNDO's offices.<br /><br />The ordering period of BPAs issued for both programs will be five years, and task orders will be competed among the applicable BPA holders. The Government intends to include a Conflict of Interest clause in each effort that will prevent firms from involvement in both procurements, as either a prime or subcontractor.<br /><br />Please note that a solicitation is not being issued at this time, and this notice shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation, nor does it restrict the Government to a particular acquisition approach.<br /><br />Please continue to monitor FedBizOpps for updates on these two DNDO efforts.

<DESC><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">UPDATE June 23, 2011:&nbsp; The BAA for this notice was posted on the Federal Business Opportuniities website on Monday, June 20, 2011.&nbsp; The BAA number is BAA-11-100-SOL-00021.&nbsp; A search using that number will take you directly to the BAA announcement.&nbsp; The points of contact for this requriement have also been updated.&nbsp; Please direct all inquiries to the Contracting Officer and/or Contract Specialist listed below.<br /></span></strong><br />BARDA is the lead federal agency for the advanced development of medical countermeasures (MCM) to protect the United States against public health emergency threats, including chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear agents, emerging infectious diseases, and pandemic influenza. The 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic exemplified the unpredictability and rapidity with which a novel influenza strain can impact the world's population. With a historic effort from both government and industry partners, vaccines were developed and available to the public six months after the initial outbreak. Despite high infection rates, the 2009 H1N1 virus was only mildly pathogenic, with relatively low rates of accompanying morbidity and mortality in the overall population. However, it is possible that future pandemics will feature morbidity and mortality rates comparable with historically more severe pandemics such as 1918 and 1957. The ever-present and ever-evolving threat of pandemic influenza presents a compelling need to optimize available medical countermeasures and develop entirely new modalities for prevention and treatment of influenza disease. This BAA will support advanced development activities to improve personal protective equipment, ventilators, clinical influenza test systems and diagnostic tools.
<p>The Pandemic and All Hazard Preparedness Act directs BARDA to promote (i) innovations in technologies that may assist MCM advanced research and development, (ii) research and development of tools, devices, and technologies, and (iii) research to promote strategic initiatives, such as rapid diagnostics, broad spectrum antimicrobials, and vaccine manufacturing technologies. The priorities of the BARDA Influenza Division are closely aligned with the National Strategy for Pandemic Influenza (Nov, 2005), the National Pandemic Influenza Implementation Plan (May, 2005), recommendations from the Public Health Emergency Medical Countermeasure Enterprise Review (Aug, 2010) and the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology report on influenza vaccines manufacturing (Aug, 2010). The HHS Public Health Emergency Medical Countermeasures Enterprise Review emphasizes the need to improve medical countermeasure technologies and move towards a "nimble, flexible capacity to produce MCMs rapidly in the face of any attack or threat".</p>
<p><br />The purpose of this BAA is to solicit proposals that focus on one or more of the following solicited areas of interest.</p>
<p>Development Areas of Interest:<br />&bull; Personal Protective Equipment and Full-Featured Continuous Ventilators for Influenza Infection &amp; All-Hazards<br />&bull; Clinical Influenza Test Systems and Diagnostic Tools</p>
<p>The Government intends to have a full &amp; open competition for this requirement in the form of a BAA, which is anticipated to be issued on June 21, 2011. The Government expects to make one or more awards, subject to the availability of funds, over the period of one year.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Point of Contact</span></strong>:</p>
<p>Questions and comments regarding this announcement, referencing synopsis BAA BARDA 11-100-SOL-00021, may be submitted to <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>FLU-BAA@hhs.gov</strong></span>.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Government currently occupies office and related space in a building under lease in Oklahoma, OK&nbsp;that will be expiring.
<p>The Government requires office and related space yielding a minimum of 76,997 ANSI/BOMA office area (ABOA) square feet.<br /><br />Minimum ABOA square feet: 76,997<br />Maximum ABOA square feet: 76,997</p>
<p>The lease term requirement is for 6 years with 3 years firm. The space must be available for occupancy by March 1, 2013. The delineated area is North: 16th street, South: Reno Ave, West: Shartel Ave and East: Kelly Ave</p>
<p>Other applicable requirements include the following features:</p>
<p>&bull; Public Transportation: A commuter rail, light rail or subway station shall be located within the immediate vicinity of the building, but not exceeding a walkable &frac12; mile. Alternatively, two or more public or campus bus lines useable by tenant occupants shall be located within the immediate vicinity of the building, but not exceeding a walkable &frac12; mile.</p>
<p>&bull; A total of 76,997 net usable square feet of contiguous space is required. If the total space requirement cannot be contiguous, or on one floor, then 15,000 square feet may be located elsewhere in the building. Spaces located on multiple floors need to be consecutive floors. It is desired that a total of 4,800 net usable square feet for the Taxpayers Assistance Office be located on the ground.</p>
<p>&bull; Equipment and telecommunications rooms require a minimum floor loading of 50- 200 lbs per square foot.</p>
<p>&bull; A minimum of 25 on-site parking spaces.<br /><br />The Government is considering alternative space if economically advantageous. In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Government's requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications infrastructure, and non-productive agency downtime.</p>
<p>Interested parties should send expressions of interest to:</p>
<p>Thomas Abraham <br />Leasing Specialist Contracting Officer<br />1919 SMITH ST. <br />Room: 1600 <br />HOUSTON,TX 77002<br />Phone: (713) 209-3077 <br />Cell: (713) 545-5317 <br />Fax: (713) 209-3066</p>

<p>&bull; Building name and address and location of the available space within the building</p>
<p>&bull; Rentable square feet available, and expected rental rate per rentable square foot, fully serviced</p>
<p>&bull; ANSI/BOMA office area (ABOA) square feet to be offered, and expected rental rate per ABOA square foot, fully serviced. Indicate whether the quoted rental rate includes an amount for tenant improvements and state the amount, if any.</p>
<p>&bull; Date of space availability</p>
<p>&bull; Building ownership information</p>
<p>&bull; Amount of parking available on-site and its cost. Include whether expected rental rate includes the cost of the required Government parking (if any).</p>
<p>&bull; Energy efficiency and renewable energy features existing within the building</p>

<DESC>This acquisition is proceeding as Unrestricted Full and Open Competition Two Step Sealed Bid (IFB).<br /><br />Estimated Cost Range is greater than $50,000,000<br />The New York District of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) proposes to construct a Multipurpose Academic Building Science Facility Phase 2, which is located at the USMA West Point NY. The fully renovated facility will provide approximately 245,000 gross square feet of the existing Science Building, Bartlett Hall (753) into an expanded and modernized science center for biology, chemistry and physics programs. The project includes a complete upgrade to meet the functional requirements of the Dean's office and all relevant codes including, but not limited to life safety and seismic upgrade requirements. The facility has been designed in accordance with the Unified Facilities Criteria (UFC) 4-510-01, DoD Minimum Anti-terrorism Standards UFC 4-010-01, and the Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards/Americans with Disabilities Act Accessibility Guidelines (UFAS/ADAAG). Operations and maintenance manuals and commissioning will be provided.<br /><br />The period of performance for this project is anticipated to be 1460 calendar days. This Procurement will be conducted under the Federal Supply Code: Y119 - Other Administrative and Service Buildings; the Standard Industrial Classification Code: 1542, North American Industry Classification System Code: 236220 - Commercial and Institutional Building Construction. The size standard for this code is $33,500,000. The Federal Acquisition Regulation requires that Past Performance Information (PPI) be collected on Department of Defense (DoD) contracts. The Government has now implemented a web-enabled application that collects and manages contractor past performance data. Effective 1 April 2007, the system, Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS), requires both the contractor and the Government to submit their portion of the CPARS report via the internet for construction contracts. More definitive guidance and instructions will be incorporated in the solicitation and resultant contract. In the meantime, to become familiar with the system, the CPARS website has a computer-based training module and a practice session for your use at https://www.nwp.usace.army.mil/ct/I/home.asp by following the links to the training.<br /><br />It is anticipated that the IFB will be issued on or about 15 days from the date on this pre-solicitation notice on or about 1 June 2011, for downloading at the Government's website at http://www.fbo.gov/. No paper copies will be issued.<br /><br />The only PLAN-HOLDER'S/BIDDER'S LIST now available is via FedBizOpps. When viewing the Synopsis/Pre-solicitation Notice, you will click on the 'ADD ME TO INTERESTED VENDORS' to enter your information. This function does not, however, allow you to identify yourself as a Prime or Sub. It is recommended that you identify your category in parentheses at either the beginning or end of your company name. For example: (Prime/Sub) XYZ Construction, or XYZ Construction (Prime/Sub). IT IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE CONTRACTOR TO CHECK FEDBIZOPPS FREQUENTLY FOR ANY AMENDMENTS OR CHANGES TO THE SOLICITATION. <br /><br />Bids will be submitted to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Contracting Division, Room 1843, 26 Federal Plaza, New York, NY 10278. All questions must be submitted in writing via email, fax, or mail to the POC.

<DESC><p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Justification for an Exception to Fair Opportunity<br /></strong><br />In accordance with FAR 16.505(b)(2), the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE) requested that the Program Support Center (PSC)&nbsp;negotiate a task order with Avalere Health LLC to perform the statement of work entitled <em>CLASS Actuarial Analysis and Technical Expert Panel Meeting</em>.&nbsp; The reasons for not providing fair opportunity to compete are that (1) only Avalere Health is capable of providing the services at the level of quality required because the services are unqiue and highly specialized and (2) ASPE's need for the services is so urgent that providing a fair oppoortunity to comepte would have resulted in unacceptable delays.<br /><br />The purpose of the task order contract is to continue actuarial modeling fo the Community Living Assistance Services and Supports (CLASS) program, a voluntary insurance progtram estalibshed by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA), by using Avalere Health's revised Long-Term Care Policy Simulator, and convene a meeting of technical experts to review the methodology, assumptions, and output from actuarial models of CLASS.&nbsp; Both activities will support developemnet of the new federall administered CLASS program.&nbsp; Specifically, the revised LTC-PS will be sued to estimte aprticiaption in CLASS and age-rated premiums based on various program parameteres and provide critical information to support the Department's develeopment of a Notice for Proposed rulemaking (NPRM) required under the ACA in 2011/2012.<br /><br />No contarctur under the Indefinite Devliery/Indefeinite Quantity Task Order Contracts for Disability, Aging and Long-Term Care Policy and Data Analysis other than Avalere Health has a current, population-based premium calculator that can model CLASS.&nbsp; Furthermore, only Avalere Health can produce the information required for the NPRM over the 12 month period of performance.&nbsp; THe estimated value is $275,000.00.&nbsp; The anticiapted cost will be fair and reasonable due to pre-determined fair and reasonable pricing in the IDIQ contract and an evaluation by the Project Officer with respect to the labor mix and level of effort.&nbsp; Future, similar requirements will be re-assessed to determine if the basis for an exception to a fair opportunity exists or if other holders of these IDIQ contracts are able to meet the Government's requirements.&nbsp; The contracting officer certified this to be true and accurate to the best of their knoweldge and belief.</p>
