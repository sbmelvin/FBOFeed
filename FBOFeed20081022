<DESC>The US Navy intends to procure a Power PC (PPC) upgrade for the AN/ALE-47 Programmer, CD-45(V)1/ALE-47, Part Number 179730-0006. The AN/ALE-47 Programmer contains a MIL-STD-1750A Central Processing Unit (CPU), Part Number 5962-89519. Due to the age of the architecture, the 1750A does not provide required processing throughput to meet the U S Navy?s immediate needs. Mission vulnerabilities created by the continued use of the 1750A processor must be immediately reduced. In order to eliminate these mission vulnerabilities the US Navy is planning to replace the 1750A CPU with BAE Systems existing ALE-47 PPC CPU Input/Output (I/O) Circuit Card Assembly (CCA). The selection of this CPU I/O CCA will also eliminate the need for the current CD-45(V)1/ALE-47 Discrete I/O CCA P/N 174255-0006 which currently contains an obsolete part, P/N QL12X16B-0PF100C. A hardware and commercial OFP demonstration is required 30 days after contract award. Military qualified, production hardware along with an Operational Flight Program (OFP) is required within 120 days of contract award to begin US Navy assault aircraft integration. The BAE PPC commercial OFP which removes the 1750A processor limitations will support initial integration testing. The commercial OFP will be modified in parallel with initial integration to incorporate the necessary US Navy assault aircraft functionality. The US Navy plans to procure 800 production units following successful hardware and software integration as well as a complete technical data package.

This acquisition will result in the modification of existing BAE Contract N00421-04-C-0069 adding a cost plus fixed-fee level of effort Option V with a period of performance of approximately five months that will run from 1 January 2009 to 21 May 2009.  This directed procurement is necessary as the current contract is scheduled to run out of ceiling 31 December 2008, approximately five months early due to increased project requirements.  The proposed additional five month option period is needed for continuing on-going projects currently being done under Contract N00421-04-C-0069 while the follow-on action is being competed.  Due to the on-going nature of the projects currently being done under Contract N00421-04-C-0069 and the need to continue these services without a break in work, BAE is the only practical source for providing the necessary continuation of these services until award of a follow-on contract.  THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.  However, responsible interested parties may submit a proposal in which they identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement.  The Government will consider all information received by 6 November, 2008, 1530 EST.  A determination by the Government not to compete this procurement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  The Government will not pay for any information received.  No telephone responses will be accepted.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541620   The overall objective of this study is to estimate mean levels of mercury and PCBs in approximately 20 of the most commonly consumed fish species and the frequency with which composite values exceed action levels for mercury and PCBs. The purpose of this work is tostatistically analyze the raw data that EPA generated for mercury and PCBs from seafood from the New Fulton Fish Market. The contractor shall analyze the data provided by the EPA and generate a report documenting the data analyses and study findings for the FFM study.  
The contractor shall perform descriptive summary statistics (mean, median, minimum, maximum, standard deviation, range and variability) for average mercury and PCB levels for each species, vendor, and origin for which the EPA provides data.  Also, the contractor shall generate an array by species of the number of samples above and below Mercury and PCB action levels. All analyses and findings will be documented in the report. The report will include text, tables, and graphical plots.
4. 	STATEMENT OF WORK
The contractor shall conduct the following tasks.
	4.1   	Task 1: Prepare Workplan
4.1.1	Task 1 Description
The contractor shall prepare a Workplan, including an estimate, and submit it to the EPA for approval within 10 business days of receiving this work assignment. The contractor shall not begin Task 2 until the Workplan has been approved by the EPA.
The Contractor may propose additional analyses that may provide additional insight into these data as well as specific graphical displays. The Workplan will specify an analysis approach. 
The EPA will provide the contractor with the study's Quality Assurance Project Plan (QAPP) with the work assignment. The QAPP was developed in accordance with the document EPA Requirements for Quality Assurance Project Plans, EPA QA/R-5. The Quality Assurance Project Plan (QAPP) describes the overall study methods and standard procedures including the quality assurance (QA) and quality control (QC) procedures used during data collection, preparation, and tissue analysis for the Study of Mercury and PCBs in Seafood from the New Fulton Fish Market. Section 9.4 of the study's QAPP only briefly summarizes how raw laboratory data will be examined and does not provide details about the statistical measures and QA procedures for the data summary analysis.

4.3	Task 3: Analyze Data
4.3.1	Task 3 Description
The EPA will provide the contractor with a CSV file or MS Excel file on mercury concentrations for 225 samples and data on PCB concentrations for approximately  50 samples. All measurement data represent an average for multiple specimens as stated above  and as specified in the Quality Assurance Project Plan: Sample Collection, Composite and Analysis for a Study of Mercury and  PCBs  in Seafood from the New Fulton Fish Market, May 2008. The contractor shall evaluate all data for acceptability and quality prior to analysis. The contractor shall review the EPA data to determine if any data was corrupted during the data transfer.  Data evaluation results shall be reported to the EPA and documented.
The contractor shall analyze the data and calculate descriptive summary statistics (mean, median, minimum, maximum, standard deviation, range and variability) for mercury and PCB levels by species and by wholesaler. Where the dataset contains the origin of the fish, include origin in the summary statistics.  The contractor shall generate an array of the data for each species showing the sample results above and below known mercury and PCB action levels. This will provide an estimate of the proportion of composite samples that exceed the action level. Analyses will examine distributions and variability of measurement results by species, species size and weight. The Contractor shall analyze results by species based on origin or waterbody, when possible. The Contractor shall evaluate the market reported species common name to the DNA sequenced species common name. The Contractor shall provide an assessment of measurement error with the duplicate sample analysis results. Where appropriate, confidence limits for overall mean levels by species will be calculated.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC> Nigeria: Kiri Dam Hydroelectric Power Plant Feasibility Study

POC John Kusnierek, USTDA, 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901, Tel: (703) 875-4357, Fax: (703) 875-4009.  PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT CONTRACTS OFFICE; PROPOSAL SUBMISSION PLACE: OFFICE OF THE GOVERNOR OF ADAMAWA STATE, P.M.B. 2066, YOLA, ADAMAWA STATE, NIGERIA.

Nigeria: Kiri Dam Hydroelectric Power Plant Feasibility Study.  The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a Feasibility Study for the Office of the Governor of Adamawa State in Nigeria.   

The State of Adamawa is located in the remote northeastern region of Nigeria, bordering Cameroon.  It is one of the largest states in Nigeria and occupies about 36,917 square kilometers with an estimated population of 3.7 million.  The State of Adamawa is committed to addressing its critical power needs.  Currently, Adamawa relies on one transmission line from the national grid for its main source of power.  This configuration makes for a fragile delivery system that leaves power recipients vulnerable to outages.  Diesel-fueled backup generators are used sporadically in the capital city of Yola, but fuel supplies have become prohibitively expensive.  The development of a hydroelectric power plant at the Kiri Dam would offer the state an additional, reliable source of power.  Consequently, the project is considered one of the highest priorities for the State of Adamawa.  

The Kiri Power Plant Project would serve two critical power needs in Adamawa.  First, it would offer an immediate additional supply of 35 MW of electricity to an area that presently has no installed capacity of its own, except for some diesel-powered thermal units in Yola, for which fuel supplies have become prohibitively expensive.  Second, it would offer the State a potential power source that is not dependent on the unstable national transmission grid.  

This project will include a Feasibility Study which would focus primarily on:

oTechnical, financial, and economic analysis of the project.
oReview of related regulatory issues
oDetermination of estimated Project costs
oImplementation plan

The project will assess the feasibility of building a 35 MW hydroelectric power plant at the Kiri Dam in the northeastern State of Adamawa in Nigeria.  The study will cover the construction of the plant, the transmission line to the national grid, and an independent transmission line from the plant to Yola.

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $467,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the TOR, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  To request the RFP in PDF format, please go to: https://www.ustda.gov/businessopps/rfpform.asp.  Requests for a mailed hardcopy version of the RFP may also be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firms name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by 4:00 p.m. on January 8, 2009 at the above address.   Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<DESC><p>Request for Information (RFI)<br />Integration of Two High Definition Video Systems to Kineto Tracking Mounts<br />(KTM) and Mobile Command and Control Systems
<p>Schedule:<br />Closing Date: 10 November 2008</p>
<p>Scope:<br />The AFFTC is seeking industry information on available products and technologies to further define/refine the requirements and the acquisition approach for the integration of remotely-operated high definition video equipment to Government Furnished Property (GFP) Flight Vision Systems. Sources can seek available products and technologies to produce components or a complete capability to modernize Range Optics Flight Vision video systems by integrating modern Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) digital Electro-Optic (E-O) sensors to two mobile Kineto Tracking Mounts (KTM) and two Control Centers (Operator Cabins). The purpose of this effort is to modernize the AFFTC capability to capture optical imagery of weapons tests, provide high resolution video of local flight test events and situational awareness to test conductors, Range Safety Officers and flight test engineers. This was formerly provided by the outdated mobile KTM/Flight Vision Systems.</p>
<p>Two systems have been determined to be implemented in a single or phased procurement. It is envisioned that the mobile KTM/Flight Vision will operate from prepared site at the West and East Range on the Precision Impact Range (PIRA) at Edwards AFB. The sites are equipped with concrete pads, power, and fiber connections.</p>
<p>The base configuration of the first phase of the new system will consist of the GFP trailer- mounted KTM connected via fiber-optic cables, through Input/output (I/O) Panels, to the GFP Control Center (Operator Cabin). This fiber-optic connectivity between the KTM and Operator Cabin will replace current copper connectivity. The operator cabin I/O panels will allow future connectivity to network or dedicated fiber for baseband signals. The Operator Cabin currently has mounted Electronic Industry Standard (EIA) equipment racks (Qty. 3) with power distribution to mount new COTS equipment such as UPS, master sync generators, IRIG-B inserters, metadata encoders, video monitoring, digital video recorder, sensor controls, KTM tracking controllers, and fiber-optic head-end equipment for optical-electrical conversion, video compression encoders, and network connectivity. Power generators for the KTM/Flight Vision Systems are GFP.</p>
<p>The demarcation for this phase will be at the Operator Cabin I/O panel, however future phased approaches will transport and distribute the KTM/Flight Vision High Definition Video to the Mission Control Rooms (MCRs) for viewing and analysis. The High Definition video is recorded on site (full baseband) at the Operator Cabin by a removable disk array and the video is then compressed for transport across a network for distribution to the MCRs. The received video is decoded in near real-time situational awareness to different Mission Control Rooms for viewing by the Flight Test Control Officer, Range Safety Officer, Test Engineer, and customers.</p>
<p>Background:<br />Currently AFFTC Range Optics Flight Vision video system is equipped to capture and store images in analog formats such as S-VHS and does not have the capability for high resolution/high definition image tracking of weapon tests. Migration from analog to digital formats can provide Range Optics Operations with a potentially improved image quality for providing customers with high resolution imagery and the potential for overall lower operational costs.</p>
<p>Description:<br />The key characteristics of the sought high definition imaging system capability are contained below. Note: &lsquo;threshold' indicates a basic requirement while &lsquo;objective' indicates a goal. Goals are not required but are considered very desirable.

If not, do you have FAR Part 145 certification efforts ongoing to obtain?<br />6) If you have FAR Part 145 certification what aircraft/engines/avionics do you support under the certificate?<br />7) Does your company have any experience in certifying airworthiness after aircraft modification using Supplemental type certificates or the DER process?<br />8) How do you handle obsolescence management of components for other commercial aircraft? <br />9) The Government is contemplating a service contract, NAICS Code 488190, what category does your company fall within; small business, veteran-owned small business, small disadvantaged business, Certified 8A, Hub Zone small business, women-owned small business, large business? <br />10) What are your thoughts on this effort being a total small business set-aside? <br />11) What percentage of this workload can be accomplished by small businesses?<br />12) If it cannot be subcontracted to small businesses, provide information to substantiate your position.<br />13) What percentage of this workload do you anticipate to subcontract?<br />14) If you are a small business, do you anticipate teaming with another offeror?<br />15) We are contemplating awarding a 7 - 10 year contract.<br />a) Can you accurately reflect your costs for that Period of Performance? <br />b) What are your concerns regarding this period of performance?<br />c) How long is your typical contractual arrangement established with vendors and subcontractors? <br />16) What advantages/disadvantages do you perceive would be obtained by using a FAR Part 12 contract?<br />17) What previous experience does your company have with Government contracts?<br />a) Is your company familiar with the Government processes of contracting, billing, engineering, etc.?<br />18) If you had pervious contracts with the Government, what types of pricing arrangement were used?<br />a) What type of pricing arrangement would you recommend for the contract?<br />19) What does your company specialize in?<br />20) What type incentives do you believe would best motivate you to offer continuous supply rate improvements while driving down cost?<br />21) What do you perceive are the pros and cons of including liquidated damage penalties tied to aircraft availability?<br />22) What other recommendations /approaches can you offer that would provide USAF insight that would result in successful Contractor Logistic support, COMBS effort for these aircraft?<br />23) What are your recommendations and/or concerns with this source selection?<br />24) Provide any other comments you would like to make in reference to this market research for E9 CLS.<br />The Government is seeking to optimize flexibility within CLS services contracts. We are exploring pricing variable levels of support into the E-9 CLS contract as part of this initiative and are seeking industry feedback and ideas on possible contracting options. The goal is to establish a flexible contract that allows the Government to adjust required level of support as needed without driving costs or significantly increasing the risks to the Contractor or the Government. The following scenario is for research purposes only and your candid answers will aid our strategy planning for the E-9 CLS contract.<br />1. Do you have capability to price incremental levels of support? For example, are you able to price two separate levels of Mission Capable (MC) and Non Mission Capable Supply (NMCS) support<br />a. Level I (standard); MC Rate 80%, NMCS rate 3%.<br />b. Level II (reduced); MC Rate 70%, NMCS rate 5% <br />2. Would there be a significant price difference at the Level I and Level II increments? If not, at what increment could the Government expect to see a price difference?<br />3. Could you conceivably adjust your level of support at the beginning of each FY based on a change in required MC/NMCS rates?<br />4. Do you foresee additional risks of pricing two levels of support? If so, briefly explain. <br />5. In your opinion, would the overall contract price increase, decrease, or remain the same if an incremental pricing structure was established versus pricing to support a single MC/NMCS rate?<br />6. Do you have other recommendations for making a CLS contract more flexible to accommodate variations in Government funding levels by fiscal year?</p>

<RESPDATE>112108
<CONTACT>Marie L. Hickox, Contracting Officer, Phone (256) 450-1493, Email Marie.Hickox@mda.mil
<DESC>The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) Test Resources Directorate (DTR) is soliciting vendor capabilities to offer, modify, design, develop, test, field and sustain a Next Generation Time and Space Position Information (NGTSPI) solution to track missiles during MDA flight tests.  NGTSPI must:

       Provide both real-time TSPI for range safety and support post-flight trajectory reconstruction analysis.  
     Track target and interceptor missiles from launch or horizon break to splash or intercept.  
     Support on average eight MDA flight tests per year.  
     Be developed and ready to begin flight safety certification in the 2011 timeframe.  

This announcement is issued for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP).  There is no solicitation available at this time and no funding has currently been allocated for award.  This notice is published for information purposes only and in no way obligates the Government to award any contract or otherwise pay for information/items provided in response to this RFI.  MDA/DTR plans to follow up this RFI with an industry day for face-to-face discussions with vendors.

1.  BACKGROUND:

MDA conducts flight testing in the Pacific theater. The resources of several Pacific test range and launch facilities are used in each test.  Generally, multiple targets and interceptors in each test are instrumented with encrypted telemetry transmitters.  Both long and short range test engagements require accurate TSPI recording for range safety and post-mission weapon systems characterization.  

Currently most targets and interceptors employ an onboard digital Global Positioning System (GPS) Translator (DGT).  The DGT is integrated with the missiles L-band antennas and low-noise amplifier(s).  The S-band downlink from the DGT is received by a ground telemetry site equipped with the GPS Translator Processor (GTP).  The GTP processes the DGT signal producing position and velocity data.

Advances in technology suggest that a GPS-based replacement meeting the performance, integration, and environment requirements below is available.  A description of vendor capabilities to offer, modify, design, develop, test, field and sustain a Next Generation TSPI system is requested.  The system shall meet or exceed the following requirements. 

2.  REQUIREMENTS:

The top-level requirements for the NGTSPI are as follows:

1.  Shall provide time, space, and position information (TSPI) for high dynamics vehicles as well as providing a dedicated S-band downlink or an interface to an existing S-band link.

2.  Shall provide adequate missile and GPS data to support root cause investigations into non-nominal tracking performance for the cases of:
     a.  L-band antenna loss  Shall accommodate abnormal partial gain or phase loss 
     b.  S-band downlink loss  - Shall accommodate abnormal partial gain or phase loss 
     c.  S-band multipath signal interference  Shall accommodate multipath and interference conditions typical of range operations.

3.  Tracking range for these missiles shall be up to 2000 nautical miles for minimum S-band antenna G/T of 13dB/K.

4.  The S-band transmitter frequency shall be settable in 1 MHz steps in accordance with Inter-range Instrumentation Group IRIG-106 standard.

5.  Shall operate with 24 to 32 Vdc provided by the flight vehicle.

6.  Shall be capable of stand alone downlink encryption or be compatible with other onboard encryption system.

7.  Shall provide a downlink closure with a bit error rate of 1 in 10-6 bits.

8.  S-band downlink shall be designed in conformance with Inter-range Instrumentation Group IRIG-106 telemetry standard to avoid adjacent S-band channel interference and efficiently use spectrum during simultaneous and independent track of multiple targets and interceptors.  

9.  Shall interface with discrete or multi-element ring receiving L-band antennas with integrated Low-Noise Amplifiers  (LNA) providing a minimum of 20dB LNA gain with the GPS C/N0 at L1 C/A signal at the input of 38.3dB-Hz over 66% spherical antenna coverage and 35.3dB-Hz over 84% spherical antenna coverage.  The unit shall meet all performance requirements with these signal conditions.

10.  Shall provide a real-time state vector at 20 Hz.

11.  Latency shall not exceed 50 milliseconds.  Latency is defined as the interval from the state vector time tag to the transmission of that state vector after processing.

12.  Time to first fix (TTFF) shall be less than 5 seconds.
 
13.  Reacquisition of signals after recoverable loss shall be less than 1.5 seconds. 

14.  Shall provide a real-time absolute position accuracy of less than 15 meters (1 sigma) while operating non-differentially.
 
15.  Shall provide a real-time velocity accuracy of 1 m/sec (1 sigma) while operating non-differentially.

16.  Shall provide for postflight position accuracy of less than 1 meter (1 sigma).

17.  Shall provide for postflight velocity accuracy of less than 0.1 m/sec (1 sigma).

18.  Flight unit performance requirements shall be met under the following dynamics:
     a.  Velocity  10,000 meters/second minimum
     b.  Acceleration  75 g minimum in any direction 
     c.  Jerk  75 g/s minimum in any direction for up to 1 sec during any 5 sec period.
     d.  Roll period  4 sec
 
19.  The flight unit shall weigh less than 16 ounces.

20.  The flight unit shall be no larger than 0.98H x 3.45W x 4.17L inches. 
 
21.  The flight unit shall operate under the following environmental conditions
     a.  Temperature --  -450 C  to 750 C 
     b.  Pressure  14.7 psia to vacuum of 1*10-8 torr

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought Synopsis. This synopsis neither constitutes a Request for Proposal, nor does it restrict the Government from an ultimate acquisition approach. This synopsis should not be construed as a commitment by the Government for any purpose. Requests for solicitation will not receive a response. All information is to be submitted at no cost or obligation to the U.S. Government. The U.S. Government reserves the right to reject, in whole or in part, any input as a result of this market survey. The U.S. Government is not obligated to notify respondents of the results of this survey. If a formal solicitation is generated at a later date, a solicitation notice will be published. No award will be made as a result of this market survey.
The Indian Head Division Naval Surface Warfare Center is seeking potential sources, pricing and scheduling for the design, manufacture and installation/training of an online vacuum casting system. The system will be used in Indian Head Division's pilot scale propellant processing facility.
The system shall continuously vacuum cast energetic material from a Coperion (formerly Werner & Pfleiderer) 40-mm twin-screw extruder. The extruder discharge is approximately 54 inches above the ground and can produce up to 100 pounds per hour of castable material. The available footprint for the vacuum casting system is seven feet wide by fourteen feet long by 75 inches high, directly in front of the extruder. The equipment shall comply with Hazardous Location Class I, Division 1 Group D and Class II, Division 1 Groups E, F and G. The following utilities are provided at the building; electric 110V & 220V, potable and non-potable water, air pressure up to 90psi. An existing vacuum pump is available, Kinney KD-30, if adequate for the designed system. Since the operating facility is used for multiple programs the vacuum casting system shall be capable of being installed and removed easily e.g. casters, leveling feet.  
The vacuum casting system shall be operated remotely from another building while the extruder is running. It shall be integrated with the existing Allen Bradley SLC500 & Wonderware controls. Due to safety requirements no personnel are allowed in the extruding/casting building while the extruder is running.  The system shall be capable of stopping operations and resuming them safely after shutdown.  During start up each morning or after a shutdown the system must be able to divert the initial material from the extruder to a scrap area and then to casting once steady state has been achieved.  The casting system shall be designed for ease of cleaning and disassembly.  Only sanitary or pharmaceutical grade connections will be allowed. There shall also be no stagnation points anywhere within the system to allow build up of material.   
Use of the vacuum casting system will be intended for molds up to 7.5 inches in diameter and 36 inches in length.  The system must also be capable of producing pan samples for quality analysis and may require vibration.  A minimum vacuum of 10 mmHg will be required during casting however this shall be adjustable for process quality and/or different products.  The design shall be flexible enough to accommodate smaller items as long as it does not dramatically increase the complexity of the system.  Consideration for possible scale up to a larger extruder (~600lbs/hr) shall also be taken.
All interested sources shall provide a summary of their company's capabilities including organization name, address, calibration processes, inspection capability, personnel, and past experience. It is also required to provide a point of contact, phone number, fax number, e-mail address, business size, taxpayer identification number, DUNS number, and CAGE Code.
All responding sources must email their response submissions no later than 10/30/2008 to:

<DESC>Link-16 Network EnhancementsREQUEST FOR INFORMATION1     DESCRIPTION1.1   INTRODUCTIONThe Program Executive Office forCommand, Control, Communications,Computers, Intelligence and Space(PEO C4I), Command and ControlProgram Office (PMW 150) is surveyingindustry interest in a prospectivecontract to perform Link-16 NetworkEnhancements in the MultifunctionInformation Distribution System (MIDS)on Ship (MOS). The contractor shallperform prototyping, hardwaredevelopment, software development,hardware assembly, hardware andsoftware integration, and testdemonstrations of the Link-16Mandate modifications and NetworkEnhancement options in a MOSterminal.1.2   THIS IS A REQUEST FORINFORMATION (RFI) ONLYThis RFI is issued solely forinformation and planning purposes  itdoes not constitute a Request forProposal (RFP) or a promise to issuean RFP in the future.  This RFI doesnot commit the Government to contractfor any supply or service whatsoever.Furthermore, the Navy is not at thistime seeking proposals and will notaccept unsolicited proposals.Responders are advised that the U.S.Government will not pay for anyinformation or administrative costsincurred in response to this RFI; allcosts associated with responding to thisRFI will be solely at the interestedpartys expense.  Not responding tothis RFI does not preclude participationin any future RFP, if any is issued.  If asolicitation is issued, it will besynopsized on the Federal BusinessOpportunities (FedBizOpps) websiteand the SPAWAR E-Commerce Centralwebsite at https://e-commerce.spawar.navy.mil.  It is theresponsibility of any potential offerorsto monitor these sites for additionalinformation pertaining to thisrequirement.2      BACKGROUND2.1   RequirementsPEO C4I, PMW 150 develops and fieldsTactical Data Link (TDL) Systems forthe U.S. Navy. The MOS systemprovides platforms access to the Link-16 network.2.1.1 Link-16 Mandatedmodifications include the following:Cryptographic Modernization (CM) willre-design cryptographic SRUs forexisting first or second generation Link-16 terminals into a compliant productas mandated by Chairman of the JointChiefs of Staff Instruction (CJCSI)Notice 6510.02C & NSA Policy 3-9.  TheCM approach will integrate a CommonCrypto Module (CCM) developed undera separate contract into a re-designedCommon Signal Processor (CSP) CircuitCard Assembly (CCA) for the MOSterminal. The CCM will haveincorporated the tenets of theCryptographic Modernization initiativeincluding the use of up to four cryptoalgorithms, and will have the memorycapacity to store 365 days of keys, withmultiple keys per day.  The CCMreplaces the functions of the currentSecure Data Unit (SDU).  Theredesigned CSP will support not onlyCM, but also FR and have the growthcapacity to support additionalenhancements. Frequency remapping is required by aMemorandum of Agreement (MOA)between Department of Defense (DOD)and Department of Transportation(DOT) regarding the 960-1215 MHzfrequency band. Frequency remappingalgorithm is as defined in DoD 4650.1-R1, Link 16 EMC Feature CertificationProcess and Requirements, App 2,Frequency Remapping Algorithm, dated26 April 2005.   The Frequencyremapping algorithm was developed toremap up to 14 of 51 carrierfrequencies. When frequencyremapping is enabled, the terminalshall select frequencies such that (1)every pulse in a message that wouldhave used an authorized frequency iffrequency remapping were disabled willuse the same frequency whenfrequency remapping is enabled, (2)every pulse that would have used anunauthorized frequency if frequencyremapping were disabled will use anauthorized frequency when frequencyremapping is enabled, and (3) everyterminal that replaces an unauthorizedfrequency with an authorizedfrequency, on any particular pulse, willmake the same frequency replacementdecision for that pulse, and thisreplacement decision shall be thesame whether the terminal istransmitting or receiving. Thereplacement frequency selections shalldepend only on the set of frequenciesinitially selected for the entire messageby the 51 carrier frequency hop-setalgorithm.2.1.2 Existing Link 16 terminalsdo not fully use the available capacityof the Link-16 network. To moreeffectively use the Link-16 networkseveral enhancements are beingconsidered. Link-16 NetworkEnhancement options include thefollowing:The Link-16 Enhanced Throughput (ET)capability provides the ability totransmit more information into a Link-16 time slot without modification to theRadio Frequency signal structure.

<DESC>Link-16 Network EnhancementsREQUEST FOR INFORMATION1     DESCRIPTION1.1   INTRODUCTIONThe Program Executive Office forCommand, Control, Communications,Computers, Intelligence and Space(PEO C4I), Command and ControlProgram Office (PMW 150) is surveyingindustry interest in a prospectivecontract to perform Link-16 NetworkEnhancements in the Joint TacticalInformation Distribution System(JTIDS) Class 2 family of terminals.The contractor shall performprototyping, hardware development,software development, hardwareassembly, hardware and softwareintegration, and test demonstrations ofthe Link-16 Mandate modifications andNetwork Enhancement options in aJTIDS Class 2 terminal.1.2   THIS IS A REQUEST FORINFORMATION (RFI) ONLYThis RFI is issued solely forinformation and planning purposes  itdoes not constitute a Request forProposal (RFP) or a promise to issuean RFP in the future.  This RFI doesnot commit the Government to contractfor any supply or service whatsoever.Furthermore, the Navy is not at thistime seeking proposals and will notaccept unsolicited proposals.Responders are advised that the U.S.Government will not pay for anyinformation or administrative costsincurred in response to this RFI; allcosts associated with responding to thisRFI will be solely at the interestedpartys expense.  Not responding tothis RFI does not preclude participationin any future RFP, if any is issued.  If asolicitation is issued, it will besynopsized on the Federal BusinessOpportunities (FedBizOpps) websiteand the SPAWAR E-Commerce Centralwebsite at https://e-commerce.spawar.navy.mil.  It is theresponsibility of any potential offerorsto monitor these sites for additionalinformation pertaining to thisrequirement.2      BACKGROUND2.1   RequirementsPEO C4I, PMW 150 develops and fieldsTactical Data Link (TDL) Systems forthe U.S. Navy. The JTIDS providesplatforms access to the Link-16network.2.1.1 Link-16 Mandatedmodifications include the following:Cryptographic Modernization (CM) willre-design cryptographic SRUs forexisting first or second generation Link-16 terminals into a compliant productas mandated by Chairman of the JointChiefs of Staff Instruction (CJCSI)Notice 6510.02C & NSA Policy 3-9.  TheCM approach will integrate a CommonCrypto Module (CCM) developed undera separate contract into a re-designedCommon Signal Processor (CSP) CircuitCard Assembly (CCA) for the JTIDSClass 2 terminal. The CCM will haveincorporated the tenets of theCryptographic Modernization initiativeincluding the use of up to four cryptoalgorithms, and will have the memorycapacity to store 365 days of keys, withmultiple keys per day.  The CCMreplaces the functions of the currentSecure Data Unit (SDU).  Theredesigned CSP will support not onlyCM, but also FR and have the growthcapacity to support additionalenhancements.Frequency remapping is required by aMemorandum of Agreement (MOA)between Department of Defense (DOD)and Department of Transportation(DOT) regarding the 960-1215 MHzfrequency band. Frequency remappingalgorithm is as defined in DoD 4650.1-R1, Link 16 EMC Feature CertificationProcess and Requirements, App 2,Frequency Remapping Algorithm, dated26 April 2005.   The Frequencyremapping algorithm was developed toremap up to 14 of 51 carrierfrequencies. When frequencyremapping is enabled, the terminalshall select frequencies such that (1)every pulse in a message that wouldhave used an authorized frequency iffrequency remapping were disabled willuse the same frequency whenfrequency remapping is enabled, (2)every pulse that would have used anunauthorized frequency if frequencyremapping were disabled will use anauthorized frequency when frequencyremapping is enabled, and (3) everyterminal that replaces an unauthorizedfrequency with an authorizedfrequency, on any particular pulse, willmake the same frequency replacementdecision for that pulse, and thisreplacement decision shall be thesame whether the terminal istransmitting or receiving. Thereplacement frequency selections shalldepend only on the set of frequenciesinitially selected for the entire messageby the 51 carrier frequency hop-setalgorithm.2.1.2 Existing Link 16 terminalsdo not fully use the available capacityof the Link-16network. To more effectively use theLink-16 network several enhancementsare being considered. Link-16 NetworkEnhancement options include thefollowing:The Link-16 Enhanced Throughput (ET)capability provides the ability totransmit more information into a Link-16 time slot without modification to theRadio Frequency signal structure.  Thiseffectively increases information ratesof coded free text and fixed formatmessages. Reed Solomon decoding(255 and 223) and convolutional coderates of 1/3-1 add layers of coding andinterleaving.Concurrent Multi-Netting (CMN)addresses an operational need tosimultaneously participate on multipleLink-16 nets. The CMN objective is toprovide a capability to receive onmultiple Link-16 nets, up to four,simultaneously, while retaining thecapability to transmit on one Link-16net.The contractor will be required todevelop, produce, integrate and testcomplete System Development andDemonstration (SDD) and Low RateInitial Production (LRIP) Link-16Mandate and Network Enhancementupdate kits for the JTIDS Class 2Hterminals. Complete Link-16 Mandateand Network Enhancement update kitswill include all components suitable forJTIDS Class 2H terminal integration.The JTIDS update kits will be upgradeexisting JTIDS Class 2H terminals toadd / modify the hardware and anycorresponding software, and will includethe CCM. The changes will beperformed as a field changemodification. All products will bemarked as required current UniqueMaterial Identification requirements.All legacy JTIDS software will beprovided to the contractor asGovernment Furnished Property (GFP).The contractor will provide the softwarefor all other components.The contractor will be required todeliver complete JTIDS Class 2H Link-16 Network Enhancement Upgrade Kitsfor platform integration and test. TheJTIDS Upgrade Kits to be procured onthis contemplated contract will conformto all current interface requirementsand will make use of existing hardwareand software design, to the maximumextent possible.  The contractor willprovide engineering and logisticssupport services for existing JTIDSClass 2H terminal demonstrations andevaluations of the Link-16 NetworkEnhancements.The contractor will be required todevelop the integrated logistics supportfor the operation, maintenance andsustainment of the Link-16 networkenhancements, which includes, but notbe limited to, provisioning technicaldocumentation, logistics managementinformation, technical documentation,training materials, spares, depot levelsupport, identification of hazardousmaterial, and a report identifyingissues associated with DiminishingManufacturing Sources and MaterialShortages (DMSMS), otherwise know asobsolescence.2.2   NOTIONAL SCHEDULEContract Award:         3rdQtr FY 12System Lead Time: Develop JTIDSClass 2 terminals upgrade kits by 3rdQtr FY153     REQUESTED INFORMATIONResponses to this RFI should providethe following information:3.1   Describe the respondentsproposed approach and existingcapability to provide JITDS Class 2terminal upgrades which conform to allinterface requirements and leveragesexisting hardware/software design.3.2   Describe the respondentscapability to develop, fully integrate,and test JTIDS Class 2 terminalupgrade kits (hardware and software)within the schedule shown above.3.3   Describe the maturity ofJTIDS and Link-16 Mandates andNetwork Enhancement productscurrently available from therespondent.

<DESC>Sources Sought Synopsis  This is not a Notice of Solicitation.  The Walla Walla District Corps of Engineers is issuing this notice to determine if there are an adequate number of interested business concerns capable of providing biological services to provide quality assistance and fish sampling functions for the Corps of Engineers (Corps) Juvenile Fish Transportation Program for the base year 2009, and optional year 2010.<BR><BR>Businesses responding to this sources sought announcement may register via email to nona.r.fincher@usace.army.mil.  This announcement is based on the best information available.  This announcement does not commit the Government to award of a contract.  The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is not responsible for any costs incurred by responding to this notice.  Please be advised that all information submitted will be considered procurement sensitive.  <BR><BR>1.  Work Period.  The Contractor shall provide biologists to participate directly in the juvenile fish bypass, collection, and transportation programs at Lower Granite Dam (located near Pomeroy, Washington), Little Goose Dam (located near Starbuck, Washington), Lower Monumental Dam (located near Kahlotus, Washington), and McNary Dam (located near Umatilla, Oregon) for the time periods listed below.  The Contractor shall provide one biologist at each project eight hours per day on a daily basis (seven days per week) through the course of the contract work period.  The Contractors biologists will work closely with the Corps biologist responsible for the juvenile fish collection and transportation facilities at each of the four dams.  <BR><BR>	Location              Beginning Dates    Ending Dates<BR>    <BR>	Base Year                   <BR>	Lower Granite Dam      March 16, 2009    November 06, 2009                    <BR>	Little Goose Dam       March 23, 2009    November 06, 2009<BR>	Lower Monumental Dam   March 23, 2009    October 14, 2009<BR>	McNary Dam             March 23, 2009    October 21, 2009<BR><BR>      Option Year 1                 <BR>	Lower Granite Dam      March 15, 2010    November 05, 2010                    <BR>	Little Goose Dam       March 22, 2010    November 05, 2010<BR>	Lower Monumental Dam   March 22, 2010    October 14, 2010<BR>	McNary Dam             March 22, 2010    October 21, 2010<BR>     <BR>2.  Endangered Species Act Permits.  The contractor must have an Endangered Species Act (ESA) Section 10 permit from National Marine Fisheries Service which enables the Contractor to anesthetize and sample juvenile fish of all ESA listed stocks  that may be encountered at the projects.  The permit must authorize the taking of the listed stocks at all four of the Corps juvenile fish transportation projects and must include a large enough take allowance to cover the anticipated number of listed species handled in the daily samples at each project.   <BR><BR>3.  Work Items.  Specific tasks performed by the Contractor are as follows:<BR><BR>	a.  Sampling of Juvenile Fish.  The Contractor shall be responsible for all handling and sampling of juvenile fish insofar as it affects the welfare of the fish.  The Contractor shall participate in the daily project sampling activities along side personnel from various state fishery agencies sampling fish under Bonneville Power Administrations Smolt Monitoring Program.  The Contractor shall be responsible for ensuring that fish are sampled according to criteria specified in the Corps Fish Passage Plan (FPP).  The Contractor shall anesthetize and handle fish in the daily sample to determine the total number of fish in the sample, species composition, average weight of the fish, and descaling and injury rates.  These activities will usually occur simultaneously with other facility activities including truck or barge loading.  The sample information will be used by the Corps project biologist to determine adherence to the loading criteria contained in the Corps' FPP.<BR><BR>	b.  Expanded Facility Collection Counts.  During the transportation season, a sample only will be counted on a regular basis (under paragraph 3.a. above).  The Contractor shall expand the total and species composition data from the daily sample to estimate total facility collection.  At least once per day the Contractor shall also double check the Corps biologists separator collection sheet to determine if there are any errors in the projects hourly collection estimate and raceway loading.  This is a critical part of the facility operation upon which all loading and holding criteria are based.  Even slight miscalculations may significantly bias the collection or loading estimate.  The Contractor shall also record daily facility and sample mortality and shall calculate the number of juvenile fish transported by either truck or barge by species on a daily basis. <BR><BR>	c.  Facility Inspections and Project Assistance.  The Contractor shall perform daily inspections of the operation and maintenance of the juvenile fish collection and transportation facilities at each project, for all activities directly affecting the welfare of the juvenile fish, and for compliance with the criteria set forth in the Corps' FPP.  Activities to be inspected include, but are not limited to: trash accumulation and removal from turbine unit trash racks; turbine unit gatewells; operation and condition of submerged traveling screens and extended-length submerged bar screens; gatewell orifice operation and condition; condition of the juvenile collection channels, dewatering structures, and flumes; condition of counting, sorting, and holding facilities; sampling, inspection, and marking operations; fish crowding and loading operations; and condition of tractor-trailer and tug-barge units.  Any deviations from project operating criteria will be reported to the Corps biologist for corrective action.  The Contractor shall also assist the Corps biologist with orifice cycling and any fish handling required within the juvenile fish collection system if it is required to be dewatered during the operating season.  The Contractor shall also inspect adult fishways at Lower Granite, Little Goose, and Lower Monumental dams, twice per week, for compliance with criteria set forth in the Corps FPP.  The inspection report shall be provided to the Corps biologist at each project after completion of the inspection.<BR><BR>	d.  Gatewell Dipping.  Periodically during the transport season, changes in fish condition may warrant a detailed inspection of fish in various parts of the collection and transportation facilities.  A common inspection practice is to dip gatewells and examine fish that have presumably just entered the bypass system.  The Contractor shall assist the Corps biologists in dipping gatewells as necessary to evaluate condition of the fish.  A complete record of gatewell dipnetting activity and fish condition data will be maintained by the Contractor biologist.<BR><BR>	e.  Water Temperature Data Collection.  At McNary Dam, the Contractor shall be responsible for collecting water temperature data in the juvenile fish collection channel, turbine unit gatewells, forebay, tailrace, and fish holding facilities.  Water temperature data will be collected hourly, and downloaded daily, using data logging probes from June 15, 2009 through August 30, 2009 and June 15, 2010 through August 30, 2010.  Temperature data will be collected from the B bulkhead slot, at orifice depth, of all 14 turbine units.  The Contractor shall take forebay water temperatures measurements at 7 locations across the face of the powerhouse, approximately in front of every other turbine unit, at 3 locations along the spillway, and in the project tailrace at the barge loading dock.  The Contractor will also record water temperatures at 3 locations in the juvenile fish collection channel, in the juvenile fish separator, and in a raceway.  The specific location for taking these water temperature measurements will be agreed upon between the Contractor and the Corps biologist at McNary Dam.  The Contractor shall maintain the data in a computer spreadsheet. <BR>Water temperature data will be included in the weekly summary report prepared by the Contractor (under 3.i.) and in a separate final report summarizing the monitoring effort and data.  The summary report shall be provided on the same schedule as the annual report in paragraph 3.i.<BR><BR>	f.  Activities of Outside Groups.  The Contractor shall monitor the activities of groups or individuals engaged in fish research or other activities at the four projects to ensure that the activities of others at the project are not having a deleterious effect on the welfare of the juvenile fish.  The Contractor shall keep track of the number of fish handled, marked, or sacrificed by each research group and shall include this information in the weekly report under 3.i.  Any problems noticed will be reported to the Corps biologist.<BR><BR>	g.  Dissemination of Information and Coordination With Biologists at Other Projects.  The Contractor will summarize and record daily fish count information and the daily activities of the collection and transportation program and be responsible for dissemination of such information.  This does not include the gathering or use of fishery information for management of fish stocks, hatchery or wild, within the waters of the state or for the setting of management criteria therein.  Copies of all information collected by the Contractor shall be provided to the Corps biologist at each project.<BR><BR>	h.  Ice Harbor Fish Condition Sampling.

<DESC><p>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) Radiation and Indoor Environments (R&amp;IE) intends to award a sole source fixed-price Purchase Order using Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, to Rad Elec Inc. of Frederick, Maryland, under the authority of FAR Part 6.302-1. The purpose of this acquisition is to acquire an AlphaPM continuous radon progeny monitor that is able to integrate seamlessly into the laboratory's existing AlphaGuard continuous radon gas monitoring systems. This integration involves the ability to use the proprietary database software that is used to interrogate data from the monitor and process this data in a PC. Furthermore, as part of R&amp;IE integration requirements, the samplers need to utilize flow through, ionizations chambers and ruggadized bodies in order to assure that quality assurance system needs are maintained. The ionization chambers allow for alpha spectrometric analyses with a 5 cpm sensitivity at 4 pCi/L. It has been determined that Rad Elec, Inc. is the sole United States vendor of the AlphaPM continuous radon progeny monitor. NO SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR QUOTE [RFQ] IS AVAILABLE. Notwithstanding, any firm who believes it is capable of meeting EPA's requirement as stated herein may submit a response which, if received within 15 calendar days of the date of this announcement, will be considered.

<p>Abstracts should contain in sufficient detail to enable the Government to determine whether the technical concept and/or capabilities should be reflected in a future BAA.</p>
<p>3.3 SYNOPSIS</p>
<p>Submission of an abstract is voluntary and is not required to propose to subsequent Broad Agency Announcements (if any) on this topic. Respondents are advised that AFRL is under no obligation to provide feedback with respect to any information submitted under this RFI.</p>
<p>4.0 TECHNICAL BACKGROUND:</p>
<p>The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has seven key technology areas called Core Technical Competencies (CTCs). Information Fusion and Understanding (IFU) is one of the seven CTCs. The Information and Fusion CTC is defined as the continuous process that provides world-wide situational awareness in order to enable decision superiority. Activities include research, development, integration and testing of innovative technologies that enable continuous assessment of global conditions and events; that establish and maintain battlespace situational awareness, including an understanding of adversarial capabilities and intent; and that locate, identify, and track red, blue, green, and gray forces anywhere, anytime in near real-time.</p>
<p>4.1 SUB-IFU CTCs</p>
<p>Within the IFU CTC there are a number of technology focus areas being addressed. This RFI is seeking ideas addressing four specific areas under the IFU umbrella. These include Reasoning &amp; Learning, Link and Group Discovery, Advanced Analysis, and Space Situation Awareness. Descriptions of these areas follow.</p>
<p>4.1.1 Reasoning and Learning</p>
<p>The goal of the Reasoning and Learning area is to research and develop technologies to enable computer systems that can reason, learn from experience, be told what to do, explain what they are doing, reflect on their experience, and respond robustly to surprise. Specific areas of interest under this RFI include but are not limited to:</p>
<p>Learning and Reasoning in the Large</p>
<p>The problems of information fusion, planning to gather information, inferring the intentions (plans, activities) of friends and enemies, and deciding how to behave to achieve goals are fundamental questions in AI research right now. In the very simplest of cases (when there are just a few states of the world), we know how to solve them exactly.</p>
<p>But the problems that we are talking about below are on a huge scale: data is highly multi-modal and high volume; there are large numbers (unboundedly many, in fact) of individuals (trucks, units, sensors, missions, soldiers, aircraft, etc) and the time scales at which the activity recognition and planning must be done are long (potentially years, in the case of gathering intelligence about terrorist networks).</p>
<p>So, the crucial technical emphasis has to be on solving huge problem instances by finding decompositions of the problem or special cases that can be solved efficiently. It may be that after applying certain decompositions, it will no longer be able to get the optimal answer. Our goal is to get the best answers we can under potentially severe time constraints. "Learning and Reasoning in the Large" refers to large amounts of data, large underlying world domain and large time scales.</p>
<p>Reasoning and data mining</p>
<p>A significant opportunity in gathering, extracting, integrating and fusing all of this related information is the ability to then perform various types of reasoning or data mining over the data to make new inferences. For example, in previous work, some initial techniques were developed for exploiting telephone books to identify buildings in imagery. This is done by using constraint satisfaction techniques to determine the possible labels for buildings in an image. However, to make these techniques work on real-world data actually requires the combination of the various steps. First, we need to extract the locations of the buildings in an image, which could be done using infrared data. Next, we need to know the names of the streets that the buildings are located on, which might be extracted from maps. Finally, we can then do the constraint reasoning to determine the mapping between the phone book entries and the buildings in the image. Similarly, we would also like to have a general set of data mining techniques that can identify patterns or relationships in the data. More generally, we need to develop a library of these techniques that can be applied over different data sources and in different situations.</p>
<p>Temporal Entity Databases</p>
<p>Recent advances in information extraction have made it possible to extract and collect facts about named entities, such as companies, persons, and locations. This presents an opportunity for automating the collection of information. However, current technology is often insufficient for compiling this information into a coherent "story". The main problem in accurately aggregating and integrating information from multiple sources is the broad range of inferences required. For instance, entity resolution is typically required when collecting facts about entities from multiple information sources. Entity resolution refers to the process of determining whether or not two facts refer to the same entity or not. For example, one fact may refer to "John Smith" the "Chief Marketing Officer" of "Acme Corp." while another fact may refer to "Mr. J. Smith" the "CMO" of "Acme Products, Inc.". Entity resolution involves determining whether these two facts refer to the same individual and company. Machine learning and inference techniques have recently been developed so that rules do not need to be hand coded for entity-resolution systems. However, the entity resolution problem is compounded when information changes over time, such as when John Smith gets promoted to CEO, or Acme Corporation is acquired by another company. Existing machine learning techniques will not work in such cases. In general, research is needed on methods that intertwine learning and reasoning.</p>
<p>The focus of this topic is designing and developing an approach for aggregating information about entities over time. The system must be able to actually resolve references to the same entity, even when that information is changing over time. In particular, new approaches must be developed where temporal reasoning can be accommodated as part of the learning process.</p>
<p>Automatically Harvesting Information about Networks<br />Social networks are often used to model, or map, relationships between entities (such as people, companies, as well as more complex phenomenon such as disease transmission or airline routes. To operate, these analysis techniques require that the data be represented as a graph -- a set of nodes tied by one or more specific types of interdependency. In many cases, the data required to create the social network is not explicitly available, but must be acquired by extracting and integrating data from a host of different sources. This topic explores automated techniques for learning, or inferring, the structure of a network based on information that is available from multiple sources.</p>
<p><br />Challenges include <br />&bull; Information Extraction: extracting relevant information from structured, semi structured and unstructured sources<br />&bull; Data Normalization and Cleaning: converting facts harvested from different sources into a source independent format <br />&bull; Entity Resolution: determining if two facts refer to the same entity<br />&bull; Information Integration: converting facts into nodes and links that can be incorporated into the social network, handling errors and inconsistencies, and deleting nodes and links based on new data.<br />4.1.2 Link and Group Discovery (LGD)</p>
<p>This area is focused on techniques for analyzing large collections of data to discover valuable knowledge that may be present as hidden patterns or links among seemingly unrelated items. LGD will discover the hidden structure of organizations, relate groups, identify fraudulent behavior, model group activity, connect bits of information into patterns that can be evaluated and analyzed, learn what patterns discriminate between legitimate and suspicious behavior, and provide early detection of emerging threats. Specific areas of interest under this RFI include, but are not limited to the following areas.</p>
<p>Dynamic Networks Over Time<br />Most networks of entities and relationships change over time. Computers connect and disconnect from the internet. Web pages and hyperlinks appear and disappear from the worldwide web. People enter and leave social networks. Leaders emerge and then disappear. Many approaches have been developed to detect patterns in static snapshots of these networks, but discovering patterns in the dynamics of these networks can provide new understanding of how they evolve and new ways to categorize networks based on their dynamics.</p>
<p><br />There is growing evidence that networks influence both individual and collective group activity. Networks play a key role in determining how information is disseminated and how organizations evolve (e.g., how new members are recruited and how they leave). Additionally, these networks have a significant impact on the choices an individual makes. These observations apply not only to social, but also to geospatial, information and technological networks. Despite growing interest in social network analysis (SNA) and related fields, our understanding of how these networks influence individuals and groups is still very limited. There is no general methodology for combining the effect of multiple, heterogeneous networks within a single model. In other words, there is a large knowledge gap in the mathematical methods and formalisms for modeling dynamic networks and their influence on the individual and group dynamics. Some of the outstanding problems in social network analysis are how to combine different sources of evidence, how to include patio-temporal data, and how the community structure changes over time.</p>
<p><br />We seek to expand various aspects of social network modeling. Existing techniques emphasize static models. We need to be able to handle dynamic models that account for relationships/friendships drifting over time. We need to make it tractable to learn such models from data, even as the number of entities gets large. We seek to develop metrics to assess and identify change within and across networks and develop techniques to determine whether differences observed over time in networks are due to simply different samples from a distribution of links and nodes or due to changes over time in the underlying distribution of links and nodes. We would like to ultimately be able to understand the entire problem space well enough to predict/forecast change in existing networks. In addition, to accurately combine information from multiple sources, we need to address ways to manage the pedigree of the information.</p>
<p>Abnormality Detection in Counter Terrorism Evidence<br />Anomaly detection looks for entities whose characteristics, behaviors or connections to other individuals are in some way abnormal. Since we usually do not have a particular pattern of abnormality available to look for, we need to somehow derive from data what is normal and then identify who deviates most from that. Often it is the combination of several seemingly normal things that is abnormal.</p>
<p>Much of the evidence we have today consists of networks of entities and their interrelationships, yet most approaches for detecting abnormalities in this evidence consider only the attributes of the entities, or focus on the presence or absence of specific relationships, without considering the context of the abnormality. For example, in the case of fraud, the perpetrator attempts to mimic normal behavior in order to avoid detection. That is, abnormality only makes sense in the context of what is normal. In the case of networks, normal behavior can be represented by recurring normative patterns in the structure of the network, and abnormalities can be defined as unexpected deviations to these normative patterns, not just unexpected deviations within the network as a whole. In addition to methods for detecting outlier attributes and relationships, we also need methods for detecting anomalies to the prevalent, normal behavior reflected in the transactions among entities in the domain of interest. Such methods will provide several benefits, including the description of abnormalities within the context of the normal behavior they defy and the ability to detect these abnormalities without prior training in possible abnormalities; thus, providing the ability to detect previously unforeseen abnormalities. Combining these methods with the above methods on detecting patterns in dynamic networks will provide the ability to detect anomalies in both the structure and the dynamics of networks.<br />Single anomalies are often the result of noise, data mistakes, or other one-time-only phenomena and do not have significant practical interest. Instead we may want to find a collection of records that are each anomalous but have some pattern of self-similarity that make them indicative of a larger event. For example, a single strange case in the hospital emergency department is probably nothing more than that, but several of these across a city are indicative of a disease outbreak, or potential malicious activity. We need to extend traditional anomaly detection methods to link data to find linked groups of anomalous records. This will identify linked groups of individuals engaged in anomalous activity even if none are previously known to be dangerous or the method of attack they are pursuing is novel. We need to develop new efficient methods to scale this up to millions of links.<br />Many times there are simply too many unique or rare events to make it useful to identify them all (not to mention having to determine how rare an event needs to be before it is reported). Sherlock Holmes stories typically see the detective observe a multitude of things that seem perfectly ordinary until he puts their significance together to solve the crime. So, we need be to recognize situations of potential interest, and to tell a story that explains why the situations are of potential interest, without those situations having been predefined in detail. What may be needed is some model of relevancy. An abnormality that can be explained away through a simple non-threatening story should probably not be reported. Conversely, an abnormality that cannot be easily explained with a non-threatening story, or that conjure up threatening or opportunistic stories should be reported (e.g., you come home and find a human finger, or $50,000, on the kitchen floor). So, we should be able to recognize situations of potential interest, and to tell a story that explains why the situations are of potential interest, without those situations having been predefined in detail.</p>
<p>4.1.3 Advanced Analysis</p>
<p>The objective of the Advanced Analysis (A2) area is to lead the development of an integrated, service-based, interactive environment of tacit collaboration. The current model for information analysis is limited since it consists of client/server based systems supporting individual repository/database access and queries. The need for more complete informational awareness reveals the flaws of this system. The diversity of analytical tasks and approaches means that difficulty of solving this problem is in the understanding of user tasks, how to assist them in performing the tasks and retaining their analytical context. This process must be improved by understanding the value of available information, assessing the user needs/requirements and tracking user activity.</p>
<p>To accomplish this there needs to be a better understanding of the three key components of an information system - information, user and actions. This understanding must be based on correlation of four aspects of analysis: relevance, novelty, credibility and persuasiveness. As an example, intelligence analysis is a complex and intensive process that requires analysts to make use of large data sets. The analyst must capture, identify and understand higher level knowledge that is constructed from that data. This is done in order to formulate, evaluate, and defend hypothesis against all other possible explanations. Adding a weak collaborative aspect to this process may only serve to increase the complexity of the problem. Instead this automated collaboration must provide relevant and/or novel information sharing. It must be tacit collaboration.</p>
<p>With these issues in mind, the goal of the A2 area is to focus on the needs of the information analyst by effectively modeling their tasks, processes and datasets. This will enable the development of an integrated "end-to-end" machine assistant that can facilitate information sharing with an automated real time discovery and delivery of relevant information. Such a capability will allow users to individually and collaboratively produce more deeply reasoned analytical results in less time. Users will increase their productivity with the automated parts of information gathering allowing more time for their analysis. Additionally tacit collaboration will help them to discover the unknowns related to analytic context, identify meaningful collaborators and knowledge sources, produce a searchable corporate memory and provide enhanced support in performing risk analysis, developing option sets and creating deeper hypothesis and report analysis.</p>
<p>Primary research areas of interest under A2 include, but are not limited to, Analysis Monitoring, Information Sharing, and Analysis Integration. The focus of Analysis Monitoring is modeling the needs and requirements of each user (which can vary with job operations) and how those requirements interact with the machines' understanding of the user needs. Information sharing research is developing techniques to help a user discover information that he/she does not even know is required and ensuring that the content is relevant and/or novel. Information Sharing also includes developing the means to accurately identify other users holding relevant knowledge to further collective intelligence capabilities. The focus of Analysis Integration is in the development of a system that leverages the best of breed capabilities while minimizing coordination costs and enhancing analytic tradecraft.</p>
<p>The goal of the research is to address Air Force needs through the transition of effective user-focused collaboration technologies. These transitions will be applications and techniques that advance tacit collaboration within dedicated Air Force operations (e.g. Air Operations Centers (AOC), National Air and Space Intelligence Center (NASIC), Air Force Intelligence Analysis Agency (AFIAA)); Joint operations (e.g. US Central Command (CENTCOM)); coalition forces (e.g. North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)) and with various government agencies (e.g. Homeland Security, Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA))</p>
<p>4.1.4 Advanced INTEL for Space Situation Awareness</p>
<p>Request information on new techniques for adversary modeling, anticipatory threat modeling, and early warning tripwire alerting of emerging counter-space adversary threats that could execute multiple coordinated attacks against multiple DoD (Department of Defense) and commercial space assets. Counter-space threats include non-kinetic (laser dazzling, RF Jamming, Cyber attack against satellite command &amp; control ground stations, etc.) and kinetic: (Direct Assent Anti-Satellite Ballistic Missile (DA-ASAT) or Co-Orbital ASAT kinetic kill vehicle (KKV) in Low Earth Orbits (LEO), Medium Earth Orbits (MEO), Geostationary Orbits (GEO)) that could be executed by multiple adversaries through simultaneous, coordinated attacks against multiple satellites in the constellation (eg, could be DA-ASAT attack against Satellite A by country A teamed with country B who is concurrently attacking Satellite B by Laser dazzling &amp; RF Jamming). Request information on techniques for space asset attack assessment which indicate the probability and type of space asset attacks, which coalition (air, ground, maritime, cyber) assets are vulnerable, the vulnerability periods, and confidence levels associated with the assessment. Dynamic adversary modeling and alerting techniques are needed to provide Joint Air and Space Operations Center (JSpOC) operators with advanced warning so that there is sufficient time for Defensive Counterspace actions to be able to be executed successfully. Request information on automated rule learning algorithms to adapt adversary patterns to evolving threats and changing adversary tactics, and tune detection and false alarm rates to optimize indications and warning (I&amp;W) tools for JSpOC operators. Request information on adaptive computational approaches to fuse temporal I&amp;W information from diverse ISR and foundational INTEL sources for timely situation awareness and allow analysts speculative what-if reasoning (i.e., what are expected to observe given a threat) that addresses uncertainty in the I&amp;W data stream and incomplete ISR/INTEL data sets. Request information on new techniques to model the in-theater impact of space asset degradation effects that concern Joint Force Component Commanders including linkage of space asset degradation to coalition (air, ground, maritime, and cyber) operations to ensure unhindered integrated Command and Control (C2) of coalition forces.</p>

<DESC><p>The Columbia River Inter-Tribal Fish Commission (CRITFC) is accepting proposals from CPA firms to provide audit services for our organization. We invite your firm to submit a proposal to us by 5pm on November 26, 2008, for consideration.
<p>The CRITFC is seeking Requests For Quotations (RFQ) from audit firms as part of its processes to periodically review services and to ensure expenses are reasonable and aligned with industry standards. The CRITFC is required to have a yearly audit performed in accordance with the Single Audit Act Amendments of 1996, as implemented by OMB Circular A-133, "Audits of States, Local Governments, and Non-profit Organizations". The copy of the audit is submitted to the Federal Audit Clearinghouse, which has been designated by OMB as the central clearinghouse. The term of the engagement is three years with a yearly renewal option. Work will not commence until 2009.</p>
<p>The remainder of this document will be structured as follows:<br />1. Background of the Columbia River Inter-Tribal Fish Commission;<br />2. Services to be Performed and Audit Objectives;<br />3. Key Personnel;<br />4. Your Response to This Request For Quotation;<br />5. Relationship With Prior CPA Service Provider;<br />6. Evaluation of Proposals;<br />7. Mailing Address &amp; Contact Information Regarding RFQ.</p>
<p>1. Background of the Columbia River Inter-Tribal Fish Commission<br />In 1977, four Columbia River treaty tribes- the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation, the Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs, the Nez Perce Tribe, and the Yakama Nation, formed the Columbia River Inter-Tribal Fish Commission (CRITFC) to ensure a unified voice in the overall management of the fishery resources, and as managers, to protect reserved treaty rights through the exercise of inherent sovereign powers of the tribes. The organization conducts business through one joint decision-making body- the "Commission", which is made up of the respective tribe's fish and wildlife representatives, and operates on a consensus basis. The tribe's authorities for its actions include reserved treaty rights in the Columbia Basin, statutes, case law, and derivative documents such as The Pacific Salmon Treaty, In-Lieu Sites legislation, etc. Coordination with each tribe's respective fisheries management helps keep CRITFC aligned with tribal programs. CRITFC is the only existing organization which represents these tribes in treaty fishery related matters and has been a cornerstone for many successes in the restoration of salmon and the protection of treaty rights.</p>
<p>The organization employs a total of approximately 76 employees, with its headquarters located in Portland, Oregon. It also operates a law enforcement department in Hood River OR (18 employees), and has satellite offices at the Haggerman Laboratory (3 employees), near Boise, ID, and in The Dalles, OR (5 employees). The CRITFC manages approximately 60 grants and contracts, which originate from a variety of sources, including the U.S Department of Interior (Bureau of Indian Affairs) U.S. Department of Energy (Bonneville Power Administration), U.S. Department of Justice (COPS Program), U.S. Department of Commerce (NOAA), to name a few. The organizational expenditures approximated $11.3 million for 2007. In 2008, the CRITFC entered into a 10 year MOA Annex with the Bonneville Power Administration which is projected to add between $7- $9 million per year to the expenditures of the CRITFC.</p>
<p>The organization operates on a calendar year, with a requirement to file the audited financial statements with the Federal Audit Clearinghouse as soon as the audited financial statements are available, or at the latest by September 30, of each respective year. The CY2008 audited financial statements will be required to be complete by June 30, 2009 and reviewed with the Commission in July 2009.<br /><br />2.

Management's discussion and analysis.<br />2. Schedule of expenditures of federal awards (A 1-33 Report).<br />3. Combining and individual fund financial statements.</p>
<p>The objective of the audit is the expression of an opinion as to whether the CRITFC's financial statements are fairly presented, in all material respects, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and to report on the fairness of the additional information referred to above when considered in relation to the financial statements taken as a whole. The objective also includes reporting on:<br />&bull; Internal control related to the financial statements and compliance with laws, regulations, and the provisions of contracts or grant agreements, noncompliance with, which could have a material effect on the financial statements in accordance with Government Auditing Standards.</p>
<p>&bull; Internal control related to major programs and an opinion (or disclaimer of opinion) on compliance with laws, regulations, and the provisions of contracts or grant agreements that could have a direct and material effect on each major program in accordance with the Single Audit Act Amendments of 1996 and OMB Circular A-133, Audits of States, Local Governments, and Non-Profit Organizations.</p>
<p>The audit will be conducted in accordance with U.S. generally accepted auditing standards; the standards for financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards, issued by the Comptroller General of the United States; the Single Audit Act Amendments of 1996; and the provisions of OMB Circular A-133; and will include tests of accounting records, a determination of major programs in accordance with Circular A-133, and other procedures necessary to enable the expression of an opinion and to render the required reports.</p>
<p>At the conclusion of the engagement, the audit firm will complete the appropriate sections of and sign the Data Collection Form that summarizes any audit findings. An original and print-ready master of the reports will be provided to CRITFC at the conclusion of the engagement, and the audit firm will provide information to management as to where the reporting packages should be submitted and the number to submit.</p>
<p>The following is a timeline of audit activities to be completed:<br />April 10, 2009: Complete audit field work.<br />May 31, 2009: Draft audited Financial Statements are provided to CRITFC staff for review.<br />June 30, 2009: Issue Final Reports.<br />July 16-17, 2009: Provide review to the Commission.</p>

<p>DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, FEDERAL BUREAU OF PRISONS,</p>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">
<p>JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION</p>
</span></strong></p>
<p>Pursuant to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 6.302-1(a)(1) and 6.302-1(a)(2) and the Bureau of Prisons Acquisition Policy Subpart 6.304(b), the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) has determined the use of other than full and open competitive procedures is justified for this procurement action. The following is supporting documentation in accordance with FAR Subpart 6.303-2 (Content).</p>
<p>1. <strong>Contracting Agency </strong>- United States Department of Justice, Federal Bureau of Prisons, Central Office, Administration Division, Acquisitions Branch, National Acquisitions Section.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Description of Action</strong> - Information, Policy and Public Affairs Division, Office of Information Systems has a requirement for annual software maintenance services for Tetragon Limited Liability Corporation (LLC) Intercomm Teleprocessing Monitor software. The Intercomm software directs and controls all transactions and terminal access to the BOP SENTRY System.</p>
<p>3. <strong>Description of Supplies and Services Required to Meet the Agency's Needs</strong>: Inclusive of the Estimated Value - The BOP requires the annual software maintenance services for the Intercomm Teleprocessing Monitor. The software maintenance services includes: a. All new software releases; b. System updates; c. Program Temporary Fixes (PTFs); d. Twenty-four hours per day, seven days per week for system software assistance. The estimated value of the annual software maintenance is $114,660.00.</p>
<p>4. <strong>Statutory Authority Substantiating this Action: </strong>FAR 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements - (1) Citations:</p>
<p>41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1).</p>
<p>5. <strong>Reason for Authority Cited</strong>: The BOP requires maintenance and support for the Intercomm Teleprocessing Monitoring which controls the functions and abilities of the SENTRY system. Intercomm is a mainframe telecommunications transaction processing system, which directs and controls all transactions and terminal access to the BOP SENTRY system. The SENTRY system is an ongoing, steady-state, legacy system with development and enhancements done by BOP staff. SENTRY fully supports the BOP's business operations, which include inmate population monitoring, sentence monitoring, designations, central inmate monitoring, administrative remedy system, inmate discipline, and financial responsibility. Without the maintenance of the Intercomm Teleprocessing Monitor, online access to the SENTRY database will cease to exist. The agency's need for the services listed above can only be provided by one source. Tetragon owns the propriety rights to this software. The services required are not available from other sources.</p>
<p>6. <strong>Efforts to Obtain Competition</strong>: Tetragon LLC is the sole manufacturer and distributer of the software and has not granted reseller authority to any other vendors. Therefore, Tetragon LLC is the only source able to provide the maintenance and support services being requested.</p>
<p>7. <strong>Contracting Officer's Fair and Reasonable Cost Determination</strong>: A review of Tetragon LLC's open market product price schedule was completed by the contracting officer. Based on the price schedule, the price being offered by Tetragon for the service required by the BOP is approximately 55% below the established market pricing and is acceptable to the Government. In addition, historical procurement data supports the fact that software maintenance and support fees generally run 15-25 percent of the manufacturer's suggested retail price of the software. In this instance the price being offered for the maintenance and support services are lower than the standard percentage when compared to the market price of the software. Based on the data examined by the contracting officer, the contracting officer has determined the price offered by Tetragon is fair and reasonable.</p>
<p>8. <strong>Market Research: </strong>A combined synopsis solicitation will be published in the Federal Business Opportunities website at <a href="http://www.fedbizopps.gov,/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">www.fedbizopps.gov,</span></a> which will offer notice of the BOP's intent to award a contract on a sole source basis to Tetragon LLC and requested quotations from interested parties.</p>
<p>9. <strong>Other Factors</strong>: The services and maintenance/support is required to maintain the Intercomm Teleprocessing Monitor which incorporates the SENTRY system. Lack of maintenance for this system would be detrimental to the BOP, as the SENTRY system controls and directs many phases of transactions and interactions within the BOP concerning inmates. Tetragon LLC owns the proprietary rights to the Intercomm Teleprocessing Monitoring software.</p>
<p>10. <strong>List of Sources</strong>: Tetragon LLC, 57 Ira Road, Syosset,</p>
<p>New York 11791-3504</p>
<p>11. <strong>Action to be Taken to Promote Future Competition</strong>: The BOP will continue to conduct market research and make efforts to obtain competition for future acquisitions when applicable.</p>
<p>12. Technical Certification - I certify that the supporting data under my cognizance which are included in this Limited Source Justification are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief. //s// Andrew Ellis, Chief, Network Management</p>
<p>13. Requirements Certification - I certify that the supporting data under my cognizance which are included in this Limited Source Justification are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief. //s// Earl Franks, Chief, Information Technology, Planning and Administration</p>
<p>14. Contracting Officer's Certification - I hereby certify that this request for Limited Source Justification is made in good faith, that the supporting data and information are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.</p>
<p>//s// P. A. Donahue-Ormandy, Senior Contract Specialist, National Acquisition Section</p>
<p>15. Concurrence - I certify that the above justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief. //s// Jan R. Johns, Chief, National Acquisitions Section, //s// Matthew D. Nace, Chief, Acquisitions Branch, //s// W.F. Dalius Jr., Assistant Director For Administration</p>
<p>16. Approval - //s// Darlene Ely, Procurement Executive</p>

STATEMENT OF WORK --  CONTRACT ROLE PLAYER SERVICES -- ADVANCED ADMISSIBILITY SECONDARY PROCESSING (AASP)  --  ENFORCEMENT OFFICER TRAINING PROGRAM (EOTP)  
The U.S. Customs and Border Protection, (CBP) Advanced Training Center, (ATC) Harpers Ferry, West Virginia requires contract role-player services in support of training delivery for course offerings conducted at the Center for a Base year period of December 1, 2008 through November 30, 2009, plus four (4) one year renewal options through November 30, 2013. 
A.  SCOPE
1.  Role-player services will be provided on a reoccurring basis to multiple classes on a prearranged schedule as supplied by CBP to the contractor.  At a minimum role players will be used to support the Advanced Admissibility Secondary Processing (AASP) Course and the Enforcement Officer Training Program (EOTP) conducted during the specified contract period.
2. The AASP course requires up to twelve (12) role-players x eight (8) hours per class.  It is estimated that approximately 22 classes will be conducted in a FY = 1,728 hours.  Schedules will be provided to the contractor at least one quarter in advance. The number of hours is subject to change due to National security reprioritizing of CBP mission requirements and may entail discontinuation or reduction in training which may change the number of classes without notice.  In the event it is necessary to reprioritize and reduce the number f role players required or cancel a scheduled class, for other than weather or immediate national emergency response, the CBP Contracting Officer Technical Representative shall provide a 48 hour written cancellation notice to the contractor.  However, if the cancellation is weather or national emergency response related, a 48 hour notification cannot be guaranteed.   
  3.  The EOTP course requires up to two (2) role-players x sixteen (16) hours per class.  This is estimated at four, 4-hour blocks.  It is estimated that there will be up to nine classes in a FY=288 hours. Schedules will be provided to the contractor at least one quarter in advance. In the event it is necessary to reprioritize and reduce the number of role players required or cancel a scheduled class, for other than weather or immediate national emergency response, the CBP Contracting Officer Technical Representative shall provide a 48 hour written cancellation notice to the contractor.  However, if the cancellation is weather or national emergency response related, a 48 hour notification cannot be guaranteed.  
 Classes for AASP and EOTP are conducted Monday through Friday between the ATC core hours of 7:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m.  The specific days and eight or four  hour blocks of time the role-players will be needed are dependent upon the  overall class schedule start and finish dates.   Schedules will be provided one quarter in advance to the contractor, identifying times and dates role-playing  services are required. 
B.   ROLE PLAYER DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES
The role-players for the academic AASP and EOTP classes will perform a variety of roles related to Title 8 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) as material witnesses and defendants and as individuals making application for entry to the United States.
For AASP and EOTP role-playing, the scripted roles and information made available to role-players during the conduct of the practical exercise is not considered law enforcement sensitive and is consistent with that information made available to the traveling public.  
In the event a role-player is needed for a scenario that is law-enforcement sensitive, prior coordination will be made with the contractor for role-players with previous law-enforcement experience.  Physical contact for other than academic role-playing will be no more than handcuffing and physical search.  
Role-players must be U.S. citizens, 18 years of age or older.
Contractor personnel who will report to the ATC and serve as Role-players are required to have completed NATIONAL AGENCY CHECK (NACI) ensuring their suitability for the duties required and access to the Advanced Training Center, a secure facility.  The NACI allows the assigned personnel to have unescorted access to the ATC.
6.   Prior role-player experience is not required    
Any scripts or external props and resources necessary to conduct the practical exercise will be provided by the ATC.
An appropriate dress code for the role-players will be coordinated between CBP and the contractor.  CBP reserves the right to reject a role-player for inappropriate dress, actions or other articulable reasons.
A lead role-player will be assigned to ensure an adequate number of role-players are present.   Lead role players will ensure a sign-in and sign-out sheet is utilized and that all role-players remain at the designated practical exercise area until the responsible officer has signed the roster and been afforded the opportunity to provide comments, if any, in the space provided.
A roster of the role-players reporting for each practical exercise shall be provided to the Contracting Officers Technical Representative (COTR) for verification and certification of invoices submitted for processing.
11.  Abide by Customs and Border Protection, Advanced Training Center guidelines for classroom management, integrity and fraternization.
12.  All vendor employees having access to the content of the training, will be asked to sign the Confidentiality Agreement provided by the vendor.
C.   SECURITY REQUIREMENTS
1.  The Contractor must conduct Employment Eligibility Verification by requiring applicants to show their U.S. Passport OR a combination of a valid state drivers license AND an original social security card or birth certification (with seal).
Each role-player assigned to work on and within the scope of this purchase order will be required to satisfactorily complete and pass a NACI with the Office of Personnel Management proof of completed background must be supplied to CBP for verification. CBP reserves the right to conduct their own backgrounds checks (no persons with a felony or misdemeanors in the last 8 years will be allowed access).
Contract employees are required to give, and to authorize others to give, full, frank and truthful answers to relevant and material questions needed to reach a suitability determination.  Refusal or failure to furnish or authorize provision of information may constitute grounds for denial or revocation of credentials. 
SCA Wage Determination No.: 2005-3017, Revision No.: 6, Date Of Revision: 05/29/2008 is in effect on this solicitation.

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>SECTION M - EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">M.1 BASIS FOR AWARD</span><br />The basis of award will be a determination of best value by the contracting officer.</p>
<p>The Government possesses the option to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with offeror (except clarifications as described in FAR&nbsp;15.306(a)). Therefore, the offeror's initial proposal should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer determines them to be necessary.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">M.2 EVALUATION FACTORS</span><br />Determination of best value will be based on trade offs between the following evaluation factors in descending order of importance: <span style="text-decoration: underline;">technical characteristics, price, and contractor's past performance.</span>&nbsp; Award will be made to the offer that is most advantageous to the government, price and other actors considered. Offerors must possess expertise in audio visual integration services.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">M.3 PRICE PROPOSAL EVALUATION</span><br />The Government will evaluate pricing to determine if overall prices are fair and reasonable. The contracting officer's best value award decision permits trade-offs between price and non-price factors and allows the Government to accept other than the lowest priced proposal.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">M.4 TECHNICAL EVALUATION</span><br />The Government's technical evaluation will include, but is not limited to, the following:<br />A.) Compliance of offered equipment with the technical requirements stated in Section C of this Request for Quote.<br />B.) Overall understanding of requirement.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">M.5 PAST PERFORMANCE EVALUATION</span><br />The purpose of past performance evaluation is to allow the government to assess the offeror's ability to perform the effort described in this RFQ.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Offeror is to provide a list of no more than three of the most relevant projects performed for federal agencies and/or commercial customers within the last three years.</span> Relevant projects include performance of efforts involving projects of similar scope, magnitude, and complexity as the effort described in this solicitation.</p>
<p>Project information to include:<br />&middot; Company/Division name<br />&middot; Product/Service<br />&middot; Contracting Agency/Customer<br />&middot; Contract or Project Number<br />&middot; Contract or Project Dollar Value<br />&middot; Period of Performance<br />&middot; Verified, up-to-date name, address, E-mail address &amp; telephone number of your customer's project manager (if applicable)<br />&middot; Paragraph summary of the project's requirement</p>
<p>Offeror is to provide information available (letters, metrics, customer surveys, independent surveys, etc.) which demonstrates customer satisfaction with overall job performance. Include an explanation of corrective actions taken in the past, if any, for substandard performance; any performance problems such as cost overruns, extended performance periods, numerous warranty calls, etc.; and/or performance not in accordance with the project terms and conditions.</p>
<p>Past performance will also be evaluated based on quality and timeliness of deliverables.</p>
<p>The government will use information submitted by the offeror, the government's own experiences with your firm, other federal government offices, and commercial sources to assess performance.</p>

<p><br />________________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p><br />ALL OCCUPATIONS LISTED ABOVE RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING BENEFITS:</p>
<p>HEALTH &amp; WELFARE: $3.24 per hour or $129.60 per week or $561.60 per month</p>
<p>VACATION: 2 weeks paid vacation after 1 year of service with a contractor or<br />successor; 3 weeks after 5 years, and 4 weeks after 15 years. Length of service<br />includes the whole span of continuous service with the present contractor or<br />successor, wherever employed, and with the predecessor contractors in the<br />performance of similar work at the same Federal facility. (Reg. 29 CFR 4.173)</p>
<p>HOLIDAYS: A minimum of ten paid holidays per year, New Year's Day, Martin Luther<br />King Jr's Birthday, Washington's Birthday, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor<br />Day, Columbus Day, Veterans' Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day. (A<br />contractor may substitute for any of the named holidays another day off with pay in<br />accordance with a plan communicated to the employees involved.) (See 29 CFR 4174)</p>
<p>THE OCCUPATIONS WHICH HAVE PARENTHESES AFTER THEM RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING BENEFITS (as<br />numbered):</p>
<p>1) COMPUTER EMPLOYEES: Under the SCA at section 8(b), this wage determination does<br />not apply to any employee who individually qualifies as a bona fide executive,<br />administrative, or professional employee as defined in 29 C.F.R. Part 541. Because<br />most Computer System Analysts and Computer Programmers who are compensated at a rate<br />not less than $27.63 (or on a salary or fee basis at a rate not less than $455 per<br />week) an hour would likely qualify as exempt computer professionals, (29 C.F.R.<br />541.400) wage rates may not be listed on this wage determination for all occupations<br />within those job families. In addition, because this wage determination may not<br />list a wage rate for some or all occupations within those job families if the survey<br />data indicates that the prevailing wage rate for the occupation equals or exceeds<br />$27.63 per hour conformances may be necessary for certain nonexempt employees. For<br />example, if an individual employee is nonexempt but nevertheless performs duties<br />within the scope of one of the Computer Systems Analyst or Computer Programmer<br />occupations for which this wage determination does not specify an SCA wage rate,<br />then the wage rate for that employee must be conformed in accordance with the<br />conformance procedures described in the conformance note included on this wage<br />determination.</p>
<p>Additionally, because job titles vary widely and change quickly in the computer<br />industry, job titles are not determinative of the application of the computer<br />professional exemption. Therefore, the exemption applies only to computer employees<br />who satisfy the compensation requirements and whose primary duty consists of:<br />(1) The application of systems analysis techniques and procedures, including<br />consulting with users, to determine hardware, software or system functional<br />specifications;<br />(2) The design, development, documentation, analysis, creation, testing or<br />modification of computer systems or programs, including prototypes, based on and<br />related to user or system design specifications;<br />(3) The design, documentation, testing, creation or modification of computer<br />programs related to machine operating systems; or<br />(4) A combination of the aforementioned duties, the performance of which<br />requires the same level of skills. (29 C.F.R. 541.400).</p>
<p>2) AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS AND WEATHER OBSERVERS - NIGHT PAY &amp; SUNDAY PAY: If you<br />work at night as part of a regular tour of duty, you will earn a night differential<br />and receive an additional 10% of basic pay for any hours worked between 6pm and 6am.<br />If you are a full-time employed (40 hours a week) and Sunday is part of your<br />regularly scheduled workweek, you are paid at your rate of basic pay plus a Sunday<br />premium of 25% of your basic rate for each hour of Sunday work which is not overtime<br />(i.e. occasional work on Sunday outside the normal tour of duty is considered<br />overtime work).</p>
<p>HAZARDOUS PAY DIFFERENTIAL: An 8 percent differential is applicable to employees<br />employed in a position that represents a high degree of hazard when working with or<br />in close proximity to ordinance, explosives, and incendiary materials. This<br />includes work such as screening, blending, dying, mixing, and pressing of sensitive<br />ordnance, explosives, and pyrotechnic compositions such as lead azide, black powder<br />and photoflash powder. All dry-house activities involving propellants or<br />explosives. Demilitarization, modification, renovation, demolition, and maintenance<br />operations on sensitive ordnance, explosives and incendiary materials. All<br />operations involving regrading and cleaning of artillery ranges.</p>
<p>A 4 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that<br />represents a low degree of hazard when working with, or in close proximity to<br />ordnance, (or employees possibly adjacent to) explosives and incendiary materials<br />which involves potential injury such as laceration of hands, face, or arms of the<br />employee engaged in the operation, irritation of the skin, minor burns and the<br />like; minimal damage to immediate or adjacent work area or equipment being used.<br />All operations involving, unloading, storage, and hauling of ordnance, explosive, and<br />incendiary ordnance material other than small arms ammunition. These differentials<br />are only applicable to work that has been specifically designated by the agency for<br />ordnance, explosives, and incendiary material differential pay.</p>
<p>** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE **</p>
<p>If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract<br />(either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state or<br />local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by<br />laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by an<br />employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wage<br />determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the<br />following standards as compliance:</p>
<p>The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an<br />adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the actual<br />cost of the uniforms. In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made<br />the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors subject to<br />this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining<br />agreement providing for a different amount, or the furnishing of contrary<br />affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all employees for such cleaning<br />and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day). However, in<br />those instances where the uniforms furnished are made of "wash and wear"<br />materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments, and do<br />not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning, daily washing, or commercial<br />laundering in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms<br />of the Government contract, by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work,<br />there is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs.</p>
<p>REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE {Standard Form<br />1444 (SF 1444)}</p>
<p>Conformance Process:</p>
<p>The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which is<br />not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to<br />be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage<br />determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable<br />relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted<br />classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination. Such<br />conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished the<br />fringe benefits as are determined. Such conforming process shall be initiated by<br />the contractor prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted class(es)<br />of employees. The conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits shall<br />be retroactive to the commencement date of the contract. {See Section 4.6 (C)(vi)}<br />When multiple wage determinations are included in a contract, a separate SF 1444<br />should be prepared for each wage determination to which a class(es) is to be<br />conformed.</p>
<p>The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows:</p>
<p>1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed<br />occupation) and computes a proposed rate).</p>
<p>2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in order<br />proposed classification title), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for each<br />proposed classification), job description), and rationale for proposed wage<br />rate), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the<br />authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no authorized<br />representative, the employees themselves. This report should be submitted to the<br />contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of employees<br />performs any contract work.</p>
<p>3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report<br />of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent<br />information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the Wage<br />and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor,<br />for review. (See section 4.6(b)(2) of Regulations 29 CFR Part 4).</p>
<p>4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or<br />disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or<br />notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to process<br />the request.</p>
<p>5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour decision to the contractor.</p>
<p>6) The contractor informs the affected employees.</p>
<p>Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF 1444 or bond paper.</p>
<p>When preparing a conformance request, the "Service Contract Act Directory of<br />Occupations" (the Directory) should be used to compare job definitions to insure<br />that duties requested are not performed by a classification already listed in the<br />wage determination. Remember, it is not the job title, but the required tasks that<br />determine whether a class is included in an established wage determination.<br />Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or subdivide<br />classifications listed in the wage determination.</p>
<p>The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the<br />"Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations", Fifth Edition, April 2006,<br />unless otherwise indicated. Copies of the Directory are available on the Internet. A<br />links to the Directory may be found on the WHD home page at<br />http://www.dol.gov/esa/whd/ or through the Wage Determinations On-Line (WDOL) Web<br />site at http://wdol.gov/.</p>

<p>WAGE DETERMINATION APPEALS PROCESS</p>
<p>1.) Has there been an initial decision in the matter? This can<br />be:</p>
<p>* an existing published wage determination<br />* a survey underlying a wage determination<br />* a Wage and Hour Division letter setting forth a position on<br />a wage determination matter<br />* a conformance (additional classification and rate) ruling</p>
<p>On survey related matters, initial contact, including requests<br />for summaries of surveys, should be with the Wage and Hour<br />Regional Office for the area in which the survey was conducted<br />because those Regional Offices have responsibility for the<br />Davis-Bacon survey program. If the response from this initial<br />contact is not satisfactory, then the process described in 2.)<br />and 3.) should be followed.</p>
<p>With regard to any other matter not yet ripe for the formal<br />process described here, initial contact should be with the<br />Branch of Construction Wage Determinations. Write to:</p>
<p>Branch of Construction Wage Determinations<br />Wage and Hour Division<br />U.S. Department of Labor<br />200 Constitution Avenue, N.W.<br />Washington, DC 20210</p>
<p>2.) If the answer to the question in 1.) is yes, then an<br />interested party (those affected by the action) can request<br />review and reconsideration from the Wage and Hour Administrator<br />(See 29 CFR Part 1.8 and 29 CFR Part 7). Write to:</p>
<p>Wage and Hour Administrator<br />U.S. Department of Labor<br />200 Constitution Avenue, N.W.<br />Washington, DC 20210</p>
<p>The request should be accompanied by a full statement of the<br />interested party's position and by any information (wage<br />payment data, project description, area practice material,<br />etc.) that the requestor considers relevant to the issue.</p>
<p>3.) If the decision of the Administrator is not favorable, an<br />interested party may appeal directly to the Administrative<br />Review Board (formerly the Wage Appeals Board). Write to:</p>
<p>Administrative Review Board<br />U.S. Department of Labor<br />200 Constitution Avenue, N.W.<br />Washington, DC 20210</p>
<p>4.) All decisions by the Administrative Review Board are final.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">THIS IS THE FORMAL PRE-SOLICITATION NOTICE IN ACCORDANCE WITH FAR 5.204.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The Acquisition and Contracting Division (AFCEE/AC), Brooks City-Base Texas, in support of the Air Force Center for Engineering and the Environment (AFCEE) is conducting an acquisition for the Environmental, Construction and Operations &amp; Services 2009 (ECOS09) program. This is a source selection for environmental, construction and operations and services at sites located primarily on DoD (mostly Air Force) installations worldwide with an emphasis on CONUS, for which AFCEE customers have responsibility. ECOS09 is 100% small business set-aside.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Requirements under this contract will primarily support environmental restoration/remediation and operations/services efforts; but requirements may also include traditional minor construction, demolition, and repair. Stand-alone design and conceptual work plan/implementation work plan (CWP/IWP) are NOT included in the scope of this contract. Requirements shall be carried out as specified under TOs at locations worldwide, with emphasis on the Continental United States (CONUS). This is a follow-on contract to the current ECOS contract and is critical to meet AFCEE's future mission and anticipated workload.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Source selection procedures will be followed as prescribed in FAR Part 15 and FAR Supplements. The contracts are contemplated to be Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) with Firm Fixed Price (FFP) and Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) pricing arrangements. This requirement is a small business set-aside consisting of approximately five (5) to eight (8) awards and will have a ceiling of $350M. The Government reserves the right to make fewer, more or no contracts based on the quality and quantity of the proposals. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this acquisition is 562910 (500 employees or less). This size standard applies for establishment of eligibility as a small business.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Excess bonding capacity is $2.5M. Contract Fair Opportunity Selection and Ordering Procedure clauses will be used to compete task orders against the successful offerors. Terms of contract(s) include a five year ordering period plus two additional years for performance.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The Government anticipates releasing the RFP on or about 14 November 2008. The RFP will be issued via FedBizOpps and posted on the AFCEE ECOS09 website, located at https://www.afceeprivweb.brooks.af.mil/pkv/ecos09/default.asp. All contractors interested in receiving information on this acquisition are encouraged to register with the FedBizOpps website as well as the AFCEE ECOS09 website listed above. Note: Only small business firms can register on the ECOS09 website as interested primes.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">No hard copies of this solicitation will be issued. All proposals must be received by the due date and time specified in the RFP. The due date will be no less than 30 calendar days after the release of the RFP. It is the contractor's responsibility to check the RFP for the actual issuance date, proposal due date/time, and delivery address. Inquiries may be directed to sheri.brassfield@brooks.af.mil and yvonne.camarce@brooks.af.mil. Please ensure emails are sent to both POCs.</p>

<DESC>The purpose of this Amendment (1) is to change the solicitation number, performance period and evaluation factors in the September 16, 2008 announcement.  The changes are in bold. 

The Department of Homeland Securitys (DHS) Transformation and Systems Consolidation (TASC) initiative was launched to consolidate and integrate mission-essential enterprise financial, acquisition and asset management systems. DHS is seeking a business partner to provide 1) an enterprise application that integrates end-to-end business processes in support of financial, acquisition and asset management and 2) integration services and program management support. The Department will conduct this enterprise-wide acquisition as a full and open competition in accordance with FAR part 15.  DHS intends to award an IDIQ performanced-based contract for a five (5) year base period and five (5) one-year option years.  The new TASC RFP number is HSHQDC-09-R-00001. 

The scope of this effort is to acquire a proven, integrated financial management, asset management and acquisition management system solution with the accompanying program management, change management and integration services to implement and sustain the proposed solution.  

The Offeror shall be responsible for transitioning DHS components from existing environments to the integrated solution and a set of standardized business processes. This effort will also include the entire system life cycle approach of analysis and documentation, design, development and configuration; IT security controls and integration, unit and system integration testing, quality assurance testing, and user acceptance testing; implementation; training; and operations, maintenance and enhancements. 

The acquisition will be conducted on an unrestricted basis using an advisory multi-step process.  Phase I will be the evaluation of offerors proposed solution.  DHS is not requesting offerors to submit proposals to Phase I of this pre-solicitation notice.  A formal Request for Proposal (RFP) will be posted to www.fbo.gov on or about November 1, 2008.

<DESC>PRESOLICITATION        NEXT GENERATION HELMET SENSOR SYNOPSIS<BR><BR>The U.S. Army RDECOM - Natick Contracting Division, in support of the US Army Soldier Systems Center-Natick has a requirement for 30,000 helmet sensors and accompanying data retrieval systems.  PEO Soldier has identified the need to produce and field the next generation helmet sensors to improve the sensors operational effectiveness for six brigade equivalents.  <BR><BR>The Helmet Sensor as a device will be coupled and integrated with a soldier helmet and will not present any harm to the individual soldier wearing the device nor interfere with any other helmet components or systems. This miniaturized device, when employed, will quantitatively measure rigid body motion responses associated with kinetic energy blasts and impact behavior. The device records and measures the magnitude and direction of both translational and angular accelerations. The device when operational and activated will discriminate between normal head motions and impacts observed in typical field activities, as well as discern high energy dynamic events when the helmet is exposed to ballistics impacts, blast pressures, and shock waves. The Helmet Sensor device will be an operationally multi-functional device fully capable of transmitting data captured either by means of using a wireless technique and/or via a standard computer USB module connection. Soldiers and supporting personnel will be able to employ a data retrieval system using automated information technologies to transmit device field data measured, recorded, and stored by a central processing unit. The finished system will be interoperable and interface with standard DoD hardware and software systems and effectively operate with existing DoD communication servers and portals.<BR><BR>The government requires sample production demonstration models submitted with offers in compliance with the purchase description provided.  The best value award for the Fixed Priced ID/IQ contract will be based on performance based acquisition techniques and responses including five volumes which are:<BR><BR>1) Technical, which includes the offerors performance work statement in response to the Statement of Objectives, limited to 50 pages<BR>2) Quality assurance plan with performance requirements summary and contract master schedule, limited to 50 pages (resumes included and not limited in page count)<BR>3) Past performance (forms provided)<BR>4) cost/price data, and <BR>5) Small business subcontracting plan.  <BR>

STATEMENT OF WORK: 
The U.S. Geological Survey, Coastal and Marine Geology Program in Santa Cruz, California, have a requirement to collect and provide high-resolution aerial imaging in support of the Sediment Fate and Transport Demonstration Project at the Tijuana Estuary, California.  The goal of this project is to measure and describe the pathways and processes of fine sediment dispersal from beach into nearshore.  Aerial imaging will be important tool to assess the sediment pathways during different environmental conditions (waves, winds, currents, etc.) as determined by the broader USGS sampling and analyses in this project available at: http://www.scc.ca.gov/webmaster/project_sites/tijuana_river/science_plan_v5.pdf. 
The scope of work consists of multiple aerial imaging over-flights conducted between November 2008 through March 2009 with the purpose of mapping the distribution of suspended sediment in nearshore waters of the study area.  Aerial imaging must be obtained from a radiometric sensor with at least 10-bit resolution (1024 levels of output) from at least 4 independent channels.  Channels must be customizable to any wavelength within the visible and near-infrared (NIR) portion of the spectrum (i.e. 400 to 950 nm) and have high signal-to-noise ratios.  Further, the imaging will include thermal infrared (TIR) to evaluate the water temperature of the ocean water.  The vendor will also provide a portable spectrophotometer to be used in the initial stages of the project to optimize the aerial sensor data collection for the sediment of interest.  The USGS will provide sediment and shiptime for these analyses.  Aerial imaging will be provided from at least 32 32' N to 32 34' N latitude and 117 07' 22" to 117 10' W longitude, an area of approximately 15 square kilometers, which includes portions of Mexican waters.  The vendor will need to prior approval from the International Boundary Waters Commission to be able to fly in this study area.  The vendor will provide all equipment, fuel, and support for the flights, imaging, and data summary.  Aerial imaging will shall occur on predetermined date, as scheduled with the technical liaison, so that the flights coincides with USGS sampling by boat.
