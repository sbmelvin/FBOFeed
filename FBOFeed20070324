The NCO also oversees the Institute of Tropical Cultivation, a scientific research/training NGO.  Coca eradication is handled by CORAH (Control y Reduction de Coca Alto Huallaga - the Government of Peru/Ministry of the Interior eradication organization), which falls under the Minister of Interior but is fully funded by NAS in the amount of just over $11 million US.  The NCO, with the help of NAS Accounting, oversees the use of that money, final approval control resting with the NCO.

The NCO is made up of the Narcotics Control Officer, the Eradication Operations Advisor, and an Executive Administrator.

PURPOSE:  The purpose of this position is to provide a Narcotics Control Officer (NCO) to the NAS/NCO coca eradication support program.

The NCO makes the link between policy and practice balancing the input from the host government with the priorities of the USG.

TRAINING RESPONSIBILITIES

The NCO conducts needs assessments to improve the efficiency of CORAH Administration and Personnel.  Currently, the NCO is overseeing the training provided by an NGO, with extensive NCO input, of all supervisors in personnel evaluation methods.

Other training is provided as seen necessary.

MONITORING AND EVALUATION RESPONSIBILITIES

The NCO is constantly monitoring progress of the eradication towards the annual goal and evaluating changes in strategy if needed.
