Additionally, approximately 700,000 paper questionnaires will be sent to nurses in select states who meet the eligibility requirements of the NHS-III. NIOSH will contribute to the funding of 250,000 of these mailings.</p>
<p>CDC/NIOSH has procured funding through NORA to contribute towards a percentage of the mailing costs for the NHS-III. Because Brigham Women's Hospital has chosen W.A. Wilde Company for their mailing needs, and because W.A. Wilde Company already has the addresses in house, in addition to the fact that CDC/NIOSH is only funding a portion of the mailing (approximately 40%). If CDC/NIOSH were to compete this task to other mailing houses, the task would be severed into two, resulting in substantial duplication of costs that would be unrecoverable through competition.</p>
<p>This project is supported by justification for other than full and open competition to W.A. Wilde Company under authority of 41 U.S.C.253(c)(1). Responsible sources that believe they possess the expertise and capabilities identified above are encouraged to submit to the Contracting Officer within 15 days from the posting date of this notice, their written capabilities statement and pricing information in the format they choose, not to exceed 10 pages. Please forward product and pricing information to&nbsp;Florence Black, Contract Specialist, Procurement and Grant Branch-V (Pittsburgh), PO Box 18070, 626 Cochrans Mill Road, Pittsburgh, PA, 15236-0070; email <a href="mailto:fbb4@cdc.gov">fbb4@cdc.gov</a>. All vendors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) prior to an award of a federal contract. The website is: www.ccr.gov.</p>
<p>The Government will review any/all product and pricing information submitted and determine if other qualified sources do exist that could provide this requirement. Information received in response will be used solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>If no affirmative responses are received within 15 days, in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, negotiations will be conducted with W.A. Wilde Company, 200 Summer St., Holliston MA 01746 as the only source.</p>

<SUBJECT>Occupational Exposures in the Nurses Health Study III - Full Study
<SOLNBR>2009-N-11115

<CONTACT>Florence P Black, Contract Specialist, Phone (412)386-4451, Fax (412)386-6459, Email fbb4@cdc.gov
<DESC><p>NOTICE OF INTENT TO NEGOTIATE A CONTRACT. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) intends to negotiate a contract with Brigham and Women's Hospital.
<p>This procurement is for a contract with researchers from Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, a teaching affiliate of Harvard Medical School, who will contribute towards the establishment of a new longitudinal, occupational cohort of female nurses of reproductive age, known as the Nurses' Health Study III. The purpose of this action is to secure the services of researchers at Brigham and Women's Hospital to collect, analyze, and manage data from the proposed Nurses' Health Study III full study to complete the following tasks: 1) recruit 100,000 participants for the study, 2) collect occupational and reproductive health data, 3) summarize exposure and health data, 4) analyze etiologic relationships between exposures and reproductive health outcomes.</p>
<p>This study is a continuation of the NIOSH Contract Number 211-2008-M-24365.</p>
<p>Because of NIOSH's interest in studying nurses, and to leverage funds, NIOSH sought a collaboration that would help meet these goals. The Harvard Nurse's Health Studies (NHS), conducted by the Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH) in Boston, is the largest study of U.S. female nurses of its kind. The NHS-I and NHS-II include two large longitudinally-followed cohorts. It has been advantageous for NIOSH to collaborate with the NHS teams to encourage them to include occupational exposure information in their questionnaires and to allow NIOSH to oversee the analyses and publication of occupationally-related data. BWH is now embarking on the establishment of a new cohort, the NHS-III, and is willing to again allow NIOSH to collaborate with them. Brigham and Women's Hospital is the only vendor with access to the Nurses' Health data and if NIOSH were to conduct such a study without BWH, the cost would be prohibitive.</p>
<p>This project is supported by justification for other than full and open competition to Brigham and Women's Hospital under authority of 41 U.S.C.253(c)(1). Responsible sources that believe they possess the expertise and capabilities identified above are encouraged to submit to the Contracting Officer within 15 days from the posting date of this notice, their written capabilities statement and pricing information in the format they choose, not to exceed 10 pages. Please forward product and pricing information to Florence Black, Contract Specialist, Procurement and Grant Branch-V (Pittsburgh), PO Box 18070, 626 Cochrans Mill Road, Pittsburgh, PA, 15236-0070; email fbb4@cdc.gov. All vendors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) prior to an award of a federal contract. The website is: www.ccr.gov.</p>
<p>The Government will review any/all product and pricing information submitted and determine if other qualified sources do exist that could provide this requirement. Information received in response will be used solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>If no affirmative responses are received within 15 days, in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, negotiations will be conducted with Brigham and Women's Hospital., 75 Francis Street, OBC 3-34Q, Boston, MA 02115 as the only source.</p>

<DESC>The Library of Congress/FEDLINK intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) for accounting services to pay invoices for federal libraries who borrow from libraries that charge for lending materials.  Federal libraries that use this Interlibrary Loan (ILL) Payment Service will be participating in the Federal Library and Information Center Committee (FLICC) FEDLINK cooperative program and will establish accounts with LC/FEDLINK to pay for the charges they incur.  The ILL Payment Service vendor will pay the lending libraries certified invoices and will then bill the borrowing librarys LC/FEDLINK account for reimbursement for the amount paid to the lender and for a service fee.  The vendor will provide the borrowing library with detailed reports and summaries of lender invoices paid.  This service is designed for payments, not collections.  That is, the vendor is to pay institutions that photocopy, supply electronic documents, or lend materials from their collection to federal libraries; the vendor is not to collect from borrowers (individuals or institutions) fees that federal libraries themselves may charge when they photocopy, supply electronic documents or lend materials.  The FEDLINK ILL fee payment service provides an efficient method for federal libraries to pay ILL fees that may be charged by lending institutions to cover the cost of photocopying or other interlibrary loan processing costs. The RFP # LC10R7200 will be posted on or about April 7, 2009.  The anticipated closing date for RFP LC10R7200 is May 7, 2009.  Vendors are responsible for ensuring that all amendments to the solicitation are received and addressed prior to proposal submission.  All proposals shall be submitted in accordance with the instruction provided in Section L of the RFP.  All questions shall be submitted in writing and addressed to the Contract Specialist via email as specified.  NO TELEPHONE CALLS WILL BE ACCEPTED.  For information about the Library of Congress FEDLINK Program, please visit our website at: www.loc.gov/flicc. For additional information about other FEDLINK services, please contact Jim Oliver, FEDLINK Vendor Services Coordinator, via email at: joli@loc.gov.

<DESC>NASA/JSC has a requirement for a bench-top prototype of the Secondary OxygenRegulator (SOR) design developed by Carleton Technologies, Inc. for the ConstellationSpace Suit. The SOR is an electro-mechanically actuated regulator consisting of newcontrol technology added to the proven mechanical regulator design that is the currentExtravehicular Mobility Unit, (EMU) Secondary Oxygen Pack (SOP) regulator (SV799042)design currently provided by Carleton Technologies, Inc. as a subcontractor on anexisting contract.  The control technology is a modified version of the Primary VariableRegulator (PVR) developed by Carleton Technologies, Inc. under an existing contract withNASA.NASA/JSC intends to purchase the items from Carleton Technologies, Inc., because it isthe original source for engineering development and fabrication of the current ShuttleEMU Secondary Oxygen Pack (SOP) regulator on which this SOR design is based on.  Carletonis the only known vendor capable of designing and building this regulator with therequired performance to meet performance requirements resulting in reduced launch massfor the Shuttle/ISS Programs. For the Constellation Program lunar exploration phase,launch mass will be even more critical than it has historically been for Shuttle/ISS andthe performance of this regulator design will be essential.	Carleton possesses the facilities, processes, jigs/fixtures, and trained/experiencedpersonnel to not only design, develop, and fabricate this evolved SOP regulatorprototype, but also to take the next step in evolving this regulator with the eventualgoal of an oxygen compatible, flight qualified, human-rated unit.   The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See Note26.Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform theeffort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 2:00 p.m. local timeon Monday, April 6, 2009.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely forthe purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitivebasis.	A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a fulland open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within thediscretion of the government.Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>NASA/LaRC has a requirement for Qty 4 new fiber-coupled telescopes and the upgradeof Qty 3 existing fiber-coupled telescopes.NASA/LaRC intends to purchase the items and upgrades from Photon Gear, Inc. based ontheir unique qualifications and experience from two sets of previously purchasedfiber-coupled telescopes. In 2006, Photon Gear won a competitive procurement for threefiber-coupled telescopes with an aperture of 20 mm.  These telescopes were used in thelaboratory system to validate their design and measure their performance.  Threeadditional telescopes with 50 mm diameter aperture were purchased on a non-competitivebasis and used in the breadboard system to be flown on a helicopter demonstrating thecapabilities of the Doppler Lidar. This procurement is for a third set of telescopes thatare essentially identical to the second set of telescopes but with two minor designupgrades.  In addition, the second set of telescopes are being modified to incorporatethe two minor design upgrades.	Procuring a different fiber-coupled telescope from adifferent source will cause considerable schedule delays and additional costs forvalidating its design and generating a new lidar design.The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform theeffort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local timeon 03/27/09.

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED. The Center for Research for Mothers and Children, Obstetric and Pediatric Pharmacology Branch, within the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), National Institutes of Health, intends to negotiate on a sole source basis, under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (1) and FAR 6.302-1(a) (2) (ii) and HHSAR 306.302-1 (a) (2) (ii), a modification to its current contract with Premier Research Group, Philadelphia, PA, entitled Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (BPCA)  Data Coordinating Center. This three month contract extension is necessary in order to avoid a lapse in contract performance and continue services in its operations of the Data Coordinating Center. This modification the existing contract will allow Premier Research Group to continue uninterrupted services in supporting ongoing BPCA pediatric clinical trials until a new competitive contract can be awarded and the services transitioned. 



This modification is to continue services until approximately August 31, 2009 or until this new competitive contract can be awarded. Also, it may be necessary to continue data coordinating support and analysis of the data of some ongoing clinical trials that are near completion beyond the award date of the new competitive contract.  This is because a few trials that are near completion may be at a critical juncture as monitoring data, tracking study progress, formatting the data for FDA, and providing study drugs (including placebos) could pose specific risks to the study, data and/or patients, if a new Contractor were brought in before completion or until a smooth transition could be effected. A contract extension will allow NICHD to closely supervise the continued activities of the Data Coordinating Center, including monitoring patient records, analyzing collected data, submitting data and final study reports to the FDA, and closing out specific study phases in an orderly fashion. This additional time will allow for a transition to the selected offeror under the new competitive procurement. 



It is critical that the services provided by the Data Coordinating Center not be interrupted as the data coordinating center is integral to the success of the pediatric clinical trials that it supports and these consist of multiple pediatric clinical trials, which to-date, include activities that support approximately fifteen ongoing clinical studies, involving approximately 110 Pediatric Off-Patent Drug Study (PODS) clinical study site centers, with as many as 1400 children, (many in intensive care settings). A primary responsibility of the Data Coordinating Center is to ensure that pediatric clinical trials are performed and documented according to the Good Clinical Practice (GCP) standards as described by FDA and the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) GCP Guidelines. The Contractor regularly gathers, monitors, and formats the study data generated from each POD Center clinical study site and is responsible for submitting the data to FDA for regulatory approval and label modification. A break in the services of the data coordinating center would result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling the needs of these ongoing clinical pediatric trials. 



Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement by submitting information (5 page limit) within 45 days of publication of this synopsis. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within 45 days of publication of this synopsis will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Deliveries should be sent to:

   DRAFT STATEMENT OF WORK

PROJECT TITLE:	Access to Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS) Databases through its web-based interface, SciFinder.

PURPOSE

DLS intends to award a contract for discounted access to CAS SciFinder available to the entire NIH community as a fixed price requirement. 
BACKGROUND INFORMATION

SciFinder is a critical information source for NIH researchers. For more than five years, the Division of Library Services (DLS) has facilitated access by NIH researchers to this resource through an umbrella contract that allowed interested groups throughout NIH to obtain discounted access to the resource for a flat annual fee by issuing their own task orders against the contract. NIH groups that acquire access to SciFinder in this way have unlimited access to the databases. 

SciFinder is a web-based interface that provides desk-top access to the proprietary chemical information contained in CAS databases. CAS is a division of the American Chemical Society. CAS is recognized by academic and corporate researchers as the producer of the worlds largest and most comprehensive chemical databases. As such they are indispensable to biomedical scientists and chemists engaged in new product and patent development as well as basic research. CAS indexes chemical articles from more than 10,000 journals; its database contains more than 30 million abstracts. The CAS Registry is the authoritative collection of disclosed chemical substance information with more than 43 million organic and inorganic substances and more than 60 million sequences.  SciFinder as a research tool allows users to:
o	identify chemical substances by searching their chemical structure or sub-structure, 
o	find data about chemical reactions, 
o	search by Nucleotide or Protein sequence, and
o	link to relevant patents and articles that can be obtained through the NIH Library

OBJECTIVES

The specific objectives of this requirement is to provide the NIH community with cost-effective access to SciFinder, the gateway to search the proprietary and comprehensive databases of chemical information produced by the Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS), a division of the American Chemical Society (ACS). This action provides a centralized license agreement that shall consolidate accounts from NIH institutes. As a result of the centralized licensing agreement, the NIH will receive a discount to the price charged for each registered user. This also will save the NIH groups who need the service the time and effort to prepare and negotiate separate contracts.

Services to be Performed

A. 	General Requirements
	
Independently and not as an agent of the Government, the Contractor shall furnish all necessary labor, materials, supplies, equipment, and services (except as otherwise specified herein) and perform the work set forth below.

The Social Security Administration (SSA) intends to issue 13 separate solicitations to obtain the services of experienced, licensed Medical Experts who are board certified and/or have SSA disability program experience at the State and/or Federal level, or in the absence of board certification, have SSA disability program experience combined with specialized training, to serve as Medical Experts to analyze and provide expert advice related to their specialized field, as needed, so that adjudicators can render accurate determinations and decisions.  

SSA requires Medical Expert services in the following fields:  

Pulmonary Medicine (solicitation number SSA-RFP-09-1027)
Internal Medicine (solicitation number SSA-RFP-09-1030)
Cardiology (solicitation SSA-RFP-09-1031)
Medical Oncology (solicitation number SSA-RFP-09-1032)
Endocrinology (solicitation number SSA-RFP-09-1033)
Gastroenterology (solicitation number SSA-RFP-09-1034)
Dermatology (solicitation number SSA-RFP-09-1035)
Internal Medicine Generalist (solicitation number SSA-RFP-09-1036)
Rheumatology (solicitation number SSA-RFP-09-1038)
Psychiatry (solicitation number SSA-RFP-09-1039)
General Surgery (solicitation number SSA-RFP-09-1040)
Orthopedic Surgery (solicitation number SSA-RFP-09-1041)
Neurology (solicitation number SSA-RFP-09-1042)

**SSA has designated these solicitations for TOTAL SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE participation only**  

BACKGROUND:  SSA is responsible for two national disability programs, Social Security Disability Insurance (DI) and Supplemental Security Income (SSI).  SSA uses a five-step sequential process for evaluating the disability claim submitted by an individual who alleges an inability to perform substantial gainful activity (SGA).  The program defines disability as an inability to engage in SGA by reason of a medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death, or has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months.  A medical basis for the disability claim is required, and the State disability determination services (DDS) collect and evaluate the medical information, making a determination about the severity of the medical impairment as it relates to the claimants ability to perform SGA.  

While medical generalist may properly evaluate many disability impairments, claims that involve difficult or complex issues require medical specialist and sub-specialist expertise.  

SSA anticipates the award of multiple Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) type contracts with provisions for the issuance of Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP) task orders as needed.  The IDIQ period of performance will consist of a 12-month base period with four 12-month option periods.  The estimated date for release of these solicitations (the appropriate solicitation number is located with the individual Medical Expert field cited above) is on/about March 30, 2009, with proposals due approximately 30 days from the actual release date.  Any amendments or other information relative to the solicitations will be posted to this website (www.fedbizopps.gov).  As such, interested sources are encouraged to REGISTER TO RECEIVE NOTIFICATION.  If you have any questions concerning the solicitations, please submit those in writing to Tonya Saunders via e-mail at tonya.saunders@ssa.gov.  Telephone calls WILL NOT be accepted or returned.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

Requirement:

The United States Government currently occupies office and related space in a building under lease in Laredo, TX, that will be expiring.  The Government is seeking to lease approximately 13731 contiguous rentable square feet of office and related space.  The rentable space must yield a minimum of 11940 contiguous ANSI/BOMA Office area square feet (OASF).  The lease term requirement is for 10 years/5 years firm.  The space must be available for occupancy by 11/1/2011.

Other applicable requirements include:

	Proximity to public transportation.
	TBD

The Government is considering alternative space if economically advantageous.  The Government will use the information it receives in response to this advertisement as a basis to develop a cost benefit analysis and to determine whether to compete the lease requirement or relocate to the existing federal courthouse building.  In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Governments requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications infrastructure, and non-productive agency downtime.

	Building ownership information.
	Amount of parking available onsite and its cost.  Include whether expected rental rate includes the cost of the required Government parking (if any).

<DESC><p>American Recovery and Reinvestment Act Action Description: The General Services Administration announces an opportunity for Construction Management Support Services for the St. Elizabeths Campus Consolidation program, Southeast Washington, D.C. . GSA anticipates using funds from the pending FY 2009 Omnibus Appropriations Act and partial funding with funds from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act ("Recovery Act") of 2009. Accordingly, the contract will be subject to unprecedented levels of transparency and accountability so Americans know where their tax dollars are going and how they are being spent. Mechanisms through special contract terms and conditions will be implemented to accurately track, monitor and report on taxpayer funds. The Recovery Act requires extensive reporting from the prime recipients of Federal funding. This may include special Buy American Act requirements, additional requirements for contractor reporting, and expanded Government Accountability Office (GAO) and Office of Inspector General (OIG) access to contractor records. Project Summary. The General Services Administration (GSA) announces their intent to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) for a negotiated Construction Management (CM) professional services contract to perform design phase (excluding actual design), procurement phase, construction phase, reimbursable, supplemental, claims, testing, and miscellaneous services for the construction of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Headquarters consolidation at St. Elizabeths, Washington, D.C. St. Elizabeths, a National Historic Landmark, is a former mental health hospital that was previously operated by the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). The St. Elizabeths Campus is located on Martin Luther King, Jr. Avenue in the Anacostia neighborhood of Southeast Washington, D.C. The West Campus and a portion of the East Campus have been selected to meet the operational housing needs for the DHS. The West Campus, a 176-acre site, is situated on the &ldquo;topographic bowl&rdquo; of the District of Columbia and offers panoramic views of the city. The campus contains 62 historic buildings, 134 character defining landscape features and a historic cemetery, in which soldiers from the Civil War era, as well as former patients, are interred. Prospective Offerors&rsquo; experience must include, but is not limited to, work performed on historic sites, with the National Historic Preservation Act Section 106 Process and within campus settings. The DHS Headquarters consolidation is a construction program involving multiple interdependent projects managed in a coordinated way to obtain benefits and controls not available from managing them individually. The individual projects are expected to include some or all of the following: The U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters; The DHS Headquarters and The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA); Immigration Customs Enforcement (ICE), The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) and Customs Border Patrol (CBP); a Central Utility/Cogeneration Plant; a National Operations Center (NOC) and various infrastructure projects, including water, gas, sewer, power, and pedestrian and roadway networks. This will be a firm fixed price, indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity contract extending for the duration of the entire program, which is currently anticipated to conclude in 2016. The government anticipates awarding a single contract to one CM entity. The estimated Construction Management Support Services cost range: $20 to $30 million. The estimated construction cost for the total development of the DHS Headquarters consolidation at St. Elizabeths is between $2.0 billion and $2.5 billion of construction work and a possible $500 million of tenant added items (telecommunications/IT, physical and electronic security, FF&amp;E). Congress has authorized Phase One of the development which includes the new U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters building, a parking structure and related infrastructure upgrades. All work will be performed in accordance with GSA&rsquo;s authorized and approved standards. The CM contract will have a firm fixed price for standard (base contract) services along with an indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity component through which the government anticipates that it will issue task and/or delivery orders for additional services as the need arises. The selection process will utilize source selection procedures in accordance with FAR 15.3. This negotiated solicitation is open to both small and large business firms. The professional firm (if not a small business concern), shall be required to present an acceptable small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business Subcontracting Plan in accordance with Public Law 95-507 as part of its proposal. Consideration is open to established, qualified firms licensed to perform professional services (FAR22.1102), which currently have active, properly staffed offices within the continental United States (including subcontractors). The RFP will be issued electronically on or about April 30, 2009, on the Internet at http://www.fedbizopps.gov/, and proposals will be due 30 calendar days after RFP issuance. All qualified responsible firms are encouraged to participate in this procurement. Small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small businesses are encouraged to participate as prime contractors, or as members of joint ventures with other small businesses. A general information session and site visit is scheduled for April 15, 2009 at 10:00 AM. The information session will be held at GSA&rsquo;s Regional Office Building, Room 5643, located at 301 7th &amp; D Streets, SW, Washington, DC 20407 with the site visit immediately following. GSA will provide transportation to and from the St. Elizabeths Campus from its Regional Office Building. Those touring the site must utilize the transportation provided. Any person(s) arriving at the site independently will not be permitted to tour with the group. Those interested in attending the general information session and site visit must contact Project Manager, Arnold Hill, via electronic mail at: arnold.hill@gsa.gov no later than COB 04/01/09. Attendees are limited to two (2) per firm. Although not mandatory, GSA respectfully requests that all interested parties register their firms at this site to receive updated information relative to this requirement.</p>

<DESC>The United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) is interested in identifying Chemical/biological (CB) protective glove liners that protect from Chemical Warfare Agents (CWA) for Ground and Aviation use.  The hand wear concept will integrate a CB protective liner that is worn underneath existing standard duty gloves (Summers Flyers Gloves, Cold Weather Gloves, Fuel Handlers Glove, Assault Gloves, etc.).  The U.S. Army Natick Research Development and Engineering Center (NSRDEC), on behalf of USSOCOM, is looking for vendors to provide Commercial-off-the shelf (COTS), Non-Developmental items (NDI), or near NDI CB protective liners that can be fully integrated with current U.S. CB protective garments to enhance capabilities. The gloves must have the following performance attributes: Provide for 12 [T] hours to 24 hours [O] of CB protection after 48 [T] hours or 96 [O] hours of wear; Provide protection against 5g/m2 [T] or 10g/m2 [O] liquid agent challenge and 5000 ct (mg/min/m3) vapor /aerosol; limit sweat build-up equal or better to current CB gloves [T] or provide a breathable [O] candidate; Not significantly reduce the tactility and dexterity of the outer standard duty glove; Possess non-melting properties [T] or meet FR to resist self-ignition, or if ignited, self-extinguish equal to or faster than current non-CB flight gloves [O] ; Have sufficient gauntlet length to interface with the sleeve of the current fielded CB protective garments; Protection against chemical agents HD, TGD, VX in liquid, vapor and aerosol forms; Maintain CB protection when exposed to operational contaminants such as JP-8, hydraulic fluid, weapons lubricants, munitions residue, standard decontaminants, blood, and salt and fresh water. Additionally, USSOCOM is interested in innovative and creative approaches to CB hand wear protection that meet the above requirements but which may provide unique candidates/alternative concepts beyond the stated liner approach (Example: a single glove approach which can provide requisite FR and CB protection without sacrificing tactility/dexterity).  The Government may acquire for testing purposes one or more vendor products that appear to meet or exceed the stated performance attributes. Responses to this market survey are due on or before 1 May 2009 and must include a product description with performance parameters, technology readiness level (i.e. maturity level), manufacturing readiness level, summary of prior testing, test reports, where and how the product is currently used; a statement on current availability, an estimated schedule and estimated cost for the price of test articles and production units.

<DESC><p>Air Force Research Laboratory's (AFRL's) mission is leading the discovery, development and integration of affordable war fighting technologies for America's aerospace forces. It is a full-spectrum laboratory, responsible for planning and executing the Air Force's science and technology program. AFRL leads a worldwide government, industry and academia partnership in the discovery, development and delivery of a wide range of revolutionary technology. The laboratory provides leading-edge war fighting capabilities keeping our air, space and cyberspace forces the world's best.
<p>Research and development sources are sought for AFRL's Directed Energy (RD) Directorate's Satellite Assessment Center (SatAC). SatAC is the Air Force-chartered organization that evaluates directed energy effects on aerospace systems and performs assessments of aerospace system susceptibilities to directed energy sources and other effects (e.g. cyber) for the Department of Defense (DoD) (reference DoD Instruction 3100.11). To accomplish its mission, SatAC develops tools for aerospace systems technical analyses. Aerospace systems are defined to include satellites, missiles (tactical and ballistic), and the respective supporting architectures. Other tools may be required to perform non-traditional analyses.</p>
<p>SatAC is interested in augmenting its technical and engineering expertise in the following major areas: (A) gathering / analyzing / modeling information; (B) system assessments; (C) computer science support. The work will be performed on site at the Air Force Research Laboratory, Kirtland AFB, NM, at contractors' facilities, and at third party facilities. Descriptions of each of these major areas are as follow:</p>
<p>(A) Gathering / analyzing / modeling information includes obtaining, analyzing, and using information to develop detailed system structural, functional and architectural models.</p>
<p>(B) Aerospace system assessments are physics-based and include interactions with space weather, laser, radio frequency, high-power microwave, other directed energy and/or non-traditional sources. Assessments include vulnerability analysis, astrodynamics, and other relevant aspects of system-level, to include network analyses.</p>
<p>(C) Computer science support encompasses development and use of software and databases to support system modeling, system assessment, assessment methodology automation, smart data fusion techniques and methods as applied to Space Situational Awareness (SSA), databases (multi-tier and relational), artificial intelligence, information extraction and automated tools/graphical user interfaces (GUIs) delivered to operational DoD customers.</p>
<p>A primary objective of the overall effort is the integration of all these areas to enhance SatAC's capabilities in carrying out research programs, such as Space Situational Awareness (SSA), which support DoD information dominance requirements for space.</p>
<p>An indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity (IDIQ) contract, with cost-plus-fixed-fee (CPFF) term form task orders is contemplated with a five year task-ordering period. The anticipated maximum ordering value is $91M. Small businesses having the capability to perform this work are invited to submit a statement of capability (SOC) in order for the Government to determine whether the acquisition should be set aside for small businesses. Based on the results of the SOC evaluation, the Government reserves the right to set aside this requirement for small businesses. Offerors shall indicate whether they are/are not a small business, a small disadvantaged business, 8(a), hub-zone certified, woman-owned, or Historically Black College or University.</p>
<p>The SOC shall contain pertinent and specific information addressing the following areas:</p>
<p>(1) Expertise in state-of-the-art satellite design (ISR, communication, navigation, and weather).</p>
<p>(2) Independent research and development programs conducted within the last three years in the technical areas being solicited and a description of significant results of such projects.</p>
<p>(3) Experience with supporting operational military/defense communities.</p>
<p>(4) Experience with the international space industry.</p>
<p>(5) Demonstration of ability to conduct experiments in laboratory and field environments and a description of other areas of experience in the performance of experiments.</p>
<p>(6) Demonstration of knowledge and understanding of all aspects of the physics, engineering, operation, and function of DoD imaging sensors, such as the AFRL Starfire Optical Range (SOR), and the exploitation of their respective data types.</p>
<p>(7) Experience with industry standard software codes and tools (for example, C++, FORTRAN, html/xml, ORACLE)</p>
<p>(8) Experience working with, and interacting within, the DOD space control (Space Situational Awareness [SSA] and Defensive Counter Space [DCS]), cyberspace and intelligence communities</p>
<p>(9) Experience and ability in managing research resources to ensure that technical efforts are completed on schedule, within cost, and capable of supporting sporadic, quick turnaround efforts, and surge capability in support of short-notice, multi-million dollar projects.</p>
<p>(10) Demonstration of ability to develop new technical expertise in response to new space control assessment mission areas.</p>
<p>Interested small businesses are requested to submit a statement of capability (original plus two copies) within 15 calendar days of this announcement, substantiating each qualification described in (1) through (10) to AFRL/RDKP, Attn: Deb McGrath, 2251 Maxwell Avenue SE, Kirtland AFB NM, 87117-5773. Any responses received not addressing all of the above requirements will be rejected. The capability statements shall be limited to 20 pages, not to exceed two pages per area, single spaced, 12-point font, Times New Roman. If required to communicate contractor capabilities, TOP SECRET information will be accepted. Please contact Capt. David Kinton, at (505) 846-3321, to arrange for delivery of any classified material. However, whenever possible, submitted information will be unclassified. Offerors should be aware that the majority of work must be done in a Top Secret environment. A statement must be included by prospective offerors as to the ability to obtain, within 30 days of contract award, an industrial security clearance, and the personnel and storage facilities available to support work at the Top Secret level. Potential offerors responding to this sources sought synopsis must indicate whether they qualify as a small business under NAICS Code 541712 with a size standard of 500 employees. An Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCI) clause is anticipated in any resultant contract. Reference AFMC FAR Clause 5352.209-9002, "Organizational Conflict of Interest" (Jul 1997). This is not a Request for Proposals (RFP) and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract. Any costs incurred as a result of this announcement shall be borne by the offeror and will not be charged to the Government for reimbursement.</p>

<DESC>The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to assist the National Science Foundation (NSF) in conducting market research to determine the interest and capabilities of qualified companies/agencies for the opportunity described in the attachment. This request is for information purposes only to help NSF gain a better understanding of potential solutions and overall costs. Responses will assist NSF in developing the acqui-sition strategy including the alternatives analysis and in determining the appropriate approach for acquir-ing the systems implementation services, hosting and application management shared services, and soft-ware. Respondents must identify any information they consider to be sensitive or proprietary.   Vendors are encouraged to limit their use of sensitive and proprietary information.  However should responses contain sensitive and proprietary information, the information will be handled accordingly.  Any informa-tion submitted will not be returned, and no payment will be made by the Government for such informa-tion.

This RFI is not a request for proposal and the Government will not award a contract pursuant to this an-nouncement. No solicitation package is available at this time and requests for solicitation packages will not receive a response. Please do not contact the NSF CFO and CIO or their staff at this time.

NSF has contracted with PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC) under NSFDACS08D1596 for financial management modernization planning support, among other services. As part of the financial management modernization planning support task, PwC is required to assist NSF in conducting market research. Part of the market research includes the development of the RFI and review of responses resulting from the issuance of the RFI. In accordance with Part 9 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) it has been determined that as a result of receiving award NSFDACS08D1596, an organizational conflict exists which will prohibit PwC from proposing on the design, development, and implementation effort that may result from this RFI.  Further, PwC is bound by confidentiality of information provisions under their con-tract with NSF.

<RESPDATE>040709
<CONTACT>Todd D Hill, Phone 301-975-8802, Email todd.hill@nist.gov
<DESC>The National Institute of Standards & Technology (NIST) seeks information on commercial vendors that are capable of providing a pattern generator for the fabrication of photomasks and to direct-write lithographic patterns onto various substrates. After results of this market research are obtained and analyzed and specifications are developed for a pattern generator system that can meet NIST's minimum requirements, NIST may conduct a competitive procurement and subsequently award a Purchase Order.  If at least two qualified small businesses are identified during this market research stage, then any competitive procurement that resulted would be conducted as a small business set-aside.

This contemplated procurement is anticipated to utilize Recovery Act Funding if it is determined that responsible sources can satisfy the requirement.

NIST has a need for a pattern generator that would meet the following requirements:

1.	The pattern generator must have a resolution of better than 0.7 um with less than 30 nm pixel placement accuracy.  The system must be able to write patterns at a rate of at least 10 mm x 10 mm per minute.  The uniformity of the critical dimensions must be at most 100 nm (3 sigma).  The pattern generator must be able to accept substrates ranging from a 76.2 mm wafer to a 200 mm x 200 mm plate.
2.  The pattern generator must be in a climate-controlled environmental chamber capable of maintaining the system in the condition needed for optimal performance.  The system must operate at an altitude of 1600 meters above sea level.  It is highly desirable to have an option for the automatic loading and unloading of substrates for serial automatic photomask generation.
3.  The pattern generator must accept pattern data in CIF or GDSII formats or have software to convert from these formats into the internal format of the system.

NIST is seeking responses from all responsible sources, including large, foreign, and small businesses.  Small businesses are defined under the associated NAICS code for this effort, 334516, as those domestic sources having 500 employees or less.  Please include your companys size classification in any response to this notice.  

Companies that manufacture pattern generators for photomasks are requested to email a detailed report describing their abilities to todd.hill@nist.gov no later than the response date for this sources sought notice.  The report should include achievable specifications and any other information relevant to your product or capabilities.  Also, the following information is requested to be provided as part of the response to this sources sought notice: 1. Name of the company that manufactures the system components for which specifications are provided. 2. Name of company(ies) that are authorized to sell the system components, their addresses, and a point of contact for the company (name, phone number, fax number and email address). 3. Indication of number of days, after receipt of order that is typical for delivery of such systems. 4. Indication of whether each instrument for which specifications are sent to todd.hill@nist.gov are currently on one or more GSA Federal Supply Schedule contracts and, if so, the GSA FSS contract number(s). 5. Any other relevant information that is not listed above which the Government should consider in developing its minimum specifications and finalizing its market research.

<SOLNBR>N0002409R2237
<RESPDATE>051509
<ARCHDATE>12312009
<CONTACT>Ms. Lyn Carroll

<a href="mailto:lyn.carroll@navy.mil">Ms. Lyn Carroll</a>
<DESC>Request For InformationInformation Requested on: Unaccompanied Housing Privatization for Pascagoula area Pre-Commissioning Units
Description: The DoN is seeking interested parties to assist the US Navy in finding housing solutions for 220-400 bachelor personnel who will be in the Pascagoula, MS area during construction of Navy ships at Northrop Grumman Ship Systems Division for the foreseeable future.  This requirement stems from the Congressionally mandated 2005 Base Realignment Closure of NAVSTA Pascagoula and its associated support facilities.  With the absence of any organic homeport berthing facilities, the Navy will no longer own the capacity for housing Pre-Commissioning crews for these Navy ships.  While the specificity in the requirement varies, the approximate number of personnel noted will require lodging; access to food services, food preparation facilities, fitness facilities, and cable TV and Internet access.
Section 2801 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1996 (FY96), Public Law 104-106, 110 Stat. 186 (10 U.S.C. 2871-2885) as amended, provides  authorities that allow the Department of the Navy (DoN) and the military services to work with the private sector, nationwide, to build and renovate military unaccompanied housing and ancillary facilities in key areas of continued need and use.  The DoN's goal is to leverage private investment with DoN participation and to use a variety of private sector approaches to manage and maintain military unaccompanied housing and ancillary facilities, faster and at an overall lower cost to American taxpayers.  
The DoN is requesting information and sources of supply of such services within reasonable commuting distance from Pascagoula (within ~60 miles).  Interested parties should provide recommended solutions and where possible, Rough Order Magnitude costs, associated constraints to proposed solutions and all assumptions used to provide suggested solutions. Offerors may consider properties reverted through the BRAC process to the State of Mississippi on Singing River Island as well as the Navy Lakeside Housing facility on Chicot Rd, which will be disposed of in accordance with the BRAC Law (http://www.braclandsales.com/) and Jackson County Economic Development Commission's Local Re-use Authority Redevelopment Plan.  The Lakeside complex or facilities at Singing River Island may be a viable option in the Offerors recommended solution.  Other options may include use of but not limited to existing apartment complexes and construction of new facilities.  One of the driving factors for!  development of a procurement plan will be cost per service member for services provided.  

Offerors should submit conceptual plans and best available cost estimates to be used in a requirements development process by the U.S. Navy. Please consider the list of topics below in your response. You may also wish to consider issues that you believe are relevant to crew housing management.. Experience or lessons learned from housing management activities.. Challenges, pitfalls (what not to do) learned from these activities.. The level of interest in participating in the planning or in partnering with the Department to achieve this goal.. Specific technical and administrative assessment tool support considered critical for your participation and the achievement of the initiative's stated goal.Defined parameters of engagement in terms of willingness to cover not only the anticipated baseline capacity of PCU Sailors but the probability that there may be peaks and valleys in terms of full or over facility capacity. 
Response information will be used to determine viability for a commercial solution to the lack of government facilities as a result of BRAC. The information received will be used by DoN for internal planning and decision making purposes. DoN will not pay for information provided under this Request for Information (RFI), and there is no guarantee that a project will be supported as a result of this RFI. This RFI is not accepting applications for financial assistance or financial incentives. Questions concerning the requested information should be directed to Ms. Lyn Carroll at lyn.carroll@navy.mil.
Please provide responses to this RFI using the attached template (see Attachment #1). An editable Word Version of this template can be downloaded from the IIPS Special Notice site for this RFI under File Attachments. Questions relative to responding to this RFI may be sent to this same mailbox in advance of your response, and will be answered via the mailbox only.

<DESC><p>The purpose of this notice is for informational purposes only. This is a supplemental notice to Special Notice F3G4BA8256A001S. The following is the finalized and approved J&amp;A that resulted from the previous referenced Special Notice.</p>
<p>COORDINATION AND APPROVAL DOCUMENT</p>
<p><br />CONTRACTING ACTIVITY: 99th Contracting Squadron, Nellis AFB</p>
<p>PROGRAM/PROJECT: 99 Group, Med Group, Mike O'Callaghan Federal Hospital, 4700 Las Vegas Blvd North, Building 1300, Nellis AFB, NV 89191-6601</p>
<p>AUTHORITY: Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirement, 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(2) or 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(2) as cited in FAR 6.302-1(c).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION</p>
<p>I. CONTRACTING ACTIVITY</p>
<p>99th Contracting Squadron, 5865 Swaab Blvd., Nellis AFB, 89091 <br />II. NATURE AND/OR DESCRIPTION OF ACTION BEING PROCESSED</p>
<p>The action being processed is for a brand name and sole source firm fixed price purchase order for Script Pro's drug dispensing system maintenance and support. The contract will be awarded to Script Pro USA of Mission, KS. This contract will be for one base year and four option years with a total estimated value of $35,285.00</p>
<p>III. DESCRIPTION OF THE SUPPLIES/SERVICES REQUIRED TO MEET THE AGENCY'S NEEDS</p>
<p>Annual maintenance and support is required for Nellis AFB's satellite drug dispensing equipment.</p>
<p>IV. STATUTORY AUTHORITY PERMITTING OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION<br />10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1) or 41 U.S.C. 253 (c)(1) as cited in FAR 6.302-1(c) Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirement<br />V. DEMONSTRATION THAT THE CONTRACTOR'S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS OR NATURE OF THE ACQUISITION REQUIRES THE USE OF THE AUTHORITY CITED ABOVE(APPLICABILITY OF AUTHORITY)</p>
<p>Script Pro's drug dispensing equipment is the equipment currently in place at Nellis AFB's satellite pharmacy. To acquire maintenance and support services from another company, other than script pro would void the current warranty and forfeit the Govt.'s right to future software upgrades and updates. To purchase any other brand of equipment, at this point, would cost the Govt. approximately $180,000. This figure greatly exceeds the current Independent Govt. estimate. In summary, to procure maintenance and support services from any company, other than Script Pro would result in substantial duplication of cost not expected to be recovered through full and open competition.</p>
<p><br />VI. DESCRIPTION OF EFFORTS MADE TO ENSURE THAT OFFERS ARE SOLICITED FROM AS MANY POTENTIAL SOURCES AS DEEMED PRACTICABLE.</p>
<p>Internet research has been conducted and phone calls have been made. Script Pro is the only company capable of performing the required support. In addition, the 99thContracting Squadron will post a "Notice of Intent To Award Sole Source" in order to give industry a chance to comment on the acquisition.</p>
<p>VII. DETERMINATION BY THE CONTRACTING OFFICER THAT THE ANTICIPATED COST TO THE GOVERNMENT WILL BE FAIR AND REASONABLE</p>
<p>Per FAR 15.404-1(b) Price Analysis<br />(iV) Comparison with competitive published price lists or published market prices</p>
<p>VIII. DESCRIPTION OF THE MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED AND THE RESULTS OR A STATEMENT OF THE REASONS MARKET RESEARCH WAS NOT CONDUCTED</p>
<p>Internet research has been conducted and phone calls have been made. Script Pro is the only company capable of performing the required support. This has been confirmed in writing by Mr. Dustin Johnson, Special Project Manager for Script Pro. In addition, the 99thContracting Squadron will posted a "Notice of Intent To Award Sole Source" from February 19 - February 25 in order to give industry a chance to comment. No contradictions were received.</p>
<p><br />IX. ANY OTHER FACTS SUPPORTING THE USE OF OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION</p>
<p>None.</p>
<p>X. A LIST OF SOURCES, IF ANY, THAT EXPRESSED INTEREST IN THE ACQUISITION</p>
<p>None.</p>
<p>XI. A STATEMENT OF THE ACTIONS, IF ANY, THE AGENCY MAY TAKE TO REMOVE OR OVERCOME ANY BARRIERS TO COMPETITION BEFORE MAKING SUBSEQUENT ACQUISITIONS FOR THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES REQUIRED</p>
<p>As demand for this service continues to grow it is expected that additional vendors for this type of service will enter the market place. Therefore, a new market survey will be conducted for any future requirement. If future market research shows the addition of qualified distributors future requirements will be conducted using full and open competition.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>XII. CONTRACTING OFFICER'S CERTIFICATION.</p>
<p>The contracting officer's signature on the Coordination and Approval Document is evidence that he/she has determined this document to be both accurate and complete to the best of his/her knowledge and belief (FAR 6.303-2(a)(12).</p>

<CONTACT>Sylvia G Van Dyke, Contracting Officer, Phone 571-272-6568, Fax 571-2723-6568, Email sylvia.vandyke@uspto.gov
<DESC>The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) plans to procure brand name X86-54 CPU rack mounted servers for the Data Center Stabilization Project to those manufactured by Dell.  This announcement is considered a brand name justification.     This is not a solicitation.     This acquisition will be conducted utilizing Part 13 of the FAR, Simplified Acquisition procedures, and the test program authorized in FAR subpart 13.5, and the Patent and Trademark Acquisition Guidelines (PTAG). THIS ACQUISITION WILL BE CONDUCTED UTILIZING EXISTING USPTO'S INDEFINITE DELIVERY/INDEFINITE QUANITY (ID/IQ) CONTRACTS FOR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PRODUCTS, A SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE.      


The USPTO uses several classes of server platforms to run Automated Information Systems in the OCIO datacenter.   A large class of USPTO rack mounted servers based on the x86-64 CPU architecture offered by Intel and AMD supports the Microsoft, Linux or VMware ESX operating systems.  Some of the larger manufacturers of x86-64 CPU computers are Dell, HP, IBM and Sun Microsystems.  While the x86-64 CPU technology allows some standardization with regard to operating systems and resident software, these rack mounted  servers are not pure commodities because the server product line of each manufacturer can vary significantly in physical form, hardware interfaces, supported integrated peripheral functionality and firmware maintenance, diagnostic and monitoring tools.

USPTO currently maintains the Data Center which has asset value of approximately $100 million. Currently of approximately 1,350 rack mounted x86-64 servers maintained in the Data Center, more than 1,100greater than 80%--of the servers are manufactured by Dell.  To manage and maintain these systems, the OCIO requires sufficient staff with training for each supported vendors platform.  The engineering team requires similar staffing to evaluate new hardware for performance and compatibility.  Different hardware support contracts are needed for each server vendor.  Additionally, a large variety of platforms can hinder the quick diagnosis and recovery of failures within the datacenter.  It is not cost effective for OCIO to support x86-64 CPU rack mounted servers and the required maintenance, diagnostic and monitoring tools from all vendors.  To curtail operational cost growth and improve data center operations, the OCIO requires limiting the acquisition of x86-64 CPU rack mounted servers to those compatible with the currently installed base of Dell rack mounted servers.  This project will procure Dell PowerEdge servers in the 2970, R805 and R905 models.

<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of Acceptable, Reasonably Susceptible of Being Made Acceptable, or Unacceptable. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:<br />Factor 1 - Organizational Representatives. This factor is met when the Offeror provides a listing, in hierarchical succession, of the Offeror's points of contact delegated specifically for this requirement. Listing includes the titles, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses for each representative. List shall include both contracting and technical representatives.<br />Factor 2 - Interconnection Agreements. This factor is met when the Offeror provides documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort and states whether Offeror is a facilities based firm, non-facilities based firm, or both.<br />Factor 3 - Evidence of Certification. This factor is met when the Offeror provides documentation and/or a direct internet link showing that Offeror is a Local Exchange Carrier certificated by the affiliated state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide the services for this requirement.<br />Factor 4 - Local Communications Services. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW requirements.</p>
<p>(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(iv) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(v) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -- No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).</p>
<p>Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition to include the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-4 ADDENDUM to 52.212-4 - Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items Mar 2009<br />(e) Definitions.<br />(1) "Common Carrier" means any entity engaged in the business of providing telecommunications services, which are regulated by the Federal Communications Commission or other governmental body.<br />(2)"Noncommon Carrier" means any entity other than a common carrier offering telecommunications facilities, services, or equipment for lease.<br />(3) "Governmental regulatory body" means the Federal Communications Commission, any statewide regulatory body, or any body with less than statewide jurisdiction when operating under the state authority. Regulatory bodies whose decisions are not subject to judicial appeal and regulatory bodies, which regulate a company owned by the same entity, which creates the regulatory body are not "governmental regulatory bodies."<br />(4) "Special Service" normally involves a common carrier providing a special service or facility related to the performance of the basic telecommunications service requirements. This may include (i) moving or relocating equipment, (ii) providing temporary facilities, (iii) expediting provision of facilities, or (iv) providing specially constructed channel facilities to meet Government requirements. <br />(5) "Telecommunications services" means the services acquired, whether by lease or contract, to meet the Governments telecommunications needs. The term includes the telecommunications facilities and equipment necessary to provide such services.<br />(u) Reporting of Funds. This contractual vehicle is used to authorize local communications services and does not obligate funds. The funded amount(s) indicate the yearly authorization totals for reporting purposes only.<br />(v) Tariff Information. <br />(1) The Contractor shall provide to the Contracting Officer-<br />(i) Upon request, a copy of the Contractor's current existing tariffs (including changes);<br />(ii) Before filing, any application to a Federal, State, or any other regulatory agency for new or changes to, applicable rates, charges, services, or regulations relating to any CSA or any of the facilities or services to be furnished solely or primarily to the Government; and<br />(iii) Upon request, a copy of all information, material, and data developed or prepared in support of or in connection with an application under paragraph (a)(2) of this clause.<br />(2) The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer of any application that anyone other than the Contractor files with a governmental regulatory body, which affects or will affect the rate or conditions of services under this contract. These requirements also apply to applications pending on the effective date of this contract.<br />(3) Public Utilities Commission (PUC) Authorization. All Offerors shall be facility-based local exchange carriers certificated (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority) with the state PUC where services are being provided.

A firm-fixed-price contract provides for a price that is not subject to any adjustment on the basis of the contractor's cost experience including tariff changes in performing the contract. If the prices differ from established tariff prices then it is the responsibility of the vendor to either file a special tariff for the contract with the relevant governmental authorities or to make other arrangements to comply with the governmental requirements. The Air Force will not be liable for price increases for failure to follow these requirements.<br />(C) All taxes, fees, and surcharges are subject to applicable tariff rates and charges. If such rates are applicable to this contract, the contractor must notify 38 EIG/PKK for authorization on the CSA before invoicing the customer. <br />(ii) The Government shall not prepay for services.<br />(iii) Recurring charges for services and facilities shall, in each case, start with the satisfactory beginning of service or provision of facilities or equipment and are payable monthly in arrears.<br />(iv) Subject to the Cancellation or Termination of Orders clause 252.239-7007, of this agreement/contract, the Government may stop the use of any service or facilities furnished under this agreement/contract at any time. The Government shall pay the contractor all charges for services and facilities adjusted to the effective date of discontinuance.<br />(v) Expediting charges are costs necessary to get services earlier than normal. Examples are overtime pay or special shipment. When authorized, expediting charges shall be the additional costs incurred by the Contractor and the subcontractor. The Government shall pay expediting charges only when-<br />(A) They are provided for in the tariff established by a governmental regulatory body; or<br />(B) They are authorized in a communication service authorization or other contractual document.<br />(vi) When services normally provided are technically unacceptable and the development, fabrication, or manufacture of special equipment is required, the Government may-<br />(A) Provide the equipment; or<br />(B) Direct the Contractor to acquire the equipment or facilities. If the Contractor acquires the equipment or facilities, the acquisition shall be competitive, if practicable.<br />(vii) If at any time the Government defers or changes its orders for any of the services but does not cancel or terminate them, the amount paid or payable to the Contractor for the services deferred or modified shall be equitably adjusted at the time of deferral or change.

These rates will remain firm fixed price during this process. This provision may be exercised more than once, but the total extension of performance hereunder shall not exceed 6 months. The Contracting Officer may exercise this provision by unilateral modification to the contract before 10 days of expiration.<br />(4)The Contractor recognizes that the services under this contract are vital to the Government and must be continued without interruption and that, before contract expiration, a successor, either the Government or another Contractor, may continue them. The Contractor agrees to -<br />(i) Provide transitioning of services during cutover period without termination liability charges; <br />(ii) Exercise its best efforts and cooperation to effect an orderly and efficient transition to a successor; and<br />(iii) Notify the Government of any services not cutover after contract expiration.<br />(x) Work Orders. Requirements for service provided hereunder will be forwarded to the Contractor through issuance of a local order (DD Form 1367 or a similar form). A local order will also be issued for termination or changes to services. Services provided without a local order are not contractually covered. Services may be ordered only as shown on the CSA Schedule B. Orders must be signed by the Communications Systems Officer or designee.<br />(y) Posting Award Documents. Per FAR 5.303 and FAR 15.503(b), local announcements of contract awards, including Schedule Bs, are posted on Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) at https://www.fbo.gov/.

This factor is met when the Offeror provides documentation and/or a direct internet link showing that Offeror is a Local Exchange Carrier certificated by the affiliated state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide the services for this requirement.<br />Factor 4 - Local Communications Services. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW requirements.</p>
<p>(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(iv) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(v) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -- No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).</p>
<p>Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition to include the following addendum.</p>

Regulatory bodies whose decisions are not subject to judicial appeal and regulatory bodies, which regulate a company owned by the same entity, which creates the regulatory body are not "governmental regulatory bodies."<br />(4) "Special Service" normally involves a common carrier providing a special service or facility related to the performance of the basic telecommunications service requirements. This may include (i) moving or relocating equipment, (ii) providing temporary facilities, (iii) expediting provision of facilities, or (iv) providing specially constructed channel facilities to meet Government requirements. <br />(5) "Telecommunications services" means the services acquired, whether by lease or contract, to meet the Governments telecommunications needs.

The Government shall pay the contractor all charges for services and facilities adjusted to the effective date of discontinuance.<br />(v) Expediting charges are costs necessary to get services earlier than normal. Examples are overtime pay or special shipment. When authorized, expediting charges shall be the additional costs incurred by the Contractor and the subcontractor. The Government shall pay expediting charges only when-<br />(A) They are provided for in the tariff established by a governmental regulatory body; or<br />(B) They are authorized in a communication service authorization or other contractual document.<br />(vi) When services normally provided are technically unacceptable and the development, fabrication, or manufacture of special equipment is required, the Government may-<br />(A) Provide the equipment; or<br />(B) Direct the Contractor to acquire the equipment or facilities. If the Contractor acquires the equipment or facilities, the acquisition shall be competitive, if practicable.<br />(vii) If at any time the Government defers or changes its orders for any of the services but does not cancel or terminate them, the amount paid or payable to the Contractor for the services deferred or modified shall be equitably adjusted at the time of deferral or change.

The Contracting Officer may exercise this provision by unilateral modification to the contract before 10 days of expiration.<br />(4)The Contractor recognizes that the services under this contract are vital to the Government and must be continued without interruption and that, before contract expiration, a successor, either the Government or another Contractor, may continue them. The Contractor agrees to -<br />(i) Provide transitioning of services during cutover period without termination liability charges; <br />(ii) Exercise its best efforts and cooperation to effect an orderly and efficient transition to a successor; and<br />(iii) Notify the Government of any services not cutover after contract expiration.<br />(x) Work Orders.

A local order will also be issued for termination or changes to services. Services provided without a local order are not contractually covered. Services may be ordered only as shown on the CSA Schedule B. Orders must be signed by the Communications Systems Officer or designee.<br />(y) Posting Award Documents. Per FAR 5.303 and FAR 15.503(b), local announcements of contract awards, including Schedule Bs, are posted on Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) at https://www.fbo.gov/.

<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of Acceptable, Reasonably Susceptible of Being Made Acceptable, or Unacceptable. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:<br />Factor 1 - Organizational Representatives. This factor is met when the Offeror provides a listing, in hierarchical succession, of the Offeror's points of contact delegated specifically for this requirement. Listing includes the titles, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses for each representative. List shall include both contracting and technical representatives.<br />Factor 2 - Interconnection Agreements. This factor is met when the Offeror provides documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort and states whether Offeror is a facilities based firm, non-facilities based firm, or both.<br />Factor 3 - Evidence of Certification. This factor is met when the Offeror provides documentation and/or a direct internet link showing that Offeror is a Local Exchange Carrier certificated by the affiliated state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide the services for this requirement.<br />Factor 4 - Local Communications Services. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW requirements.</p>
<p>(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(iv) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(v) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -- No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).</p>

<p>PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of Acceptable, Reasonably Susceptible of Being Made Acceptable, or Unacceptable. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:<br />Factor 1 - Organizational Representatives. This factor is met when the Offeror provides a listing, in hierarchical succession, of the Offeror's points of contact delegated specifically for this requirement. Listing includes the titles, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses for each representative. List shall include both contracting and technical representatives.<br />Factor 2 - Interconnection Agreements. This factor is met when the Offeror provides documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort and states whether Offeror is a facilities based firm, non-facilities based firm, or both.<br />Factor 3 - Evidence of Certification. This factor is met when the Offeror provides documentation and/or a direct internet link showing that Offeror is a Local Exchange Carrier certificated by the affiliated state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide the services for this requirement.<br />Factor 4 - Local Communications Services. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW requirements.</p>
<p>(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(iv) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(v) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -- No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned.

Services may be ordered only as shown on the CSA Schedule B. Orders must be signed by the Communications Systems Officer or designee.<br />(y) Posting Award Documents. Per FAR 5.303 and FAR 15.503(b), local announcements of contract awards, including Schedule Bs, are posted on Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) at https://www.fbo.gov/.

<p>PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of Acceptable, Reasonably Susceptible of Being Made Acceptable, or Unacceptable. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:<br />Factor 1 - Organizational Representatives. This factor is met when the Offeror provides a listing, in hierarchical succession, of the Offeror's points of contact delegated specifically for this requirement. Listing includes the titles, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses for each representative. List shall include both contracting and technical representatives.<br />Factor 2 - Interconnection Agreements. This factor is met when the Offeror provides documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort and states whether Offeror is a facilities based firm, non-facilities based firm, or both.<br />Factor 3 - Evidence of Certification. This factor is met when the Offeror provides documentation and/or a direct internet link showing that Offeror is a Local Exchange Carrier certificated by the affiliated state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide the services for this requirement.<br />Factor 4 - Local Communications Services. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW requirements.</p>
<p>(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(iv) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(v) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -- No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).</p>

<p>As prescribed in 12.302(d) the following addenda is provided for solicitation provision FAR 52.212-1 and hereby amends any language therein:<br />INSTRUCTIONS TO VENDORS -- COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JUN 2008) <br />*the term "solicitation" hereby references this combined synopsis solicitation*<br />(a) North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code and small business size standard. The NAICS code and small business size standard for this acquisition appear in Block 10 of the solicitation cover sheet (SF 1449). However, the small business size standard for a concern which submits an offer in its own name, but which proposes to furnish an item which it did not itself manufacture, is 500 employees.<br />(b) Submission of quotations. Submit quotations to the office specified in this solicitation on or before the date specified in this solicitation. Quotations may be submitted on the SF 1449, letterhead stationery, or as otherwise specified in the solicitation. As a minimum, offers must show --<br />(1) The solicitation number;<br />(2) The date specified in the solicitation for receipt of quotations;<br />(3) The name, address, and telephone number of the vendor;<br />(4) A technical description of the items being quoted in sufficient detail to evaluate compliance with the requirements in the solicitation. This may include product literature, or other documents, if necessary;<br />(5) Terms of any express warranty;<br />(6) Price and any discount terms;<br />(7) "Remit to" address, if different than mailing address;<br />(8) A completed copy of the representations and certifications at FAR 52.212-3 (see FAR 52.212-3(b) for those representations and certifications that the offeror shall complete electronically);<br />(9) Acknowledgment of Solicitation Amendments;<br />(10) Reserved<br />(11) If the quotation is not submitted on the SF 1449, include a statement specifying the extent of agreement with all terms, conditions, and provisions included in the solicitation. Vendors that fail to furnish required representations or information, or reject the terms and conditions of the solicitation may be excluded from consideration.<br />(c) Period for validity of quotations. The vendor agrees to establish a firm timeframe in which the proposed price is good for.<br />(d) Reserved<br />(e) Multiple quotations. Vendors are encouraged to submit multiple quotations presenting alternative terms and conditions or commercial items for satisfying the requirements of this solicitation. Each quotation submitted will be evaluated separately.<br />(f) Reserved<br />(g) Contract award (not applicable to Invitation for Bids). The Government intends to evaluate quotations as described in FAR 13.106-2. Therefore, the vendor's initial quote should contain the vendor's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. The Government may accept other than the lowest quote; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in quotes received. <br />(h) Reserved<br />(j) Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) Number. (Applies to all quotations exceeding $3,000, and quotations of $3,000 or less if the solicitation requires the Contractor to be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database. The vendor shall enter, in the block with its name and address on the cover page of its quotation, the annotation ``DUNS'' or ``DUNS +4'' followed by the DUNS or DUNS +4 number that identifies the vendor's name and address. The DUNS +4 is the DUNS number plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned at the discretion of the vendor to establish additional CCR records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see FAR Subpart 32.11) for the same concern. If the vendor does not have a DUNS number, it should contact Dun and Bradstreet directly to obtain one. A vendor within the United States may contact Dun and Bradstreet by calling 1-866-705-5711 or via the internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform. A vendor located outside the United States must contact the local Dun and Bradstreet office for a DUNS number. The vendor should indicate that it is a vendor for a Government contract when contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office.<br />(k) Central Contractor Registration. Unless exempted by an addendum to this solicitation, by submission of a quotation, the vendor acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee shall be registered in the CCR database prior to award, during performance and through final payment of any contract resulting from this solicitation. If the vendor does not become registered in the CCR database in the time prescribed by the Contracting Officer, the Contracting Officer will proceed to award to the next otherwise successful registered vendor. Vendors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the Internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423 or 269-961-5757.<br />(l) Reserved<br />(End of Provision)<br />In accordance with FAR 13.004 -- Legal Effect of Quotations the following information is provided in regards to quotations.<br />A quotation is not an offer and, consequently, cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Therefore, issuance by the Government of an order in response to a supplier's quotation does not establish a contract. The order is an offer by the Government to the supplier to buy certain supplies or services upon specified terms and conditions. A contract is established when the supplier accepts the offer.<br />When appropriate, the contracting officer may ask the supplier to indicate acceptance of an order by notification to the Government, preferably in writing. In other circumstances, the supplier may indicate acceptance by furnishing the supplies or services ordered or by proceeding with the work to the point where substantial performance has occurred.<br />If the Government issues an order resulting from a quotation, the Government may (by written notice to the supplier, at any time before acceptance occurs) withdraw, amend, or cancel its offer.</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation HSCG85-09-Q-625838 for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and quotations are being requested.  The Request for Quotations incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 01-19.  This is a Small Business set-aside procurement.  The NAICS is 721110.  It is the policy of the U.S. Coast Guard to issue solicitation and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman program for Agency protest (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the general Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting Officer or Ombudsman.  

Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant Contracting Officer.  If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following to the Ombudsman:  solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).

Formal Agency Protest with Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use theirs best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester falls to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under OPAP program should be forwarded to the address:  Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington, D.C. 20593, telephone (202) 267-2285, Fax: (202) 267-4011.

OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman;  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.

If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).

Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional cost that otherwise would not occur. 
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:  "Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears.  "Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
"Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;  (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held-  (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and  (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.  Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.  (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:  (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296.  (2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.  (3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 
(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships.

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights.

(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).

<DESC>This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation and Notice of Intent.  The Government intends to award a firm fixed price (FFP) contract for a one year satellite capability to track vessels in near real time in order to provide better intransit visibility to the warfighter under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  This will be in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6, in conjunction with FAR 13.5, as applicable, and as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a separate written solicitation will not be issued.  Submit quotes on HTC711-09-Q-0180.  The solicitation documents and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-31, dated 19 March 2009.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 517919 and the small business size is $25M.  

SDDC and USTRANSCOM require the capability to track vessels in near real-time in order to provide better intransit visibility to the warfighter. Justification: Current tracking capability is based on individual vessel 'pings' to buoys within various locations worldwide. If an area does not have buoys (for example, around Somolia coastline), we do not have visibility of DOD shipments within that area. This service is based on satellite feeds, not buoys, so the data is more complete.  Supply of hourly webservice for all vessels in satellite coverage worldwide.  Period of performance of 1 April 2009 thru 31 March 2010.  FOB Point shall be Destination, Scott AFB IL.  Delivery location is SDDC, 709 Ward Drive, Scott AFB IL 62225.  

The following FAR and DFARS provisions and clauses apply to this acquisition: FAR 52.204 By submission of an offer, the offeror acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee shall be registered in the CCR database prior to award, during performance, and through final payment of any contract, basic agreement, basic ordering agreement, or blanket purchase agreement resulting from this solicitation; FAR 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-5 Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders Commercial Items; DFARS 252.204-7004 Alternate A Central Contractor Registration; 252.212-7001 Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes of Executive Orders Applicable to Defense Acquisitions or Commercial Items (DEVIATION).

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). 

Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

GSA anticipates using funds from the pending FY 2009 Omnibus Appropriations Act for this project and partial funding with funds from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act ("Recovery Act") of 2009. Accordingly, the contract will be subject to unprecedented levels of transparency and accountability so Americans know where their tax dollars are going and how they are being spent. Mechanisms through special contract terms and conditions will be implemented to accurately track, monitor and report on taxpayer funds. The Recovery Act requires extensive reporting from the prime recipients of Federal funding. This may include special Buy American Act requirements, additional requirements for contractor reporting, and expanded Government Accountability Office (GAO) and Office of Inspector General (OIG) access to contractor records. SEE ATTACHED MS WORD DOCUMENT FOR FINAL SYNOPSIS.</p>
