<DESC>NA This modification is issued for the purpose of answering questions received in response to a Broad Agency Announcement for the Joint Technology Office High Energy Laser Program.  Please note that the cut off date for full proposals has passed. 1.  Question:  When will the award(s) be announced, and if selected, when will the funding be received?  Answer:  Awards are scheduled to be made in the later part of May 2002.  Funding must be available before individual awards can be made. 2.Question: Is there a limit to the number of awards to small businesses and if so what is the limit? Answer:  There is no specific limit to the number of awards to small businesses. 3. Question: Two firms have requested extensions of the date date of the full proposals.  Will the full proposal be extended?  Answer:  No, the due date for the full proposals is still 10 January 2002, 2PM Eastern Standard Time. 4. Question: In regard to Volume1/Technical/Management, Section 5, background, it states --provide appropriate literature citations. . . . Is it OK to reference the requirement with a couple sentences in this section stating that the actual literature cita tions may be found in Annex A or is Annex A only for resumes?  Answer: Either place is OK. 5.  Question: Does the 15 page limitation for cost volume apply to baseline and options (making 30 page limitation in total) or is total combined limitation for both 15 pages. Answer: It is for the total for the prime contractor's proposal.  If there are s ubcontracts proposed, the offeror may add the required number of additional pages for each subcontractor in order to satisfy the requirements for cost information listed in the BAA. 6.Question:  Since the SF1411 equivalent is not required, should we assume financial/other disclosures are either not required or outside the 15 page limit? Answer:  The SF1411 equivalent should be included if over $500,000.  Financial/other disclosures are outside of the 15 page limit. 7. Question: The BAA states that Volume 1 page count includes all information i.e. indices, photographs, foldouts, appendices, etc.  However, the BAA does not state that the page count for Volume II includes these documents.  Does this mean that we can inc lude attachments to Volume II and not have it count toward the page limitation? Answer:  Attachnments for Volume II cost are not included in page limit for cost. 8. Question: Notwithstanding the statement in the BAA as stated in Question #1, the BAA further states that an annex should be included with our resumes and this will not count against the page count.  Please clarify. Answer: The annex does not count again st the page limit. 9.  Question:  The directions for volume II state that subcontractor proposals should be included; however, with a 15 page limitation, this could be problematic.  Would a summary of the subcontractors and their quotations satisfy or can the full quotations  be excluded from the page count?  Answer: Subcontractors information does not count against the 15 page limitation. 10. Question: Monthly progress reports are stated to be due 5 days after the end of the month. In order to provide meaningful progress data, 30 days is often needed. Is it acceptable for proposals to state the assumed submittal data for data items? Answer:  Monthly reports are due on the 15th day of the following month. This would be stated in any resulting contract. 11.  Question: The maximum page count for the cost proposal is 15 pages. Are subcontractor proposals included in this page count? Since subcontractors need to submit detail of their pricing to us, this could impact the number of pages. Could their proposal s be submitted as attachments that are not included in the page count? Answer: Subcontractor proposals are not included in the page count.  The page count is for the prime only. 12. Question: Do subcontractors proposals need to be submitted electronically with the prime submittal? And, do their proposals need to be includ ed

<DESC>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) intends to negotiate with the North Carolina State Highway Patrol.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is initiating a study to evaluate the effectiveness of two Federal new motor vehicle standards (FMVSS) (1) antilock brake systems on commercial vehicles (e.g., medium/heavy duty trucks) and (2) upgrade strength, configuration and energy absorption requirements for commercial trailer rear impact guards. The two studies are entitled "Evaluation of Antilock Brake Systems (ABS) for Heavy Trucks" and "Evaluation of Rear Impact Guards (RIGs) for Truck Trailers". The data collection for both studies will be conduced simultaneously as the relevant RIGs crash data (rear impact crash type) is a subset of the ABS crash data (all crash types). This will allow for efficient, cost-effective data collection. In order to carry out the evaluation studies, data is required on highway crashes involving commercial vehicles (e.g., medium duty heavy duty trucks such as single unit trucks, combination trucks, bobtail tractors, etc.). A portion of the data required for analysis is contained in the Police Crash Reporting Form (PCR) used by State Law Enforcement Agencies, but other data elements such as pre-crash maneuvers, trailer VIN, trailer MIL lamp, cargo load etc. will require a supplement data form to be completed by crash investigators at the crash scene. Interested firms should identify their capability to conduct the Crash Data Collection and Evaluation Study as described above. The written response must include detail information relating to the specific evaluation studies being requested. Expressions of interest without sufficient detail to permit evaluation of ones ability to accomplish the requested studies will not be considered. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations nor is a Request-for-Quotations solicitation document currently available. A determination by the Government not to compete this action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive contract. In the absence of responses from interested firms demonstrating their capability, NHTSA intends to request a quotation from the North Carolina State Highway Patrol on a noncompetitive basis for the work described. Responses must be received by the listed procuring office within 15 days from the date of publication of this notice.

<DESC>This is a written Request for Quotation (RFQ) No.CON-02-0003 pursuant to procurement of the required services described below using the Simplified Acquisition Procedures specified in Part 13 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).  Price quotations submitted in response to this RFQ that exceed the Simplified Acquisition Threshold (as specified in FAR Subpart 2.101, Definitions) will not be considered as responsive to this RFQ.  The Broadcasting Board of Governors, International Broadcasting Bureau (BBG/IBB) has a requirement for a contractor to obtain qualitative information on media habits and evaluations of Radio Mart? broadcasts by its regular or occasional listeners among Cubans traveling to the United States of America.  Scope of Work:  The contractor shall obtain the qualitative information through focus groups with recently-arrived Cuban travelers in the Greater Miami area, identifying and recruiting participants, arranging transportation to the contractor's focus group facility, professional moderation and analytical reporting of the results.  This qualitative research will provide BBG, IBB and Radio Mart? management with: (a) audience reaction to and suggestions for improving Radio Mart? programs; and (b) in-depth analysis of attitudes toward foreign and domestic media, sources of news and information, and Radio Mart? programs.  1.   General Specifications.   The contractor shall conduct a total of four focus group sessions, each with 8-10 participants and lasting approximately 2 hours.  Each group shall include roughly equal numbers of women and men, and at least two participants in each group shall be from each of the following age ranges: 18-29, 30-39, and 40 and older (if possible three participants each from the 18-29 and 30-39 groups).  All participants must be Cuban citizens with at least complete secondary education, and none shall have left Cuba more than 3 months prior to participation in a focus group (as many as possible of the participants should have arrived in the U.S. within the previous two months).  The contractor shall screen to minimize participation of recent political prisoners or others with outspoken political views whose involvement might bias group discussions.  As many of the groups as possible shall be composed of recently-arrived travelers who listened regularly (weekly) to Radio Mart? programs prior to leaving the island.  If it is not possible to recruit sufficient travelers who were recent regular listeners, regular radio listeners who have listened to Radio Mart? programs in the last 12 months (occasional listeners) may be recruited as necessary.  Separate groups shall be held with regular and occasional listeners (if sufficient numbers of regular listeners can be recruited).  The same moderator shall conduct all groups.  Participants will be given a self-completion questionnaire during sessions, and they will listen to brief in-session stimulus tapes of 20 to 30 minutes total duration.  The tapes will be supplied to the contractor by the IBB prior to the focus group sessions.   2.  Discussion Guide.  IBB will provide the contractor with a draft discussion guide, in Spanish, which will specify questions of basic interest and suggested sequencing. These issues shall include: daily lifestyle and media habits in Cuba, evaluation of the production style, presentation quality, and content of specific Radio Mart? programs, discussion of topic areas of interest to radio listeners, reasons for listening (and not listening) to Radio Mart? programs, and participant suggestions of possible strategies for improving Radio Mart? programs.  The contractor shall review and suggest revisions for final approval by IBB's Office of Research (P/NR).   3.  Identification and Recruitment of Participants.  The contractor will identify arriving Cuban travelers who meet recruitment criteria through direct contacts at Miami International Airport and/or other points of entry, or through referrals from publ

PMSW will be releasing a draft Request for Proposals (RFP) for Block II/III  of the Prophet system on or about 14 February 2002. The Block II/III Program is an upgrade to the Prophet Block I Production System. The Prophet Block II/III system is HMMWV based and shall provide full Block I functionality (the Block I frequency range i s 20 – 2000 MHz) and add the following Electronic Support (ES) capabilities:  ·	Demodulation and DF/LOB of TAS signals (Block I is capable of demodulating and DF/LOB AM, FM, CW and SSB single channel push-to-talk unencrypted transmissions) ·	Automatic identification of TCS, TAS and TOS signals in the specified frequency range All of the above functions must be performed while the vehicle is stationary and/or On-The-Move (OTM). The DF accuracy in the stationary Configuration shall be no greater than 100 RMS and the DF accuracy while OTM shall be no greater than 22.50 RMS. The sy stem shall be fully automated with a Human Machine Interface (HMI).  An Electronic Attack (EA) capability integrated with the ES functions is being considered as either a basic system requirement or a Better Value Capability (BVC). The above list represent s the major requirements being sought; the complete list of requirements will be documented in the RFP.  Maximum re-use of the Block I system and its sub-systems is encouraged and will be considered when evaluating proposals. All pertinent data that the Go vernment has obtained from the production contract will be made available to requesting contractors. The Government will offer all potential bidders access to utilize any/all applicable data, information and/or functionality from the current Block III Risk  Reduction/CAD Architecture efforts under contract with QinetiQ. (This access is limited to US and UK contractors.) QinetiQ will provide a briefing of their contracted activities at an Industry Day to be held on or about 21 February 2002. A standard data p ackage documenting QinetiQ’s efforts will be available for all potential bidders. (Note: Prospective Bidders need to notify a POC by 15 January 2002 of their planned attendance at Industry Day so the proper documentation can be processed). The Government r equires that any potential bidders have existing technology that meets the signal type and frequency range requirements noted above. To satisfy this requirement, all potential bidders need to participate in a demonstration of those capabilities to be condu cted in April/May 2002, at their own cost. Details on demonstration requirements will be included in the draft RFP.  The upcoming solicitation will be a full and open competition where the RFP defines the performance requirements of the system along with a  section defining better value capabilities. The better value capabilities should be stand-alone features in terms of pricing and potential for inclusion in the final system design. All contractors planning to respond to the solicitation must have the abil ity to handle, store and process Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI).  (2) The Government is seeking the widest possible response from industry.

<DESC>NA The U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command (USASMDC) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with SY Technology, Inc., of Huntsville, Alabama for development, deployment, operation and sustainment of the Site Activation Command (SAC) Coordination Center (SAC-CC) in support of the Site Activation Command, Ground-Based Midcourse Defense (GMD)-Joint Program Office (JPO), Huntsville, AL.  The proposed acquisition is directed to SY Technology, Inc., pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), as implemented by FA R 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii).  The selection of SY Technology, Inc., Inc. is based on the prior work performed by SY Technology, Inc., including requirements identification and preliminary design, and software development.  SY Technology, Inc, has developed an ext ensive knowledge base through a steep learning curve, and extensive interactions with the SAC.  Any source other than SY Technology would result in substantial increase in schedule risk as well as duplication of cost to the Government that cannot be recove red through competition.  It is highly improbable that other sources are available to duplicate the work already accomplished by the incumbent, to meet the Government's compressed activation schedule requirements and not disrupt current operations.  A Cost  Plus Fixed Fee, Award Term, Level of Effort type contract is contemplated.  The period of performance will consist of a five-year base period plus five (5) one-year Award Term years. The services required to meet the needs of the GMD-JPO include the continuation of the design activities which will proceed into software coding, integration and system test activities adhering to both system engineering and security requirements as direct ed by the government.  The contractor will complete the development of, and field, the site activation coordination center.  The contractor will establish a design lab to serve as a development environment to support future software releases and to provide  technical support to resolve field problems.  Development activities will include systems engineering, configuration management, security engineering, test and evaluation, certification and accreditation.   The Contractor shall travel as required to attend meetings, provide on-site support, and/or to interface with others to provide the above stated services.

Quoters are herein requested to submit written price quotations and technical capabilities/experience information for conducting an audience survey as outlined below. SECTION A: SCOPE OF WORK  1) Nature of Survey.  Audience data shall be obtained through a national survey of Spanish-speaking adults Peru that is designed to obtain the most accurate possible information about: the number of regular (i.e. weekly) and occasional listeners to VOA's broadcasts; the demographic characteristics and geographical distribution of the audience; the size of the regular and occasional listening audience for other international and domestic broadcasters; the previous-day usage patterns among audiences for radio and television broadcasts; awareness of international broadcasts available either directly or through local re-broadcasts; audience opinions as to the accuracy, reliability, quality, and relevance of programming from major radio and television broadcasters; and general patterns of media use.  The interviewing shall be face-to-face and conducted in the home of the respondent by a trained interviewer.  IBB will require demographic information on each respondent including, gender, age, education, and occupation. 2) General Responsibilities of Contractor.  The contractor will be responsible for the project design and execution, including the following specific tasks: a) translation, formatting,  pretesting, adaptation, and printing of IBB supplied questionnaires; b) developing the Sampling Plan; c) training interviewers; d) supervising fieldwork; e) cleaning and encoding survey responses; f) entering and processing the data; g) ascertaining the representativeness of the sample and weighting the data, if necessary; g) preparing cross-tabulations in data books; submitting data on diskette; and communicating all necessary information and results to IBB in a timely manner. 3) Sample Design.  Interested quoters are herein requested to submit price quotations for a sample of 2,000 adults, age 15 or older, representative by gender, age, and education of the adult Spanish-speaking population of Peru.  The sample shall be stratified to include sub-samples representative of each province.

Quotes shall describe the rationale for such proposed exclusions, as well as the estimated size of the population excluded, which should not total more than approximately 10% of the national population.  The sample shall be drawn using recognized probability methods, all the way down to the selection of the individual respondent at the household level.  Only one individual per household shall be selected, and at least three attempts shall be made to interview selected respondents before substitution is allowed.  A detailed Sampling Plan, including stratification criteria, description of the sampling frame, listing of anticipated Primary Sampling Units (PSUs), approximate number of interviews in each, procedures for selecting households within PSUs, and procedures for selecting individual respondents at the household level, shall be subm

<DESC>Air Force Research Laboratory, Materials and Manufacturing Directorate (AFRL/MLBC ) solicits research proposals for the effort "M&P for the Development of Structural/Multifunctional Carbon-Foam Applications".  The principal objective of this program is to identify and develop a structural/multifunctional application for carbon and/or graphitic foam and define the material/process/property relationships necessary to fulfill the requirements of the chosen application.  Identifying a transition path for the developed technology is also considered an important objective of the program.  The unique mechanical/thermal/electrical properties of carbon materials make carbon foam an attractive lightweight material for aircraft, space launch vehicles, and satellites requiring multifunctional material performance.  The properties of carbon/graphitic foams, however, strongly depend on the foam ligament (strut) geometry and its microstructure.  These are greatly affected by the processing method.  A variety of commercial methods exist for manufacturing carbon/graphitic foams displaying a wide variety of properties.  Proper choice of the foam manufacturing/processing method should lead to an optimum design for the given application.  Interested offerors may view and/or download the full PRDA solicitation by accessing the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOps) homepage at http://www.eps.gov/.  Direct questions to the Contracting point of contact identified in the announcement.

<DESC>The United States Department of Education has a requirement for a large, complex data collection.  The National Study of Faculty and Students [NSoFaS] is designed to collect  information on nationally representative samples of faculty, instructional staff and students. The study consists of two main components. The faculty and instructional staff component [Part A-NSoPF:2004] will be similar in scope to prior National Study of Postsecondary Faculty (NSOPF) data collections.  The student survey component [Part B-NPSaS:2004], will be similar to prior National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS) data collections, plus include state-representative samples of students enrolled at public 2-year, public 4-year, and private not-for-profit 4-year in 12 states. Data will be collected primarily via the web and include self-administered, telephone interview and web field work.  Although different modes of collection are anticipated, the system will be web-based. This study will result in documented data files, electronic codebooks, data analysis systems, and tabulations/descriptive reports for each main component.
 
The faculty and instructional staff component [Part A or NSoPF] will consist of a field test in 2002-03 and a full-scale sample in 2003-04. Data will be collected from a nationally representative sample of faculty and instructional staff in 2- and 4-year (and above) public and private, not-for-profit colleges and universities that are Title IV eligible, degree-granting institutions in the 50 states and the District of Columbia.  If additional funding becomes available, faculty and institutions in the private for-profit 4-year sector will be added to Part A.  

The student component [Part B or NPSaS] will consist of a field test in 2002-03 and a full-scale sample in 2003-04. NPSaS is a comprehensive nationwide study of how students and their families pay for postsecondary education.  It includes nationally representative samples of undergraduates, graduates, and first-professional students; students attending less-than-2-year institutions, community colleges, 4-year colleges, and major universities. For 2004, the sample will also include state-representative undergraduate student samples enrolled in public 2-year, public 4-year, and private not-for-profit 4-year institutions in California, Connecticut, Delaware, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Minnesota, Nebraska, New York, Oregon,Tennessee, and Texas. Students who receive financial aid and those who do not receive aid participate in NPSaS.  Results of the study are used to help determine federal policy regarding student financial aid.

<DESC>General Information: Document Type: 	Broad Agency Announcement Solicitation Number:	DAAE30-02-BAA-0700 Announcement Title:	Enhanced Delivery System-Air (EDS-A) Pre-bid Conference:	Dec 6, 2001 Posted Date:	Dec 21, 2001 Original Response Date:	Feb 15, 2002 Current Response Date:	Feb 15, 2002 Classification Code:	 Set Aside:	N/A Selection Announcement:	Mar 28, 2002 Contracting Office Address A. US Army Tank-automotive and Armaments Command, Armament Research, Development,  and Engineering Center (TACOM-ARDEC), Attn: AMSTA-AR-ASL (Chesnulovitch), Bld.  455; Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07806-5000 Description B. OBJECTIVE:  (1)	Background: The Container Roll On/ Roll Off Platform (CROP) has become  the Army’s standard means for moving ammunition.  It is a flat platform twenty  feet long by eighty-nine inches wide that has a large A-frame on one end.  This A-frame interfaces with a hydraulic lifting mechanism on a Palletized Loading System (PLS) truck or a Heavy Expanded Mobility Tactical Truck-Load Handling  System (HEMTT-LHS), and allows these vehicles to pick up the CROP and its load  and pull it up on to its chassis for transport.  The CROP will also fit into a twenty foot ISO container, locking itself in place for shipment on rail,  commercial trailer, or ship.  However, the current CROP was not made to  interface with aircraft logistics systems, which has recently become  necessary.  It will not fit in the tracks found on the aircraft and it is  relatively heavy, reducing the amount of ammunition that can be sent due to  weight allowances.  In general, airlifted ammunition takes too long and costs  too much to deliver to soldiers because the Army’s platforms (i.e., CROP) and  load handling trucks do not work with the Air Force’s airplanes.  Work-arounds  have been created, including the use of the 463L pallet and the  CROP-Aircraft  Interface Kit (CAIK), formerly known as the SLIPPER.  The 463L pallet was  designed specifically for use on aircraft.  It is approximately 2 inches thick  by 88 inches wide by 108 inches long with aircraft lock interfaces along each  side.  It will interface with both of the standard rail systems found on transportation aircraft, the 108-inch rail system and the 88-inch rail system.  In order to transport a CROP load of ammunition, the soldiers can either  offload the contents of a CROP onto 463L pallets, or attach three 463L pallets  together and place a loaded CROP on top.  The CROP-Aircraft Interface Kit  (CAIK) is a newly fielded piece of hardware.  It is essentially a pair of  adapter plates that attaches to the bottom of a CROP, one at each end, and  allows it to interface with the logistics systems on aircraft.  They weigh  about 200 pounds apiece, and interface with the CROP through ISO locks.  One  other feature of the CAIK is that they can be used to direct load or offload a  CROP from a C-17 using nothing but the PLS truck. (2) This BAA is soliciting for new and innovative ideas for the creation of the  Enhanced Delivery System- Air (EDS-A).   The EDS-A will be the complete  solution to the aforementioned problem.  It will resemble the current CROP,  maintaining all its existing capabilities, but it will add the ability to  interface with transportation aircraft.  Once fielded, the EDS-A will allow  seamless interfaces between all modes of transportation, including but not  limited to the HEMMT-LHS truck, ISO containers, and aircraft.   C. PROPOSAL PREPARATION INSTRUCTIONS: The cost of preparing proposal papers in  response to this announcement is not considered an allowable direct charge to  any other contract.  Unnecessarily elaborate brochures or proposals are not  desired.  Proposals are requested to contain no proprietary information as the  government wishes to share the information with commercial industry and other  government agencies.  Should the offeror wish to include proprietary  information, it is requested that they create a second document that includes  the proprietary informat

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be requir

<DESC>This notice is for information purposes only.  A draft program solicitation, as a precursor to potentially awarding multiple financial assistance cooperative agreements, is underway.  The Clean Coal Power Initiative (CCPI) is a cost-shared partnership between the government and industry to demonstrate advanced coal-based, power generation technologies.  The goal is to accelerate commercial deployment of advanced technologies to ensure the United States has clean, reliable, and affordable electricity.  This solicitation represents the first installment of Federal funding for the CCPI Program.  Following release of the draft solicitation, in December 2001, a comment and response session with potential industry partners will be conducted prior to final issuance of the program solicitation.  Final issuance of the program solicitation is slated for February 2002 with awards expected late in fiscal year 2003.  DOE will provide between $300-$400 million to fund the program, and industry must match (or exceed) the government cost share for every project.  The minimum cost share by the industrial participant is 50%, and must be at least 50% in each budget period.  Applicants proposing less than 75% cost sharing must submit a Repayment Agreement in accordance with the guidelines in the solicitation. Periods of performance for the projects are expected to be two to six years. Each project will be broken into four phases: Phase I-Project Definition, Phase II-Design, Phase III-Construction, and Phase IV-Demonstration.  This solicitation will be open to receive qualifying applications for a period of 150 days from the release of the final solicitation.  Applications will be evaluated and selections made by late December 2002.  The DRAFT solicitation, DE-PS26-02NT41428 will be available for downloading as a Word, WordPerfect 6.1 (Windows) and/or as an Adobe Portable Document Format (pdf) file via the DOE's Industry Interactive Procurement System (IIPS) on or about December 21, 2001.

Zysk, Contract Specialist, via the "Submit Question" feature in the IIPS Secured Services site at http://e-center.doe.gov.

The final solicitation will be made available on or about February 18, 2002.

<DESC>EPA is requesting that LifeLine version 1.1 software be modified by the Life Line Group (LLG) to allow the estimation of cumulative risk to pesticides in accordance with EPA/OPP Guidelines; perform a cumulative risk assessment for the organophosphorus pesticides; and revise user and technical documentation for the LifeLine software to reflect modification. Pesticides are chemicals that are deliberately introduced into the environment to prevent, destroy, repel or mitigate any pest.   As specified by the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) and the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) as amended by the Food Quality Protection Act (FQPA), a pesticide may be registered if its use will not result in unreasonable adverse effects or risks to humans or the environment.  the Health Effects Division (HED) of OPP within the EPA/OPP is charged with ensuring that "reasonable certainty of no harm" to human health and the environment will occur as a consequence of the use of pesticides in food production, processing, storage, and transporation.  Therefore, HED,must evaluate aggregate exposures, doses, and risks associated with the use of pesticide active ingredients. LifeLine Version 1.1 is a computer software system designed to evaluate aggregate exposure, doses, and risks associated with the use of a pesticide active ingredient for a period ranging from one day to a lifetime.  The LLG is the sole owner of the LifeLine software and holder of the copyright to the program.  It is anticipated that the government will award a sole source fixed price contract to LLG with a twelve month performance period.

<DESC>Additional Q&As regarding GS00A02PDR0001

1.	Question: In the Q&A you provided earlier today, the following question and its associated answer was presented as follows:

?Q: Under Task 1 and later under Deliverable it says ?up to three usability tests and up to four one-to-one interviews.  Does this really mean up to three focus groups and four sets of one-on-one usability tests ? one for each stakeholder group?  This makes more sense for what is typically done in usability testing.

A:  No.  We expect three focus groups and/or group usability sessions, up to three one-on-one usability tests, as well as four interviews with stakeholders.?

Our question is directly related to the three one-on-one usability tests.  Does this mean 1) no more than three individuals are involved in the one-on-one usability tests (three tests, three individuals), or 2) three separate test sessions made up of multiple one-on-one usability tests involving one individual per test?


Answer: Please refer to the Statement of Work which clearly states the deliverable as up to three usability tests and up to four one-to-one interviews.  Disregard the reference in the response of up to three one-on-one usability tests and three focus groups.  The only requirements are up to three usability tests and up to four one-to-one interviews.


2.	Question:  The following question and its associated answer was presented as follows:

?Q: How many designs or templates do you want?

  A:  We require up to 14 templates ? four levels into three customer segments plus two other customized pages.?

Our question is directly related to the four levels.  Would you please provide further clarification regarding your definition of the levels to ensure we respond appropriately to the requirement?

Answer:  The site hosts over one hundred pages.  Please refer to the existing site.  FirstGov is interested in your plan for template and page design.  Levels can be defined as index pages and sub pages related to them.

<DESC>This notice is a Request for Information only.  The Government may or may not issue a solicitation as a result of this announcement.  The Government will NOT pay for any information given in response to this call for information. BACKGROUND:  To satisfy increasing training demands without significantly impacting the training budget, the U.S. Army Simulation, Training and Instrumentation Command (STRICOM) is conducting market research by seeking innovative business solutions/training approaches to develop, maintain, operate, upgrade, and support flight simulation training for the Army Aviation Objective Flight School XXI (FSXXI), U.S. Army Aviation Center (USAAVNC), Ft. Rucker, AL.  The flight simulation training requirement consists of three parts: TH-67 High Fidelity Flight Simulators (HFFS), Advanced Aviation Institutional Training Simulators (AAITS), and a multi-function training staff.
The number of devices, functionality and fidelity (including motion cues) of the manned modules, visual system, and training environment capabilities for the TH-67 High Fidelity Flight Simulators (HFFS) must support individual/crew task training to standard in accordance with the Initial Entry Rotary Wing (IERW) course, Flight School XXI curriculum, and an estimated annual throughput of 1200 flight students.  The TH-67 simulators will be installed in Pratt Hall with the installation including the tear-down of 24 of the simulators currently installed in that building and shipping of those simulators to locations directed by the government.  A minimum of 24 AAITS are required and will be installed in the Aviation Warfighting Simulation Center (AWSC) (currently undergoing final construction).  The AAITS must be reconfigurable to the AH-64A Apache, AH-64D Longbow, UH-60A/L Blackhawk, CH-47D Chinook, and OH-58D Kiowa Warrior aircraft initially, and the RAH-66 Comanche aircraft eventually.  The AAITS functionality and fidelity (including motion cues), visual system, training environment, interoperability, and C4ISR capabilities must support individual/crew, collective, combined arms, and joint training requirements to include training individual/crew and collective tasks to standard in accordance with aircrew training manuals (ATM) and mission training plans (MTP).  A multi-function training staff is required to manage, support, schedule, maintain, operate and upgrade the TH-67 HFFS, the AAITS, and their associated facilities; develop training support packages (TSPs) and associated training scenario generation tools; develop tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP); develop combined arms training strategies (CATS); and provide training support in terms of battlemaster, semi-automated forces, role play, and instructor/operator activities.  This announcement seeks innovative acquisition strategies for the development, operation, maintenance, and life cycle support and upgrade of the flight simulators required for the Army Aviation Objective Flight School XXI (FSXXI) at reasonable pricing with increased efficiencies.  All interested business concerns shall indicate interest by providing company name, business size, mailing address, phone number, electronic mailing address, and a brief synopsis of company capabilities and your innovative approach to this potential acquisition to: Mr. Larry J. Grauert, Contracting Officer, larry_grauert@stricom.army.mil, Mr. Mac Whisner, Contracting Officer, mac_whisner@stricom.army.mil, and to Mr. Bernard Gajkowski, Deputy Product Manager Air and Command Tactical Trainers, bernard_gajkowski@stricom.army.mil.  Your response to this notice must be received not later than 11 January 2002.  Upon receipt and review of your interest, the Government may allow your firm to schedule an appointment with a Government team at STRICOM, Orlando, FL, during January/February 2002 to fully brief your innovative approach to these flight simulator requirements.

<DESC>The US Geological Survey (USGS) anticipates entering into non-competitive negotiations with the University of Idaho (UI) located at the University of Idaho Research Park in Post Falls, Idaho, for 3,786 square feet of office and 4,000 square feet of parking/outside storage space.  The subject space will be in support of an ongoing cooperative project between USGS and the University of Idaho and will be located directly on the University of Idaho Research Park, 721 Lochsa Street, Post Falls. USGS and UI routinely collaborate on projects associated with the evaluation of metal contaminants in the Spokane and Coeur d'Alene River Basins and the protection of endangered fish species in the Kootenai River. Projects benefiting USGS by working directly at the Research Park include the Lower Coeur d'Alene metals transport study, Coeur d'Alene Basin abandoned mine lands studies, and the Kootenai River white sturgeon recovery study. Co-location of USGS and UI scientists jointly working on these projects will greatly improve their ability to share information and ideas, which in turn will result in better scientific understanding of the processes being studied. Other benefits include USGS participation in UI graduate programs as both students and instructors. On-site shared resources available to USGS personnel at the Research Park include access to the UI's interactive compressed video system; a state-of-the-art telecommunications system that would facilitate real-time meetings, conferences, workshops, and training, with interactive access to participants throughout the state. USGS will gain access to the University of Idaho's laboratory, located in the Research Park, to perform various water quality analyses and water sample preparation processes. USGS will have access to University owned scientific and research equipment such as survey-grade GPS's and acoustic Doppler velocimeters that would enhance ability to conduct water resources investigations in the area.  The lease term will be ten years.  Suppliers who believe they can provide the required space with the same university privileges are invited to submit an affirmative response by February 01, 2002 in accordance with note 22.  All such responses will be evaluated in order to determine whether that supplier has full knowledge and capabilities to meet requirements of USGS.  An affirmative response should be provided to the point of contact: Kevin Brenot, Phone 650-329-4126 or Susan Moser, Phone 650-329-4051.  This notice is for information purposes only.  Request for Proposal (RFP) is not available.  This notice may represent the Government's only official notice of this procurement.  See note 22. *****

<DESC>NASA/Kennedy Space Center (KSC) is hereby soliciting information for potential sources to provide launch services for NASA's Space Technology 5 (ST5) mission.  This mission consists of placing a three-satellite constellation into Geosynchronous Transfer Orbit (GTO) to test methods for operating a constellation of spacecraft as a single system.  Each of the satellites will weigh approximately 40 kg including spacecraft separation system, with dimensions of 51 cm flat-to-flat octagon by 31 cm height for the spacecraft.  With the separation system in place the octagon flat-to-flat dimension is 60 cm.  Further details of the ST5 mission are available on the Internet at http://nmp.jpl.nasa.gov/st5. The ST5 mission is planned for launch in 2004 as a secondary payload on an expendable launch vehicle.   Launch services are defined as all hardware and services necessary to place the payload into the defined GTO and include the launch vehicle as well as payload/launch vehicle integration services, launch preparations, and launch to GTO.   NASA seeks a launch vehicle that has demonstrated at least one successful flight in the launch configuration to be used prior to NASA's use. In reviewing launch service capability, NASA will consider payload adapter design and maturity, cost, manufacture schedule, date of first available launch service commitment, demonstrated launch history, and other launch service aspects.   NASA's intent is to utilize existing commercial launch service capabilities and processes to the maximum extent possible; however, NASA will also define requirements for necessary oversight and data gathering functions. Companies having the existing specialized capabilities to meet the requirements described above for flight of secondary payloads to GTO are encouraged to submit a capability statement indicating their ability to perform the mission.  Responses must include the following: name and address of firm, size of business; average annual revenue for the past 3 years and number of employees; ownership; whether they are large, small, small disadvantaged, 8(a), HUBZone, Veteran-owned, and/or woman-owned; number of years in business; listing of relevant work performed during the last three years, provide contract numbers, contract type, dollar value of each, and point of contact - address and phone number; and a description of the ST5 secondary payload opportunity (2004 launch opportunities, firm contract in place, prior/planned flight history, estimated secondary launch costs).  Please advise if the requirement is considered to be a commercial or commercial-type product or service. A commercial item is defined in Internet "Note A".  This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for information solicited.  Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation.  Respondents deemed fully qualified will be considered in any resultant solicitation for the requirement.   The Government reserves the right to consider a small business or 8(a) set-aside based on responses hereto.  All information should be submitted via e-mail or mail (Mailing address - JFK Space Center, NASA; Attn:  Terrance Crowley; Mail Code: OP-OS-ELV; KSC, FL 32899) no later than January 15, 2002.  In responding please refer to ST5.  Any referenced notes can be viewed at the following URL: http://genesis.gsfc.nasa.gov/nasanote.html No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If a solicitation is released it will be synopsized on the Government wide point of entry (GPE) and on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service. It is the potential offerors' responsibility to monitor these sites for the release of any solicitation or synopsis.   The GPE can be accessed via the Internet at http://www.fedbizopps.gov.

<DESC>Market Research -- coreFLS Staff Readiness Assessment and Training Initiative (RESTRICED TO CURRENT FSS CONTRACT HOLDERS ONLY) -- I.  Background - The Department of Veterans Affairs core Financial and Logistics System (coreFLS) Project is designed to meet the VA's long-recognized need for a fully integrated financial and logistics system to provide accurate, timely responses to the many related information needs existing throughout the Department.  The system consists of Oracle Federal Financials as well as Oracle Project Accounting and Oracle Fixed Assets, Asset Management Software (Maximo), Medical Inventory Management Software (DynaMed), and an Oracle Public Sector contracting management software package.  The coreFLS program is committed to developing and delivering quality, just in time training.  This implementation will affect over 100,000 end-users in areas such as Fiscal, SPD, supply, warehouse, maintenance and engineering throughout the United States.  A significant project management effort is required in the design, development, and delivery of training to meet the needs of this large geographically diverse end user audience.  To date VA has not been able to locate an Oracle implementation of a similar magnitude.  The VA coreFLS Team currently holds a limited Oracle Tutor license to evaluate the feasibility of using this software for online help and documentation. VA is seeking a current GSA schedule holder to assist VA in meeting the training requirements for implementation of the system (Oracle Federal Financials Oracle Project Accounting and Oracle Fixed Assets, Maximo Asset Management and DynaMed Medical Inventory management and Oracle Contract management).   The numerous deliverables will include but may not be limited to the following; 1. Conducting a Training Analysis addressing critical issues such as, * End-users profile, * System documentation, * Business process reengineering, * Training strategies, * Current coreFLS cutover project plans, * Existing VA resources, * Geographic considerations, * Magnitude of the project and support issues.  The training analysis will establish the coreFLS training vision, include near and long-term issues and encompass all software solutions within coreFLS.  2. Using existing help and documentation resources to develop and provide end-users access to online help and process information from within the coreFLS application.  3. Developing web-based courses, to provide end-users with knowledge of coreFLS applications and navigation. 4. Developing comprehensive Curriculum Maps, which outline those elements critical to a successful training curriculum such as: * Course development which supports identified end-user job roles, * Objectives, * Targeted audience, * Training modalities with strategies for delivery-  i. Identify type, ii. Number of training hours/days, iii. Required resource materials and personnel, iv. Delivery strategies to support scheduled deployment plan * Comprehensive curriculum and implementation plan. 5. Developing end-user's training materials such as, * Instructor guides, * End-users manuals, * Job aides, * Electronic training media 6. Conducting instructor led training classes as necessary which includes, * Documenting participation, * Conducting course evaluation, * Scheduling and announcing course dates, * Allowing VA to audit and interview potential class instructors.  VA is looking for firms with recent relevant experience performing the aforementioned tasks. This experience should also include: * Significant experience in designing support strategies and training solutions for Oracle clients in a large organization with geographically dispersed sites, a large number of employees and diverse end users.  * Experience in working with and providing training on Maximo and on Dynamed is also highly desirable. II.  To Respond to this research request and indicate interest, please provide the following by not later than January 16, 2002: 1. General Infor

<DESC>The Social Security Administration (SSA) is considering acquiring the services of a contractor who has the capability and resources to effectively and efficiently detect unreported depository accounts at financial institutions.  The anticipated period of performance is for a base year with 2 one-year options.  The Request for Proposal (RFP) for this requirement is scheduled for release on or about April 30, 2002; proposals will be required 30 days thereafter.  Today there are more than 6.7 million Federal Supplemental Security Income (SSI) recipients in the United States.  To be eligible for SSI benefits, recipients must meet specific income and resource criteria.  To determine the initial and continuing entitlement to benefits, SSA needs to verify both the income and assets of these recipients.  As part of its plan to improve management of the SSI program, SSA is exploring ways to make the current financial institution account verification process more efficient and effective.  The objective is to devise a means of detecting unreported depository accounts at financial institutions using the customers name and social security number as the identifying information.  It is believed this process will save significant taxpayer dollars by avoiding benefit payments to ineligible recipients.  Under Section 213 (Access to Information Held by Financial Institutions) of the Foster Care Independence Act of 1999 (Public Law 106-169), SSA was provided with the right to obtain from any financial institution any record concerning an applicant?s or recipient?s eligibility to benefits.  It allows SSA to obtain the information without furnishing the financial institution a copy of the authorization.  Requests submitted under this provision are deemed to meet the requirements of the Right to Financial Privacy Act.  To date, Thomson Financial Publishing located at 4709 West Golf Road, 6th Floor, Skokie, Illinois, 60076 is the only company identified by SSA that has the capability for detecting unreported depository accounts at financial institutions using the customers name and social security number as the identifying information.  Thomson Financial Publishing serves as the Official Registrar of the Routing Number System for the American Bankers Association (ABA); they are purportedly the single source for assigning and retiring routing numbers for every institution that meets the criteria established by the ABA; and it is believed that every financial institution in the U.S. must come to them to be assigned, to retire, or to change a routing number.  In their capacity as Official Registrar of the Routing Number System for the ABA, they collect, process and maintain a worldwide database of current worldwide information on financial institutions.  Any responsible firm that feels it has the capability to provide this requirement and has similar capabilities and resources as Thomson Financial Publishing may respond in writing no later than January 31, 2002 with capability statements and information describing in full detail their capabilities to accomplish SSA?s objective.  Additionally, respondents should cite specific examples of their experience in detecting unreported depository accounts at financial institutions using the customer?s name and social security number as the identifying information.  FAXED RESPONSES ARE NOT PERMITTED.  Questions concerning this announcement may be submitted via mail.  This is not a request for quotations.  The Government does not intend to pay for information provided in response to this announcement, respondents should refer to AVPMMY600.

The = size limitation for email attachments is five megabytes per individual = email message.  The SSA utilizes Microsoft Word 97 as the standard = word processing software.

<CONTACT>DON DAVIS, TELEPHONE 812-854-3709
<DESC>MARKET SURVEY – SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS:  The Naval Air Systems Command is presently developing initial program cost/schedule/performance estimates for a potential EA-6B/ALQ-99 Band 4/6 Transmitter (XMTR) program.  This program would serve to replace the current ALQ-99 Band 4 and Band 5/6 XMTR Weapons Replaceable Assemblies (WRA), used in the ALQ-99 Tactical Jamming Pod.  These XMTR WRAs, designed in the late 1960's and produced in the 1970's and early 1980's, have poor reliability, availability and maintainability (RAM), contain obsolete or very difficult to procure components and lack performance to effectively counter present and emerging threats while operating in today's dense electromagnetic signals environment. In order to better define program acquisition strategy and a cost/schedule/performance baseline, the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division, acting at th e direction of the EA-6B Program Manager and the Advanced Systems Integrated Product Team leader, is soliciting inputs, recommendations and estimates from interested companies in the following areas: (1) Possible Band 4/6 XMTR design concepts; (2) Technical performance objectives; (3) Alternative program acquisition strategies; (4) Program schedule; (5) Program cost estimates, including development, production, recurring XMTR production unit cost and total life cycle costs; and (6) Programmatic and technical risk areas and possible mitigation measures.   Transmission or discussion of current ALQ-99 Band 4 and Band 5/6 XMTR performance requires interested parties to have the ability to discuss, receive and store information classified SECRET/U.S. Only, thus only Companies having this level of security clearance can participate.                     At the current time, NO F UNDING IS AVAILABLE for contractual efforts.  The U.S. Government is in no way liable to pay for or reimburse any companies or entities that offer inputs in response to this announcement.  NO FUNDING CURRENTLY EXISTS OR IS BUDGETED IN FUTURE YEARS for a Band 4/6 XMTR program, thus by issuing this announcement the Government is in no way obligated to expend funds for such a program.  Any costs incurred by interested companies in response to this announcement will NOT be reimbursed. Interested companies may obtain basic ALQ-99 Pod and Band 4 and Band 5/6 XMTR information via the EA-6B Technical Data Center web site at http://www.crane.navy.mil/tdc/.   This web site is unclassified but access controlled.  Companies must register for and be granted access.  Once access is obtained, the information may be found in the "ALQ-99 Band 4/6 Transmitter Information" section.  In order t o receive classified information, companies should contact Mr. Tim Cornwell, Airborne Electronic Warfare Systems, Code 80223, 812-854-4844, cornwell_t@crane.navy.mil  In order to be useful for program planning decisions, any inputs need to be received no later than 31 January 2002.  Interested parties are referred to http://www.crane.navy.mil/supply/synop/01r0155.htm for further details on how to submit white papers/proposals.  The above address contains generic points of contact and mailing addresses.  For the purposes of this sources sought announcement, all inputs should be mailed to: Commanding Officer Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division Code 80223, Bldg 3330C 300 highway 361 Crane, IN  47522-5000 ATTN: Mr. Tim Cornwell All information marked as proprietary information will be safeguarded to prevent disclosures to non-government personnel and entiti es.

<DESC>Market Research -- coreFLS Staff Readiness Assessment and Training Initiative (RESTRICED TO CURRENT FSS CONTRACT HOLDERS ONLY) -- I.  Background - The Department of Veterans Affairs core Financial and Logistics System (coreFLS) Project is designed to meet the VA's long-recognized need for a fully integrated financial and logistics system to provide accurate, timely responses to the many related information needs existing throughout the Department.  The system consists of Oracle Federal Financials as well as Oracle Project Accounting and Oracle Fixed Assets, Asset Management Software (Maximo), Medical Inventory Management Software (DynaMed), and an Oracle Public Sector contracting management software package.  The coreFLS program is committed to developing and delivering quality, just in time training.  This implementation will affect over 100,000 end-users in areas such as Fiscal, SPD, supply, warehouse, maintenance and engineering throughout the United States.  A significant project management effort is required in the design, development, and delivery of training to meet the needs of this large geographically diverse end user audience.  To date VA has not been able to locate an Oracle implementation of a similar magnitude.  The VA coreFLS Team currently holds a limited Oracle Tutor license to evaluate the feasibility of using this software for online help and documentation. VA is seeking a current GSA schedule holder to assist VA in meeting the training requirements for implementation of the system (Oracle Federal Financials Oracle Project Accounting and Oracle Fixed Assets, Maximo Asset Management and DynaMed Medical Inventory management and Oracle Contract management).   The numerous deliverables will include but may not be limited to the following; 1. Conducting a Training Analysis addressing critical issues such as, * End-users profile, * System documentation, * Business process reengineering, * Training strategies, * Current coreFLS cutover project plans, * Existing VA resources, * Geographic considerations, * Magnitude of the project and support issues.  The training analysis will establish the coreFLS training vision, include near and long-term issues and encompass all software solutions within coreFLS.  2. Using existing help and documentation resources to develop and provide end-users access to online help and process information from within the coreFLS application.  3. Developing web-based courses, to provide end-users with knowledge of coreFLS applications and navigation. 4. Developing comprehensive Curriculum Maps, which outline those elements critical to a successful training curriculum such as: * Course development which supports identified end-user job roles, * Objectives, * Targeted audience, * Training modalities with strategies for delivery-  i. Identify type, ii. Number of training hours/days, iii. Required resource materials and personnel, iv. Delivery strategies to support scheduled deployment plan * Comprehensive curriculum and implementation plan. 5. Developing end-user's training materials such as, * Instructor guides, * End-users manuals, * Job aides, * Electronic training media 6. Conducting instructor led training classes as necessary which includes, * Documenting participation, * Conducting course evaluation, * Scheduling and announcing course dates, * Allowing VA to audit and interview potential class instructors.  VA is looking for firms with recent relevant experience performing the aforementioned tasks. This experience should also include: * Significant experience in designing support strategies and training solutions for Oracle clients in a large organization with geographically dispersed sites, a large number of employees and diverse end users.  * Experience in working with and providing training on Maximo and on Dynamed is also highly desirable. II.  To Respond to this research request and indicate interest, please provide the following by not later than January 16, 2002: 1. General Infor

<SUBJECT>19-Commercial Boat Building Candidates for Building United States Naval Academy's Sail Training Craft (STC)
<DESC>This is a special notice for information. Recently, Federal Business Opportunities (www.fedbizopps.gov) was designated in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) as the single point of universal electronic public access on the Internet to government-wide Federal procurement opportunities that exceed $25,000 (see 66 Fed. Reg. 27407, May 16, 2001). The FAR requires agencies, as of October 1, 2001, to use FedBizOpps to provide access to public notices of procurement actions over $25, 000 that are currently required to be published in the Commerce Business Daily (CBD) along with associated solicitations and amendments. Designation of this one-stop online gateway represents an important step in the ongoing transformation to a more efficient, accessible, citizen-centric e-government. Agencies will be in a transition period through December 31, 2001. During this time, the FAR requires  agencies to ensure that notice is provided both to FedBizOpps and the CBD. However, the FAR provides that, as of January 1, 2002, agencies will no longer be required to provide duplicate notice in the CBD and instead may rely exclusively on the mandatory notice in FedBizOpps to provide the required access. This transition will enable agencies to realize the efficiencies in electronic processes that help to justify their investments in e-government. Accordingly, effective January 4, 2002, the Department of Commerce will cease publication of the CBD through the U.S. Government Printing Office (GPO).  The following instructions may be helpful in accessing the information on the USNA STC that is on the Federal Business Opportunities Website.  Go to http://www.fedbizopps.gov.  Click on "FBO for Vendors." Scroll down to USN.  Click on "Offices".  Scroll down to " Naval Sea Systems  Command".  Click on "classification code".  Information pertaining to the USNA STC is found under classification code 19.  As a result all future announcements for this program will be announced in the Federal Business Opportunities website.
