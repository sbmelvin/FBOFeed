<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">USAID/RDMA envisions a five-year program incrementally funded over five years with an estimated budget ranging from $9 million to $9.9 million (subject to availability of funds). Program activities are expected to be a comprehensive study of the likely impact of climate change on prevalent agriculture subsectors and ecosystems in the Basin. The study will apply hydro-meteorological data from atmosphere-ocean general circulation models to agriculture suitability and ecosystem envelope models to forecast the expected changes, assess the probable impacts, and develop adaptation strategies. This information will be used in the implementation of 5 to 6 integrated ecosystem and community based adaptation pilot projects in representative ecosystems in the Basin. During the implementation of the pilot projects, data will be systematically collected and analyzed to provide a better valuation of the ecosystem services on which the communities depend, and this will be used to provide guidance on national policies related to valuing ecosystem services. The costs and benefits of the pilot projects will be carefully monitored and successful practices will be drawn together to develop, at a pre-feasibility level, potential national integrated ecosystem and community based adaptation projects that could be eligible for financing from climate change adaptation funds. Lessons from the project will be widely disseminated through a regional knowledge center platform.</span></p>

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The California Institute of Technology's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (Caltech/JPL),located in Pasadena, California, operating under a prime contract with NASA seeksinformation from potential contractors on the design, verification, manufacture, andvalidation of radiation hardened application specific integrated circuits (ASICs) insupport of the Jupiter Europa Orbiter mission (JEO).BACKGROUND: The Europa Jupiter System Mission (EJSM) is a joint NASA/European SpaceAgency (ESA) mission that would consist of two (2) flight elements exploring the Joviansystem: the NASA-led JEO, and the ESA-led Jupiter Ganymede Orbiter (JGO). JEO and JGOwould execute a choreographed exploration of the Jovian system before settling into orbitaround Europa and Ganymede, respectively. The launch of JEO would occur in 2020 witharrival at Jupiter in 2025. Jupiter Orbit Insertion (JOI) begins a 30-month Jovian systemtour followed by a 9-month science mapping phase after Europa Orbit Insertion (EOI) inJuly 2028. The orbiter will ultimately impact the surface of Europa after the mission iscompleted.The current JEO and JGO mission concepts include 11 and 10 complementary instruments,respectively, to monitor dynamic phenomena (such as Ios volcanoes and Jupitersatmosphere), map the Jovian magnetosphere and its interactions with the Galileansatellites, and characterize water oceans beneath the ice shells of Europa and Ganymede. Jupiter is approximately ten (10) times the size of the Earth while its magnetic momentis nearly twenty thousand (20,000) times stronger.  As the magnetic field at the equatoris proportional to the magnetic moment divided by the cube of the radial distance, theJovian magnetic field is proportionally twenty (20) times larger than that of the Earth. The Jovian moons of interest lie well within the radiation belt. The resulting radiationenvironment for the current mission concept is estimated at 2.9 Mrad total ionizing dose(TID) behind 100 mil thick aluminum.  This level is seven (7) times greater than anyprevious NASA mission.A pre-project office has been formed to begin preparation for this challenging mission.The pre-project is a joint undertaking of JPL and the Johns Hopkins University AppliedPhysics Laboratory (JHU/APL).  JPL administers the release and response of this RFI.The JEO flight system is comparable in size and complexity to other spacecraft forsimilar missions such as Cassini or Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO). The concept wouldfeature full redundancy for engineering functions, 3-axis stabilized pointing,radioisotope power source (RPS) with batteries for peak power management, bi-propellantchemical propulsion, a large gimbaled high gain antenna (HGA), and X-band and Ka-bandtransponders for tracking, telemetry and precision Doppler measurements. The proposed ten(10) year mission would require that all electronic components be hardened to a minimumof 300 kRad, although lower tolerance level could be considered as exceptions in limitedcases where no alternative exists. The radiation challenges and long-duration demand thehighest reliability in spacecraft and instrument design capabilities.PURPOSE: JPL seeks to solicit candidate solutions for radiation hardened ASIC design,manufacturing, verification and validation from potential contractors. Mission assuranceand risk mitigation requirements of the JEO mission will require that any ASICs used onthe mission have been designed and verified with the most robust, thorough, and effectiveprocess possible in order to withstand the harsh radiation environment encountered duringthe mission lifetime.  For digital designs, it is anticipated that prototypes in FieldProgrammable Gate Arrays (FPGA) will be designed and developed as intermediate productsfor use by the spacecraft and instrument design teams.	Additional circuitries will berequired for mixed signal development. Potential ASIC providers to this RFI are requestedto address the translation of the FPGA design format, analog Intellectual Property (IP)cores, architecture, and radiation mitigation schemes to the candidate ASIC manufacturingprocess for both mixed signal and digital only designs.  The specific design formatrequired for the manufacture of the ASICs are also requested in response to this RFI. REQUIREMENT: Respondents are requested to provide the following information: (1)processes, documentation, requirements, hardware and software tools, test benches, andany other relevant material as to why their proposed ASIC design, manufacturing, andverification and validation approach should be considered as a candidate solution for theJEO mission; (2) IP handling, foundry capability, radiation mitigation technology, andtesting capability; and (3) case studies, test chips if readily available, and/orpractical examples.  Attached are information on the test chip and a list of questionsregarding the ASIC design, manufacturing, and verification and validation process thatare requested to be addressed (refer to Exhibit 1.)   Additional questions can beexpected as the evaluation continues.The JEO Pre-project office (JPL and APL) will vet all submittals. The results of thisreview will be used to compile a list of recommended ASIC vendors for JEO (to be releasedas a public document on the EJSM web portal in the later half of calendar year 2011) andto develop guidelines for implementing ASICs on the JEO program.  The results will bepublished as a JEO document for both spacecraft and instrument development teams.RESPONSE TO THE RFI: Please provide your response, including the following requiredinformation: (1) Company name and mailing address; (2) Contact person, phone, FAX number,and Email address; and (3) Company size (i.e., large business, small business, smalldisadvantaged business, woman-owned, Service-Disabled/Veteran owned, etc.) Please limityour written response to ten (10) pages.RESPONSE DEADLINE: Please submit the above-requested information to the attention of MaryHelen Ruiz at Email address: maryhelen.ruiz@jpl.nasa.gov no later than Friday, January21, 2011.POINT OF CONTACT: Please direct any questions regarding this synopsis to Tsun-Yee Yan viaEmail at: yan@jpl.nasa.govDISCLAIMER: It is emphasized that the requested information is for preliminary planningpurposes only and does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that JPL willlet a solicitation in the future. Neither JPL nor the Government will be responsible forany costs incurred by you in furnishing this information. Be advised that any informationprovided shall be deemed to be furnished with unlimited rights to JPL and APL, with JPLand APL assuming no liability for the disclosure, use, or reproduction of such data.

DEPARTMENT OF VETERNS AFFAIRS
CENTRALIZED ACQUISITION SERVICE (VISN 6) 
JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION
FAR 6.302-1, 41 U.S.C. 253 (c)(1)
                        
                       
1.	The purpose of this memorandum for record is to document justification for other than full and open competition to procure on site project engineering services for the Department of Veteran Affairs Medical Center, Durham, N.C. 
2.	The undersigned proposes to award a follow-on contract for project engineering services to PLC Enterprises on a sole source basis. 
3.	Facilities Management Services currently does not have sufficient qualified engineers to properly monitor and manage existing construction projects. As a result a contractor is needed to provide project engineering services to assist in project plans, project controls, budgeting, scheduling, and planning in all stages of the current construction projects at the VAMC Durham.   PLC Enterprises is currently providing the services of Layne Crabtree under contract VA558-C00056.  A follow contract with PLC for the services of Layne Crabtree is required to ensure proper management of the mission critical construction projects.  Mr. Crabtree has been intricately involved in numerous projects since the contract was awarded to PLC Enterprises. Services are needed through June 30, 2011 which is when a number of projects are scheduled for completion. The estimated cost of these services is $50,000.00.

4.	Under the authority of Title 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii) other 
than full and open competition is justified when services are available only from the original source in the case of a follow-on contract.
5.	 Currently the Durham VAMC has 26 NRM projects and 3 minor projects in the design and construction phase and will have additional projects in FY2011.  Facilities Management Service has a need for immediate help from an experienced engineer with VA experience who can complete the services without interruption. Mr. Crabtree is a highly qualified and experienced engineer. PLC Services has agreed to continue to provide the services of Mr. Crabtree for the duration of the follow-on contract. Mr. Crabtree has been working on the following projects: D-Wing clinical addition; Research Bldg #15 Phase II; Parking garage; Renovation of Emergency Department (NRM); Renovation 9B (NRM); Resurface roads and Parking lots (NRM). He is the only person who has been involved with the complete design and construction of each of these projects so far. He is needed to complete them and assist in the VA in the transfer of work once his contract expires. His unique background and current work on each project provides the VAMC Durham with the most experienced engineer to complete the projects without major risk, additional cost, or schedule delays. He is a former VA senior resident engineer and is very familiar with the VA construction practices, COTR requirements, VA design and was also a VA Contracting Officer.   
 
6.	Under the exception in FAR part 5.202 (11) the proposed contract action is made under the terms of an existing contract that was previously synopsized in sufficient detail to comply with the requirements of 5.207 with respect to the current proposed contract action.

7.	The anticipated cost of $50,000.00 ($71.00 per hour) is determined to be fair and reasonable because it is at or below other open market pricing of $60,000 -$90,000.00 ($85.00- $128.00 per hour) .  

8.	A market survey was not conducted due to the lengthy VAMC orientation process and the uniqueness of VA construction contracting. As a result the Government's requirements can only be met with a follow-on acquisition to the existing contract.  Award of a follow on contract will allow current projects to continue work without disruption.

9.	Failure to issue a follow on contract will lead to an indefinite postponement of multiple construction projects at the expense of the government.  

10.	 No other sources expressed an interest in this procurement.  

11.	 At this time there are no known actions to be taken to overcome barriers to competition. In the event that PLC Enterprises cannot provide the services of Mr. Crabtree and services are still required, the Government will solicit for the services on a competitive basis.

12.	I hereby certify that the requirements represented by this justification cover only that quantity needed to satisfy the requirements, which form the basis of this justification. That these services meet the Government's minimum needs and that this justification is complete and accurate to the best of my knowledge and belief.

<p>EVALUATION-COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999) <br />(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this synopsis/solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>Past Performance: In accordance with FAR 52.212-1(b)(10) and the following, the offeror is required to identify past or current contracts for efforts similar to this requirement. Offerors shall provide the information shown below for at least three (3) and no more than five (5) contracts for the same or similar items. Provide as a minimum the following applicable information for each contract:</p>
<p>a. Contract number, Names of contracting parties or agency, point of contact, specifically the Contracting Officer and the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR), including email address and telephone number of these identified individuals.<br />b. Ship name, hull type, length, and displacement.<br />c. Type of availability (dry dock, dockside, etc.) and where performed;<br />d. Original contract commencement and completion dates, actual commencement and completion dates, and explanation of (i.e. reasons for) schedule slippage/extensions, if any;<br />e. Award price and final contract price (award plus growth), including the total number of growth work changes and scope of these changes. <br /><br />Past Performance will look at relevant experience, responsiveness, resources, quality and consistency of services, customer satisfaction, and management.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Price: The total price will be the evaluated price.<br /><br />Past performance, when combined, are approximately equal to cost or price. <br />(a) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. <br />EVALUATION APPROACH</p>
<p>1. An evaluation plan has been established to evaluate the factors set forth below and all proposals shall be subject to evaluation by a team of Government personnel in accordance with the plan.</p>
<p>2. The Government will evaluate each proposal strictly in accordance with its content and will not assume that performance will include areas not specified in the offeror's written proposal. The Government reserves the right to contact other government and commercial sources to validate information submitted in a proposal and to assess capability, past performance and responsibility.</p>
<p>3. Proposals, which are unrealistic in terms of price, will be deemed reflective of an inherent lack of technical competence or indicative of a failure to comprehend the complexity and risks of the proposed contract. Such proposals may be rejected as unacceptable without further discussions. In addition, the Government reserves the right to eliminate from consideration those proposals as deficient in information as to require a major re-write or revision in order to become acceptable.</p>
<p>4. The technical evaluation factors and other factors other than price, when combined, are approximately equal to price. Price will not be a numerically weighted factor in the evaluation of proposals. If the two or more highest rated technical proposals are considered to be essentially equal in terms of technical competence, price may become the determinative factor in making an award.</p>
<p>5. The Government reserves the right to award a contract on the basis of evaluation of the original submission without discussions or call for Final Proposal Revisions. The contract will be awarded as a firm fixed price contract using simplified acquisition procedures.</p>
<p>The Government will award a contract resulting from this synopsis/solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be more advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. For the purpose of this solicitation technical capability and past performance are approximately equal to price.</p>
<p>Potential sources having the expertise and required capabilities are invited to submit proposals that will be considered by the agency. Proposals must fully address all Technical Capabilities Factors and Past Performance. No reference to Price shall be included in the Proposal. Proposals must contain the contractor's Tax Information Number, and DUNS Number. Proposals must be received not later than 10 DEC 2010, 11:00 A.M. Local California time.

<p><br />OMBUDSMAN NOTICE</p>
<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</p>
<p>It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested Parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>INFORMAL FORUM WITH THE OMBUDSMAN. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>FORMAL AGENCY PROTEST WITH THE OMBUDSMAN: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protests to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:</p>

CLIN 0001: Pre-Deployment Tactical Training Package

The descriptions of the contract requirements for the training services are outlined in the Statement of Work (SOW) as set forth in Attachment 1. The Government anticipates award of a Firm-Fixed Price contract. Please refer to Attachment 1 for the period of performance and date of services.

Vendors responding to this announcement shall submit their quote in accordance with FAR 52.212-1.

A vendor’s quote must be written in a logical, practical, clear, concise and logically assembled manner, containing all pertinent information in sufficient detail to provide the evaluators with a clear understanding of the vendor’s approach and to permit evaluation of the proposed program.
  It is the responsibility of the vendor to present enough information to allow the various work efforts, support, and management approaches to be meaningfully evaluated without discussions.  
The vendor’s initial quote should contain the vendor’s best terms from a price and technical standpoint.  However, the Government reserves the right to  communicate with vendors  if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary.  The Government may reject any or all quotations if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest quotation; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in quotations received.  A quote must be internally consistent or the quote will be considered unrealistic and may be considered unacceptable.
  Evaluation of the technical approach will be based upon the extent to which the vendor thoroughly and accurately describes the overall technical solution.  In accordance with FAR 52.219-9, all other than small businesses must submit a Subcontracting Plan to be considered for an evaluation.

The provision at FAR 52.212-1 does not apply.  The evaluation procedures to be used are as follows:  The Government will award a single contract resulting from this request for quotes to the responsible vendor whose quote, conforming to the RFQ, will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  This procurement is being conducted pursuant to FAR 13.5.  As such, evaluation procedures pursuant to FAR 13.106 will be utilized to the maximum extent possible.
  Quotes will be evaluated in an efficient and minimally burdensome fashion.  The Contracting Officer reserves the right to evaluate quotes without the use of formal evaluation procedures such as establishing a competitive range, conducting discussions, scoring quotations, and to make an award to other than the lowest quote.
The Contracting Officer may conduct comparative evaluations of offers pursuant to FAR 13.106-2(b). 


Evaluation Factors:  The following factors shall be used in the evaluation of quotes: 1) Technical Capability:  defined as a) demonstration of the capability to perform all the requirements in this RFQ (SME cerificates, Quality Assurance Plan and Technical/Management Proposal combined);  b) corporate experience providing this type of training for the United States Armed Forces.
  2) Past Performance; and 3) Price.

Technical capability and Past performance are equal in value.  The combined value of Technical Capability and Past Performance shall be evaluated as more important than Price.  

For corporate experience and past performance, the vendor shall submit, as part of its quote, information on previously performed contracts or on-going contracts that are similar to the statement of work/item description in the solicitation performed for Federal, State or local Governments, and for commercial firms. Information shall be provided on either 1) all such contracts within the past three years, or 2) the last three such contracts performed, whichever is fewer, and shall be limited to the name and address of the organization for which the services were performed, a brief description of the services performed, and the phone number and/or email of a contact for each contract listed.
 The information may also include a description of any quality awards earned by the vendor. The Government reserves the right to obtain information for use in the evaluation of past performance from any and all sources including sources outside of the Government. Vendors lacking relevant past performance history will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance and will receive a neutral rating. The vendor should provide the information requested above for past performance evaluation, or affirmatively state that it possesses no relevant directly related or similar past performance. The Government may give greater consideration to the contracts that the Government feels are most relevant to the RFQ.
 

In addition, vendors are required to submit a Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP) to be considered technically acceptable. QASP is subject to approval by the Contracting Office.

The quote must include the following:
1)  Introductory Folder
2) Technical/Management Proposal (demonstration of the capability to perform all the requirements in this RFQ).
3) Certificates of Subject Matter Expertise (SME) as required in section 3.14 of SOW (Attachment 1).
4) Cost Proposal
5) Small Business Utilization
6) Quality Assurance Plan
7) Past Performance

See Attachment 1 for the clauses which are applicable to this procurement.   

Vendors shall provide completed copies of FAR 52.212-3 or their Online Representations and Certification Application (ORCA) record with their quote.
 Vendors shall also provide completed copies of DFARS 252.225-7000 with their quote. ORCA is located at http://orca.bpn.gov. The provisions and clauses can be found at FAR website: http://www.acquisition.gov/far/ and DFARS website: http://farsite.hill.af.mil/VFDFARA.HTM. Vendors are required to provide their Contractors’ DUNS Number and Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code with their quote. The CAGE code entered shall be for that name and address provided by the Contractor. Vendors are required to be registered and current in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and Wide Area Work Flow (WAWF-RA) databases.

<p>4. POSITION TITLE: Support Relief Group (SRG) - Pharmacist</p>
<p>5. MARKET VALUE: GS-14 equivalent ($84,697 - $110,104 - not eligible for locality pay). Final compensation will be negotiated within the listed market value based upon the candidate's past salary, work history and educational background.

<p>6. PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: One year, with four one-year options</p>
<p>STATEMENT OF LIMITATIONS ON PERIOD AND PLACE OF PERFORMANCE:</p>
<p>The purpose of this contract is to establish an employee/employer relationship with the contractor to perform services on a temporary, on-call, basis as part of the Support Relief Group (SRG). It is the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) / Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA)'s intent to contract for these services for a maximum of 250 days per calendar year.</p>
<p>The level of effort anticipated under this contract will be provided within the terms of this contract at times mutually agreed to by DCHA/OFDA and the contractor. Upon identification of a temporary need within the scope of work, DCHA/OFDA will contact the contractor and provide the following information:</p>
<p>1. Date contractor is needed to report to DCHA/OFDA or assignment in the field<br />2. Duration of Assignment<br />3. Place of Performance</p>
<p>The contractor will notify DCHA/OFDA within 24 hours of availability. At the time the contractor accepts the assignment, he/she is expected to commit for the duration of the assignment. While the contractor will be required to commit to a certain time period, it is understood that the exigencies of a disaster may require the assignment to be extended (not to exceed 250 days). The Contractor shall notify OFDA at the time of commitment if their existing schedule would preclude an extension. Notification of schedule conflicts shall not necessarily disqualify the contractor from the assignment but will simply assist DCHA/OFDA in recruiting a replacement. Subsequently, if the contractor agrees to an extension of the duration of a particular assignment, thereafter, the contractor will be required to give DCHA/OFDA 10 days notice for release from the assignment.</p>
<p>7. PLACE OF PERFORMANCE: Worldwide</p>
<p>8. STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) is the office within USAID that is responsible for providing emergency non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters. OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) and is organized into three divisions. The Disaster Response and Mitigation Division (DRM) is responsible for the provision of emergency humanitarian assistance through a grants mechanism to non-governmental organizations (NGOs), Private Voluntary Organizations (PVOs), the United Nations agencies and to partners to ensure the implementation and delivery of this assistance. This division also oversees OFDA's non-response efforts in disaster risk reduction. DRM also coordinates with other organizations and donors for the provision of relief supplies and assistance. DRM devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human caused disaster situations with a focus on disaster risk reduction. It encompasses a group of technical sector specialists who provide expert capability in assessing the quality of disaster response and disaster risk reduction activities. The Program Support Division (PS) provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning and guidance, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA's Washington and field offices. The Operations Division (OPS) develops and manages logistical and operational support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations. OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue Teams (SAR), coordinating and supporting Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and the Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs) as needed.</p>
<p>The Technical Assistance Group (TAG) within DRM was created in order to provide OFDA with a skilled cadre of technical experts in a variety of fields relevant to its disaster response and risk reduction activities. It is divided into a number of subgroups that include Food Security, Health, Most Vulnerable Populations, and Natural Hazards groups. The Pharmacist is part of the Public Health subgroup.</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The Support Relief Group (SRG) is a program developed by OFDA to satisfy its growing need for surge capacity. In response to numerous disasters worldwide, it became clear that OFDA could not find, in a timely manner, adequate staff to cover all positions in the field and in Washington, and to backfill for permanent staff deploying to the field. The SRG program brings on board select candidates who could work on a part-time basis, for no more than 250 days per calendar year, and who can be deployed within hours to facilitate OFDA's response to disasters, or to backfill staff in Washington and other locations. SRG positions are contracted for an initial period of one year with the option to extend up to five years.</p>
<p>Activation of the Pharmacist will be coordinated with OFDA/TAG. The Pharmacist is an integral member of OFDA's TAG. USAID/OFDA activities are intended to minimize the adverse impacts of natural hazards by reducing vulnerability to disasters, increasing regional, national and local capacity to prepare for and respond to disasters, and enhancing the resiliency of vulnerable groups and communities to recover from recurrent natural disasters.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>OFDA requires a Registered Pharmacist, licensed to practice in the United States, to provide OFDA with technical assistance in public health program assessment and planning for grant proposals, disasters and other areas as needed. The OFDA pharmacist will evaluate human and veterinary medical commodity requests, local health systems and pharmaceutical supply chains to assure that only quality, safe and effective essential medicines are dispensed to beneficiaries.</p>
<p>9. CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>The Pharmacist's responsibilities will include the following:</p>
<p>&bull; Conduct assessments of host nation pharmaceutical manufacturing, storage and distribution network and recommend appropriate relief activities. Facilitate and coordinate actual U.S. Government emergency technical response activities with the USAID Mission, other donor agencies, and the U.S. Embassy; <br />&bull; Assist OFDA to coordinate, plan, implement, and evaluate emergency pharmaceutical procurement and distribution activities to ensure that efforts in assigned program areas are meeting the needs of affected populations and satisfy the goals and objectives of the response program;<br />&bull; Exercise independent judgment and decision-making related to pharmaceutical procurement and distribution activities, as well as evaluation of commodity requests, both in the US and in the field. Ensure that pharmaceutical procurement is in accordance with Agency regulations; <br />&bull; Evaluate commodity requests for appropriateness of essential medicines and medical supplies for the response and that quantities are in-line with anticipated needs. Review data to assure that all essential medicines that may be purchased meet or exceed internationally accepted standards for safety, efficacy, and quality; <br />&bull; Liaise with partners, international organizations and host nation authorities to ensure the appropriateness of medical commodities to be delivered. Be aware of the local capacities for production of medical commodities, the quality of locally produced medical commodities and the impact of imported medical commodities and essential medicines on the local economy;<br />&bull; Brief host governments on internationally accepted standards for medical commodities and essential medicines such as Good Manufacturing Practices (GMPs) and Good Distribution Practices (GDPs). Evaluate existing host nation programs and systems and recommend improvements that will enhance health care for the beneficiaries; <br />&bull; Coordinate and monitor OFDA-funded health care activities to ensure the proper use of OFDA program funds. Review documentation provided by the implementing partner to confirm that appropriate essential medicines were in fact provided to the beneficiaries. As appropriate, apply new developments in the pharmaceutical sector to OFDA programming;<br />&bull; Identify pharmaceutical supply chain measures that could be linked to disaster response activities. Review and analyze risk reduction principles and recommend course(s) of action to OFDA-Washington staff;<br />&bull; Assist in the development of various types of country/regional strategies for field offices, DARTs, and assessment teams.

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note: personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>
