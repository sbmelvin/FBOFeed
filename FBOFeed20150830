<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT AND NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATIONS. The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS), Research Triangle Park, NC intends to negotiate on a sole source basis and issue an order with Cellular Dynamics International, Madison, WI 53711 , as it has been determined that only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. This request is for 36 each of PHC-100-020-001-PT iCell Hepatocytes 2.0. The National Toxicology Program requires iPSC-derived hepatocytes with demonstrated metabolic competence. These iPSC-derived hepatocytes have been used in previous studies and therefore have established hepatocyte functionality (metabolic competence, bile canalicular formation/polarization, and transcriptomics). This purchase will be used to extend the existing evaluations into the effects of 2D vs 3D culture configurations. As these will be used in an on-going research project, these same iCell Hepatocytes are required in order to maintain research data consistency. Award is subject to Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition (JOFOC) approval. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however, all responses received within 8 days from the date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract action based upon responses to this notice is solely with the discretion of the Government. Information received Awill normally be considered for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. If no affirmative responses are received within 8 days of this notice to determine whether a qualified source is more advantageous to the Government, the order will be issued to Cellular Dynamics. The NAICS Code/Size is 325998/500 Employees. This procurement is to be processed using Simplified Acquisition Procedures in conjunction with FAR Part 12 Commercial Item Acquisition of Commercial Items. There is no solicitation package available. For any questions regarding this announcement, please contact Deitra Lunney via email lunney@niehs.nih.gov.

The assays for drug discovery and development for antiparasitic diseases require a multi-functional plate reader to meet the needs of drug development.  Without a plate reader that can accommodate all of the assay requirements for the reading of luminescence, flourescence, and absorption, ET will not be able to fulfill its drug discovery and development mission. <br>  <br> ET has spent severn years creating and qualifying six high throughput assays for drug disvoery on the Tecan readers (GENois Plus and the M2000).  An alternate type of reader would require the recreation and assay qualification of six high throughput assays for drug discovery in order to meet the standards of the FDA. <br>  <br> Interested responders that belive they have an  quote mark equal to quote mark  product are invited to complete and submit Attachments 1 and 2 by 8 Sep 2015, by 4:30 P.M.

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

(D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at subpart 32.11) for the same concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract. A change in the DUNS number does not necessarily require a novation be accomplished. Dun &amp; Bradstreet may be contacted-</p>

This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see FAR 32.11) for the same parent concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>

<p>252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure (Sep 2011)</p>
<p><br />a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA</p>
<p>Alternative line item structure offer where monitors are shipped separately:</p>

The Contractor shall consult with the Department of State regarding any questions relating to compliance with the ITAR and shall consult with the Department of Commerce regarding any questions relating to compliance with the EAR.</p>
<p>(c) The Contractor's responsibility to comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items exists independent of, and is not established or limited by, the information provided by this clause.</p>
<p>(d) Nothing in the terms of this contract adds, changes, supersedes, or waives any of the requirements of applicable Federal laws, Executive orders, and regulations, including but not limited to-</p>
<p>(1) The Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (50 U.S.C. App. 2401, et seq.);</p>

<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006.

The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

The Government intends to make award on the basis of the lowest priced technically acceptable quote meeting or exceeding the acceptability standards for Factor (i) and Factor (ii), Factor (iii).  The Government will not, however, provide additional credit for those quotations that may exceed the standards. 
Offeror quotations will be evaluated under Factor (i) above, which represents minimum acceptable criteria. Under this factor, the Government will rate the quote as either acceptable or unacceptable.

Unacceptable - Quotation does not clearly meet the minimum requirements of the solicitation.

We serve the uniformed services and the Nation as an outstanding academic health sciences center with a worldwide perspective for education, research, service, and consultation; we are unique in relating these activities to military medicine, disaster medicine, and military medical readiness. USU is located in Bethesda, MD on the grounds of the Naval Support Activity Bethesda.<br /><br />USU intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with ADInstruments, located in Colorado Springs, Colorado for 20 PowerLab 26Ts. <br /> <br />This equipment will be procured in accordance with the procedures of FAR Part 12-Commercial Items and FAR Part 13-Simplified Acquisition Procedures.<br /><br />Sole source determination is made in accordance with:<br /><br />FAR Part 13.106-1 Soliciting Competition<br /><br />(b) Soliciting from a single source<br /><br />(1) For purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, contracting officers may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available.<br /><br />The mission of USU is to provide the highest quality education programs in the health sciences to those selected individuals who demonstrate dedication to a health profession career in the Uniformed Services.  As such, it is essential USU provide the necessary training and equipment required for our students to become successful doctors and nurses and to be able to provide the best care possible for our soldiers and to support our research efforts. <br /> <br />The faculty of Uniformed Services University of Health Sciences currently uses the PowerLab 26T for physiology labs in their curriculum along with the PowerLab 4ST. The PowerLab 4STs are approximately 15 years old and no longer are compatible with the latest version of ADInstruments LabChart software. The faculty intends to purchase more PowerLab 26Ts to replace the PowerLab 4ST Data Acquisition Systems on campus so that they may have students using systems and software that are on the same version. This will help to save time and faculty involvement/instruction during the students' lab courses.  Purchasing the new units will permit the retirement of the 4STs.  With a uniform set of updated units, it will be possible to utilize the upgraded features on the latest software that are not available when a mixed set of old and new PowerLabs are used.
<p>ADInstruments is the only known source that can provide the requested equipment.</p>
<p>This is not a request for quotes and a solicitation package will not be issued.  Sources interested in responding to this requirement must be able to provide compelling evidence that they can provide the abovementioned requirement as specified.

As such, it is essential USU provide the necessary training and equipment required for our students to become successful doctors and nurses and to be able to provide the best care possible for our soldiers and to support our research efforts.  <br /><br />USU implemented Kuali COEUS in 2015 as a research management tool and replacement for the COEUS system. USU intends to procure software development services in support of the VPR use of Kuali COEUS. Moderas supported the migration of the COEUS system to Kuali COEUS in 2015. They possess the most current understanding of the system and the data structure.  The company wrote the migration scripts necessary to move the data from COEUS to Kuali COEUS. Contracting with a different vendor will mean the new vendor will consume consulting hours examining the data, reporting tools and USU's implementation of the system. Selection of Moderas will enable USU to leverage current knowledge and limit redundant work resulting in a lower cost to continued development and implementation. <br /><br />As a result of their collaboration and support in configuring the current COEUS system, developing migration and reporting tools and providing implementation consulting, Moderas is the only source that can provide the requested services in the most advantageous way to the government. &nbsp;Thus we are treating this as a follow-on contract.<br /><br />

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested. This is a Request for Quote and the solicitation number is VA101-15-Q-0236. The solicitation documents and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-51. This solicitation (see attached file) is targeting only Service Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB). 
VA has a portfolio of over 1,900 operational leases, approximately 1,500 of which are direct (i.e. via GSA Delegation) leases.  Each year, VA replaces, renews, or enters into hundreds of leases, in addition to the exercising of options, entering into standstill agreements, and other similar lease actions.  Recent changes to GSA Delegation policy provides that VA must secure delegation on a project by project basis and make use of GSA's GREX delegation system to do so.  This process involves the preparation of lease packages for internal VA approval, upload of various documents to GSA's GREX system (including scoring), and ultimately execution of the lease contract once delegation is received.  This process must be completed in compliance with internal VA policy requirements, GSA delegation requirements, and OMB A-11 Appendix B requirements.
Additionally, CFM's workload includes land management activities: the acquisition, disposal, and modification of real estate interests, including fee simple, easements, licenses, permits, and outleasing.  These actions involve the preparation of internal approvals, obtaining and reviewing various due diligence studies and other deliverables, the closing/settlement process, and title review and approval according to Department of Justice (DOJ) standards.
The selected contractor shall be responsible for the following: using available systems and databases to track and report leases and land management actions; preparation of lease packages to ensure compliance with internal approval, GSA, and OMB A-11 requirements including documentation and communication of any identified deficiencies; documenting leasing and land management process flows, to include internal routing and external routing; documenting requirements in support of process flows, including checklists, cheat sheets, and FAQs; specific documentation and training material related to policies, procedures, design guides, and handbooks for leasing and land management; providing project management support services for leasing and land management activities; and general real estate program support.
CFM intends to acquire the services necessary to satisfy this requirement through limited competitive means - SDVOSB firms must complete 51 percent of the work.  The complete solicitation document file is attached. All questions should be emailed to maina.gakure@va.gov by September 2 (Noon EST) and a response to the questions will be posted as an amendment to the solicitation. The associated NAICS code is 531390 (Other activities related to real estate). This solicitation closes on Wednesday September 09, 2015 at 8:00 am (EST).  Point of contact is maina.gakure@va.gov or 202 461 6849. Interested contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) www.ccr.gov and verified at www.vetbiz.
Please respond to the attached Task I PWS as well. To eliminate competitive advantage to other CFM lease related work, note the restrictions as listed at the last page of the RFQ

(a) The Government intends to make a single award to the responsible Offeror whose offer is the most advantageous to the Government considering price and price related factors. The Government intends to award the contract to the eligible, low-priced, responsible offeror.  Award will be made upon price reasonableness determination, contractor determination of responsibility within the meaning of FAR Part 9 and acceptance to the provisions set forth herein. 
The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:
(i) Factor 1.  Technical Capability ? Using Attachment A ? Performance Work Statement, quoters must demonstrate that the company possesses the appropriate certifications as required by paragraph 4.1.1 of the Performance Work Statement.
The Government intends to make award on the basis of the lowest priced technically acceptable quote meeting or exceeding the acceptability standards for Factor (i) and Factor (ii), Factor (iii).  The Government will not, however, provide additional credit for those quotations that may exceed the standards. 
Offeror quotations will be evaluated under Factor (i) above, which represents minimum acceptable criteria. Under this factor, the Government will rate the quote as either acceptable or unacceptable. Failure to meet the minimum criteria for this factor will render the entire quote unacceptable and ineligible for award. 
The Government will rate the responses as follows: Acceptable - Quotation clearly meets the minimum requirements of the solicitation.
Unacceptable - Quotation does not clearly meet the minimum requirements of the solicitation.
At the discretion of the Contracting Officer, the Government intends to evaluate quotes and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Each initial quote should, therefore contain the Offeror?s best terms from both a price and technical standpoint. <BR> <BR>FAR 52.212-3 Offeror Reps and Certs / FAR 52.212-3 Alt1 Offeror Reps and Certs.
