<SUBJECT>Collection of Data on Doses to Members of the Public Exposed to Patients Treated with Iodine-131
<SOLNBR>NRC-HQ-13-R-04-0167
<RESPDATE>121713
<CONTACT>La'toya Cooper, Contract Specialist, Phone (301) 287-0886, Email latoya.cooper@nrc.gov
<DESC><p>Radioactive iodine, mainly the isotope Iodine-131, is used in the diagnosis and treatment of several medical conditions, the primary ones in the present context being treatment of hyperthyroidism and thyroid cancer following thyroidectomy. The importance of these conditions arises from the fact that their treatment protocols generally call for administration of relatively large doses of Iodine-131, and such patients therefore pose the greatest potential for exposure of others.</p>
<p>Patients are often released from the hospital following treatment if they meet the release conditions specified in the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's (NRC) Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Title 10, Part 35.75, "Release of individuals containing unsealed byproduct material or implants containing byproduct material." The basic criterion underlying the release conditions is that "the total effective dose equivalent to any other individual from exposure to the released individual is not likely to exceed 5 mSv (0.5 rem)."</p>
<p>To assist licensees in implementing the above release requirement, NRC published Regulatory Guide 8.39, "Release of patients administered radioactive materials." This guide provides formulas and tables that are considered acceptable to NRC in translating the basic 5 mSv requirement into operational quantities to be used in releasing patients. For example, an operational quantity used in releasing patients is the dose rate measured at a specified distance from the patient. The formulas and tables in the guide use very conservative assumptions in estimating the dose to an individual that results from exposure to the released patient, but the guide also permits licensees to base their calculations on patient-specific conditions, which are often much less conservative than the generic conditions.</p>
<p>There have been a number of publications in the technical, peer-reviewed literature describing studies that attempted to measure or estimate the doses received by persons coming in contact with released patients, and a preliminary review of some of these publications suggested that the release condition of 5 mSv noted above is being met in practice. However, the NRC Commission has decided that a more extensive review of available data, and a re-examination of the calculation methods and tables described in Regulatory Guide 8.39, shall be conducted to ensure that exposures to members of the public resulting from release of patients according to 10 CFR 35.75 do in fact meet the release criterion, and that the methods used to calculate operational release criteria are reasonably accurate and not excessively conservative. In addition, the Commission instructed staff to generate additional data on exposure of members of the public if the available data is considered to be insufficient to provide reasonable assurance that the release criterion is being met in practice. The objective of tasks under this upcoming solicitation are to undertake, through contracts, to carry out the Commission's directions.</p>
<p>To supplement data found in the available literature on typical exposures to members of the public that are expected to come in proximity of released patients who were treated with high activities of Iodine-131 for hyperthyroidism and thyroid cancer. Exposed persons include personnel at the hotels and nursing homes where patients sometimes stay immediately following their release from the hospital. Measurements made under this task, however, shall only include nursing home and hotel staff. The study shall include collection of data on both external and internal doses, and may involve measurement of doses using personnel dosimetry for external exposures and some form of bioassay for internal exposures.</p>
<p>The resulting contract is expected to be a cost-plus-fixed fee contract. The expected period of performance is 2 years</p>
<p>This procurement is expected to be awarded in Fiscal Year 2014.</p>

<p>(ii) Will be made through a means that provides access to the notice of proposed contract<br />action through the GPE.</p>
<p>(iii) Permits the public to respond to the solicitation electronically.</p>
<p>Electronic commerce is defined at 41 USC sec. 426 as electronic techniques for accomplishing business transactions, including electronic mail. Thus, provided the complete solicitation package is available through the GPE and offerors are permitted to respond electronically (i.e., email in this case), the proposed contract action would not need to be synopsized.</p>
<p>Therefore, synopsis is hereby waived as this acquisition is not expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold, request for proposal will be made through Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOps), and the offerors will be able to respond electronically.</p>

<DESC>Joint Biological Tactical Detection System (JBTDS) <br> W911QY-13-R-0036 <br> Presolicitation Notice <br> The U.S. Army Contracting Center, Natick Contracting Division, on behalf of the Joint Project Manager - Nuclear Biological Chemical Contamination Avoidance (JPM-NBCCA), intends to issue a full and open competition solicitation under FAR Part 15, for the Engineering & Manufacturing Development phase of the Joint Biological Tactical Detection System (JBTDS), to include options for Low Rate Initial Production and Full Rate Production.  The JBTDS is envisioned to be a lightweight, low cost, man-portable and battery operable capability set to detect, collect and identify biological pathogens and toxins in a tactical environment.  The primary system functions are to detect biological warfare agents (BWA), collect aerosol samples, identify the BWA in the sample, and alert personnel of the presence of a hazard.  The JBTDS detector/collector sub-system will provide visual, audible and networked warnings of the presence of biological agents and trigger sample collection.  The JBTDS identifier will identify the presence of biological agents and identify specific target species.  <br>  <br> This effort will require the manufacture of BWA detection, collection, and identification hardware and software, consisting of the aforementioned capabilities linked together through a base communication system to allow real time detection from an independent location. Capabilities include: detector/collector, collector, identifier, and base station communications, each designed to function independently or together as one system. Requirements include the development and delivery of capabilities, engineering data, logistics products, and support to Government testing, training, and fielding.  Capabilities will be developed, tested, and purchased to support force protection needs, with the capability to adapt systems in multiple configurations/mission scenarios. <br>  <br> The Government does not intend to use FAR Part 12 for this acquisition. It is anticipated a combination cost plus incentive fee, firm fixed price, and cost type contract(s) shall be awarded to a single or multiple contractor(s). In accordance with FAR 16.301-3, the contractor's accounting system must be adequate for determining costs applicable to the contract. The Request for Proposal (RFP) is expected to be issued on or about 6 Dec 2013.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 541712 with a size standard of 500 employees.  In accordance with DFARS 252.204-7004, Alternate A, all interested offerors shall be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database. <br>  <br> Responses to the JBTDS solicitation will be evaluated on a Best Value basis.  Proposal costs shall not be reimbursed. When released, all interested parties will be able to view, download, and print a copy of the solicitation and any resulting amendments at: <br>  <br> U.S. Army Contracting Center, Aberdeen Proving Ground,  Natick Contracting Division website: https://www3.natick.army.mil/  greater than  Business opportunities <br>  <br> Joint Project Executive Office for Chemical Biological Defense (JPEO-CBD) website at: http://www.jpeocbd.osd.mil/.   <br>  <br> FedBizOpps.gov at: <br> https://www.fbo.gov/ <br>  <br> Reference W911QY-13-R-0036 <br>  <br> No telephone calls will be accepted.

<DESC>The Louis Stokes Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center located at 10701 East Blvd, Cleveland, Ohio 44106 intends to solicit proposal from contractors in the metropolitan Cleveland, Ohio area to provide services as part of its Community Based Health Care for Homeless Veterans (HCHV) program.  The VA anticipates issuing a solicitation for this requirement on or about November 7, 2013, with a closing date for proposals on or about November 25, 2013.  The solicitation will be available for download from http://www.fbo.gov.  Interested contractors will be responsible for downloading copies of solicitation (and any subsequent amendments) from that website, and no hard copies will be made available.  The solicitation will provide full information to contractors about the proposal submission process.  Prospective offerors are encouraged to register their interest in the solicitation on the FBO website so that they are notified of the issuance of the solicitation and any amendments.

The goal of the HCHV program is to remove homeless Veterans from the street or habitation unfit for Veterans and place them in community-based, residential environments with sufficient therapeutic services to meet the needs of those Veterans. Through the HCHV program, VA provides case management services to Veterans and facilitates their access to a broad range of medical, mental health, and rehabilitative services. The purpose of the solicitation will be to obtain proposals from contractors who can provide emergency beds, care, treatment and rehabilitative services to veterans suffering from serious mental illness, including veterans who are homeless, in community-based treatment facilities offering a safe and secure environment that supports their rehabilitation goals. The Contractor will be required to provide therapeutic and rehabilitative services, but will not be required to provide detoxification or other hospital level treatment - those services will be provided by the VA at VA facilities.  Due to the urgent nature of this requirement, contractors will be required to demonstrate their ability to provide services within a 2-week period after contract award.  Initial contract awards are expected to be on or about January 1, 2014.  Contracts will have a base term of one year, with options for four additional one-year terms exercisable in the discretion of the VA.   

The government will use a best value source selection method under Part 13 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation and anticipates making a single award of fixed firm price, indefinite delivery, and indefinite quantity contract for this requirement.

NAICS Code is 624221 for (temporary shelters) and the solicitation will be issued for full and open competition. All responsible sources may submit proposals which shall be considered by the Agency.  To be eligible for award, contractors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) data base at www.sam.gov.  Registration is free and potential offerors are encouraged to visit the SAM website and register as soon as possible to avoid delays should they be selected for a contract award. Questions concerning this announcement should be directed to the Contract Officer (Glen.Johnson@va.gov) using the e-mail link provided. No phone calls will be accepted.

<DESC>*** PLEASE CONTACT AMY MAPLES (ARCS) TO SUBMIT QUOTES OR TO ANSWER ANY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS THAT MAY ARISE FROM THIS SOLICITATION. CONTACT INFORMATION CAN BE FOUND WITHIN THE BODY OF THIS SOLICITATION. *** NASA/MSFC intends to purchase one (1) Floating Network License of COMSOL CFD Module and one (1) Floating Network license of Heat Transfer Module from COMSOL, Inc. This recommendation is made pursuant to FAR 13.106 for the acquisition of supplies or services determined to be reasonably available from only one source. Competition is impractical for the following reasons: 1. The COMSOL codes are proprietary and a source of the salient characteristics is not available to the government.  No second source vendors have been authorized by the creator of COMSOL to develop these codes; therefore, the information to develop a package for full and open competition is not available. 2. COMSOL software has been used for many years for analysis related to problems involving fluid dynamics routinely required to be resolved in support of thermal control systems.  Ensuring the continued accuracy, reliability and compatibility of all elements of these analysis systems is of the utmost importance.	Risking changes that are not compatible are deemed unacceptable risks. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	 Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact no later than 4:30 p.m. CST on Monday, November 4, 2013. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.	A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. NASA Clause 1852.215-84, Ombudsman, is applicable. The Center Ombudsman for this acquisition can be found at http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/pub/pub_library/Omb.html. Although the primary Contracting Officer is listed as Artra C. House, please contact Amy Maples (ARCS) for any technical questions at amy.maples@nasa.gov.

<DESC>DESCRIPTION:  This is a Pre-Solicitation Notice for the following services under project number 596-14-101 - Architect/Engineering (A/E) firm to provide site investigation, schematic design, design development, construction documents, preparation of bid documents, and construction period services for the replacement and relocation of Morgue to building 27 at the Leestown Division VA Medical Center, Lexington, KY.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL; NO SOLICITATION PACKAGE WILL BE ISSUED UNTIL AFTER AN EVALUATION HAS BEEN MADE ON THE PROVIDED SF-330.  Interested firms should submit their current SF 330 to craig.ziegemeier@va.gov.  The SF 330s are due on November 14, 2013 at 2:00 PM Central Standard Time.  
The Lexington Leestown VA Medical Center is seeking professional architect/engineering firms to provide all Architectural and Engineering services necessary to provide site investigation, schematic design, design development, construction documents, preparation of bid documents, and construction period services for Project 596-14-101 which will renovate approximately 500 square foot for a morgue and bereavement room in building 27 at the Leestown VA Medical Center, Lexington, KY. Project will perform work in building 1 related to deactivating the existing morgue in building 1. The project will also perform road and dock construction and improvements for the morgue.  A new mortuary refrigeration unit will be purchased and installed as part of the construction project as the old unit is past its useful life. The A/E will work with an Integrated Project Team (IPT) to determine the optimal solution for the project. An evaluation of the optimal location for the morgue/bereavement room will be completed during the schematic design phase using the information in the VA Design guides. Topographic Survey of the area may be needed pending dock location.  As this project is located with a Historic District, the A/E shall assist the VA with documents needed to complete the Section 106 Consultation process for SHPO review for any exterior additions/renovation.  The final location will be chosen prior to work on the Design Development phase.  Digital copies of the as-builts are limited. The consultant will be expected to fully investigate and confirm the validity of hard copy as-builts and other drawings. This will include independent investigation of the VAMC's flat files by the consultant to determine and procure the information required for the complete design.  Project design shall clearly show work required, phasing of work required, and instructions to construction contractor regarding how to accomplish the necessary renovations in a 24/7 medical environment taking into consideration demolition, dust control, infection control, and specialized facility requirements as discussed with VA staff.  Also included will be limitations, e.g. work required to be completed outside of standard administrative hours, work limited to periods shorter than a single shift, etc., for specific locations in the project.  Bid deductions will be built into the scope of work of the project to allow for flexibility in construction award.
The submitted SF330s will be evaluated on the following criteria:
(1) Professional qualifications necessary for satisfactory performance of required services;

(2) Specialized experience and technical competence in the type of work required, including, where appropriate, experience in energy conservation, pollution prevention, waste reduction, and the use of recovered materials;

(3) Capacity to accomplish the work in the required time;

(4) Past performance on contracts with Government agencies and private industry in terms of cost control, quality of work, and compliance with performance schedules;

(5) Location in the general geographical area of the project and knowledge of the locality of the project; provided, that application of this criterion leaves an appropriate number of qualified firms, given the nature and size of the project; and

(6) Reputation and standing of the firm and its principal officials with respect to professional performance, general management, and cooperativeness.

(7) Record of significant claims against the firm because of improper or incomplete architectural and engineering services.

(8) Specific experience and qualifications of personnel proposed for assignment to the project and their record of working together as a team
The awarded A/E firm will prepare drawings and specifications in sufficient detail such that qualified outside General Contracting companies can prepare accurate and timely proposals for the desired work. The awarded A/E firm is responsible for ensuring that the specifications and drawings supplied fully represent all of the work described in the Request for Proposal (RFP).  The Medical Center must remain operational throughout the construction period and a detailed sequence of work will be provided by the A/E to minimize impact of the construction.  The NAICS code for this project is 541310 with a small business size of $7 million.  The SF-330 can be downloaded through the GSA Forms Library at: http://www.gsa.gov/portal/forms/type/TOP, type in SF330 in the "Find a Form" block and click on search.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL; NO SOLICITATION PACKAGE WILL BE ISSUED UNTIL AFTER AN EVALUATION HAS BEEN MADE ON THE PROVIDED SF-330. 

The estimated cost of construction range for project 596-14-101 is between $100,000.00 and $250,000.00.

All applicable codes and regulations apply.

FAR Clause 52.236-2 (c), Design Within Funding Limitation will be applicable to these procurement actions.  Design limitation costs will be provided to the most highly rated A/E firm selected to complete the design.  

All offerors shall be further advised that in accordance with VAAR 836.606-73 the total cost of the architect or engineer services contracted for must not exceed 6 percent of the estimated cost of the construction project plus any fees for related services and activities. 

A short list of the three most highly ranked firms shall be determined from the evaluation of the submitted SF330s.  Only the three most highly ranked firms will be considered for further negotiations.  Those firms that do not rank in the short list will be notified of their exclusion from further competition.

This requirement is being procured in accordance with The Brooks Act of 1972, Federal Acquisition Regulation 36.6 (FAR) and VA Acquisition Regulation 836.6 (VAAR).  

Interested firms should submit their current SF 330 to craig.ziegemeier@va.gov.  The SF 330s are due on November 14, 2013 at 2:00 PM Central Standard Time. Use the following instructions for submitting your SF 330.

<DESC>DESCRIPTION:  This is a Pre-Solicitation Notice for the following Architect/Engineering Services: Upgrade Lighting Phase 1, Project 626-13-403, Nashville TN; Upgrade Lighting and Controls Phase 2, Project 626A4-14-401, Murfreesboro TN.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL; NO SOLICITATION PACKAGE WILL BE ISSUED UNTIL AFTER AN EVALUATION HAS BEEN MADE ON THE PROVIDED SF330.  Interested firms should submit their current SF330 to steven.bentley@va.gov. The SF330s are due on December 4, 2013 at 2:00 PM Central Standard Time.  
The Tennessee Valley Healthcare System VA Medical Center is seeking professional architect/engineering firms to prepare complete contract drawings, specifications, technical reports and cost estimates, including construction period services for "Upgrade Lighting Phase 1" at the Nashville Campus of the VA TVHS, 1310 24th Avenue South, Nashville, TN 37212 and for "Upgrade Lighting and Controls Phase 2" at the Murfreesboro Campus of the VA TVHS, 3400 Lebanon Pike, Murfreesboro, TN 37129. Work includes electrical, mechanical and industrial hygiene. Investigate, design and create bid documents for repair and upgrade of existing lighting systems. It is the intent of the Department of Veterans Affairs to have the A/E fully survey, investigate and document the existing space lighting and lighting control systems in order to gain the knowledge and insight necessary to prepare quality, accurate documents in a professional and competent manner. The objective is to find energy wasting lighting and lighting controls and develop Energy Conservation Measures (ECM). This includes light level surveys with light meters in select areas, visual inspection and other innovative measuring and testing methods. Compare to modern lighting standards and develop lighting modification alternatives, select the alternatives that save the most energy and then create construction documents to implement the selected corrective actions. Each of the above projects is to be completed as separate designs and separate contract documents. Separate A/E construction period services will be provided for each project.
The submitted SF330s will be evaluated on the following criteria:
(1) Professional qualifications necessary for satisfactory performance of required services;

(2) Specialized experience and technical competence in the type of work required, including, where appropriate, experience in energy conservation, pollution prevention, waste reduction, and the use of recovered materials;

(3) Capacity to accomplish the work in the required time;

(4) Past performance on contracts with Government agencies and private industry in terms of cost control, quality of work, and compliance with performance schedules;

(5) Location in the general geographical area of the project and knowledge of the locality of the project; provided, that application of this criterion leaves an appropriate number of qualified firms, given the nature and size of the project; and

(6) Reputation and standing of the firm and its principal officials with respect to professional performance, general management, and cooperativeness.

(7) Record of significant claims against the firm because of improper or incomplete architectural and engineering services.

(8) Specific experience and qualifications of personnel proposed for assignment to the project and their record of working together as a team
The awarded A/E firm will prepare drawings and specifications in sufficient detail such that qualified outside General Contracting companies can prepare accurate and timely proposals for the desired work. The awarded A/E firm is responsible for ensuring that the specifications and drawings supplied fully represent all of the work described in the Request for Proposal (RFP).   The Medical Center must remain operational throughout the construction period and a detailed sequence of work will be provided by the A/E to minimize impact of the construction.  The NAICS code for this project is 541310.  The SF330 can be downloaded through the GSA Forms Library at: http://www.gsa.gov/portal/forms/type/TOP, type in SF330 in the "Find a Form" block and click on search.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL; NO SOLICITATION PACKAGE WILL BE ISSUED UNTIL AFTER AN EVALUATION HAS BEEN MADE ON THE PROVIDED SF330. 

THE ESTIMATED MAGNITUDE OF DESIGN FOR PROJECT 626-13-403 & 626A4-14-401 IS BETWEEN $25,000 AND $100,000.

<DESC>The US Army Contracting Command-Aberdeen Proving Ground (ACC-APG) Belvoir Division is seeking sources on behalf of the Project Manager Mobile Electric Power (PM MEP) that have available, or have the capability to manufacture, test and deliver Advanced Medium Mobile Power Sources (AMMPS) using Government furnished Technical Data Packages.  Potential sources must have the capability to effectively interpret detailed government specifications and product drawings to assemble and conduct production conformance test requirements (in accordance with Mil-Std-705 Test methods) as ordered.  The AMMPS program will procure the medium sized tactical sets, which include generator set sizes 5, 10, 15, 30 and 60 kW. The AMMPS program includes 26 different configurations, including 50/60 Hertz (Hz) models and 400 Hz models with optional winterization kits.  The AMMPS family of generators includes ten skid-mounted configurations and 16 trailer-mounted configurations as Power Units and Power Plants (PU/PP). The PU/PPs include trailer interface kits, switch boxes and cables mounted on standard military trailers. The trailers to be used include the 1-ton Light Tactical Trailer (LTT) and the 2.5-ton M200A1 trailer. Standard light and medium tactical wheeled vehicles will tow the trailer-mounted configurations. The AMMPS program will require logistics related products.

The barracks was originally built in the year 1961 and last renovated in 1988. Cadets are currently housed in the existing barracks, which do not meet current Army standards. They do not meet a typical training barracks 2+2 configuration. The barracks are sub-standard; do not provide sufficient square footage. The barracks is also deficient in required power, communications, security and utilities. Ventilation is not in compliance with building codes and mold exists in the barracks presenting a continual health risk to the Cadets. The current barracks does not provide enough female latrines to accommodate the 16% female population. <br> The current HVAC, fire suppression, and infrastructure deficiencies negatively impact the health and security and safety of the Cadets. There is no air conditioning in the barracks. The current infrastructure will require substantial upgrades to meet current health, safety and security codes and requirements. <br>  <br>

<a href="mailto:bernadette.t.quevedo.civ@mail.mil">MICC - White Sands Missile Range</a>
<DESC>This is a sources sought announcement only and is not an intent to procure.  A solicitation is not available at this time and any requests for a solicitation will not receive a response.  The Survivability, Vulnerability, & Assessment Directorate (SVAD) on White Sands Missile Range (WSMR) is conducting market research to determine the capability of businesses in regards to the design, manufacture, and testing process for a Relativistic Electron Tube (Reltron Tube). <br>  <br> A Reltron Tube is a device used to generate high power pulsed microwaves by accelerating electrons to relativistic speeds. The Reltron Tube (Tube 5) needs to operate in the 1350-1700 MHz frequency band in support of the High Power Microwave (HPM) test facility.   In order to perform HPM testing in the above listed frequency range, SVAD requires this tube to be designed, manufactured and tested prior to its delivery to WSMR.  This frequency band is currently considered a test gap of the HPM test facility and needs to be acquired in order to provide a realistic HPM threat environment to its customers. <br>  <br> The three main parts associated with Tube 5 are the Injector Region with Cathode, Modulating Cavity, and Accelerating Region with Beam Dump. Tube 5 specifications consist of a frequency range selectable from 1350-1700 MHz. Peak Power should be a nominal 170 MW, as calculated to produce a radiated field of 50 kV/m at 15 meters from the face of a horn antenna. The Illumination Area needs to cover 12 square meters @ 15 meters. For the RF pulse width, WSMR has a goal of 220 cycles. This limitation is set by the 500 ns pulse width of the government owned pulsed power drivers, under impedance-matched conditions, minus the rise time of the RF modulation envelope which was typically 80-100 ns in the beam-stick tests. 550 MHz has cycle time of 1.82 nsec. <br>  <br> Reltron Tubes commonly produce X-ray energy created by bremsstrahlung radiation of the decelerating electrons. Because of this by-product, Tube 5 will need to meet the Department of the Army Radiation Safety Program Pamphlet 385-24. The extent of the X-RAY shielding requirements will be dependent on the radiological dose rates produced by the Reltron Tube. The thicknesses of the lead shielding surrounding this Reltron Tube will need to attenuate the X-ray exposure within the standard maximum worker-allowed radiation level. <br>  <br> The Tube 5 design needs to adapt and be interchangeable within WSMR's test bed. The vendor will need the resources to complete the required design, manufacture, and testing process of tube 5 prior to its delivery to WSMR. <br>  <br> The specific tasks that the vendor shall perform are: <br>  	Design of output section <br>  	Fabricate output section <br>  	Assemble the output section <br>  	The fully assembled output section will be  quote mark delivered in place quote mark  <br>  	Purchase directional coupler and transmission waveguide required for tests <br>  	Integrate the output section onto Tube 5  quote mark beam-stick quote mark  <br>  	Test Tube 5 on Reltron test bed <br>  	Characterize tube 5 performance in single shot mode across frequency band (measurement of peak power and pulse width in transmission waveguide using directional coupler) <br>  	Determine repetition rate capability of Tube 5 with a goal of achieving 5 Hz operation <br>  	Provide a test report with the demonstrated peak power and RF pulse width described in section 2 <br>  	Pre-delivery acceptance testing witnessed by WSMR personnel at vendor facility <br>  	The Reltron Tube will be packaged and shipped for final performance testing at WSMR after Pre-delivery acceptance is complete. <br>  	Tube 5 installation by WSMR/SVAD personnel in Gov't owned platform <br>  	Final performance testing conducted at WSMR HPM facility by SVAD personnel <br>  <br> The estimated period of performance for this SOW is 12 months from contract award date. <br>  <br> Each potential source shall give a brief description of their ability to produce the Reltron Tube and provide design, manufacture and test procedures for the Reltron Tube.  This description should include a demonstration that the source: has adequate financial resources to perform the contract, or the ability to obtain them;  be able to comply with the required or proposed delivery or performance schedule, taking into consideration all existing commercial and governmental business commitments;  has a satisfactory record of integrity and business ethics; has the necessary organization, experience, accounting and operational controls, and technical skills, or the ability to obtain them; and has the necessary production, construction, and technical equipment and facilities, or the ability to obtain them. <br>  <br> Each potential source is also requested to provide the contract number(s), dollar value(s) and brief description of work previously or currently being performed, which specifically demonstrates the contractor's ability to successfully satisfy the requirements of the Reltron Tube.  Firms shall also provide point of contact information where available for the efforts cited above. <br>  <br> All responses to this sources sought are limited to twelve pages and must include the following additional information: name and address of firm, commercial activity/government entity (CAGE) code, business size and status, point of contact name, title, phone, and email.  Interested sources shall submit all replies by email to bernadette.t.quevedo.civ@mail.mil no later than 1300 MST on November 8, 2013.  Acknowledgement of receipt will not be made. <br>  <br> THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT INTEND TO AWARD A CONTRACT ON THE BASIS OF THIS SOURCES SOUGHT OR TO OTHERWISE PAY FOR THE INFORMATION SOLICITED.  This request for information is for planning purposes only and shall not be considered as an Invitation for Bid (IFB), Request for Quotation (RFQ), or Request for Proposal (RFP), or as an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any products or services.  Your responses to this sources sought will be treated as information only.  No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of contractor submission of responses to this sources sought or Government use of such information.

<DESC>This is a Request for Information (RFI) only. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is currently analyzing the feasibility and affordability of encouraging increased collection of iris data from criminal subjects by state and local criminal justice partners. Fingerprints are well established as the most widely accepted biometric for the purposes of establishing identity for criminal subjects. Facial comparison and recognition is gaining significant traction; "mug shots" have been a staple of the criminal justice system process but only recent advances in the reliability of facial recognition and comparison technologies are bringing face on par with fingerprints as a "must have" biometric. Despite the widely accepted acknowledgement that iris is among the strongest unique biometric identifiers, iris collection and comparison remains nascent. This is due in part to the higher cost of integrating iris sensors into the existing booking process, a more involved collection effort, and the lack of large iris databases for useful services for those organizations collecting and using iris information.<br /><br />Because virtually all state and local law enforcement partners are already capturing facial images during the criminal justice process, State and local criminal justice partners may be more likely to embrace iris collection if it could be accomplished from a single collection platform that also collects facial images. An affordable, user-friendly combined simultaneous face/iris capture platform may be a cornerstone component of the Next Generation Booking Environment for federal, state, and local criminal justice agencies. In order to increase technical familiarity of combined face/iris collection systems among state and local partners and better help sensor developers to understand the law enforcement requirements, the FBI is inviting combined face/iris collection platform vendors to participate in a select technical demonstration showcase in Atlanta, Georgia on December 4, 2013. <br /><br />The technical demonstration showcase will be held in conjunction with the FBI Criminal Justice Information Services Division's semi-annual Advisory Policy Board (APB) meeting. The APB is comprised of executive leadership from state and local criminal justice organizations covering all regions of the United States, as well as senior representatives from other sectors of the federal criminal justice system, the national security community, and the tribal law enforcement community.<br /><br />The FBI is interested in showcase participants that have developed operational combined simultaneous face/iris collection systems suitable for use in a standard criminal justice "booking" environment, which generally entails:<br />&bull; Controlled collection environment;<br />&bull; Fixed/controllable sensor distances;<br />&bull; Fixed/controllable lighting conditions;<br />&bull; Compliant subjects;<br />&bull; ANSI/NIST standards compliant.<br /><br />Space for this event is extremely limited; the FBI anticipates that a maximum of seven vendors will be invited to participate in the technical showcase. In order to determine vendor suitability, the FBI is requesting that interested vendors attach product material and deployment information along with their expression of interest in attending. <br /><br />All vendor participation requests must be received no later than 11:00 am EST on&nbsp;November 6, 2013. Vendors will receive notification of their selection or non-selection no later than November 15, 2013. Vendors selected to participate will receive additional information about access to the Atlanta showcase location. <br /><br />Participation requests, product material and deployment information and Questions about this event may be submitted via email only to: Michael.Young6@ic.fbi.gov<br /><br />THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY. This RFI does not constitute a solicitation or a promise to issue a solicitation in the future. This RFI does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. Furthermore, we are not seeking proposals. Responders are advised that the Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI. All costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the responding vendor's expense. All information received in response to this RFI that is marked proprietary will be handed accordingly. The Government shall not be liable for or suffer and consequential damage for any propriety information not properly identified. Propriety information will be safeguarded in accordance with the applicable Government regulations. Propriety information or trade secrets should be clearly identified. <br /><br />Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract or agreement. Responses to the RFI will not be returned. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future solicitation.<br />

<SUBJECT>Acid/Base Wet Bench 
<SOLNBR>AMD-14-SS01
<RESPDATE>111313
<CONTACT>Paula Wilkison, Contract Specialist, Phone 301-975-8448, Email paula.wilkison@nist.gov - Patrick K Staines, Contract Specialist, Phone (301)975-6335, Email patrick.staines@nist.gov
<DESC>The National Institute of Standards &amp; Technology (NIST) seeks information on commercial vendors that are capable of providing one or more custom polypropylene, acid/base handling wet benches to support nanofabrication in the Center for Nanoscale Science and Technology (CNST), NIST's nanotechnology user facility. The bench(s) will be sited and used as a shared resource accessible to researchers from industry, academia, NIST, and other government agencies in the CNST NanoFab.
<p><br />After results of this market research are obtained and analyzed, and specifications are developed, NIST may conduct a competitive procurement and subsequently award a Purchase Order for a custom polypropylene, acid/base handling wet bench. If at least two qualified small businesses are identified during this market research stage, then any competitive procurement that resulted would be conducted as a small business set-aside.</p>
<p><br />An acid/base handling wet bench is an exhausted enclosure that contains a well-illuminated, unobstructed horizontal work surface where researchers can safely use concentrated liquid acidic and/or basic solutions. The work surface is typically equipped with accessories specialized for the specific application of the wet-bench. For NIST, the applications are nanofabrication processes. The work surface is mounted over a liquid-tight acid/base resistant basin that collects all liquids from any embedded sink drains, dump or spray water rinsers, and surface perforations in the work surface. The construction material is typically white polypropylene, with all water supply plumbing rated for use with high purity deionized water.</p>
<p><br />NIST currently owns several acid/base wet benches that are nearing end-of-life and can no longer meet the capacity requirements. In order to increase NIST's capacity to serve users and provide additional technical capabilities for nanofabrication, NIST has a need for one or more replacement acid/base wet benches, which meet the following minimum requirements:</p>
<p><br />1. GENERAL<br />These wet benches are intended to be used by researchers who need to safely perform manual wet processing using acidic and/or basic chemical solutions. The bench(s) shall be suitable for installation and use in a vertical laminar flow, class 100 cleanroom, and accommodate at least 3 simultaneous users. The bench(s) will replace existing benches and therefore must be compatible with the existing space and utilities. The bench(s) will be equipped with features that provide the following utility support: high purity nitrogen, semiconductor grade deionized (DI) water, city water, acid/base drain, acid/base exhaust, compressed air, high purity nitrogen gas, and 110 VAC GFCI electrical outlets.</p>
<p>2. BENCH CONFIGURATION<br />a. The system will be mounted in a through-wall configuration with all utility connection in the rear panel.<br />b.

STATEMENT OF WORK
Background Information
Immunohistochemical staining is widely used in the diagnosis of abnormal cells such as those found in cancerous tumors. Pathology is requesting this immunostainer so slides may be prepared to allow the pathologists to differentiate different malignancies. Currently the tissues that need immunostaining are sent to a reference lab for staining and reading. Jack C. Montgomery VA Medical Center in Muskogee, OK sends approximately 175 specimens out which results in approximately 810 slides per year. These numbers are expected to increase as our patient population increases.

Scope:
Desirable characteristics:
"	30 slide capacity or more
"	Processing of 60 slides/8 hour shift or more
"	35 reagents on board or more
"	Able to process following specimens:

Specimen 	#specimens per year 	Average # slides per specimen 	Total # slides 
Lung 	50 	5 (includes + and -) 	250 
Lesion 	25 	3 (includes + and -) 	75

The work is primarily located at public access facilities such as boat ramps and swim beaches as well as Dworshak, Lower Granite, Little Goose, Lower Monumental, Ice Harbor and McNary Projects.  These facilities are located in the states of Oregon, Washington and Idaho and encompass over one dozen counties.  All sites in Walla Walla District are adjacent to or are located in the Columbia, Clearwater or Snake Rivers. <br> In addition, work may be required at USACE Portland District public access facilities including John Day, The Dalles, Bonneville, Willamette and Rogue River Projects as well as work sites, facilities and vessels under the direction of Channel and Harbors Branch. <br>  <br> All interested and capable contractors are encouraged to respond.

Potential dramatic improvements in logistics, cost, and mission capability for all services are the desired goal. The Army desires to take advantage of emerging solutions from applied and advanced research initiatives that show promise in the following: <br>  A. Enhancing mobility:  less carried weight for both soldiers and vehicles;  <br>  B. Increased force protection:  fewer/lighter resupplies/reduced fuel consumption; <br>  C. Reducing logistics cost and logistics footprint in the battle space without  affecting Warfighting capability or readiness; <br>  D. Reducing environmental impacts (Emissions); <br>  E. Increasing Platform Capability:   <br>      1.	Longer effective missions - extending the Battlefield Mission <br>      2.	Filling in the power gap between battery and smallest generator set  <br>      3. Silent Watch - increasing Soldier survivability via reduced noise signature <br>      4.

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [X], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>New or in good condition- initial acceptance will be at the discretion of the acceptor during the delivery. All items required must be fully functional, present, and compatible as required by the SOW. <BR> <BR>Monthly delivery for one year. <BR> <BR>

<DESC>We require monthly inspections of the tributaries and streams within the US Forest Service Santee Experimental Forest, with a focus on maintaining uninterrupted and reliable stream flow in Watersheds 77, 79, 80 and in Turkey Creek (Watershed 78). This involves thorough investigation of these streams, over a distance of at least 300 meters upstream and downstream of specified control points, plus adjacent riparian areas. The control points include the Watershed 77, 79 and 80 stream gauging stations, the Turkey Creek station (located where Turkey Creek flows under SC Hwy 41N; see attached map), and the point at which Turkey Creek flows under the Irishtown Rd bridge. If beaver activity in a control area is observed (during a monthly inspection or by on-site personnel), we expect the immediate initiation of actions to remove the animals and further inspections until the activity ceases. The animals should be removed by ethical and humane methods, and all state and federal laws should be observed (it is understood that firearms or trapping methods may be used). Any materials used by the beavers for dam or lodge building must be removed to prevent obstruction of stream water flow within the control area.

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) ___ Are, ___ are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) ___ Have, ___ have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) ___ Are, ___ are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) ___ Have, ___ have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p><br />STATEMENT OF NEED<br />Hydrogen</p>
<p><br />1. BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The National Weather Service (NWS) is a 24 hour, 365 day operation, and is a public safety agency. The primary mission of the NWS is the protection of life and property. In support of the mission, the NWS in Boise, ID launches weather balloons routinely twice a day at 4am and 4pm MST. Each balloon requires approximately 65 cubic feet (CF) of hydrogen. Instrumentation is attached to each balloon which provides measurements of temperature, humidity, wind speed and direction, and height. This data is transmitted worldwide and used to make weather forecasts out to 10 days.</p>
<p>2. OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>The objective of the National Weather Service is to receive and keep on-hand an adequate supply of hydrogen (between 900 and 2,500 CF), to perform the weather balloon launches on schedule.</p>
<p>3. SCOPE</p>
<p>The Contractor is responsible for supplying hydrogen on a weekly basis to the National Weather Service office located at 3833 S. Development Ave., Bldg. 3807, Boise, ID. The total amount of hydrogen to be delivered for this requirement is between 900 and 1000 CF per week (between 48,000 and 52,000 CF annually).</p>
<p>4. PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE</p>
<p>The base period of performance for this requirement is 12 months, beginning January 1, 2014 and ending December 31, 2014, with the option to extend up to four additional option period years.</p>
<p>5. PLACE OF PERFORMANCE</p>
<p>All deliveries are to be made to the National Weather Service office located at 3833 S. Development Ave., Building 3807, Boise, ID 83705. The point of delivery is at the Inflation Building, which is located in the northwest corner of the parking lot area of the main NWS office building. Access to the Inflation Building requires a key, which the Driver must obtain from NWS personnel at the time of delivery. Furthermore, the NWS is located on the National Interagency Fire Center's (NIFC) campus, which is a secure federal facility. The Driver must obtain access first to the campus via NIFC security Gatehouse entrance to the campus. The Driver must have a valid Employee ID and valid Driver's License in order to obtain access to the NIFC campus.</p>
<p>6. REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p>Site Storage and Usage: All hydrogen must be provided in individual cylinders as the facility is not arranged to allow for six-packs or other configurations. The Government has space at the delivery point to receive and store up to twelve cylinders of hydrogen at a time. It is the objective of this requirement to keep on hand between 900 and 2,500 CF of hydrogen, with approximately 900 CF being used per week, leaving approximately a one-week supply of hydrogen as backup stock in case of additional unplanned balloon launches, or other unforeseen circumstances. <br /><br />Transition Period: If the contract is awarded to other than the incumbent Contractor, then prior to the first day of the contract, the new Contractor and one of the agency points of contact (see section 9 of this document) shall meet to arrange the delivery schedule, including coordinating the initial delivery to coincide with the pickup of cylinders by the former contractor. The meeting may be in person, by phone, or by email. It is critical to operations that the transition from the incumbent to the new Contractor occurs on the same day, with pickup of cylinders by the incumbent occurring before the new delivery, due to space constraints. Likewise, upon completion of this contract, if the new follow-on contract is awarded to other than the current Contractor, the current Contractor shall participate in the transition coordination efforts.</p>
<p>Initial and Recurring Deliveries: For the initial delivery, the Contractor shall supply 2,500 CF of hydrogen on or before the first day of the new contract, in accordance with the agreed upon schedule, to the Place of Performance. Thereafter, the Contractor shall, on the same day each week, in accordance with the agreed upon schedule, replenish the hydrogen stock up to 2,500 CF, replacing all empty hydrogen cylinders with full hydrogen cylinders. The Contractor shall pickup the empty cylinders in the same trip.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall contact National Weather Service personnel at this location when arriving for delivery. The Driver needs a key to the Inflation Building and obtains the key from NWS personnel at the time of delivery. The key must be returned to the NWS personnel prior the Driver leaving the premises. A loading and unloading area is available at this location such that cylinders can be rolled from a truck lift gate to its delivery point.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall ensure the bottles are securely strapped to the stand at delivery and placed in an orderly/neat and clean fashion. The Contractor shall perform the deliveries in such a manner that there will be minimal interruption to or interference with the normal operation of Government business on the premises.</p>
<p>Evidence of Delivery: The Driver shall provide evidence of delivery by way of receipt signed by a NWS representative at the time of delivery. A copy of the signed receipt shall be left with the NWS representative, and a copy shall also be attached to the associated invoice when mailed.</p>
<p>Compliance: If any of the deliveries do not conform to contract requirements (i.e. a delivery results in less than full replenishment of hydrogen to 2,500 CF), the Government reserves the right to require the Contractor to bring the delivery into conformity with contract requirements, at no increase in contract amount (i.e. without additional delivery charges).</p>
<p>7. SAFETY AND SECURITY</p>
<p>All rules concerning safety, not smoking and the security of the property must be observed at all times.</p>
<p>Materials Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) must be provided by the Contractor to the Meteorologist in Charge (MIC) or Administrative Support Assistant (ASA) at each office, where the information will be kept on file in accordance with applicable guidelines of the OSHA Hazard Communications Standard. Requirements pertaining to recordkeeping will be strictly followed, with copy(s) provided to MIC as necessary and upon request.</p>
<p>8. INVOICING</p>
<p>The Contractor will invoice on a monthly basis in arrears for that month's hydrogen deliveries and related surcharges (i.e. cylinder rental fee, etc.). The invoice must include the following items:</p>
<p>a. Name and address of the contractor, which must be the same as that on the Purchase Order<br />b. Invoice date and invoice number<br />c. Purchase Order number and associated line item number from the Purchase Order<br />d. Description, quantity, unit of measure, unit price and extended price of supplies delivered, and date of delivery<br />e. Evidence of delivery by way of receipt signed by NWS representative at the time of delivery<br />f. Name (where practicable), title, phone number, and mailing address of person to notify in the event of a defective invoice (a defective invoice is one that does not meet all the above requirements)</p>
<p>The invoices shall be sent to the following address:</p>

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage.

The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms "contract," "contractor," and "Contracting Officer" shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights.<br />(f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507-1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk.</p>
<p>(g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future. Accordingly, the contractor may at any time seek a waiver from the Head of the Contracting Activity by submitting such waiver request to the Contracting Officer, including a full written description of the requested waiver and the reasons in support thereof. <br />(End of clause)</p>

<p>STATEMENT OF NEED<br />Hydrogen</p>
<p>1. BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The National Weather Service (NWS) is a 24 hour, 365 day operation, and is a public safety agency. The primary mission of the NWS is the protection of life and property. The NWS in Elko, NV launches weather balloons routinely twice a day at 4am and 4pm Pacific Time. Each balloon requires approximately 85 cubic feet (CF) of hydrogen. Instrumentation is attached to each balloon which provides measurements of temperature, humidity, wind speed and direction, and height. This data is transmitted worldwide and used to make weather forecasts out to 10 days.</p>
<p>2. OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>The objective of the National Weather Service is to receive and keep on-hand an adequate supply of hydrogen (between 510 and 1,700 CF) and to perform the weather balloon launches on schedule.</p>
<p>3. SCOPE</p>
<p>The Contractor is responsible for supplying hydrogen to the National Weather Service office located at the Weather Forecast Office-Elko, 3720 Paradise Drive, Elko, NV 89801. The total amount of hydrogen to be delivered for this requirement is between 1,200 and 1,700 CF per week (62,400 and 88,400 CF annually).</p>
<p>4. PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE</p>
<p>The base period of performance for this requirement is 12 months, beginning January 1, 2014 and ending December 31, 2014, with the option to extend up to four additional years.</p>
<p>5. PLACE OF PERFORMANCE</p>
<p>All deliveries are to be made to the National Weather Service office at 3720 Paradise Drive, Elko, NV 89801. The point of delivery is at the Upper Air building, which is located east of the Main office and has a white domed roof. Doors that are used for delivery access are located on the north side of the building.</p>
<p>6. GENERAL REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p>All hydrogen must be provided in individual cylinders as the facility is not arranged to allow for other configurations. The Government has space at the delivery point to receive and store up to 15 cylinders of hydrogen at a time. It is the objective of this requirement to keep on hand between 510 and 1,700 CF of hydrogen, with a minimum of 1,190 CF being used each week, leaving approximately a three-day supply of hydrogen as backup stock in case of additional unplanned balloon launches, or other unforeseen circumstances. Actual usage will vary based on the need for additional balloon launches.</p>
<p>This site is operated 365 days a year. Therefore, the delivery schedule needs to be maintained regardless of holidays. If a holiday falls on a scheduled delivery day and the Contractor is not open due to the holiday, they shall make arrangements in advance for an alternative delivery date. The Contractor will contact the National Weather Service office if the delivery is going to be delayed for any other reason.<br /><br />If this contract is awarded to other than the incumbent Contractor, then prior to the first day of the contract, the new Contractor and one of the agency points of contact listed in section 9 shall establish the delivery schedule, including coordinating the initial delivery to coincide with the pickup of cylinders by the former contractor. Likewise, upon completion of this contract, if the new follow-on contract is awarded to other than the current Contractor, the current Contractor shall participate in the transition coordination efforts in order to minimize the risk of a missed balloon launch due to the hydrogen being unavailable at the launch site. The end-of-contract transition period may include a lighter delivery in the final weeks of the contract.</p>
<p>7. DELIVERY</p>
<p>For the initial delivery, the Contractor shall supply to the Place of Performance 1,700 CF of hydrogen in accordance with the agreed upon schedule. Thereafter, the Contractor shall, every week in accordance with the agreed upon schedule, replenish the hydrogen stock up to 1,700 CF, replacing all empty hydrogen cylinders with full hydrogen cylinders. The Contractor shall pickup the empty cylinders in the same trip. If additional deliveries are required prior to the next regularly scheduled delivery, the NWS will contact the Contractor and request the additional delivery, with delivery completed within two business days of being contacted.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall sign in with NWS personnel at the main building when a delivery is occurring in order to obtain a key for the facility. The delivery person shall return the key once the delivery is complete and sign out of the main building.</p>
<p>A loading and unloading area is available at this location such that a cylinder can be rolled from a truck lift gate to its delivery point.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall ensure the bottles are securely strapped to the stand at delivery and placed in an orderly/neat and clean fashion. The Contractor shall perform the deliveries in such a manner that there will be minimal interruption to or interference with the normal operation of Government business on the premises.</p>
<p>If any of the deliveries do not conform to contract requirements (i.e. a delivery results in less than full replenishment of hydrogen to 1,700 CF), the Government reserves the right to require the Contractor to bring the delivery into conformity with contract requirements, at no increase in contract amount (i.e. without additional delivery charges).</p>
<p>8. SAFETY AND SECURITY</p>
<p>All rules concerning safety, not smoking and the security of the property must be observed at all times.</p>
<p>Materials Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) must be provided by the Contractor to the Meteorologist in Charge (MIC) or Administrative Support Assistant (ASA) at each office, where the information will be kept on file in accordance with applicable guidelines of the OSHA Hazard Communications Standard. Requirements pertaining to recordkeeping will be strictly followed, with copy(s) provided to MIC as necessary and upon request.</p>
<p>8. POINTS OF CONTACT</p>
<p>The Government contacts at the National Weather Service office in Elko, NV are:</p>
<p>To be provided at contract award.</p>
<p>9. INVOICING</p>
<p>The Contractor will invoice on a monthly basis in arrears for that month's hydrogen deliveries and related surcharges (i.e. cylinder rental fee, etc.). The invoice must include the following items:</p>
<p>a. Name and address of the contractor, which must be the same as that on the Purchase Order<br />b. Invoice date and invoice number<br />c. Purchase Order number and associated line item number from the Purchase Order<br />d. Description, quantity, unit of measure, unit price and extended price of supplies delivered, and date of delivery<br />e. Evidence of delivery by way of receipt signed by NWS representative at the time of delivery<br />f. Name (where practicable), title, phone number, and mailing address of person to notify in the event of a defective invoice (a defective invoice is one that does not meet all the above requirements)</p>
<p>The invoices will be sent to the following address:</p>

<p>8. NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program. It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is (202).372-3695.</p>

STATEMENT OF WORK<br />POSITION DESCRIPTION<br />BACKGROUND<br />USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified<br />individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for<br />priority conflict-prone countries.

OTI assists in securing peace by<br />aiding indigenous local partners such as civil society groups (non-governmental organizations or<br />informal community groups), local governments, private businesses, media groups, and others,<br />through identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic<br />needs; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; re-integration of excombatants<br />into civilian society; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based<br />organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public understanding and<br />participation in their country's political process.<br />To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a<br />group of high level professionals and experts under U.S. Personal Services Contracts (USPSCs).<br />These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force<br />and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and<br />objectives.

Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16 FAM 116 available at<br />http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/16fam/index.htm<br />Note: Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health<br />Programs.<br />(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520),<br />Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The<br />contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that<br />covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or<br />provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e)<br />supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."<br />(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is<br />the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both<br />in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms,<br />conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible<br />family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total<br />amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see<br />paragraph (f) of this provision).<br />(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family<br />members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:<br />(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or<br />materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;<br />(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires<br />hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical<br />condition, including obstetrical care; and<br />(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP)<br />determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical<br />condition.<br />(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel<br />for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel<br />and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and<br />Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the<br />Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form<br />DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible<br />Solicitation for a USPSC OTI Program Manager - Program Office<br />SOL-OTI-14-000003<br />19 | P a g e<br />following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac<br />insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up<br />to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs<br />paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical<br />travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID<br />written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.<br />(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the<br />contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a<br />medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067,<br />Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a<br />hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the<br />contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the<br />issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset<br />the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual<br />has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.<br />(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for<br />Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by<br />insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is<br />obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount<br />in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees<br />contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs<br />(see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is<br />covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable<br />insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor<br />must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the<br />repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph,<br />whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse<br />USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives<br />from his/her medevac provider.<br />(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or<br />transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action<br />to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the<br />USPSC/dependent.<br />(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense<br />and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting<br />Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a<br />repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).<br />Solicitation for a USPSC OTI Program Manager - Program Office<br />SOL-OTI-14-000003<br />20 | P a g e<br />ATTACHMENT 2<br />FAR 52.222-50 COMBATING TRAFFICKING IN PERSONS (FEB 2009).<br />(a) Definitions.

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.
(g)(1)(i)  If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, ?doing business as? name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name with a minimum of one business day?s written notification of its intention to?
      (A)  Change the name in the SAM database; 
      (B)  Comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12 of the FAR; and
      (C)  Agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. 
    (ii)  If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (g)(1)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the ?Suspension of Payment? paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. 
   (2)  The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database.  Information provided to the Contractor?s SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the ?Suspension of payment? paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. 
(h)  Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov or by calling 866-606-8220, or 334-206-7828 for international calls.
(End of Clause) <BR> <BR>New Equipment ONLY; NO remanufactured or "gray market" items.  All items must be covered by the manufacturer's warranty. <BR> <BR>Bid MUST be good for 30 calendar days after close of Buy. <BR> <BR>Shipping must be free on board (FOB) destination CONUS (Continental U.S.), which means that the seller must deliver the goods on its conveyance at the destination specified by the buyer, and the seller is responsible for the cost of shipping and risk of loss prior to actual delivery at the specified destination. <BR> <BR>Offeror must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database before an award can be made to them.  If the offeror is not registered in the CCR, it may do so through the CCR website at http://www.ccr.gov. <BR> <BR>The selected Offeror must comply with the following commercial item terms and conditions, which are incorporated herein by reference: FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors - Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition; FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items - the selected offeror must submit a completed copy of the listed representations and certifications; FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial Items, paragraph (a) and the following clauses in paragraph (b): 52.222-21, 52.222-26, 52.222-35, 52.222-36, 52.222-37, 52.225-13, 52.232-34.

<DESC><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>AMENDMENT 5 - Request Capability Statements:<br /></strong>Amendment 5 establishes a second cut-off date of <strong>November 25, 2013 at 2:00pm Eastern</strong>&nbsp;for vendors to provide Capability Statements with the intention of issuing&nbsp;Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs).&nbsp; Capability statements should be sent via email to <a href="mailto:fullerdf@mcc.gov">fullerdf@mcc.gov</a>.&nbsp; Amendment 5 expands Section B.2 Labor Categories/Rates to include labor categories under category entitled "Other" and add additional objectives under Section C.3.7 Objectives.&nbsp; Interested vendors shall submit a Capability Statement for the additional labor categories/objectives and/or the previously published labor categories/objectives.&nbsp; Interested vendors shall also submit the previously attached Workbook TABS entitled "Rates", "Past Performance Matrix", and "Business Information".<br /><br />AMENDMENT 4 - Responses to Questions is attached.<br /><br />AMENDMENT 3<br />The BPA covers six distinct technical work areas of possible technical work in the future: <br />&bull; Threshold Program<br />&bull; Economic Analysis<br />&bull; Monitoring and Evaluation<br />&bull; Institutional Review Boards (IRBs)<br />&bull; Social and Gender<br />&bull; Finance, Investment and Trade
<p>Each of these six work areas include a range of possible technical skills that will be required on future call orders, and for some, especially M&amp;E, the range of skills listed is very wide. Given this breadth of listed technical skills described under the BPA, it is possible that many (and possibly most) vendors will not have all the requisite skills across all six work areas or within some or all of the six work areas. This reality should not discourage vendors from responding individually, nor should it be seen as a signal that small vendors need to work together with a large prime contractor to be recognized by MCC.</p>
<p>From MCC's perspective, the objective of the BPA is to generate a population of known vendors with known areas of expertise and interest. While vendors are free to work together to submit a response to the RFQ on all elements of the six work areas, that is not MCC's primary intent. Instead, MCC encourages vendors to respond individually or in small groups to demonstrate their core competencies on any or all of the six work areas and on any or all of the skills required within each work area. It is not MCC's intention to receive responses from a small number of mega-consortia that cover all areas; rather, MCC is seeking to establish relationships with a broad range of possible future partners. That relationship is expected to be flexible. Vendors that demonstrate core competency in a subset of skills within a work area or within a sub-set of work areas will have the opportunity to respond to future task orders either by building new institutional capacity in skills that were not previously listed or to work together with other vendors that have complementary skills. In other words, individual responses from small vendors that cover only a sub-set of skills or work areas will not preclude those vendors from bidding either individually or collectively on task orders that reach beyond the core competencies listed in their response to the BPA.</p>
<p>See Attached Q&amp;As.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The <strong>first cut off date</strong> for vendor submissions of Capability Statements for MCC-13-RFQ-0084 is <strong>extended</strong> for <strong>2 weeks</strong> from May 24, 2013 <strong>to June 7, 2013 at 2:00pm Eastern Daylight Time</strong>.

<p>The <strong>first cut off date for vendor submissions</strong> of Capability Statements is <strong>May 24, 2013 at 2:00pm</strong> Eastern Daylight Time. Awards of Blanket Purchase Agreements may be made prior to the cut off date.</p>
<p>The solicitation will remain open until December 31, 2018 but submissions will not be accepted after the cut off date identified until the Government reopens a submission period. Please set up an alert to be notified of any amendments.</p>

<p>Vendors need not be capable of performing every requirement under the BPA. Vendors may submit Capability Statements for any of the program needs stated above.</p>
<p>Responses to this Request for Capability Statement shall be submitted to David F. Fuller, at <strong>fullerdf@mcc.gov</strong>. To ensure timely handling, the subject line of ALL email correspondence, SHALL include <strong>"MCC-13-RFQ -0084 (vendor name)".</strong></p>
<p><strong>Statement of Capabilities</strong> - Vendors shall submit Capability Statements for any of the areas stated above. Attached to this Capability Statements request is RFQ MCC-13-RFQ-0084 which includes the Scope, Background, Objectives, and Clauses, as well as a Workbook with TABS for "Rates", "Past Performance Matrix", and "Business Information".</p>
<p>Interested vendors shall submit a capability statement of no more than Thirty (30) single-sided pages (excluding CVs and Workbook), which demonstrates the firm's ability to perform the key scope requirements described above and in the attachments to this synopsis. Standard company brochures and/or paraphrasing of the SOW will not be considered sufficient to demonstrate the capabilities of an interested party.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Vendors shall utilize the attached Workbook to submit their fully loaded rates for any and all labor categories the vendor can perform. Rates shall be submitted for all years covering the BPA and shall coincide with the calendar year and only change on January 1 of every year.</p>

<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks.

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)<br />The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

A courtesy copy (CONUS West Coast performance locations only) to Ermanno Magliulo, Engineering Director, at ermanno.magliulo@navy.mil will be appreciated.</p>
<p>RAPIDGate&reg; is being implemented for access to DoD facilities in CONUS, HI, Guam and Puerto Rico. Vendor is responsible to acquire RAPIDGate&reg; status and destination base individual access badge(s) activation prior to performance start date. Delays that may result from inadequate planning are contractor responsibility. Vendor instructions and program information is available at http://www.RAPIDGate.com or tel. 877.727.4342.

<DESC><p align="left">&nbsp;<strong>Purpose </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;The purpose of this Request for Proposal (the "Request") is to solicit competitive proposals for the retention of an experienced executive search consultant to provide services to the Postal Regulatory Commission ("Commission") as it seeks candidates for the General Counsel position, which will become vacant in January 2014. The General Counsel position is, in terms of salary, roughly the equivalent of an Executive Schedule Level II employee. The Commission would like to make an offer to a new candidate no later than March 2014.</p>
<p>This Request is intended to solicit information pertaining to the advantages, quality of services and costs associated with an executive search process. The consultants to be considered will be expected to submit their responses to this Request by November 12, 2013. Following an initial screening, finalists will meet with the Commission at its offices in Washington DC. The anticipated selection date is December 6, 2013.</p>
<p>This Request does not commit the Commission to any reimbursements of costs or expenses which may be incurred by the respondent in preparing for this Request or any costs or expenses incurred by the respondent prior to the execution of a contracted agreement.</p>
<p>The Commission reserves the right to accept or reject any or all proposals received as a result of this Request, to negotiate separately with competing respondents, and to accept that proposal which, in its judgment, is in the best interests of the Commission.</p>
<strong>
<p>About the Postal Regulatory Commission</p>
</strong>
<p>The Commission is an independent agency that has exercised regulatory oversight over the Postal Service since its creation by the Postal Reorganization Act of 1970. Initially, that oversight consisted primarily of conducting public, on-the-record hearings concerning proposed rate, mail classification or major service changes, and recommending decisions for action by the postal Governors.</p>
<p>The Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act (PAEA) enacted on December 20, 2006, significantly strengthened the Commission's authority to serve as a counterbalance to new flexibility granted to the Postal Service in setting postal rates. The Act requires the Commission to develop and maintain regulations for a modern system of rate regulation, consult with the Postal Service on delivery service standards and performance measures, consult with the Department of State on international postal</p>
<p>policies, prevent cross-subsidization or other anticompetitive postal practices, promote transparency and accountability, and adjudicate complaints.</p>
<p>The law also assigns new and continuing oversight responsibilities to the PRC, including annual determinations of Postal Service compliance with applicable laws, development of accounting practices and procedures for the Postal Service, review of the Universal Service requirement, and assurance of transparency through periodic reports. New enforcement tools include subpoena power, authority to direct the Postal Service to adjust rates and to take other remedial actions, and levying fines in cases of deliberate noncompliance with applicable postal laws.</p>
<em>
<p><strong>Commission Leadership</strong></p>
</em>
<p>The Commission is composed of five Commissioners, each of whom is appointed by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, for a term of six years. A Commissioner may continue to serve after the expiration of his or her term for up to one year or until a successor is confirmed. No more than three members of the Commission may be from one political party. The Chairman is designated by the President and serves as the chief administrator of the agency.</p>
<p>Assisting the Commission is a staff with expertise in law, economics, finance, statistics, and cost accounting. The Commission is organized into four operating offices:</p>
<p><strong>Accountability and Compliance</strong></p>
<p><strong>General Counsel</strong></p>
<p><strong>Public Affairs and Government Relations</strong></p>
<p><strong>Secretary</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Commission maintains an independent office for its Inspector General.</strong></p>
<p>The Office of Accountability &amp; Compliance is responsible for technical analysis and formulation of policy recommendations for the Commission in both domestic and international matters. It provides the analytic support for Commission review of rate changes, negotiated service agreements, classifications of new products, post office closings, and other issues. The Office evaluates Postal Service accounting records, financial reports, and other financial data to assess accuracy, completeness, and conformance to reporting and procedural standards established by the Commission. This includes reports filed pursuant to SEC rules and procedures. The Office assists the Commission in its annual determinations of compliance with service performance standards and the preparation of the annual report to the President and Congress.</p>
<p>The Office of General Counsel provides legal assistance on matters involving the Commission's responsibilities, defends Commission decisions before the courts, and manages the formal complaint process.</p>
<p>The Office of Public Affairs &amp; Government Relations facilitates prompt and responsive communications for the Commission with the public, Congress and federal agencies, the Postal Service, and information media.</p>
<p>The Office of Secretary &amp; Administration records the official actions of the Commission; preserves Commission documents; maintains personnel records; and provides other support services including managing the Commission's library, docket room, and computers.</p>
<p>The Office of Inspector General conducts, supervises, and coordinates audits and investigations relating to the programs and operations of the Commission, and identifies and reports fraud and abuse in Commission programs and operations.<br /><br /><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Scope of Services</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;The Secretary of the Commission has been charged by the Chairman with managing the process for the recruitment and identification of well-qualified finalists for the position of General Counsel. The General Counsel serves at the pleasure of the Commission. The Commissioners will make the final selection for the position.</p>
<p>To assist it in performing this duty, the Commission seeks to engage a well-qualified executive search firm with extensive experience in placing high-level government executives in high-performing organizations. From the Commission's perspective, a successful consulting relationship will be characterized by straightforward, creative, independent consulting, accurate information and analyses, timely and informative responses to requests for information and cultural fit. We are anticipating filling the position from a local applicant pool.</p>
<p>The selected candidate, in addition to performing the consultative, search, and placement services, will be expected to conduct up to three meetings with Commission leadership to discuss perspectives on the scope of responsibilities and ideal qualities for candidates for the General Counsel position. Up to two meetings with Commission leadership to discuss specific potential candidates will also be conducted.</p>

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103.

<DESC> <br> The U.S. Army Research Institute for the Behavioral and Social Sciences (ARI) announces the ARI FY13-18 Broad Agency Announcement for Basic, Applied, and Advanced Scientific Research.  This Broad Agency Announcement (BAA), which sets forth research areas of interest to the United States Army Research Institute for the Behavioral and Social Sciences, is issued under the provisions of paragraph 6.102(d)(2) of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), which provides for the competitive selection of proposals.  Proposals submitted in response to this BAA and selected for award are considered to be the result of full and open competition and in full compliance with the provisions of Public Law 98-369 (The Competition in Contracting Act of 1984) and subsequent amendments.  <br>    <br> The U.S. Army Research Institute for the Behavioral and Social Sciences is the Army's lead agency for the conduct of research, development, and analyses for the improvement of Army readiness and performance via research advances and applications of the behavioral and social sciences that address personnel, organization, training, and leader development issues.  Programs funded under this BAA include basic research, applied research, and advanced technology development that can improve human performance and Army readiness.  The funding opportunity is divided into two sections- (1) Basic Research and (2) Applied Research and Advanced Technology Development.  The four major topic areas of research interest include the following:  (1) Training; (2) Leader Development; (3) Team and Inter-Organizational Performance in Complex Environments; and (4) Solider/Personnel Issues.    <br>    <br> Funding of research and development (R&D) within ARI areas of interest will be determined by funding constraints and priorities set during each budget cycle.  Those contemplating submission of a proposal are encouraged to contact the ARI Technical Point of Contact (TPOC) identified in Part II Section G of this BAA or the responsible ARI Manager noted at the end of the technical area entry (Part II Section A of this BAA) to determine whether the R&D warrants further inquiry.  If the R&D warrants further inquiry and funding is available, submission of a proposal will be entertained.  The recommended three-step sequence is (1) telephone call to the ARI TPOC or responsible ARI Manager, (2) white paper submission, (3) full proposal submission.  Awards may be made in the form of contracts, grants, or cooperative agreements.    <br>    <br> Proposals are sought from educational institutions, non-profit/not-for-profit organizations, and commercial organizations, domestic or foreign, for research and development (R&D) in those areas specified in Part II Section A of this BAA.  The U.S. Army Research Institute for the Behavioral and Social Sciences encourages Historically Black Colleges and Universities/Other Minority Serving Institutions (HBCU/MI) (FAR Part 26.3) small businesses, and small disadvantaged businesses (FAR Part 19) to submit proposals for consideration.  Foreign owned, controlled, or influenced organizations are advised that security restrictions may apply that could preclude their participation in these efforts.  Government laboratories, Federal Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs), and US Service Academies are not eligible to participate as prime contractors or recipients.  However, they may be able to participate as subcontractors or subrecipients (eligibility will be determined on a case by case basis).    <br>    <br>    <br>  This BAA may be accessed from the following websites:   <br>    <br>  https://www.fbo.gov    <br>    <br>  http://www.grants.gov  <br>    <br>    <br>    <br>    <br>    <br>      <br>

<DESC>The Department of Defense, Project Manager for Mobile Electric Power (PM-MEP) and Army Research, Development, and Engineering Command (RDECOM) Power Division - Power Technology Branch will conduct an advanced planning meeting (market research) for the Small Tactical Electric Power (STEP) Systems Program. The purpose of the meeting is to introduce industry to the Army's needs and goals for Small Tactical Electric Power systems in the 500 - 3000 W range.  <br>    <br>  DATE: 11/13/2013  <br>  TIME: 7:45am-12:30pm, EST  <br>  LOCATION:    Department of Defense, Project Manager for Mobile Electric Power  <br>  		     10205 Burbeck Road, Building 324  <br>  		     Fort Belvoir, VA 22060  <br>    <br>  The Army is contemplating the establishment of a new a family of tactical electric, soldier-portable, signature suppressed, multi-fuel compatible power systems in the 500 - 3000 watt range for direct power and hybrid, silent watch, and battery charging applications in the forward tactical battlefield areas.  Potential dramatic improvements in logistics, cost, and mission capability for all services are the desired goal. The Army desires to take advantage of emerging solutions from applied and advanced research initiatives that show promise in the following:  <br>   A. Enhancing mobility:  less carried weight for both soldiers and vehicles;   <br>   B. Increased force protection:  fewer/lighter resupplies/reduced fuel consumption;  <br>   C. Reducing logistics cost and logistics footprint in the battle space without  affecting Warfighting capability or readiness;  <br>   D. Reducing environmental impacts (Emissions);  <br>   E. Increasing Platform Capability:    <br>       1.	Longer effective missions - extending the Battlefield Mission  <br>       2.	Filling in the power gap between battery and smallest generator set   <br>       3. Silent Watch - increasing Soldier survivability via reduced noise signature  <br>       4. Increased reliability/availability  <br>       5.	Increased power density    <br>    <br>   The U.S. Army has issued the generic Tactical Electric Power CPD describing basic requirements for tactical power sources. This document does not require specific power source technologies, although it does require the use of JP-8 fuel.  Currently, there are no fielded JP-8 units in the Army smaller than 2 kW.  A wide range of performance characteristics must be addressed, including AC versus DC output, average power vs. peak power, and system life and reliability.  A set of metrics for the next generation power sources in the 500 - 3000 watt range is attached to this announcement. System solutions rated at a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of 6 or better that meet these requirements are sought. <br>  <br>  All questions relating to registration, attendance requests (please include company name and address, list of employees attending, and phone numbers), and any questions regarding this announcement must be submitted no later than Friday, 8 November 2013  to David Hampton, Contract Specialist, David.M.Hampton23.civ@mail.mil, 703-704-0821. All interested parties must register in order to attend the event.  This workshop is an opportunity for all interested industrial firms to learn about the STEP Program, its development and potential future acquisitions. The purpose of this meeting is for market research purposes only. The Government is not requesting proposals at this time. The Government will not reimburse companies for any expenses associated with attendance of the conference.    <br>

The barracks was originally built in the year 1961 and last renovated in 1988. Cadets are currently housed in the existing barracks, which do not meet current Army standards. They do not meet a typical training barracks 2+2 configuration. The barracks are sub-standard; do not provide sufficient square footage. The barracks is also deficient in required power, communications, security and utilities. Ventilation is not in compliance with building codes and mold exists in the barracks presenting a continual health risk to the Cadets. The current barracks does not provide enough female latrines to accommodate the 16% female population.  <br>  The current HVAC, fire suppression, and infrastructure deficiencies negatively impact the health and security and safety of the Cadets. There is no air conditioning in the barracks. The current infrastructure will require substantial upgrades to meet current health, safety and security codes and requirements.  <br>    <br>

<DESC>This is modification 3 to the synopsis entitled SIMULATION AND SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGY II- SST II, NNJ13471515R which was posted on August 21, 2013. You are notified that questions in response to draft RFP sections C, L, and M are answered below.  The due date for responses is not extended. &lt;p&gt; Q1: Section: M Page: M-4 Paragraph: M.6	 REFERENCE:  Mission Suitability Factor, Mission Suitability Table, Subfactor 4, Small Business Subcontracting Plan &lt;p&gt; Should Subfactor 4 be renamed Small Business Utilization, to include Small Business Subcontracting Plan (SBU-1) and Commitment to the Small Business Program (SBU-2). Please clarify if both SBU-1 and SBU-2 are being evaluated as part of this Subfactor. &lt;p&gt; A1: Subfactor 4 has been renamed to "Small Business Utilization" to include Small Business Subcontracting Plan (SBU-1) and Commitment to the Small Business Program (SBU-2);  both of which will be evaluated under Subfactor 4. &lt;p&gt; Q2: Section: L.20 Page: L-17 Paragraph: Table L-4	 REFERENCE: Mission Suitability Factor 1 in Volume II &lt;p&gt; From Table L-3 and what is noted in paragraph L.21.2, pages L-22 to L-23, we suggest that TA1 for Overall Technical Approach be removed and TA2 be relabeled at TA1, so it is consistent with Table L-3 and paragraph L.21.2. Does the Government agree? &lt;p&gt; A2: The Government does agree with this change however, after further review of the solicitation, TA1 has been restructured and TA2 has been removed. &lt;p&gt; Q3: Section: C Page: 5 Paragraph: 3.0	 REFERENCE:  The Contractor shall develop and implement a Quality Plan in accordance with DRD 4 for work conducted off-site. &lt;p&gt; Section L.17 on page L-12 states that the current plan for the SR&SD contractor is to use existing facilities on-site at the JSC for personnel who will directly support the accomplishment of the contract requirements. &lt;p&gt; Therefore, a Quality Plan does not appear to be a requirement of the Proposal identified on page MA-4 as part of the Management Approach, as the plan would be needed only for offsite contractor employees. Suggest this requirement be deleted from paragraph 3.0 of Section C. Does the Government agree? &lt;p&gt; A3: The Government does agree with this change and as a result, the Quality Plan requirement language has been removed from the Statement of Work (SOW) and the DRD 4, Quality Plan has also been removed from Section J. &lt;p&gt; Q4: Section: M Page: M-12 Paragraph: M.6.4, third paragraph down	 REFERENCE:  For evaluation and selection purposes, the Government will evaluate the Offerors proposed contract year one task order labor and non-labor resources for all contract option years. &lt;p&gt; Suggest that the words all contract option years be deleted from the referenced sentence, as they do not appear to be consistent with the intent of the Governments evaluation as noted in last paragraph on page M-12 which states  For years 2 through 5, the contractor shall straight-line the labor and non-labor resources.	Does the Government agree? &lt;p&gt; A4:  The Government does agree with this change.  The words "all contract option years" have been deleted. &lt;p&gt; Documents related to this procurement will be available over the Internet.  These documents will reside on a World Wide Web (WWW) server, which may be accessed using a WWW browser application.

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to add an estimated level of effort. Please see the updated paragraph below.
<p>The Naval Air Systems Command, Weapons Division (NAWCWD), China Lake, CA is conducting a market survey to determine the interest and capability of Industry to participate in a competitive acquisition for Contractor Engineering Technical Services (CETS) Contractor Field Services (CFS) for Naval Air Technical Data and Engineering Service Center (NATEC), San Diego, CA. The Level of Effort (LOE) is estimated at 11,040 hours. Services will include on and off-site training, technical guidance and advice to resolve unusually complex technical problems. NATEC requires CETS in support of the C-130, AH-1W, P-3, H-46, H-60, EA-6B, and F-18, series aircraft systems and sub-systems. It is essential that the listed aircraft be mission-ready and able to perform their military tasking with the minimum possible failures or faults. The Government is performing market research in order to determine if small businesses possess the capability to execute the requirements within this acquisition. Respondents need to indicate all small business designations. Interested business firms who meet the capability requirements identified in this notice are requested to reply to this notice with a response.

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division (NAWCWD), China Lake, CA intends to modify contract N68936-12-D-0033 on an other than full and open competition basis in accordance with FAR 6.302-1 to provide additional hours (CLIN 0001), other direct costs (CLIN 0002), and other associated costs and fee to Lone Star Aerospace (LSA), Addison, TX. This modification is for LSA to continue providing predictive business and technology decision analysis services for the Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) and the Naval Aviation Enterprise (NAE). LSA is the only known company to provide the tools necessary for integrating a sophisticated version of Bayesian interfacing with Monte Carlo analysis in a single highly-scalable device (currently incorporating 50,000 non-linear variables with no known upper limit identified to-date), facilitating a Delphi-like process which allows groups to consider multiple "what-if" benefits and consequences in real time, and quantitatively ranking all potential outcome options in terms of the areas of greatest potential. In addition to this proprietary tool, LSA has collected a significant amount of NAVAIR and industry data that will continue to be utilized through spiral development. This modification will increase the level-of-effort by approximately 85,632 hours. The contract SOW will not change. Award will be made on or about 13 December 2013.
<p>This notice is not a request for competitive proposals; however, any firm believing that it can provide the required services may submit a capability statement which shall be considered by the agency to be received at the Contracting Office no later than 12 November 2013 at 15:00 Pacific Standard Time. The firm must clearly show its ability to perform the work without compromising the quality, accuracy, reliability, and delivery or causing programmatic hardship. Responses shall be addressed to the Commander, Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division, 429 E. Bowen Road, MS 4015, China Lake, CA 93555-6108, Attn: Susan McKenzie, Code 254110D; or by the preferred method of electronic mail to susan.dautel@navy.mil.</p>

The spectrum of services required range from requirements analysis and concept exploration to rapid prototyping, system development, system sustainment and other related tasks.    <br>    <br>  The Government anticipates a Single Award Indefinite-Delivery/Indefinite-Quantity (ID/IQ) contract vehicle to be awarded.  The Contract Line Item Number (CLIN) structure for the task orders will be structured appropriately to the level of effort to be performed.

<DESC>***THIS NOTICE HAS BEEN AMENDED TO PROVIDE AN EXTENSION TO THE PREVIOUS CLOSING DATE OF OCTOBER 24.&nbsp; VENDORS ARE ENCOURAGED TO SUBMIT CAPABILITIES STATEMENTS AND QUESTIONS IN RESPONSE/PERTAINING&nbsp;TO THE BELOW NOTICE EVEN IF THEY SUBMITTED IN RESPONSE TO THE INITIAL NOTICE***<br /><br /><br />This Request for Information (RFI) is being issued by the Washington Headquarters Services Acquisition Directorate (WHS/AD), on behalf of the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence (OUSDI). Note that this is <strong>NOT</strong> a request for quotes or request for proposal. A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. This RFI seeks industry comments to assist the Government in locating potential sources with the ability to satisfy its requirement. The critical element of this RFI is product/service availability; firms performing under NAICS code 541611 - Administrative Management and General Management Consulting Services with a size standard of $14,000,000.00 are encouraged to respond.
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">RFI Guidelines:</span> <br />Please note that this synopsis is for <strong>INFORMATION</strong> and <strong>PLANNING</strong> purposes only and does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFQ). Responses to the RFI cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract nor will the Government pay for the information solicited or recognize any costs associated with the submission of the RFI. The purpose of the RFI is to provide an opportunity for industry to enhance the success of any future procurement to meet this requirement. Any information obtained as a result of this RFI is intended to be used by the Government on a non-attribution basis for program planning and acquisition strategy development. Providing data/information that is limited or restricted for use by the Government for that purpose would be of very little value and such restricted/limited data/information is not solicited. By submitting information in response to this RFI, submitters of such information impliedly consent to the release and dissemination of submitted information to any Government or non-Government entity to which WHS releases and disseminates the information for review. As such, to the extent that any information submitted in response to this RFI is marked as or construed to be proprietary or business-sensitive, submitters are hereby notified (a) about the potentiality that such information may be disclosed to third parties and (b) that submission of information in response to this RFI constitutes consent to such handling and disclosure of submitted information. Responses to this notice are not considered offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.<br /><br />In the interest of meeting the government's requirement within the required acquisition schedule, the government desires to conclude market research as soon as possible. The government may make a set-aside decision as soon as market research is accomplished adequately to provide a reasonable expectation whether or not offers can be obtained from at least two responsible small business (including consideration of small businesses in socio-economic categories) concerns offering services (itself or of other small businesses) that will result in award being made at a fair market price. Thus, responses received after a reasonable expectation is determined, and before the RFI response date, will have no bearing on the set-aside decision.</p>
<p>Potential sources are invited to submit Capabilities Statements along with relevant experience related the requirements. In addition, please indicate your business size and other socio-economic characteristics as well as whether you currently possess a GSA Schedule. The response is limited to 8 pages.</p>
<p>All responses and questions shall be submitted via e-mail to <a href="mailto:dennis.jackson33.civ@mail.mil">dennis.w.jackson33.civ@mail.mil</a>. Responses are due no later than 3:00 P.M. on Thursday, October 24, 2013. Only attach MS Word/Excel compatible files or Adobe Acrobat PDF files in electronic correspondence.</p>
