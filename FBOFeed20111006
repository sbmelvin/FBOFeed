<DESC>PROJECT INFORMATION:
<p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, has a requirement for architectural, engineering, and technical design services for the renovation of the existing upper Unity Work Center compound site.  The purpose is to develop concept design documents, preliminary design documents, construction documents, and engineering services during construction.</p>
<p>Unity Work Center (USFS) is located in Unity, Oregon (pop. 130), which is approximately 35 air miles southwest of Baker City, Oregon. At one time, three compounds (upper, lower, and middle) had comprised the Forest Service owned administrative site. The use of the site has reduced significantly over the past several years and the Forest has conveyed the lower and middle compounds.  However, the Upper Compound will continue to serve as a seasonal work center, and will serve as a base for fire and recreation crews. With a population of 130, the town of Unity (over an hour drive from Baker) does not have available rentals or apartments to offer for housing. The ability to respond to forest fires in this locality depends on recruiting and retaining employees - providing bunkhouse space is a critical factor.</p>
<p>Most of the existing Forest Service owned housing was located on the lower and middle compounds. The modifications to the Upper Compound are necessary to fit personnel into the existing residual infrastructure. Many of the facilities on this compound are 1930's and 1960's vintage (and are listed in the National Register of Historic Places), and no longer meet current building, occupancy, and health/safety code requirements. Renovations to existing buildings and construction of a new bunkhouse will help make this compound more functional for current and projected future use.<br />The Forest intends to use funds to provide housing for 20 seasonal employees. The Forest would like to remove the modular portion of the existing office (approximately 1,900 square feet), and remodel/expand the remaining stick-frame office (adding approximately 4,000 square feet) into a 20 person bunkhouse as well as design of all associated site/utilities.  A site analysis will need to be completed to determine the technical feasibility of this option, or if there is a more technically sound option that should be pursued.</p>
<p>This building must be upgraded to meet accessibility and current building code standards, upgrade life safety (fire safety) systems, provide food preparation facilities (kitchen), remove the underground heating oil tank (HOT) and replace with compliant above ground heating oil tank, and upgrade the restroom facilities.  Additionally, this project will include energy and sustainability upgrades such as wall and ceiling insulation, thermal-pane windows, upgraded HVAC system, energy-efficient lighting, and installation of a supplemental solar power system. An evaluation and possible replacement of the siding is a component of this project. The IT (radio, telephone, and data) hub for the site will remain in this building and will have to be designed into the project.</p>
<p>The successful A/E shall be responsible for providing all materials, supplies, equipment, transportation, and personnel to provide the required architectural and engineering services and will prepare documents containing alternatives, cost estimates, drawings, calculations and recommendations, as appropriate, for completion of the project work.  All work shall be completed by or under the direct supervision of architects and/or engineers licensed in the State of Oregon (as appropriate to the work being performed).</p>
<p>CONTRACT INFORMATION:</p>
<p>This contract is being procured in accordance with the Brooks Act (P.L. 92-582) as implemented in FAR Subpart 36.6.  A single firm will be selected for negotiation based on demonstrated competence and qualifications for the required work.</p>

<SUBJECT>High Throughput Genotyping and DNA Sequencing for Studying the Genetic Contribution to Human Disease Renewal 2012-2017
<SOLNBR>HHSN-NIH-NHLBI-PS-HG12-20
<RESPDATE>102011

<DESC>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), NIH intends to negotiate on a non-competitive, sole source basis with the Johns Hopkins University (JHU) for the High Throughput Genotyping and DNA Sequencing for Studying Genetic Contributions to Human Disease Renewal 2012-2017 program. This effort will be a five years. JHU, the incumbent contractor, is currently performing this work under Contract HHSN268200782096C/HHSN268201100011I and has the unique capability to provide the required services to NHLBI for the renewal of this program. In addition, inherent duplication of costs to the Government and unacceptable delays in completing the project make competition unfeasible for this study. The cited authorities are 41 U.S.C. 252(c) (1), as set forth in FAR 6.302-1 and HHSAR 306-302-1. The applicable NAICS code for this requirement is <strong>541712</strong>. This program's background and purpose and objectives are detailed below.
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Background<br /></strong></span>The Center for Inherited Disease Research (CIDR) is a program dedicated to providing high quality, high throughput genotyping in support of efforts to locate and identify genes responsible for human disease and health. The identification of the locations of genes that predispose to or are responsible for a variety of human diseases will greatly benefit the programs of the National Institutes of Health. By identifying these genes, the function of their gene products in normal and disease states can be studied. New DNA-based diagnostic methods can be developed and tested in clinical trials. Ultimately, identification of the genes can illuminate the biochemical and physiological pathways that have become deranged in these disorders and thus provide insights that may be crucial to developing both preventive and therapeutic interventions, thereby improving the public health. CIDR is a program established and supported by fourteen NIH Institutes: National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), National Cancer Institute, National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research, National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, National Eye Institute, National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, National Institute on Aging, National Institute of Deafness and other Communication Disorders, National Institute of Mental Health, National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases, National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism and the National Institute on Drug Abuse. NHGRI provides the scientific and administrative oversight for the center.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Purpose and Objectives<br /></span></strong>The purpose of this acquisition is to provide high quality, high throughput human and mouse genotyping services, high throughput exome and whole genome DNA sequencing, whole genome DNA methylation measurements and the ability to produce data in a setting of a laboratory certified under the standards of the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA). Services to be provided will include expertise in statistical genetics and genomic analysis using methods designed to find the genetic basis for disease. These services will support extramural and intramural research programs funded by the fourteen participating Institutes.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Services to be provided:</strong></span> <br />(1) Single nucleotide genotyping (SNP) to allow whole genome linkage scans of at least 10,000 human samples per year. <br />(2) SNP genotyping using custom designed assay for 96 to 500,000 user selected SNPs on ~36,000 samples per year. <br />(3) Fixed content genotyping on platforms capable of scoring 500,000 to 5,000,000 uniformly spaced loci to allow SNP whole genome association scans of ~100,000 human samples per year. These assays shall be designed to capture &gt;90% of the variation in human DNA when taking human linkage disequilibrium into account, for the purposes of genome-wide association studies. This measure should be calculated for each of the three major human ancestral groups. <br />(4) SNP genotyping of human immune response genes using ~200,000 SNPs on ~8,000 samples per year. <br />(5) SNP genotyping using ~ 200,000 SNPs covering the genes in human metabolism in ~35,000 samples per year <br />(6) SNP genotyping of up to ~1500 SNPs in ~5,000 mouse DNA samples per year. <br />(7) Measure DNA methylation in human samples using arrays that cover 10,000 to 250,000 potential sites of methylation in the human genome in ~15,000 samples per year. <br />(8) Carry out whole exome sequencing of human DNA for ~1,000 exomes per year. <br />(9) Carry out whole genome sequencing on human and mouse DNA for ~40 samples per year.<br />(10) Consultation on statistical genetics questions including power estimates for assessing sample size requirements before production genotyping is carried out, and analysis of genotyping data after production genotyping is complete. <br />(11) Strict quality control to include testing of all samples for adequacy of amount and quality of DNA prior to full genotyping and produce genotypes to DNA fingerprint each sample as it enters the lab. <br />(12) Use of pedigree structure information to test for inheritance errors, misattributed parentage, and incorrect gender assignments, all of which might point to sample mix-ups. <br />(13) Provide opportunity for investigators who submit their projects to CIDR to replace problematic DNA samples that do not pass pre-testing quality control before production genotyping is undertaken. <br />(14) Accurate quality control reporting for each project and an annual summary over all projects on missing data, pedigree structure errors, and blind duplicate error rates, using either available software or designing and implementing novel software to generate these reports. <br />(15) Databases for laboratory information management (tracking samples and reagent usage, DNA and reagent quality control), collecting genotyping results, and analyzing genotypes for data quality control metrics. <br />(16) Ability to provide results and all quality control metrics on CD-ROM or electronic media in a format mutually agreed upon by the CIDR Program and the submitting Investigator. <br />(17) Provide system-wide data security and data back-up in a secure location off-site that is specially designed to provide protection from physical damage to storage media. <br />(18) Ability to receive and interpret electronically encoded family and pedigree structure information. <br />(19) Capacity to receive &gt;150,000 DNA samples per year from submitting investigators in multi-well, barcode encoded plates. <br />(20) Ability to aliquot, dilute, test, store and genotype these DNA samples without cross-contamination. <br />(21) Expertise in evaluating and implementing novel genotyping technologies and work flow procedures in order to keep CIDR's methodology up to date and cost effective. <br />(22) Ability to provide SNP genotyping results in a CLIA approved manner upon request for clinical studies.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Anticipated Period of Performance<br /></span></strong>June 1, 2012 through May 31, 2017</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">This notice will close fifteen days from its posting. This is not a request for proposals (RFP). The estimated award date is June 1, 2012.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>NAICS 236220. The General Services Administration (GSA), Public Buildings Service, Special Programs Division (SPD), is seeking a contractor to provide all supervision, labor, materials, and equipment necessary to perform maintenance and repairs on a 600 square foot, one-story office trailer for the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) located at the Wrangell Port of Entry, Wrangell, Alaska 99929. Estimated price range is between $25,000 and $100,000. The estimated date of contract award is 7 December 2011.<br />The purpose of this maintenance and repair work is to increase weatherproofing and to preserve the wood building envelope elements of the exterior of the modular trailer. The exterior paint on the modular trailer and the 25-foot high, steel pole has deteriorated. The trailer's three (3) foot high wood skirting has also deteriorated and requires replacement. The existing interior lighting illumination does not meet standards. The existing downspout discharge location has been altered, and this could eventually lead to damaging the property. Weatherproof sealing of the existing computer room's slider-style vinyl window has deteriorated. One exterior door deadbolt entry lockset is not in compliance with emergency exit requirements. <br />After receipt and approval of bonds and insurance, interior work can occur as soon as possible after contract award, but only after requesting and receiving approval from CBP to allow the work to occur in a manner that does not disrupt CBP's operations.<br />All exterior work must occur during favorable weather conditions on the day the work is to commence with a favorable weather forecast for completion of the work. Weather conditions for exterior painting, staining, and any other exterior work must meet the specifications and manufacturer's requirements for the products being applied and can only occur after requesting and receiving approval from the GSA.<br />Security Considerations: This is a secure and access-controlled facility. Contractor personnel shall be U.S. citizens, free of criminal convictions, and shall submit to clearance procedures specified by the U.S. Customs and Border Patrol.<br />This is a total small business set-aside. The applicable small business size standard for NAICS 236220 is $33.5 million in annual receipts. <br />The Government intends to award one (1) firm-fixed-price construction contract as a result of this solicitation. Proposals will be evaluated based upon a best value tradeoff. Price is significantly more important than technical considerations.<br />Firms shall submit a letter of interest via e-mail to the Contract Specialist with the identifying solicitation number prior to 31 October 2011. E-mail address is: ann.fleckenstein@gsa.gov.<br />Interested contractors, in order to do business with the Federal Government, must register their firms with the Central Contract Registration (CCR). Contractors can access the CCR for free at http://www.ccr.gov.<br />The solicitation shall be released on or about 31 October 2011, with receipt of proposals due not later than 30 November 2011. All questions related to this project must be submitted in writing to ann.fleckenstein@gsa.gov.<br />

<p>It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that the Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:</p>

<DESC>The AF ISR Agency issues this sources sought synopsis for information and planning purposes in support of the possible acquisition of atmospheric gas analysis services. This synopsis is not to be construed as a commitment by the government nor will the government pay for information solicited. The services to be acquired are primarily concerned with the processing, separation, and radioassay of atmospheric gas samples for elemental determination of sample components for the purpose of nuclear test ban treaty verification. Definition of some terms: sample = physical object requiring processing to isolate selected atmospheric radioactive effluent gasses of interest for analysis. Gas analysis requires the ability to: (a) be proficient with various radioactive gas counting techniques; (b) determine, prior to separation, the percent of oxygen and nitrogen and the volume (in cubic centimeters) of other selected effluent gases within sample bottles; (c) separate selected radioactive effluent gases, as required, from cryogenic air samples; (d) radioassay separated samples; and (e) maintain capability to process and analyze samples from surge of additional collections, as required. Requests for these analyses may occur with little notice and may require 8-hour to 24-hour analysis capability. Other requirements include: (a) In the event the government elects to procure atmospheric gas analysis services, prospective sources must possess, or show the capability to obtain, a US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) Radioactive Materials License (or an agreement state license/permit, as applicable for the facility where work will be performed), prior to performance start; (b) Offerors shall be responsible for providing a suitable site for performance of the contract requirements. Unique analysis equipment essential to the mission will be provided, with ownership retained by the government. Due to the potential of contaminating mission samples, analysis equipment and areas of any facility used for gas analysis services shall not be used for activities other than government work without the expressed written permission of the government program office and shall be isolated from other facilities doing nuclear work; and (c) Prospective sources would be required to have DOD security clearances of at least the SECRET level. A firm-fixed-price contract is contemplated with a one-year basic contract period and four 1-year options. Participation in this potential effort would require both a facilities clearance and storage capability of at least the SECRET level. Prospective sources would be required to support secure communication capabilities at the SECRET level. The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code and size standard are 541380/$12.0 million. No technical or solicitation documents exist at this time. Interested offerors having the required specialized capabilities to meet the above requirements should submit a capability statement of 10 pages or less indicating their ability to perform all aspects of the effort described herein. Firms must respond electronically to Ms Lois. Brockson at lois.brockson@patrick.af.mil within 15 calendar days from the date of publication. NO PHONE CALLS WILL BE ACCEPTED. Firms responding must state whether they are a Small Business (SB). Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB), Woman-owned Small Business (WOSB), Historically Black College or University or Minority Institution (HBCU/MI), an 8(a) firm, a Native American firm, a HUBZone firm, a Veteran-Owned Small Business Concern, a Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business Concern, a participant in the Very Small Business Pilot Program, or a large business based on the size standard above. The government reserves the right to set this acquisition aside for any of the above type organizations based on the responses received. The clause at Air Force Federal Acquisition Regulation (AFFARS) 5352.201-9101, Ombudsman, is applicable to this request. In accordance with AFFARS 5301.9103, the first sentence of clause 5352.201-9101 paragraph (c) is tailored to read: If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the Air Force ISR Agency ombudsmen, [Ms Veronica Solis, AF ISR Agency/A4/7, 102 Hall Street, STE 258, San Antonio, TX 78243-7091 (P) 210-977-2288, (F) 210-977-2245 "AFISRA.A47@LACKLAND.AF.MIL"].

<p>STATEMENT OF DUTIES</p>
<p>GENERAL STATEMENT OF THE PURPOSE OF THIS CONTRACT AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE CONTRACTOR</p>
<p>A. BACKGROUND. The Office of Afghanistan/Pakistan Programs (INL/AP) is part of the Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL) in the Department of State. The Bureau is responsible for the development, supervision, coordination and implementation of international narcotics control assistance activities and international criminal justice issues for the Department of State. INL/AP provides policy guidance and develops, executes and monitors programs to address the full range of counternarcotics issues as they relate to stabilization and reconstruction activities in Afghanistan and Pakistan. INL has been engaged in an effort with the Government of the Islamic Repiublic of Afghanistan (GIRoA) to ensure a comprehensive approach to the drug problem. The U.S. Counternarcotics Strategy for Afghanistan targets narcotics traffickers through interdiction, while also supporting agricultural development, eradication, demand reduction, public information, and rule of law programs throughout Afghanistan.</p>
<p>B. PURPOSE. The Counternarcotics Advisor will support, assist, and advise INL in its efforts to expand counternarcotics programs in Regional Command-West (RC(W)), based in Herat. The Counternarcotics Advisor would provide expertise in a wide variety of settings, including internal U.S. embassy and multi-national meetings, to assist GIRoA in reaching its stated goals and objectives in reforming the counternarcotics programs in Afghanistan. S/he would offer assistance in a variety of areas, to include counternarcotics policy development and coordination with the interagency and international community and counternarcotics program development, management, and oversight.</p>
<p>I. STATEMENT OF WORK<br />&bull; Serves as INL counternarcotics advisor in the area covered by the Regional Command (RC), as directed by INL or the Senior Civilian Representative in the RC. As directed, coordinate with State, the Regional Command, USAID, USDA, international partners, and provide advice to Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRTs) and Regional Platforms on counternarcotics matters.</p>
<p>&bull; Aid in ensuring lines of communication between INL/Kabul, DEA, USAID, U.S./ISAF military, the GOA, and other international partners on counternarcotics programs.</p>
<p>&bull; Acquire a good knowledge and understanding of activity under all eight pillars of the GIRoA counternarcotics effort, as well as an understanding of how the counternarcotics effort is linked with counterinsurgency, anti-corruption, and rule of law efforts.</p>
<p>&bull; Assist with the formulations and implementation of policies/programs at the local and regional level.</p>
<p>&bull; Assist with conducting program development, implementation, and oversight for new and existing INL counternarcotics programs, including, but not limited to working with Provincial Development Councils to develop proposals for Good Performers Initiative programs, Governor-Led Eradication, the Counternarcotics Public Information, and drug abuse prevention and treatment programs. Also, aid in the solicitation and delivery of resources and funding from third party sources (for example UK Embassy, ISAF, CSTC-A).</p>
<p>&bull; As directed, work with relevant partners from the Office of the Governor, GIRoA Line Ministries, and provincial and district leadership to advance shared interests in counternarcotics.</p>
<p>&bull; Assist in tracking counternarcotics and related developments in the area of responsibility, including CN efforts by partner entities including the civilian and military counternarcotics efforts and USAID alternative development efforts in the province, among others. As appropriate, facilitate and promote counternarcotics engagement and assistance to the provinces within the RC by other international parties, including the United Nations and Coalition member states.</p>
<p>&bull; Facilitate visits to the RC for GIRoA counternarcotics officials and visiting INL, Embassy, and State Department delegations.</p>
<p>&bull; Assist with providing regular reporting on developments in the field to INL/Kabul, INL/Washington, the State Department Senior Civilian Representative in the RC, and INL counternarcotics advisors and program officers elsewhere in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>&bull; As necessary and directed, serve as general INL Liaison at the RC, connecting RC-based officers with relevant INL staff in Kabul, the rest in Afghanistan, and Washington.</p>
<p>&bull; Work effectively under pressure, within short time constraints, and during times of rapidly developing events. <br />&bull; Work collaboratively and effectively with senior leadership and colleagues from other countries, agencies, and departments to accomplish INL's goals and objectives.</p>
<p>&bull; Inform INL on current developments in a given portfolio that must be consulted in advance of important briefings, meetings, or presentations of new initiatives.</p>
<p>&bull; Produce a brief written weekly report on status of programs, activities, and initiatives to be disseminated via email to designated points of contact at INL Kabul, and INL/AP on a mutually agreed upon day of the week. Upon reporting to post, propose a format for this report, which should include, but is not limited to: recent and planned activities, accomplishments, challenges, proposed solutions, administrative issues, and upcoming schedule (to include TDYs and leave). Photographs may be included, as well.</p>
<p>Guidelines</p>
<p>Guidelines consist of various letters of authorization and memoranda of understanding between the U.S. Government and the Government of Afghanistan, as well as existing federal regulations, Department of State policies, legislation, the Foreign Assistance Act, and other authorization and appropriations in the INL account.</p>
<p>Complexity<br />Develops detailed plans, goals, and objectives for the long-range implementation and administration of INL policies and programs, and/or develops criteria for evaluating the effectiveness of the program. Coordinating plans with various other groups including international donors, the U.S. military and the Government of Afghanistan can be complicated. The work horizon of this position is one year; the incumbent must actively plan activities twelve months into the future. Active planning involves anticipating future events and requirements, deciding or recommending what needs to be done, the people and other resources required, and the timing of the activities. <br />Operating within the country strategy, the incumbent will have ongoing opportunity to develop new ideas and approaches that impact on existing procedures and methods. The incumbent must absorb and understand a large volume of detailed information on policies and procedures for multiple disciplines. Within a loose framework, the incumbent will be responsible for meeting a series of mid-to-long term objectives through structuring work and resources. Often breaking new ground, this role will be highly complex and will require a highly developed analytical ability and judgment. The problems encountered in this position are often unique, highly complex, or conceptual. Covering a wide range of potentially conflicting issues, the incumbent must apply the highest analytical skill and judgment to determine the best solution from the range of possible alternatives. The work pattern will be typified by many different overlapping tasks with heavy disruption due to changes in priorities, external events, and other interruptions<br />The incumbent will interface primarily with mid-level officers inside the U.S. Embassy in Kabul and other international representatives at PRTs and civilian platforms in Afghanistan. The nature of the contact with embassy officers will be highly demanding, requiring the transfer of complex ideas and concepts. The incumbent will interact primarily with mid-level military, GOA, and international officials, although the advisor will sometimes meet with the governor of the province to which assigned. The nature of the contact will normally be routine, although often escalating to complex as competing/conflicting interests and security threats are encountered.<br />A broad range of highly developed oral communication skills are required for this position. The incumbent will, at various times, be required to transmit routine information, discuss sensitive matters with tact and diplomacy, provide complex explanations, persuade and influence, give formal presentations, express care and compassion, provide reasoned arguments, and resolve conflicts without compromising the organization's position. Finally, the incumbent must exercise leadership, in order to achieve objectives and get the job done well, quickly, and efficiently without recourse to close supervision or coercion.</p>
<p>Physical Demands</p>
<p>In Afghanistan, the work is principally sedentary, however frequent travel in and around Afghanistan is likely. While on a site visit there are physical demands associated with travel to and from remote areas abroad in restrained time frames over underdeveloped infrastructure and conveyances - the position requires an above average resistance to fatigue and physical hardships. Extended onsite visits to remote project sites may rarely be required, necessitating the ability to walk medium to longer distances (hundreds of yards or more) on generally irregular dirt or stone surfaces, in both hilly and flat terrain. Those who use wheelchairs, have respiratory difficulties, or require assistance walking will find this difficult. Additionally, those undergoing medical treatment or taking certain medicines that limit their physical or mental abilities may find it difficult to adhere to the limitations recommended by their physician(s). Travel on helicopters and/or cargo-oriented fixed wing aircraft will also be required. Those with ear or other problems, who do not easily adapt to pressurized environments or higher but non-pressurized environments, will find the travel requirements of these positions difficult. Those with circulation problems or difficulties adapting to climate extremes or extremely dusty environments will find this aspect of the position difficult.</p>
<p>II. MINIMUM QUALIFICATIONS</p>
<p>a. U.S. citizenship, eligible for a State Department Secret security clearance.</p>
<p>b. The incumbent should possess a university degree in a field related to the primary duties of this position. Examples include: International Affairs, International Development, Political Science; South/Southwest Asia, Middle East, Asian or Islamic Studies; Business Administration and/or finance; and Development Economics. A master's degree is preferred but not required.<br />c. A total of ten years of professional work experience directly related to one or more of the fields related to the primary duties of the position: program management, international development, public diplomacy/public information campaigns, agriculture or alternative livelihood assistance. NOTE: A SECURITY OR LAW ENFORCEMENT BACKGROUND ALONE IS INSUFFICIENT TO MEET THE EXPERIENCE REQUIREMENT OF THIS POSITION. <br />d. International experience is required; experience in Afghanistan or Iraq preferred. <br />e. Knowledge Areas<br />i. The incumbent must quickly acquire a detailed knowledge of INL programs, civilian and military planning, and applications to counternarcotics goals in the geographic area where assigned. The incumbent will be expected to give detailed advice on how these areas operate<br />ii. The incumbent must quickly acquire a detailed knowledge of the political situation; social, cultural, religious, economic, and legal frameworks; security situation; and the agricultural, infrastructural (roads, bridges, irrigation, etc.), counternarcotics strategy in his/her geographic area of assignment<br />iii. The incumbent should possess, at the time of assignment, detailed knowledge of at least one (but preferably at least two) of the following fields: counternarcotics policy, counternarcotics-related law enforcement, justice sector development, public information, agriculture livelihood development, economic livelihood development, alternative livelihood development, and/or drug demand reduction/treatment.<br />iv. Specialist knowledge may have been acquired through extensive training in the specialist area(s), through a considerable amount of work experience in the field, or a combination of the two. Due to this background, the incumbent will be influential within the entire program and will likely provide detailed advice to non-specialist and other specialists.<br />f. Any degree of fluency in Pashto or Dari is desired, as is experience in working with an interpreter.<br />g. A range of written communication skills are required for this position. The incumbent will, at various times, be required to transmit routine information to other international advisors through e-mail and fax, discuss sensitive matters with tact and diplomacy with the international community in both formal and informal letters and e-mails, as well as provide complex explanations, persuade and influence, and resolve conflicts in a written format without compromising the organization's position. <br />III. POSITION ELEMENTS<br />Supervisory Controls: The incumbent will directly report to the Director of the INL Section (INL/Kabul) at U.S. Embassy Kabul through the INL/Kabul Counternarcotics Team Leader. The Department of State Senior Civilian Representative in Kandahar will provide daily supervision. Tasking will come from both INL/Kabul and INL's Afghanistan and Pakistan Program Office in Washington. The incumbent's actions, decisions and recommendations are reviewed on the basis of results achieved and conformance with appropriate laws and regulations. Because the incumbent receives only general policy guidance, he/she must constantly depend on his/her own professional judgment to further the mission of INL.</p>
<p>Level of Effort: Hours for this full-time position will be the core hours of U.S. Embassy Kabul: 8:30am to 5:30pm Sunday through Thursday with a minimum of fifty-five hours per week.</p>
<p>Travel and Position Location: The position is located within Regional Commands throughout Afghanistan. Frequent travel in and around the assigned province is likely. All movements within Afghanistan will be covered by the U.S. military and/or INL air wing and motor pool assets, and all travel outside of Afghanistan will be covered by commercial airlines.</p>
<p>Pre-deployment support for the Afghanistan-based Advisor: The advisor will be required to attend four (4) weeks of basic familiarization training at the Foreign Service Institute in Washington D.C. prior to deployment.</p>
<p>Life Support: Life support for the Advisor will be provided by other USG service providers and is not to be included in this task order proposal. INL/INL Kabul will provide the incumbent with access to the Embassy compound. The incumbent will have access to hardened and/or regular cars (exact type will be dependent on the security situation) from motor pool for transportation. Housing will be assigned through the Embassy's PRT Office in coordination with INL and the PRT Commander.</p>

<p>STATEMENT OF DUTIES</p>
<p>GENERAL STATEMENT OF THE PURPOSE OF THIS CONTRACT AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE CONTRACTOR</p>
<p>A. BACKGROUND. The Office of Afghanistan/Pakistan Programs (INL/AP) is part of the Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL) in the Department of State. The Bureau is responsible for the development, supervision, coordination and implementation of international narcotics control assistance activities and international criminal justice issues for the Department of State. INL/AP provides policy guidance and develops, executes and monitors programs to address the full range of criminal justice issues as they relate to stabilization and reconstruction activities in Afghanistan and Pakistan. INL has been engaged in an effort with the Government of Afghanistan to build the capacity of the Afghan Criminal Justice System to properly and securely detain arrested persons awaiting trial and sentencing as well as those who have been properly sanctioned by a court in a manner consistent with the commonly accepted human rights principles.</p>
<p>B. PURPOSE. The Regional Corrections Advisor (to include the Representative to the Combined Joint Interagency Task Force - 435 (CJIATF-435)) reports to the INL/Kabul Director through the INL/Kabul Administration of Justice Team Lead, serving as the corrections systems development expert on a full range of prison/corrections issues in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>The Regional Corrections Advisor would provide technical corrections expertise in a wide variety of settings, including internal U.S. embassy and multi-national meetings, to assist the Government of Afghanistan in reaching its stated Goals and Objectives in reforming the corrections/prisons system in Afghanistan. The Regional Corrections Advisor would offer assistance in a variety of areas, to include technical assistance, contingency planning and development, training and equipment needs. S/he would also serve as a resource to the INL/Kabul Director, the INL/Kabul Administration of Justice Team Lead, and the Afghan Director General for Prisons (Central Prisons Directorate) on corrections issues bringing together expertise from the United States, as well as other countries having innovative corrections projects and programs that could be considered by the Government of Afghanistan.</p>
<p><br />I. STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>&bull; Serves as one of INL's corrections experts in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>&bull; Develops and coordinates corrections programs for Afghanistan in concert with other USG, international and Afghan law enforcement and criminal justice programs.</p>
<p>&bull; Serves as an advisory resource for INL/Kabul, INL/AP, CJIATF-435, and Afghan corrections officials on specific aspects of planning and implementation of ongoing corrections assistance programs in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>&bull; Oversees and coordinates Afghanistan corrections program activities with the end goal of supporting the Afghan Government in developing a safe, secure, and humane corrections system.</p>
<p>&bull; Provides policy analysis and program guidance to INL/Kabul, INL/AP, and Afghan officials on all aspects of corrections matters, addressing any of a number of issues related to corrections system reforms to include human rights issues related to prisoner incarceration; prisoner classification; strategic planning; prisoner programs; budgeting; development of correctional capacities and institutions; refurbishment and/or construction of correctional facilities; and training plans.</p>
<p>&bull; Organizes and participates in meetings, seminars, and exercises to develop plans/programs for implementation of corrections assistance in Afghanistan and improve overall capacities to effectively modernize existing institutions.</p>
<p>&bull; Attends domestic and international conferences on Government of Afghanistan corrections reforms.</p>

<p>&bull; Other duties as requested and assigned by the INL/Kabul Director and Administration of Justice Team Lead.</p>
<p>&bull; Communicates regularly with the INL/AP Corrections Team Lead.</p>
<p>Guidelines</p>
<p>The assignment involves providing expert analytical and advisory support for the planning, development, and execution of U.S. foreign policy within a broad and complex range of corrections areas, interpreting data that is often vague, unsubstantiated, or contradicts existing knowledge in preparing options and/or recommendations. Incumbent must develop an analysis that provides new perspectives for the understanding and resolution of complex legal, political, economic, social, geographic, or military issues as they relate to Afghanistan and the surrounding region. The work is complicated by the need to provide expert advice and guidance that influences the decisions and actions of senior policy officials and the need to quickly, accurately, and decisively determine the relevance and significance of information to the policy interests of the Department. It is further complicated by the need to produce widely disseminated analytical products that represent the Bureau's official assessment of complex issues, and keep the policy making and foreign affairs communities constantly apprised of new issues and developments with respect to corrections issues. Other complicating factors include the incumbent's responsibility for ascertaining the need for initiating and conducting in-depth studies on topics of critical importance to the policy formulation process, and for representing INL/Kabul on committees and working groups that address issues of vital interest to INL.</p>
<p>Complexity</p>
<p>Develops detailed plans, goals, and objectives for the long-range implementation and administration of the program, and/or develops criteria for evaluating the effectiveness of the program. Coordinating plans with various other groups including international donors, the U.S. military and the Government of Afghanistan can be complicated.</p>
<p>Projects require dynamic leadership and expertise and complex innovation, strict adherence to high level policy without lower level interpretive assistance, and the ability to single-handedly or in concert with a variety of other stakeholders resolve critical problems and achieve difficult goals that may impact other programs. They are broad in scope and complicated by many complex features, technical, administrative, or political in nature.</p>
<p>Physical Demands</p>
<p>The work generally does not impose unusual physical demands when the incumbent is working at his/her office location. However, frequent travel is required to hazardous duty locations that could impose unusual and/or difficult physical demands.</p>
<p>II. MINIMUM QUALIFICATIONS</p>
<p>a. U.S. citizen, eligible for a State Department Top Secret security clearance.</p>
<p>b. A total of 15 years professional work experience:<br />&#61607; At least 10 years experience in corrections operations, management, organizational development, planning, and/or training, 2 years of which must have been at the rank of assistant warden (or equivalent) or higher.<br />&#61607; At least 4 years experience in other senior management roles such as strategic planning, resource management, and budgeting. <br />c. Graduation from a certified state or federal corrections or probation officer training academy.<br />d. A bachelor's degree from an accredited college or university. Individuals without a degree but with significant corrections management experience (minimum of five years) at the warden level (or equivalent) or higher will be considered.<br />e. A total of fifteen years professional work experience. At least four years experience in senior project management using critical path methodology, resources management, quality control processes, and budgeting. Demonstrated experience which clearly illustrates the applicant's ability to manage a multi-phase, complex construction project from concept through final turnover. International experience required, experience in Afghanistan or Iraq preferred. Significant experience in correction and/or justice infrastructure projects preferred. <br />f.

<DESC>This notice is issued by the NASA/JSC to post a Request for Information onTechniques for using 3.0 Tesla Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) to assess trabecular andcortical bone mineral density at central sties via the internet, and solicit responsesfrom interested parties.  Request for Information (RFI):  It is well established that bone mineral density (BMD) loss is rapid (1-1.5%/mo) andsite-specific (axial and load-bearing sites) during long duration spaceflight.	This lossoccurs faster in the trabecular compartment than in the cortical compartment.  Adecreased BMD can be accompanied by other changes in bone structure which increase therisk for bone fracture and early onset osteoporosis.  Bone fracture could have seriousimplications for a long duration mission.  Moreover, the risk for early onsetosteoporosis could limit the astronauts quality of life and career length.The current techniques used to evaluate BMD are Dual-energy X-ray Absoptiometry (DXA) andQuantitative Computed Tomography (QCT).  BMD has the advantage of abundantepidemiological studies completed with its use, but it only provides integral (combinedcortical and trabecular bone); whereas BMDs of the separate compartments are importantfor distinguishing changes in bone structure vs. the remodeling of bone tissue.  QCT hasbeen valuable and informative when used to measure BMD of the two compartments in the hipand spine, but it is a research technology for which clinical implications have yet to beestablished.  Both DXA and QCT use ionizing radiation, which is undesirable since astronauts arescanned repeatedly to assess changes over time.  It is important to minimize thisexposure as can be reasonably achieved.  Astronauts are already exposed to higher thannormal levels of radiation during spaceflight.	Therefore, DXA and other X-ray basedtechnologies are not optimal for quantifying the changes in trabecular and cortical bonemineral density.The astronaut population is currently being evaluated with 3.0 Tesla MRI scans forclinical monitoring and ongoing research protocols.  NASA is interested in learning ifthere are techniques in development that could use MRI technology to quantify BMD.  Theadvantages are the resolution, lack of radiation, and decrease in astronaut crew time byhaving all studies performed at a single site.This Request for Information:1. Is there a non-invasive technique that can utilize standard 3.0 Tesla MRI machines toassess trabecular and cortical bone mineral density at central sties (proximal femur,femoral  neck and spine)?2. How does the techniques reproducibility and accuracy compare  to current X-ray basedgold standards (DXA and QCT)?3. What is the feasibility of adopting this technique?     a. What are the risks associated with the technique?     b. What are the initial cost and operational/maintenance cost?     c. Are all the required components readily available or is specializedinstrumentation required?     d. What errors do you expect from spinal degenerative changes or aorticcalcification?     e. How does the technique correct for movement and water  mass?4. What information does the technique provide on bone morphometry?5. Is this technique validated for making clinical decisions to improve outcomesregarding fracture risk and early onset osteoporosis (e.g. responsive to therapies,monitoring progression of pathologies)?6. Are there other non-radiation solutions (besides a possible 3.0 Tesla MRI) that couldprovide us this information?This document is for information and planning purposes and to allow industry theopportunity to verify reasonableness and feasibility of the requirement, as well aspromote competition.

<DESC><span style="text-decoration: underline;">General Information</span>:<br />This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice. <br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br />Background</span>:<br />The National Toxicology Program (NTP) was established within the Department of Health and Human Services and charged with coordinating toxicological testing programs within the Public Health Service of the Department. The NTP, as part of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS), is responsible for evaluating the toxic and carcinogenic potential of environmental agents that may pose a health hazard to citizens of the United States. The NTP requires support for the conduct of short- and long-term toxicity studies following pre- and postnatal exposure to a variety of test articles by various routes of exposure. This requirement is designed to study diverse agents that may include: environmental chemicals; food additives, colorants or flavorings; pharmaceuticals and herbal remedies; pesticides; ingredients found in a variety of consumer products including soaps and cosmetics; detergents and cleaners; nanomaterials; chemicals used in manufacturing or industrial settings, etc.
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Purpose</span>:<br />NIEHS is seeking capability statements from interested and qualified small businesses to conduct toxicology studies for the NTP. These studies will support and assist the NTP research effort to evaluate the effects of early life exposure to test articles that may result in long term adverse effects.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Project Details</span>:<br />For each test article studied, a detailed protocol outline will be provided by the Government to the testing laboratory. In general, studies will involve daily dosing of rats or mice. The anticipated routes of administration are gavage, dosed feed and dosed water. Study duration may be from a few days up to 2 years. Some tests may begin with time-mated animals, while others will begin with non-pregnant animals. Treatment regimens, species used, endpoints to be measured, etc., may vary depending on specific chemicals to be tested and study goals.</p>
<p>Anticipated study designs will include (1) Reproductive Assessment by Continuous Breeding (RACB), (2) NTP Modified One-Generation (MOG) studies with multiple cohorts (information on the NTP modified one-generation design may be found at http://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/ntp/About_NTP/BSC/2011/April/MOGDesign.pdf), and (3) Prenatal Developmental Toxicity studies.</p>
<p>The RACB study includes daily dosing of breeding pairs to produce F1a, F1b and F1c litters. Offspring from F1c litters will be mated to produce F2a, F2b and F2c litters. The NTP MOG study generally begins with time-mated females delivering litters from which offspring are assigned to multiple cohorts for evaluation of a variety of endpoints including: developmental landmarks, reproductive indices, teratology, subchronic toxicity, histopathology and/or collection of biological samples. Other endpoints in the MOG such as neurotoxicity or evaluation of target organ toxicities may be required. In some cases, new testing paradigms may be developed with incorporation of unique endpoints.</p>
<p>Award of one or more cost-reimbursement, level of effort type contract is contemplated. The total estimated level of effort for each laboratory if, for example, two awards are made, is anticipated to be between 25,000 to 50,000 labor hours per year depending on the needs of the NTP. Each laboratory would be anticipated to conduct a mix of the above studies with more RACB and MOG studies conducted than Prenatal Developmental Toxicity studies. The mix of studies conducted may change from year to year.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Mandatory Qualification Criteria</span>:<br />The Contractor shall have an AAALAC accredited laboratory and the ability to conduct studies that are compliant with Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) Regulations for non-clinical laboratory studies.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Anticipated Period of Performance</span>:<br />The anticipated period of performance is ten (10) years with an estimated start date of October 1, 2012 and ending September 30, 2022.</p>

<DESC>This announcement constitutes a Request for Information (RFI) Synopsis. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. The following information is provided to assist Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIRSYSCOM) in conducting market research to identify new technologies for Navy and Marine Corps Small Tactical Unmanned Air Systems (Group 1-3). Program Manager, Navy and Marine Corps Small Tactical Unmanned Air Systems (PMA-263) under oversight from Program Executive Officer, Strike Weapons and Unmanned Aviation (PEO U&amp;W) will provide the assessment team for this market research effort.
<p>PMA-263 is submitting this RFI to determine Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS) or high (8/9+) Technology Readiness Level (TRL) availability of software that can process a video data stream, either RS-170 or MPEG, to reliably detect and alert the users/operators to look for moving objects within full motion video (FMV) to include but not limited to vehicles, boats, and dismounts (in the open and partially obscured). The software should be capable of real-time operation on a personal computer or other stand-alone computing platform.</p>
<p>It is assumed that the software will operate on a stand-alone computing platform but should be mature enough and capable of integration into a larger software suite as an Application Program Interface (API) for Electro Optic and Infra Red (EO/IR) FMV processing. The software should detect anomalous and moving objects in the video frame and provide the operator with an alert (for example, a visual and/or audible cue). The software should reliably detect numerous (10 to upwards of 100) targets simultaneously with a Probability of detection (Pd) of greater than 0.90 and a low false alarm rate. The output of the processor should be an RS-170 or MPEG video stream with the target alerts displayed as part of the video frames (reference FMV standards including but not limited to RS170, NTSC, H.264, and MPEG-4).</p>
<p>Industry Response Criteria<br />Ensure your response contains your company's name, street address, point of contact with phone number and email address, and company web page URL. Limit your responses to 25 slides and 50 double-spaced printed pages, and provide one hardcopy and one CD-ROM in Microsoft Office format. All material provided in response to this RFI shall be unclassified, non-confidential, and non-proprietary to the maximum extent practicable.</p>
<p>If including proprietary information in the response, (1) ensure proprietary information is marked appropriately, (2) identify disposition instructions, and (3) indicate whether you require the Government to facilitate the execution of information/proprietary exchange agreements with any contractors providing advisory and assistance services to the Government who may have access to this proprietary information. Responses to RFI will not be returned. The Government will take all necessary steps to protect/safeguard any confidential/proprietary information provided. The Government will NOT be responsible for any confidential/proprietary information not clearly marked. E-mailed submissions will not be accepted by NAVAIR. The Government will not reimburse any preparation costs. At any time after receipt of RFI responses, the Government reserves the right to contact respondents for further discussion and/or clarification of the submittal.</p>
<p>Industry responses to the RFI should be sent to below address no later than 30 business days after posting to https://www.fbo.gov/:</p>

The project will also include memorial walls to commemorate those whose remains are not available for interment.  To optimize the use of available land for gravesites, the project will install pre-placed concrete crypts. In addition to the gravesite development, the construction includes access roads; an entrance area; flag/assembly area; two permanent committal shelters; an administration building/public information center with electronic gravesite locator and public restrooms; memorial walkway/donations area; maintenance complex; road system; utilities; signage; site furnishings; fencing; irrigation system as needed consistent with water-wise landscaping principles; utility distribution system; environmental (including historical and cultural resources) preservation and mitigation.

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. This is a notice of intent to award a sole source contract under statutory authority 10 USC 2304(c) (1), set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1, "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements." The Government intends to enter into a utility service contract with the SDEDA on or about 01 Oct 2014 to treat all wastewater generated on Ellsworth AFB, SD. SDEDA is a Publically Owned Treatment Works (POTW) which is a requirement for Ellsworth AFB to retain the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) domestic sewage exclusion set forth in Section 3023(a), 42 U.S.C. &sect; 6939e. The Government will deactivate the base wastewater treatment plant and connect to the new SDEDA Regional Wastewater Treatment Facility located in Box Elder, SD. Standard wastewater treatment tariff rates as set forth by the South Dakota Public Utilities Commission are applicable.
<p>Per FAR Part 5.207(e), Fed Biz Ops Numbered Note 22 applies and is modified to read:</p>
<p>22. The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>Interested parties may e-mail bernard.clemens@ellsworth.af.mil, not later than 04 November 2011; 4:00 p.m. Pacific Time.</p>
<p>DEMONSTRATION THAT THE CONTRACTORS UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS OR NATURE OF THE ACQUISITION REQUIRES THE USE OF THE AUTHORITY CITED ABOVE (APPLICABILITY OF AUTHORITY)</p>
<p>SDEDA will be the only POTW in the immediate area that can economically treat sewage with the RCRA domestic sewage exclusion, complying with surface water discharge limits imposed by the South Dakota Department of Environment and Natural Resources (SD DENR). Using the SDEDA to treat Ellsworth Air Force Base's wastewater will satisfy the requirements of FAR Part 6.302-1(b)(3) as it is the only option that allows the base to maintain environmental compliance and retain its RCRA domestic sewage exclusion.</p>

<SOLNBR>DARPA-SN-12-03
<RESPDATE>112111
<ARCHDATE>02222012
<CONTACT>Michael Blackstone, Email DARPA-SN-12-03@darpa.mil
<DESC>The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, Contracts Management Office (CMO) on behalf of the Microsystems Technology Office (MTO), intends to award a Sole Source contract to Honeywell for a Platform for Acquisition, Logging, and Analysis of Devices for Inertial Navigation (PALADIN) under the Micro Rate Integrating Gyroscope (MRIG) Program. The primary goal of the MRIG program is to realize vibratory gyroscopes that can be instrumented to measure the angle of rotation directly, extending the dynamic range and eliminating the need for integrating the angular rate information. The research under this program is focused on developing isotropic, two degree-of-freedom (2-DOF) resonators with a primary interest in microscale 3-D shell resonators - spheres, "wine-glass" structures, or any spatially distributed symmetric shells. Under the MRIG program, the Honeywell team is developing a toroidal rate integrating gyroscope based on 3D, micro-scale glass blowing using high quality factor materials. During the course of their research, the Honeywell team will test their MRIG prototypes under extreme temperature and vibrational environments. Through this award, the Honeywell team will develop a single universal testing platform (PALADIN) to allow rapid, uniform early-stage Test and Evaluation (T&amp;E) of prototypes in support of their MRIG effort. Typically, the evaluation of prototypes is a boutique process, where a customized setup (i.e. mechanical mounting, the electrical interfaces, etc.) is built for each individual device. The ad hoc nature of this approach requires significant time, effort, and resources and can introduce non-uniformities in the measurements due to subtle differences in the implementation of interfaces. The Honeywell PALADIN effort builds upon their prior work on the Tactical Underwater Navigation Systems (TUNS) Program. Under this program, they demonstrated their Agile Navigation &amp; Guidance Integrated Electronics (ANGIE) platform which is an embedded computer that hosts navigation and guidance applications with custom electronics. The proposed PALADIN effort is a logical follow up to their prior work on TUNS as it leverages existing hardware and software which will be modified to realize an experimental testing platform that is capable of analog and digital data logging, performing real-time analysis of inertial sensors, and is deployable in harsh temperature and vibrational environments. The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302-1 "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements." As the developer of the current ANGIE platform, Honeywell possesses unique knowledge, capabilities and intellectual property required to carry out the required research effort at significantly reduced cost and time to the government. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation is currently available. However, interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement. Responses received within forty-five (45) days after date of publication of this notice will be considered by the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open basis is solely within the discretion of the Government. Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to meet the requirements by submitting a white paper and past performance data by no later than 21 November 2011 to The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, Attn: Mr. Michael Blackstone, Contracts Management Office (CMO), 3701 North Fairfax Drive, Arlington, VA 22203-1714 or via email to DARPA-SN-12-03@darpa.mil. Questions shall be submitted to the above email address. <br /><br />It is noted that DARPA's Microsystems Technology Office (MTO) maintains an annual Office-wide Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) seeking revolutionary research in electronics, photonics, MEMS, algorithms, and combined Microsystems technology to deliver new capabilities to sense, communicate, energize, actuate, and process data and information for the war fighter. The "MEMS" mission thrust area under this BAA specifically seeks proposals for inertial sensor systems for PNT such as Honeywell's PALADIN effort. Parties wishing to respond to this notice are invited, as an alternative, to submit a white paper against DARPA-BAA-10-35.

The bidders were also encouraged to clearly describe betterments and preferences included in their proposal.<br>6. Proposals are due on 18 October 2011 at 11:00 Eastern Time.<br>7. Dale Polston stated that the project duration from Notice to Proceed (NTP) to construction completion was 490 days, which included design.

There are two listed betterments, concrete MEP and relocation of the wetlands. There is one priced option which is a bi-level loading ramp. Betterments would be given favorable consideration in the evaluation process as long as they were within budget limitations listed in Section 00114.

A few written questions were provided and shown below: The division 5 steel specification calls for fabricator to be AISC certified. May a non-AISC certified fabricator be used if we provide all related tests and inspections? The sub I plan to use has performed on several COE projects.<br><br>o No additional information will be provided, please use the information in the solicitation.

<p>(h) Multiple awards. This award shall be made on an all or none basis.</p>
<p>PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection in which competing Offerors' past performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer.</p>
<p>The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made by the Contracting Officer. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:</p>
<p>Factor 1 - Provider Capability</p>
<p>1a. This factor is met when the Offeror provides evidence they are a telecommunications company which owns most of its own facilities such as switching equipment, transmission lines and infrastructure, having the capability to provide Primary Rate Interfaces (PRI), Direct Inward Dial (DID), and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Factor 2 - Local Communications Services. This factor pertains to switch and PBX sites only.</p>
<p>This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a SITE-SPECIFIC diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix 10 requirements. Reference generic example diagram in Appendix 10.</p>
<p>(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In evaluating PPI, the government will employ several approaches including: reviewing contract references provided by the offeror; seeking PPI through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. Only recent (within the last three years) and relevant PPI (similar or greater in scope, magnitude of effort, and complexity than effort described in this solicitation) will be evaluated. When reviewing PPI, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform the services described in this solicitation. <br />(i) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will be performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(iii) The performance confidence assessment will result in an overall performance confidence rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />(v) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(vi) If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence"<br />performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer.</p>
<p>Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition to include the following addendum:</p>
<p>52.212-4 Addendum 1-Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items Mar 2009<br />(e) Definitions.<br />(1) "Common Carrier" means any entity engaged in the business of providing telecommunications services, which are regulated by the Federal Communications Commission or other governmental body.<br />(2)"Noncommon Carrier" means any entity other than a common carrier offering telecommunications facilities, services, or equipment for lease.<br />(3) "Governmental regulatory body" means the Federal Communications Commission, any statewide regulatory body, or anybody with less than statewide jurisdiction when operating under the state authority.

<p>(v) Tariff Information. <br />(1) The Contractor shall provide to the Contracting Officer-<br />(i) Upon request, a copy of the Contractor's current existing tariffs (including changes);<br />(ii) Before filing any application to a Federal, State, or any other regulatory agency for new or changes to applicable rates, charges, services, or regulations relating to any CSA or any of the facilities or services to be furnished solely or primarily to the Government; and<br />(iii) Upon request, a copy of all information, material, and data developed or prepared in support of or in connection with an application under paragraph ii above.<br />(2) The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer of any application that anyone other than the Contractor files with a governmental regulatory body, which affects or will affect the rate or conditions of services under this contract. These requirements also apply to applications pending on the effective date of this contract.<br />(3) Public Utilities Commission (PUC) Authorization. All Offerors shall be local exchange carriers certificated (Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority (SPCOA) , or Certificate of Operating Authority (COA)) with the state PUC where services are being provided. This contract shall at all times be subject to such changes by the PUC of the state having jurisdiction over the particular site as said Commission may, from time to time, direct in the exercise of its jurisdiction.<br />(4) Rates, Charges, and Services. <br />(i) The Contractor shall furnish the services and facilities under this contract in accordance with-<br />(A) All applicable tariffs, rules, regulations, or requirements;<br />(1) Lawfully established by a governmental regulatory body; and<br />(2) Applicable to service and facilities furnished or offered by the Contractor to the general public or the Contractor's subscribers;<br />(B) A firm-fixed-price contract provides for a price that is not subject to any adjustment on the basis of the contractor's cost experience including tariff changes with the exception of TFS. If the prices differ from established tariff prices, it is the responsibility of the contractor to either file a special tariff for the contract with the relevant Governmental authorities or make other arrangements to comply with the governmental requirements. The Air Force will not be liable for price increases for failure to follow these requirements. If, during the term of the contract, the TFS change, the contractor must submit supporting state statutes, local ordinances, regulations, FCC ruling and rates, etc, for Government verification. A modification will then be issued based upon the newly documented annual TFS. <br />(ii) The Government shall not prepay for services.<br />(iii) Recurring charges for services and facilities shall, in each case, start with the satisfactory beginning of service or provision of facilities or equipment and are payable monthly in arrears.<br />(iv) Subject to the Cancellation or Termination of Orders clause 252.239-7007, of this contract, the Government may stop the use of any service or facilities furnished under this contract at any time. The Government shall pay the contractor all charges for services and facilities adjusted to the effective date of discontinuance.<br />(v) Expediting charges are costs necessary to get services earlier than normal. Examples are overtime pay or special shipment. When authorized, expediting charges shall be the additional costs incurred by the Contractor and the subcontractor. The Government shall pay expediting charges only when-<br />(A) They are provided for in the tariff established by a governmental regulatory body; or<br />(B) They are authorized in a communication service authorization or other contractual document.<br />(vi) When services normally provided are technically unacceptable and the development, fabrication, or manufacture of special equipment is required, the Government may-<br />(A) Provide the equipment; or<br />(B) Direct the Contractor to acquire the equipment or facilities. If the Contractor acquires the equipment or facilities, the acquisition shall be competitive, if practicable.<br />(vii) If at any time the Government defers or changes its orders for any of the services but does not cancel or terminate them, the amount paid or payable to the Contractor for the services deferred or modified shall be equitably adjusted at the time of deferral or change. The Government and the Contractor shall equitably adjust the rates by mutual agreement. Failure to agree on any adjustment shall be a dispute concerning a question of fact within the meaning of the Disputes clause of this contract.</p>

These rates will remain firm fixed price during this process. This provision may be exercised more than once, but the total extension of performance hereunder shall not exceed 6 months. The Contracting Officer may exercise this provision by unilateral modification to the contract before 10 days of expiration.<br />(4)The Contractor recognizes that the services under this contract are vital to the Government and must be continued without interruption and that, before contract expiration, a successor, either the Government or another Contractor, may continue them. The Contractor agrees to -<br />(i) Provide transitioning of services during cutover period without termination liability charges; <br />(ii) Exercise its best efforts and cooperation to effect an orderly and efficient transition to a successor; and<br />(iii) Notify the Government of any services not cutover after contract expiration.</p>

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>

<DESC><strong>The Defense Medical Materiel Program Office (DMMPO) announces a Request for Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFIAQ) for the standardization of Patient Safety Slippers. The Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) North is the lead MMESO for this project. <br /><br /></strong>The primary objective of this effort is to standardize the quality of care across the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) and operational assemblages based on the critical balance of clinical efficacy and value. The intent for this initiative is the standardization of a clinically preferred product(s) and source for institutional and operational medicine requirements at the lowest price. It is also intended for this initiative to result in the reduction of Stock Keeping Units (SKUs) and National Stock Numbers (NSN). Standardized products must be obtained through the Department of Defense (DoD) Prime Vendor (PV) Program. As an enterprise-wide clinically driven program, vendors and products must meet specific technical requirements plus products must meet or exceed specific clinical performance expectations as a primary consideration. Among vendors who meet the technical requirements and the products that meet or exceed the clinical acceptability, then clinically preferred, best value will determine selection. It is intended that the selected standardized vendor(s) for this Standardization Action (SA) support the enterprise goal of medical materiel standardization that combines operational and institutional requirements. <strong>The government is seeking a single award for this SA.<br /><br /></strong>The major facilities in the MMESOs North, South, West, Pacific and Europe (hereafter referred to as MMESOs) include but are not limited to MMESO North: Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, Portsmouth Naval Hospital, Womack Army Medical Center, Wright-Patterson Medical Center; MMESO South: Wilford Hall Medical Center, Brooke Army Medical Center, Eisenhower Army Medical Center, Darnall Army Medical Center, Keesler Medical Center, Naval Hospital Jacksonville, Martin Army Community Hospital; MMESO West: Madigan Army Medical Center, William Beaumont Army Medical Center, Naval Medical Center San Diego, Irwin Army Community Hospital, Mike O'Callaghan Federal Hospital; MMESO Pacific: Tripler Army Medical Center, 18th Medical Group, Kadena AB, Okinawa, US Naval Hospital, Yokosuka, Japan; MMESO Europe: Landstuhl Regional Medical Center, Landstuhl, GE, US Naval Hospital, Naples, Italy, and 48th Medical Group, RAF Lakenheath; and Operational U.S. Forces. This SA is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support, Directorate of Medical Materiel. To participate in this SA your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the current Med-Surg PV for each MMESO Area of Responsibility (AOR), i.e., Cardinal Health, and Owens &amp; Minor. This requirement is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the standardization initiative and agree to allow PVs to distribute their products. The IA resulting from this RFIAQ is a supplement to the PV Program and is not a contract. For additional information regarding DLA TS Medical's PV program please access its web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil
<p>This IA standardization initiative will be a Three Phase IPP Process: vendor(s) who meets the technical / company requirements in Phase I will be invited to participate in Phase II where no-charge products will be provided for clinical evaluation and Phase III where pricing will be required for submittal. Phase II and Phase III will be run concurrently. The resulting IA will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of selection with three (3) 12-month "option" periods not to exceed a total of 5 years. <strong>Anticipated selection date is January 2011.</strong> The selection will be based on the product and vendor that provides the Best Value to the enterprise. Products and vendors that meet or exceed the technical and clinical performance requirements will be considered clinically preferred products and sources. Among vendors who meet the technical requirements and the products that meet or exceed the clinically preferred standard, best price (i.e. lowest Aggregate Post Standardization Cost) will determine selection. <strong>Point of Contact: Ms. Toni Massenburg, MMESO North, Team Leader, toni.massenburg@us.army.mil 571-231-5451 and Ms Gail Tucker-Carlisle, Clinical Analyst, gail.tucker-carlisle@us.army.mil.</strong></p>
<p>B. Products &amp; Performance Required <br />The MMESOs are seeking product line items in the category of Patient Safety Slippers. Within the MMESOs, this product line has an estimated annual dollar requirement of $424,012.99. This forecast is based on historical MedPDB sales during a recent 12-month period. Based on the recent 12-month usage data, the top thirty seven (37) line items of the total seventy eight (78) line items, account for 80.8% ($342,645.39) of the total volume in sales ($424,012.99) in the MMESOs and are clinically significant. The top high volume usage lines for this project are shown in the Technical/Company Requirements below.</p>
<p>C. Instructions to Vendors<br /><strong>Vendors interested in participating in this standardization initiative will provide an initial response to the FBO-posted RFIAQ to Ms. Toni Massenburg, Team Leader, toni.massenburg@us.army.mil and Ms Gail Tucker-Carlisle, Clinical Analyst, gail.tucker-carlisle@us.army.mil.</strong> The vendor's initial responses will include detailed information requested in the technical/company requirements listed in the FBO RFIAQ and must also include: (1) Company name and address; (2) Company Point of Contact (POC) (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address); and (3) Identification of the RFIAQ to which the vendor is responding. Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendor is strongly encouraged to confirm with the MMESO North that their initial submission, quote and literature actually arrived at the MMESO North via email. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date / time, should a problem occur with the first submission. Vendor should complete and submit the attached document. A vendor who cannot open the attachments, may contact the POC as noted in the FBO RFIAQ and a copy will be provided via an alternate method (fax, email or hard copy). <strong>Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00PM Eastern Standard Time (EST) on the date listed for closing will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization initiative. </strong></p>
<p>D. Source Selection Procedures <br />The MMESO Joint Product Review Board (JPRB) will serve as the forum for clinical recommendations for product selection, seeking and evaluating opportunities for committed volume purchase agreements, and coordinating logistics efforts in support of DoD Components. The boards are chaired by Designated Senior Logisticians (DSLs) and co-chaired by Designated Senior Clinicians (DSCs) in the MMESO AORs and include clinicians and logisticians for MTFs within each MMESO. The Clinical Advisory Committee (CAC) members are the deciding officials for this initiative. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the MMESOs. The MMESO North reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if determined necessary.</p>
<p>Phase I Technical / Company Evaluation<br />The MMESO CPT will review the responses from the vendors and determine which vendors meet the technical/company requirements. A vendor must meet the technical requirements for continued consideration in this initiative. Failure to provide any requested information or meet any of the technical requirements will disqualify the vendor from further consideration. A vendor who meets the following technical/company requirements will be qualified and invited to participate in the clinical/performance selection process and will be requested to submit products for testing and their best price discount quotes via an e-mail communication. All communications of significant acquisition milestones (such as invitations to participate or notices of disqualification) should be digitally signed.</p>
<p>Technical/Company Requirements<br />During the pre-source selection procedures, the CPT approved the company/technical requirements outlined below. The fourteen (14) requirements below must be answered with the vendor's initial submittal and required documents by the response date stated in the FBO announcement. <strong>A vendor who does not meet these requirements or who does not submit documentation to support these requirements with initial submittal will be disqualified in Phase I. <br /><br /></strong>1.

<p>Phase II Clinical Performance Evaluation</p>
<p>Following acceptability of the technical/company requirements, the MMESO North, on behalf of the CPT, will request product sample sets from the product group to be sent to the CPT members at the participating MTFs. Vendor will be given 30 calendar days from the issue of the notice in which to deliver the product samples for clinical evaluation at Phase II. <strong>Product samples must be shipped no later than fourteen (14) calendar days after issue of notice, and arrive at the designated addresses for each MTF by 5:00PM local time before the 30th calendar day.</strong> Vendor must be able to deliver product literature, training materials and evaluation samples as requested to the MMESO Pacific via FedEx or UPS AND to the MMESO Europe via United States Postal Service (USPS) Express Mail and throughout the United States by selected shipping method when requested in Phase II. Vendor must send the MMESO North verification regarding the shipment of literature and samples. This information will include the date of shipment, final delivery date, tracking numbers and the carrier used by the vendor. Vendor will provide only the following no cost product samples for clinical/performance evaluation. Unused samples will not be returned. Six (6) pairs of each size and style listed below are to be provided to each of the evaluation sites as identified in the letters of invitation.<br />1) Sock Type patient safety slippers in adult extra large<br />2) Hard Sole patient safety slippers in adult large<br /><br />Each evaluator will evaluate each product sample from each vendor against the established requirements. A trial will consist of evaluating sample products from a single vendor, evaluated against the requirements and recorded on a single evaluation form per vendor. Each evaluator will evaluate or trial each participating vendor's product line. The clinical/performance acceptability evaluation period will last for fourteen (14) calendar days. The acceptability evaluation will be conducted using the below listed requirements with responses as either a "YES" (meets/passes requirements) or "NO" (does not/fails to meet requirements) answers. The MMESO JPRB has established that the Clinically Preferred threshold of products for standardization will be eighty percent (80%) of the requirements questions answered as "YES" (meets/passes requirements). Vendor scoring below the clinically preferred threshold will be disqualified from selection for this standardization initiative.</p>
<p>A vendor scoring below the clinically preferred threshold will be disqualified from selection for this standardization initiative. A vendor who has been disqualified will be notified in writing upon disqualification. Of those vendors that are qualified as clinically preferred, selection will be based on best price. Clinical / performance acceptability evaluations by the participating CPT facilities will be tabulated resulting in one score per participating MMESO per vendor. The participating MMESOs' scores by vendor will then be combined resulting in one final vendor performance evaluation score. All clinical/performance acceptability evaluations will be tabulated by the MMESO North and results will be forwarded to the MMESO CPT for final review.</p>
<p>There will be approximately twelve (12) MTFs enterprise wide that will be evaluating products.</p>
<p>Clinical/Performance Requirements<br />During the acquisition planning process, the MMESO CPT approved the clinical/performance requirements outlined below. <br /><br />SOCK Type ONLY<br />1. (National Patient Safety Goal NPSG.09.02.01 - specifically Reduce the risk of patient harm resulting from falls by placing emphasis on wearing Non-Skid Slippers). The slipper socks non-skid material on the tread surface maintains integrity and grips the walking surface without slipping or sliding under the foot. Non-skid material on the slipper tread surface must be of sufficient amount and positioning to assure tread grips the walking surface with each step without slipping or sliding which may increase the risk of falling.<br />2. (National Patient Safety Goal NPSG.09.02.01 - specifically Reduce the risk of patient harm resulting from falls by placing emphasis on wearing Non-Skid Slippers). The Slipper Sock material holds to the foot/ankle without drooping and sagging while walking. Slipper material that droops/sags with movement such as walking may result in an increased risk for a patient fall or non-compliance in wearing the Safety slippers. <br />3. (National Patient Safety Goal NPSG.07.02.01 specifically Reduce the risk of health care-associated infections resulting from pressure ulcers by placing emphasis on wearing Non-Skid Slippers that properly fit the feet). Slipper Sock material holds to the foot or ankle without impairing circulation. Slipper Sock material that holds to the foot or ankle too tightly may impair circulation to the tissue leading to discomfort or further injury to the tissue and/or non-compliance in wearing of the Non-Skid Slippers. <br />FIRM Sole ONLY:<br />4. (National Patient Safety Goal NPSG.09.02.01 - specifically Reduce the risk of patient harm resulting from falls by placing emphasis on wearing Non-Skid Slippers). The non-skid material on the tread surface of the foam slippers maintains its integrity and grips the walking surface without slipping, sliding or tearing. Non-skid material on the Hard/Firm Sole slipper tread surface must be of sufficient amount and positioning to assure tread grips the walking surface with each step without slipping, sliding or tearing, which may increase the risk of falling.<br />5. (National Patient Safety Goal NPSG.07.02.01 specifically Reduce the risk of health care-associated <br />infections resulting from pressure ulcers by placing emphasis on wearing Non-Skid Slippers). The Hard/Firm Sole Slipper's interior seams and surfaces are smooth when worn, fit properly, and do not cause pressure or irritation. Hard/Firm Sole Slipper material that is rough on the interior seams/surfaces can cause pressure, impair circulation, and/or can cause discomfort which inhibit or deter patient walking. The patient may also not wear hard/firm slippers if they provide discomfort, thus increasing their potential for falls and injury. <br /><br />Phase III Pricing Analysis<br />Upon completion of the Phase I - Technical/Company Requirements, a vendor who is found technically acceptable will be qualified /invited to provide product samples and price discount quotes concurrently. A vendor will be given 30 calendar days from the date of pricing requests, to submit IA pricing quotes, in a prescribed electronic spreadsheet format, based upon the requirements of the MMESOs. <strong>Pricing must be received at the MMESO North by 5:00 PM EST, thirty (30) calendar days after the issue date of the vendor notice to submit best price quotes.</strong> Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the specific products requested in this announcement. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing for the products identified in this announcement (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the MMESOs). Price will be analyzed based on the projected Aggregate Post-Standardization costs for each vendor. Aggregate Post-Standardization Cost will be calculated for each vendor by applying the vendor's offered prices to the anticipated annual usage of the enterprise. Unmatched items will be represented in the Post-Standardization Cost at a baseline non-discounted price (current DAPA price of product with highest procurement). <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Among the products and sources that were determined to be clinically preferred, the best price Aggregate Post-Standardization Cost will be selected.</span></strong></p>

GSA's practice is to evaluate offers in the order in which they are received. However, GSA may give priority to processing certain offers when circumstances dictate, such as when a federal agency Contracting Officer specifically requests an expedited offer review in order to meet a pending requirement that will be procured under the MAS program, or when there is a need for GSA to bring strategically critical new products or services to market in order to meet federal customer needs.

<p><br />FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation-Commercial Items (January 1999). The provision at 52.212-2 applies to this acquisition and is provided in full text. (a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The Indian Health Service will make a separate determination of price reasonableness. The primary consideration in evaluating this criterion is which offeror can perform the service in a manner most advantageous to the government. Under best value principles, there is no requirement that a purchase order be awarded on the basis of lowest proposed cost. The award primarily on the basis of estimated costs may encourage the submission of unrealistically low estimates and increase the likelihood of cost overruns. Estimated costs must be reasonable for the services to be performed. If consideration is narrowed to choosing among quotes with approximately equal technical criteria as determined by the technical evaluation, cost information can become the determining criteria. (b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the options(s).</p>

<p>(4) The provision at FAR 52.212-4 CONTRACT TERMS AND CONDITIONS - COMMERCIAL ITEMS (Jun 2010) and below addendum applies.</p>
<p>VOLATILE ORGANIC COMPOUNDS (VOC) REGULATIONS</p>
<p>(a) Contractors are required to comply with federal, state and local VOC compliance laws and regulations. Among other requirements, certain Contractors may also be required to operate pursuant to a Title V permit. The need for such a permit will depend on the provisions of the applicable state's "State Implementation Plan" (SIP) and the type/quantity of the Contractor's regulated emissions, including VOCs. Certain SIPs may also mandate certain Contractors to operate under the terms of a compliance plan intended to reduce VOC emissions.<br />(b) Contractors, therefore, must submit the following to the<br />designated Port Engineer not later than two weeks after contract award: <br />1) Copies of any federal, state or local permits required and applicable to the use or application of VOCs at Contractor's facility or offsite work places;<br />2) Copies of any compliance plans required and applicable to the use or application of VOCs at Contractor's facility or offsite work places.<br />(c) If no federal, state or local permits or compliance plans are required and applicable to the use or application of VOCs at Contractor's facility or offsite workplaces, then Contractor shall submit to the designated Port Engineer a letter, notarized under oath, that such documents are not required.<br />(d) Contractors will submit the following to the designated Port<br />Engineer not later than two weeks after contract award: Data Sheets (MSDS) documents, certificates, specifications or any other manufacturing data verifying the VOC ratings of paints to be applied to the Cutter in accordance with MLCA Standard Spec 63000N, Section 5.3.1.</p>
<p>REQUIRED INSURANCE</p>
<p>The Contractor shall, at its own expense, procure and maintain the following kinds of insurance with respect to performance under the contract. In accordance with HSAR 3052.228-70, Insurance (DEC 2003), the Contractor shall furnish the Contracting Officer with proof of insurance for the duration of the contract, including:<br />1. Ship Repairer's Liability - $500,000 per occurrence.<br />2. Comprehensive General Liability - $500,000 per occurrence.<br />3. Full insurance coverage in accordance with the United States' Longshoremen's and Harbor Worker's Act.<br />4.

<p>The insurance certificate must provide the name of the US Coast Guard vessel and the contract and/or solicitation number as specifically insured.</p>
<p>INSPECTIONS</p>
<p>Except as specified elsewhere, the U.S. Coast Guard shall rely on the Contractor to accomplish all inspection and testing needed to ensure that the work conforms to contract quality requirements.</p>
<p>Records of all inspection work by the Contractor shall be kept complete and available to the Government during the term of this contract and for such longer period as may be specified elsewhere in this contract.</p>
<p>The name and telephone number of the U.S. Coast Guard Inspector will be provided after the award of a contract resulting from this solicitation.</p>
<p>GROWTH WORK</p>
<p>(a) The Contractor shall not perform growth work without the Contracting Officer's authorization. Growth work is work within the scope of the contract, which has not been previously priced as a pre-priced CLIN. The Contracting Officer reserves the right to contract for growth work on the basis of a negotiated, firm, fixed price, when it is in the best interest of the Government.

SCOPE OF WORK: The Contractor shall provide 30 Dari language speakers knowledgeable on Afghan culture and societal norms with 12 Dari language speakers acting as interpreters to assist unit collective training for 1st Brigade Combat Team, 82D Airborne Division. Language speakers will interact primarily with Company Commanders and Field Grade officers during 1 BCT's Field Training Exercise (FTX). This training will also provide 1 BCT leaders trained in Dari through the AF/PAK Language Program an opportunity to apply their training in a collective environment. <br><br>2.	BACKGROUND: 1 BCT is responsible for training and deploying Soldiers in support of a contingency operation, Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF). Mission success will rely on our leaders' abilities to interact effectively with prominent local leaders, public servants, and political figures in the Counter-Insurgency arena. Dari Language Cultural Advisors will afford 1 BCT leadership the opportunity to experience optimized training through tough and realistic scenarios focused on Counter-Insurgency Operations.<br><br>a.	Specifically, the Government requests that the contractor provides individuals that will act as Dari Language Speakers, Cultural Advisors, Civilians on the Battlefield, Interpreters, and support to Opposition Force on Situational Training Exercise (STX) lanes for Soldiers deploying for a contingency operation into theater from Fort Bragg, NC.<br><br>b.	Cultural Advisors, Dari Language Speakers, and Interpreters provide an essential training experience to Soldiers preparing for combat in varying conditions. Conditions may vary from coordinating an opportunity to meet with local leaders to occupying a vehicle or personnel entry control point, interfacing with an indigenous informant or walk-in, communicating properly with local political, police or religious leaders to develop situational awareness and atmospherics, or directing both combatants and non-combatants during offensive operations.<br><br>c.	Dari Language Speakers enable newly trained Soldiers to apply language skills in a tactical environment, and Interpreters provide leaders an opportunity to negotiate interpreter based challenges in training.<br><br><br>3.

<p><br />Q1. Is there a contractor currently providing the same or similar services? If so, could you please provide the contractor name, contract number, and award date?<br /><br />A1. No current contract in place.</p>
<p>Q2. Why is this solicitation not going out as a 'SDVOSB' set-aside when there is at least two bidders that can qualify? We believe that this contract is best served by letting veterans only bid on it. No one understands how to take care of disabled veterans and will do a great job at performing the service then disabled veterans in the business. Please reconsider reissuing this solicitation.</p>
<p>A2. Market Research did not provide at least two SDVOSB and also, Past Procurement history for this requirement posted to FBO, no SDVOSB proposed.</p>
<p>Q3. In the solicitation package there was no Standard Form 1449. Should there be one?</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. <br /><br />This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation. Quotes are being solicited and a written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation number W912L7-12-T-0001 is hereby issued as a Request for Quote. This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-53. The Tennessee Army National Guard has the following requirements. This requirement is being advertised as a small business set-aside; the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 562991 with a Small Business Size Standard of seven million dollars ($7,000,000.00) per year. All responsible sources may submit an offer, which shall be considered by this Agency. The following clauses are applicable to this acquisition: FAR 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Items, 52.212-2 -- Evaluation -- Commercial Items. As prescribed in 12.301(c), the Contracting Officer may insert a provision substantially as follows: Evaluation -- Commercial Items (Jan 1999) (a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: Technical ability to meet the statement of work, price and past performance. Technical and past performance, when combined, are approximately equal to price. (b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). (c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. FAR 52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items, FAR 52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items, FAR 52.212-5 (Dev) Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders Commercial Items (JUN 2006) (Deviation) 52.216-22 Indefinite Quantity, 52.217-8 -- Option to Extend Services. As prescribed in 17.208(f), insert a clause substantially the same as the following: Option to Extend Services (Nov 1999) The Government may require continued performance of any services within the limits and at the rates specified in the contract. These rates may be adjusted only as a result of revisions to prevailing labor rates provided by the Secretary of Labor. The option provision may be exercised more than once, but the total extension of performance hereunder shall not exceed 6 months. The Contracting Officer may exercise the option by written notice to the Contractor within five days. 52.217-9 -- Option to Extend the Term of the Contract. As prescribed in 17.208(g), insert a clause substantially the same as the following: Option to Extend the Term of the Contract (Mar 2000) (a) The Government may extend the term of this contract by written notice to the Contractor within three months of contract expiration; provided that the Government gives the Contractor a preliminary written notice of its intent to extend at least 30 days before the contract expires. The preliminary notice does not commit the Government to an extension. (b) If the Government exercises this option, the extended contract shall be considered to include this option clause.(c) The total duration of this contract, including the exercise of any options under this clause, shall not exceed five years, 52.232-19 Availability of Funds for the Next Fiscal Year, 52.222-41 Service Contract Act of 1965. As prescribed in 22.1006(a), insert the following clause: Service Contract Act of 1965 (Nov 2007) (a) Definitions. As used in this clause- "Act" means the Service Contract Act of 1965 (41 U.S.C. 351, et seq.). "Contractor," when this clause is used in any subcontract, shall be deemed to refer to the subcontractor, except in the term "Government Prime Contractor." "Service employee" means any person engaged in the performance of this contract other than any person employed in a bona fide executive, administrative, or professional capacity, as these terms are defined in Part 541 of Title 29, Code of Federal Regulations, as revised. It includes all such persons regardless of any contractual relationship that may be alleged to exist between a Contractor or subcontractor and such persons. (b) Applicability. This contract is subject to the following provisions and to all other applicable provisions of the Act and regulations of the Secretary of Labor (29 CFR Part 4). This clause does not apply to contracts or subcontracts administratively exempted by the Secretary of Labor or exempted by 41 U.S.C. 356, as interpreted in Subpart C of 29 CFR Part 4. (c) Compensation. (1) Each service employee employed in the performance of this contract by the Contractor or any subcontractor shall be paid not less than the minimum monetary wages and shall be furnished fringe benefits in accordance with the wages and fringe benefits determined by the Secretary of Labor, or authorized representative, as specified in any wage determination attached to this contract. (2)(i) If a wage determination is attached to this contract, the Contractor shall classify any class of service employee which is not listed therein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage determination) so as to provide a reasonable relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination. Such conformed class of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished the fringe benefits as are determined pursuant to the procedures in this paragraph (c). (ii) This conforming procedure shall be initiated by the Contractor prior to the performance of contract work by the unlisted class of employee. The Contractor shall submit Standard Form (SF) 1444, Request For Authorization of Additional Classification and Rate, to the Contracting Officer no later than 30 days after the unlisted class of employee performs any contract work. The Contracting Officer shall review the proposed classification and rate and promptly submit the completed SF 1444 (which must include information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the employees' authorized representatives or the employees themselves together with the agency recommendation), and all pertinent information to the Wage and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor. The Wage and Hour Division will approve, modify, or disapprove the action or render a final determination in the event of disagreement within 30 days of receipt or will notify the Contracting Officer within 30 days of receipt that additional time is necessary. (iii) The final determination of the conformance action by the Wage and Hour Division shall be transmitted to the Contracting Officer who shall promptly notify the Contractor of the action taken. Each affected employee shall be furnished by the Contractor with a written copy of such determination or it shall be posted as a part of the wage determination. (iv)(A) The process of establishing wage and fringe benefit rates that bear a reasonable relationship to those listed in a wage determination cannot be reduced to any single formula. The approach used may vary from wage determination to wage determination depending on the circumstances. Standard wage and salary administration practices which rank various job classifications by pay grade pursuant to point schemes or other job factors may, for example, be relied upon. Guidance may also be obtained from the way different jobs are rated under Federal pay systems (Federal Wage Board Pay System and the General Schedule) or from other wage determinations issued in the same locality. Basic to the establishment of any conformable wage rate(s) is the concept that a pay relationship should be maintained between job classifications based on the skill required and the duties performed. (B) In the case of a contract modification, an exercise of an option, or extension of an existing contract, or in any other case where a Contractor succeeds a contract under which the classification in question was previously conformed pursuant to paragraph (c) of this clause, a new conformed wage rate and fringe benefits may be assigned to the conformed classification by indexing (i.e., adjusting) the previous conformed rate and fringe benefits by an amount equal to the average (mean) percentage increase (or decrease, where appropriate) between the wages and fringe benefits specified for all classifications to be used on the contract which are listed in the current wage determination, and those specified for the corresponding classifications in the previously applicable wage determination. Where conforming actions are accomplished in accordance with this paragraph prior to the performance of contract work by the unlisted class of employees, the Contractor shall advise the Contracting Officer of the action taken but the other procedures in subdivision (c)(2)(ii) of this clause need not be followed. (C) No employee engaged in performing work on this contract shall in any event be paid less than the currently applicable minimum wage specified under section 6(a)(1) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amended. (v) The wage rate and fringe benefits finally determined under this paragraph (c)(2) of this clause shall be paid to all employees performing in the classification from the first day on which contract work is performed by them in the classification. Failure to pay the unlisted employees the compensation agreed upon by the interested parties and/or finally determined by the Wage and Hour Division retroactive to the date such class of employees commenced contract work shall be a violation of the Act and this contract. (vi) Upon discovery of failure to comply with paragraph (c)(2) of this clause, the Wage and Hour Division shall make a final determination of conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits which shall be retroactive to the date such class or classes of employees commenced contract work. (3) Adjustment of compensation. If the term of this contract is more than 1 year, the minimum monetary wages and fringe benefits required to be paid or furnished thereunder to service employees under this contract shall be subject to adjustment after 1 year and not less often than once every 2 years, under wage determinations issued by the Wage and Hour Division. (d) Obligation to furnish fringe benefits. The Contractor or subcontractor may discharge the obligation to furnish fringe benefits specified in the attachment or determined under paragraph (c)(2) of this clause by furnishing equivalent combinations of bona fide fringe benefits, or by making equivalent or differential cash payments, only in accordance with Subpart D of 29 CFR Part 4. (e) Minimum wage. In the absence of a minimum wage attachment for this contract, neither the Contractor nor any subcontractor under this contract shall pay any person performing work under this contract (regardless of whether the person is a service employee) less than the minimum wage specified by section 6(a)(1) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938. Nothing in this clause shall relieve the Contractor or any subcontractor of any other obligation under law or contract for payment of a higher wage to any employee. (f) Successor contracts. If this contract succeeds a contract subject to the Act under which substantially the same services were furnished in the same locality and service employees were paid wages and fringe benefits provided for in a collective bargaining agreement, in the absence of the minimum wage attachment for this contract setting forth such collectively bargained wage rates and fringe benefits, neither the Contractor nor any subcontractor under this contract shall pay any service employee performing any of the contract work (regardless of whether or not such employee was employed under the predecessor contract), less than the wages and fringe benefits provided for in such collective bargaining agreement, to which such employee would have been entitled if employed under the predecessor contract, including accrued wages and fringe benefits and any prospective increases in wages and fringe benefits provided for under such agreement. No Contractor or subcontractor under this contract may be relieved of the foregoing obligation unless the limitations of 29 CFR 4.1b(b) apply or unless the Secretary of Labor or the Secretary's authorized representative finds, after a hearing as provided in 29 CFR 4.10 that the wages and/or fringe benefits provided for in such agreement are substantially at variance with those which prevail for services of a character similar in the locality, or determines, as provided in 29 CFR 4.11, that the collective bargaining agreement applicable to service employees employed under the predecessor contract was not entered into as a result of arm's length negotiations. Where it is found in accordance with the review procedures provided in 29 CFR 4.10 and/or 4.11 and Parts 6 and 8 that some or all of the wages and/or fringe benefits contained in a predecessor Contractor's collective bargaining agreement are substantially at variance with those which prevail for services of a character similar in the locality, and/or that the collective bargaining agreement applicable to service employees employed under the predecessor contract was not entered into as a result of arm's length negotiations, the Department will issue a new or revised wage determination setting forth the applicable wage rates and fringe benefits. Such determination shall be made part of the contract or subcontract, in accordance with the decision of the Administrator, the Administrative Law Judge, or the Administrative Review Board, as the case may be, irrespective of whether such issuance occurs prior to or after the award of a contract or subcontract (53 Comp. Gen. 401 (1973)). In the case of a wage determination issued solely as a result of a finding of substantial variance, such determination shall be effective as of the date of the final administrative decision. (g) Notification to employees. The Contractor and any subcontractor under this contract shall notify each service employee commencing work on this contract of the minimum monetary wage and any fringe benefits required to be paid pursuant to this contract, or shall post the wage determination attached to this contract. The poster provided by the Department of Labor (Publication WH 1313) shall be posted in a prominent and accessible place at the worksite. Failure to comply with this requirement is a violation of section 2(a)(4) of the Act and of this contract. (h) Safe and sanitary working conditions. The Contractor or subcontractor shall not permit any part of the services called for by this contract to be performed in buildings or surroundings or under working conditions provided by or under the control or supervision of the Contractor or subcontractor which are unsanitary, hazardous, or dangerous to the health or safety of the service employees. The Contractor or subcontractor shall comply with the safety and health standards applied under 29 CFR Part 1925. (i) Records. (1) The Contractor and each subcontractor performing work subject to the Act shall make and maintain for 3 years from the completion of the work, and make them available for inspection and transcription by authorized representatives of the Wage and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, a record of the following: (i) For each employee subject to the Act- (A) Name and address and social security number; (B) Correct work classification or classifications, rate or rates of monetary wages paid and fringe benefits provided, rate or rates of payments in lieu of fringe benefits, and total daily and weekly compensation; (C) Daily and weekly hours worked by each employee; and (D) Any deductions, rebates, or refunds from the total daily or weekly compensation of each employee. (ii) For those classes of service employees not included in any wage determination attached to this contract, wage rates or fringe benefits determined by the interested parties or by the Administrator or authorized representative under the terms of paragraph (c) of this clause. A copy of the report required by subdivision (c)(2)(ii) of this clause will fulfill this requirement. (iii) Any list of the predecessor Contractor's employees which had been furnished to the Contractor as prescribed by paragraph (n) of this clause. (2) The Contractor shall also make available a copy of this contract for inspection or transcription by authorized representatives of the Wage and Hour Division. (3) Failure to make and maintain or to make available these records for inspection and transcription shall be a violation of the regulations and this contract, and in the case of failure to produce these records, the Contracting Officer, upon direction of the Department of Labor and notification to the Contractor, shall take action to cause suspension of any further payment or advance of funds until the violation ceases. (4) The Contractor shall permit authorized representatives of the Wage and Hour Division to conduct interviews with employees at the worksite during normal working hours. (j) Pay periods. The Contractor shall unconditionally pay to each employee subject to the Act all wages due free and clear and without subsequent deduction (except as otherwise provided by law or regulations, 29 CFR Part 4), rebate, or kickback on any account. These payments shall be made no later than one pay period following the end of the regular pay period in which the wages were earned or accrued. A pay period under this Act may not be of any duration longer than semi-monthly. (k) Withholding of payments and termination of contract. The Contracting Officer shall withhold or cause to be withheld from the Government Prime Contractor under this or any other Government contract with the Prime Contractor such sums as an appropriate official of the Department of Labor requests or such sums as the Contracting Officer decides may be necessary to pay underpaid employees employed by the Contractor or subcontractor. In the event of failure to pay any employees subject to the Act all or part of the wages or fringe benefits due under the Act, the Contracting Officer may, after authorization or by direction of the Department of Labor and written notification to the Contractor, take action to cause suspension of any further payment or advance of funds until such violations have ceased. Additionally, any failure to comply with the requirements of this clause may be grounds for termination of the right to proceed with the contract work. In such event, the Government may enter into other contracts or arrangements for completion of the work, charging the Contractor in default with any additional cost. (l) Subcontracts. The Contractor agrees to insert this clause in all subcontracts subject to the Act. (m) Collective bargaining agreements applicable to service employees. If wages to be paid or fringe benefits to be furnished any service employees employed by the Government Prime Contractor or any subcontractor under the contract are provided for in a collective bargaining agreement which is or will be effective during any period in which the contract is being performed, the Government Prime Contractor shall report such fact to the Contracting Officer, together with full information as to the application and accrual of such wages and fringe benefits, including any prospective increases, to service employees engaged in work on the contract, and a copy of the collective bargaining agreement. Such report shall be made upon commencing performance of the contract, in the case of collective bargaining agreements effective at such time, and in the case of such agreements or provisions or amendments thereof effective at a later time during the period of contract performance such agreements shall be reported promptly after negotiation thereof. (n) Seniority list. Not less than 10 days prior to completion of any contract being performed at a Federal facility where service employees may be retained in the performance of the succeeding contract and subject to a wage determination which contains vacation or other benefit provisions based upon length of service with a Contractor (predecessor) or successor (29 CFR 4.173), the incumbent Prime Contractor shall furnish the Contracting Officer a certified list of the names of all service employees on the Contractor's or subcontractor's payroll during the last month of contract performance. Such list shall also contain anniversary dates of employment on the contract either with the current or predecessor Contractors of each such service employee. The Contracting Officer shall turn over such list to the successor Contractor at the commencement of the succeeding contract. (o) Rulings and interpretations. Rulings and interpretations of the Act are contained in Regulations, 29 CFR Part 4. (p) Contractor's certification. (1) By entering into this contract, the Contractor (and officials thereof) certifies that neither it (nor he or she) nor any person or firm who has a substantial interest in the Contractor's firm is a person or firm ineligible to be awarded Government contracts by virtue of the sanctions imposed under section 5 of the Act. (2) No part of this contract shall be subcontracted to any person or firm ineligible for award of a Government contract under section 5 of the Act. (3) The penalty for making false statements is prescribed in the U.S. Criminal Code, 18 U.S.C. 1001. (q) Variations, tolerances, and exemptions involving employment. Notwithstanding any of the provisions in paragraphs (b) through (o) of this clause, the following employees may be employed in accordance with the following variations, tolerances, and exemptions, which the Secretary of Labor, pursuant to section 4(b) of the Act prior to its amendment by Pub. L. 92-473, found to be necessary and proper in the public interest or to avoid serious impairment of the conduct of Government business: (1) Apprentices, student-learners, and workers whose earning capacity is impaired by age, physical or mental deficiency, or injury may be employed at wages lower than the minimum wages otherwise required by section 2(a)(1) or 2(b)(1) of the Act without diminishing any fringe benefits or cash payments in lieu thereof required under section 2(a)(2) of the Act, in accordance with the conditions and procedures prescribed for the employment of apprentices, student-learners, handicapped persons, and handicapped clients of sheltered workshops under section 14 of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, in the regulations issued by the Administrator (29 CFR parts 520, 521, 524, and 525). (2) The Administrator will issue certificates under the Act for the employment of apprentices, student-learners, handicapped persons, or handicapped clients of sheltered workshops not subject to the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, or subject to different minimum rates of pay under the two acts, authorizing appropriate rates of minimum wages (but without changing requirements concerning fringe benefits or supplementary cash payments in lieu thereof), applying procedures prescribed by the applicable regulations issued under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (29 CFR parts 520, 521, 524, and 525). (3) The Administrator will also withdraw, annul, or cancel such certificates in accordance with the regulations in 29 CFR parts 525 and 528. (r) Apprentices. Apprentices will be permitted to work at less than the predetermined rate for the work they perform when they are employed and individually registered in a bona fide apprenticeship program registered with a State Apprenticeship Agency which is recognized by the U.S. Department of Labor, or if no such recognized agency exists in a State, under a program registered with the Office of Apprenticeship Training, Employer, and Labor Services (OATELS), U.S. Department of Labor. Any employee who is not registered as an apprentice in an approved program shall be paid the wage rate and fringe benefits contained in the applicable wage determination for the journeyman classification of work actually performed. The wage rates paid apprentices shall not be less than the wage rate for their level of progress set forth in the registered program, expressed as the appropriate percentage of the journeyman's rate contained in the applicable wage determination. The allowable ratio of apprentices to journeymen employed on the contract work in any craft classification shall not be greater than the ratio permitted to the Contractor as to his entire work force under the registered program. (s) Tips. An employee engaged in an occupation in which the employee customarily and regularly receives more than $30 a month in tips may have the amount of these tips credited by the employer against the minimum wage required by section 2(a)(1) or section 2(b)(1) of the Act, in accordance with section 3(m) of the Fair Labor Standards Act and Regulations, 29 CFR Part 531. However, the amount of credit shall not exceed $1.34 per hour beginning January 1, 1981. To use this provision- (1) The employer must inform tipped employees about this tip credit allowance before the credit is utilized; (2) The employees must be allowed to retain all tips (individually or through a pooling arrangement and regardless of whether the employer elects to take a credit for tips received); (3) The employer must be able to show by records that the employee receives at least the applicable Service Contract Act minimum wage through the combination of direct wages and tip credit; and (4) The use of such tip credit must have been permitted under any predecessor collective bargaining agreement applicable by virtue of section 4(c) of the Act. (t) Disputes concerning labor standards. The U.S. Department of Labor has set forth in 29 CFR parts 4, 6, and 8 procedures for resolving disputes concerning labor standards requirements. Such disputes shall be resolved in accordance with those procedures and not the Disputes clause of this contract. Disputes within the meaning of this clause include disputes between the Contractor (or any of its subcontractors) and the contracting agency, the U.S. Department of Labor, or the employees or their representatives. The following wage rates apply to any contract resulting from this solicitation:

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>THE OCCUPATIONS WHICH HAVE NUMBERED FOOTNOTES IN PARENTHESES RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING:</p>
<p>1) COMPUTER EMPLOYEES: Under the SCA at section 8(b), this wage determination does<br />not apply to any employee who individually qualifies as a bona fide executive,<br />administrative, or professional employee as defined in 29 C.F.R. Part 541. Because<br />most Computer System Analysts and Computer Programmers who are compensated at a rate<br />not less than $27.63 (or on a salary or fee basis at a rate not less than $455 per<br />week) an hour would likely qualify as exempt computer professionals, (29 C.F.R. 541.<br />400) wage rates may not be listed on this wage determination for all occupations<br />within those job families. In addition, because this wage determination may not<br />list a wage rate for some or all occupations within those job families if the survey<br />data indicates that the prevailing wage rate for the occupation equals or exceeds<br />$27.63 per hour conformances may be necessary for certain nonexempt employees. For<br />example, if an individual employee is nonexempt but nevertheless performs duties<br />within the scope of one of the Computer Systems Analyst or Computer Programmer<br />occupations for which this wage determination does not specify an SCA wage rate,<br />then the wage rate for that employee must be conformed in accordance with the<br />conformance procedures described in the conformance note included on this wage<br />determination.</p>
<p>Additionally, because job titles vary widely and change quickly in the computer<br />industry, job titles are not determinative of the application of the computer<br />professional exemption. Therefore, the exemption applies only to computer employees<br />who satisfy the compensation requirements and whose primary duty consists of:<br />(1) The application of systems analysis techniques and procedures, including<br />consulting with users, to determine hardware, software or system functional<br />specifications;<br />(2) The design, development, documentation, analysis, creation, testing or<br />modification of computer systems or programs, including prototypes, based on and<br />related to user or system design specifications;<br />(3) The design, documentation, testing, creation or modification of computer<br />programs related to machine operating systems; or<br />(4) A combination of the aforementioned duties, the performance of which<br />requires the same level of skills. (29 C.F.R. 541.400).</p>
<p>2) AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS AND WEATHER OBSERVERS - NIGHT PAY &amp; SUNDAY PAY: If you<br />work at night as part of a regular tour of duty, you will earn a night differential<br />and receive an additional 10% of basic pay for any hours worked between 6pm and 6am.<br />If you are a full-time employed (40 hours a week) and Sunday is part of your<br />regularly scheduled workweek, you are paid at your rate of basic pay plus a Sunday<br />premium of 25% of your basic rate for each hour of Sunday work which is not overtime<br />(i.e. occasional work on Sunday outside the normal tour of duty is considered<br />overtime work).</p>
<p><br />HAZARDOUS PAY DIFFERENTIAL: An 8 percent differential is applicable to employees<br />employed in a position that represents a high degree of hazard when working with or<br />in close proximity to ordinance, explosives, and incendiary materials. This<br />includes work such as screening, blending, dying, mixing, and pressing of sensitive<br />ordance, explosives, and pyrotechnic compositions such as lead azide, black powder<br />and photoflash powder. All dry-house activities involving propellants or explosives.<br />Demilitarization, modification, renovation, demolition, and maintenance operations<br />on sensitive ordnance, explosives and incendiary materials. All operations<br />involving regrading and cleaning of artillery ranges.</p>
<p>A 4 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that<br />represents a low degree of hazard when working with, or in close proximity to<br />ordance, (or employees possibly adjacent to) explosives and incendiary materials<br />which involves potential injury such as laceration of hands, face, or arms of the<br />employee engaged in the operation, irritation of the skin, minor burns and the<br />like; minimal damage to immediate or adjacent work area or equipment being used.<br />All operations involving, unloading, storage, and hauling of ordance, explosive, and<br />incendiary ordnance material other than small arms ammunition. These differentials<br />are only applicable to work that has been specifically designated by the agency for<br />ordance, explosives, and incendiary material differential pay.</p>
<p>** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE **</p>
<p>If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract<br />(either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state or<br />local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by<br />laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by an<br />employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wage<br />determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the<br />following standards as compliance:</p>
<p>The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an<br />adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the actual<br />cost of the uniforms. In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made<br />the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors subject to<br />this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining<br />agreement providing for a different amount, or the furnishing of contrary<br />affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all employees for such cleaning<br />and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day). However, in<br />those instances where the uniforms furnished are made of "wash and wear"<br />materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments, and do<br />not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning, daily washing, or commercial<br />laundering in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms<br />of the Government contract, by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work,<br />there is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs.</p>
<p>The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the<br />"Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations", Fifth Edition, April 2006,<br />unless otherwise indicated. Copies of the Directory are available on the Internet. A<br />links to the Directory may be found on the WHD home page at http://www.dol.<br />gov/esa/whd/ or through the Wage Determinations On-Line (WDOL) Web site at<br />http://wdol.gov/.</p>
<p>REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE {Standard Form<br />1444 (SF 1444)}</p>
<p>Conformance Process:</p>
<p>The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which is<br />not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to<br />be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage<br />determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable<br />relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted<br />classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination. Such<br />conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished the<br />fringe benefits as are determined. Such conforming process shall be initiated by<br />the contractor prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted class(es)<br />of employees. The conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits shall<br />be retroactive to the commencement date of the contract. {See Section 4.6 (C)(vi)}<br />When multiple wage determinations are included in a contract, a separate SF 1444<br />should be prepared for each wage determination to which a class(es) is to be<br />conformed.</p>
<p>The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows:</p>
<p>1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed<br />occupation(s) and computes a proposed rate(s).</p>
<p>2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in order<br />proposed classification title(s), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for each<br />proposed classification(s), job description(s), and rationale for proposed wage<br />rate(s), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the<br />authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no authorized<br />representative, the employees themselves. This report should be submitted to the<br />contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of employees<br />performs any contract work.</p>
<p>3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report<br />of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent<br />information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the Wage<br />and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor,<br />for review. (See section 4.6(b)(2) of Regulations 29 CFR Part 4).</p>
<p>4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or<br />disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or<br />notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to process<br />the request.</p>
<p>5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour decision to the contractor.</p>
<p>6) The contractor informs the affected employees.</p>
<p>Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF 1444 or bond paper.</p>
<p>When preparing a conformance request, the "Service Contract Act Directory of<br />Occupations" (the Directory) should be used to compare job definitions to insure<br />that duties requested are not performed by a classification already listed in the<br />wage determination. Remember, it is not the job title, but the required tasks that<br />determine whether a class is included in an established wage determination.<br />Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or subdivide<br />classifications listed in the wage determination.</p>

The Contractor staff shall attend Government led Privacy Act Training prior to handling relevant data and materials.</p>

<p>Professional Appearance. The Contractor's employees shall present a professional appearance at all times and their conduct shall not reflect discredit upon the United States, the Department of Homeland Security and the United States Coast Guard. If the Government feels there is a problem with a Contractor's appearance; the issue will be brought to the attention of the KO who will report the issue to the Contractor.</p>
<p>Employee Conduct. <br />Contractor's employees shall comply with all applicable Government regulations, policies and procedures (e.g., fire, safety, sanitation, environmental protection, security, "off limits" areas, wearing of parts of military uniforms, and possession of weapons) when visiting or working at Government facilities. The Contractor shall ensure contractor employees present a professional appearance at all times and that their conduct shall not reflect discredit on the United States, the Department of Homeland Security or the U.S. Coast Guard.</p>
<p>Employee Identification.<br />Contractor employees visiting Government facilities shall wear an identification badge that, at minimum, displays the Contractor name, the employee's photo, name, clearance-level and badge expiration date. Visiting Contractor employees shall comply with all Government escort rules and requirements. All Contractor employees shall identify themselves as Contractors when their status is not readily apparent and display all identification and visitor badges in plain view above the waist at all times.</p>
<p>Removing Employees for Misconduct or Security Reasons. <br />The Government may, at its sole discretion, direct the Contractor to remove any Contractor employee from U.S. Coast Guard facilities for misconduct or security reasons. Removal does not relieve the Contractor of the responsibility to continue providing the services required under any task order awarded under this contract. The Contracting Officer will provide the Contractor with a written explanation to support any request to remove an employee.</p>
<p>Conflict of Interest. <br />The Contractor shall not employ any person who is an employee of the United States Government if that employment would, or would appear to cause a conflict of interest.</p>

<p>Notice For Filing Agency Protests<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p>Notice For Filing Agency Protests<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

The Contractor staff shall attend Government led Privacy Act Training prior to handling relevant data and materials.</p>
<p>Adherence to Regulations and Notices. The Contractor shall ensure that its personnel adhere to the policies promulgated in USCG Regulations, Federal Regulations, Commandant Instructions and Notices.</p>
<p>Professional Appearance. The Contractor's employees shall present a professional appearance at all times and their conduct shall not reflect discredit upon the United States, the Department of Homeland Security and the United States Coast Guard. If the Government feels there is a problem with a Contractor's appearance; the issue will be brought to the attention of the KO who will report the issue to the Contractor.</p>
<p><br />Employee Conduct. <br />Contractor's employees shall comply with all applicable Government regulations, policies and procedures (e.g., fire, safety, sanitation, environmental protection, security, "off limits" areas, wearing of parts of military uniforms, and possession of weapons) when visiting or working at Government facilities. The Contractor shall ensure contractor employees present a professional appearance at all times and that their conduct shall not reflect discredit on the United States, the Department of Homeland Security or the U.S. Coast Guard.</p>
<p>Employee Identification.<br />Contractor employees visiting Government facilities shall wear an identification badge that, at minimum, displays the Contractor name, the employee's photo, name, clearance-level and badge expiration date.

All Contractor employees shall identify themselves as Contractors when their status is not readily apparent and display all identification and visitor badges in plain view above the waist at all times.</p>
<p>Removing Employees for Misconduct or Security Reasons. <br />The Government may, at its sole discretion, direct the Contractor to remove any Contractor employee from U.S. Coast Guard facilities for misconduct or security reasons. Removal does not relieve the Contractor of the responsibility to continue providing the services required under any task order awarded under this contract. The Contracting Officer will provide the Contractor with a written explanation to support any request to remove an employee.</p>

<p>Notice For Filing Agency Protests<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

The Contractor's employees shall present a professional appearance at all times and their conduct shall not reflect discredit upon the United States, the Department of Homeland Security and the United States Coast Guard.

<p>Notice For Filing Agency Protests<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p>1.1 SCOPE. <br />The U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) Office of Safety and Environmental Health has a requirement for training support services involving classroom instruction and field exercise training for a four-day Shore Confined Space Entry course (Code 500096, G-KSE-024) to a class size of 13 to 25 students. Training shall be held at the following locations: TRACEN Yorktown, Yorktown, VA; TRACEN Petaluma, Petaluma, CA; and Transportable to CG Unit TBD. USCG intends to fulfill this requirement by awarding a fixed-price contract for one year with four option years.</p>
<p>The Government has the option to add sessions to, or substitute for, the sessions listed in this Performance Work Statement (PWS) if agreed to by the Contractor and the USCG.</p>
<p>1.2 BACKGROUND. <br />The training mission of the USCG is to provide quality safety, health, and environmental training to selected personnel in order to enhance skills at the basic, intermediate, and advanced levels in order to prepare personnel in their designated specialty or field.</p>
<p>Shore Confined Space Entry and Rescue training reviews USCG policy COMDTINST M5100.47 and OSHA 29 CFR 1910.146, regarding Shore Confined Space Entry and Rescue procedures. Program management and implementation are covered including requirements for developing a written Confined Space Safety Instruction. The duties of entrants, attendants, entry supervisor, and rescue team members are discussed in detail. Characteristics of confined spaces are explained and methods taught to identify and distinguish a Non Permit required confined space from a Permit required confined space. Risk management of confined space entry is integrated into hazard recognition, evaluation, control, permitting, and monitoring procedures. Though focusing on shore-confined space, aviation-confined space is also reviewed. An overview of confined space test equipment is performed with each student, practicing calibration and use functions of the equipment. Students perform practical exercises using monitoring equipment to test spaces.</p>
<p>This training is designed for Shore Facility Confined Space Entry and Rescue application. This course is intended for USCG personnel military and civilian who are assigned to shore facilities having confined spaces and who have been assigned duties as attendants, or entry supervisors with responsibilities to test and monitor confined spaces. Personnel attending this course should have completed the online USCG Confined Space Safety Awareness training prior to enrollment in this course and have a basic understanding of industrial safety practices.</p>

<DESC><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This Sources Sought Amendment is for clarification of the C-130 Main Landing Gear (MLG) Ball Screw Assembly (NSN 1620 01 263 6733/Part Number 8430M4) acquisition. Due to the Air Force having only limited data rights, we feel that it is necessary to further clarify why the C-130 MLG Ball Screw Assembly has limited/highly specialized data rights associated with it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An offeror who has previous experience in the manufacture and qualification of similar ball screw items, used in Landing Gear Retraction/Extension system applications, may apply to the design control authority at OO-ALC (417 SCMS/GUEA) for a potential waiver to the attached draft Source Qualification Statement. The potential waiver may be granted if and only if the design control authority can establish the qualifications of the offeror; through the evaluation of written inputs from the offeror, from previous knowledge of the offeror's capabilities, and from previous experience on similar item acquisitions. It must also be noted that offerors may still be required to submit a prequalification article.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We hope that this can help clear any confusion relating to the C-130 MLG Ball Screw Assembly. If you are requesting a waiver, please submit the information by 23 Sep 2011. If you have any questions please send them to Patrick.Jurkiewicz@hill.af.mil and we will respond as soon as an answer can be obtained.</p>

<DESC>PROJECT INFORMATION:
<p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, has a requirement for architectural, engineering, and technical design services for the renovation of the existing upper Unity Work Center compound site.  The purpose is to develop concept design documents, preliminary design documents, construction documents, and engineering services during construction.</p>
<p>Unity Work Center (USFS) is located in Unity, Oregon (pop. 130), which is approximately 35 air miles southwest of Baker City, Oregon. At one time, three compounds (upper, lower, and middle) had comprised the Forest Service owned administrative site. The use of the site has reduced significantly over the past several years and the Forest has conveyed the lower and middle compounds.  However, the Upper Compound will continue to serve as a seasonal work center, and will serve as a base for fire and recreation crews. With a population of 130, the town of Unity (over an hour drive from Baker) does not have available rentals or apartments to offer for housing. The ability to respond to forest fires in this locality depends on recruiting and retaining employees - providing bunkhouse space is a critical factor.</p>
<p>Most of the existing Forest Service owned housing was located on the lower and middle compounds. The modifications to the Upper Compound are necessary to fit personnel into the existing residual infrastructure. Many of the facilities on this compound are 1930's and 1960's vintage (and are listed in the National Register of Historic Places), and no longer meet current building, occupancy, and health/safety code requirements. Renovations to existing buildings and construction of a new bunkhouse will help make this compound more functional for current and projected future use.<br />The Forest intends to use funds to provide housing for 20 seasonal employees. The Forest would like to remove the modular portion of the existing office (approximately 1,900 square feet), and remodel/expand the remaining stick-frame office (adding approximately 4,000 square feet) into a 20 person bunkhouse as well as design of all associated site/utilities.  A site analysis will need to be completed to determine the technical feasibility of this option, or if there is a more technically sound option that should be pursued.</p>
<p>This building must be upgraded to meet accessibility and current building code standards, upgrade life safety (fire safety) systems, provide food preparation facilities (kitchen), remove the underground heating oil tank (HOT) and replace with compliant above ground heating oil tank, and upgrade the restroom facilities.  Additionally, this project will include energy and sustainability upgrades such as wall and ceiling insulation, thermal-pane windows, upgraded HVAC system, energy-efficient lighting, and installation of a supplemental solar power system.

<DESC><p>Under Authority of FAR 6.302-1, Only one Responsible source, the US Census Bureau intends to negotiate and award on a noncompetitive basis an agreement with NTT America (NTT) for platform as a service (PaaS) delivering a Managed Hosting Solution with current System Test and Evaluation (ST&amp;E) certification for a Low-Low-Low System for the Census QUISP II System. NTT has unique qualifications. NTT currently provides the secure database and web server hosting for the QUISP II system as a subcontractor for a Census research and development consultant at its Sterling Facility. Hosting the Census system requires strict compliance with the Information Technology security requirements described in the Census Bureau IT Security Program Policies, Version 2.2, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-130, Management of Federal Information Resources; the Computer Security Act of 1987 (Public Law 100-235); and the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA). A System Test and Evaluation (ST&amp;E) must be completed for each facility that will house the Census system. The U.S. Census Bureau has determined that NTT is the only known source with the capability and existing certified facilities needed to provide hosting for the QUISP II. The intent of this synopsis is for informational purposes only and is not a request for competitive proposals. No solicitations will be issued.

<AWDAMT>A one year contract for $219,114 with four one year options for an ultimate contract value of $1,145,545.
<AWDDATE>100311
<AWARDEE>Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center, 533 Bolivar Street, New Orleans, LA 70112-1393 US
<DESC>The objective of the Determination of Genetic Susceptibility to Lung Cancer in Families from Southern Louisiana program is to collect clinical, environmental and phenotypic data, and biological specimens from lung cancer patients, their families and frequency matched normal control individuals for use in studies of the genetic epidemiology of lung cancer.

The contractor will perform the following program requirements:  1) rapidly identify and contact all lung cancer patients, hereafter called probands, newly diagnosed between October 3, 2011 and October 2, 2016 (assuming all contract option years are exercised) within 27 parishes in southern Louisiana using a rapid ascertainment network and attempt to enroll them into the phase 1 interview portion of the study; 2) perform a brief phase 1 family history interview with these probands to determine how many of their relatives have ever had lung cancer; 3) collect phenotypic and detailed smoking and other environmental exposure data and biologic specimens from selected lung cancer patients (selected because they have a family history of lung cancer that was discovered during the phase 1 interview) and their families to be delivered to the Government (in a de-identified manner) so that the following analyses can be performed: genotyping, genetic linkage analyses, familial-case-control genome-wide and targeted association analyses, genome sequencing analyses, and genotype-phenotype correlation analyses. The contractor will complete enrollment of 10-15 new families with adequate data for use in the linkage study and 320-400 probands with a family history for the association study from among the families ascertained during this contract period; 4) collect phenotypic and environmental exposure data and biologic specimens on approximately 320-400 matched control (unaffected) individuals (frequency matched to the probands on age, smoking exposure levels, area of residence, race/ethnicity) who are biologically unrelated to the lung cancer patients for use in the analyses described above; 5) continue follow-up of previously enrolled lung cancer patients and their families to allow updating of new cancer diagnoses within the families; 6) Provide a Statistical Geneticist to assist NHGRI staff with these types of methodological research, as well as to advise the data collection staff about prioritization of their data collection efforts (to ensure collection of the most powerful families), assist NHGRI staff with analyses of the data as needed, and perform evaluations of various statistical genetic methods needed to analyze this extremely complex trait; 7) verify all reported cases of cancer at any site in original patients and in affected relatives by review of hospital charts, pathologist or physician medical records, or death certificates (if appropriate) and information on histological type whenever available; 8) maintain a database that contains all of the data generated from the study; and 9) provide biologic specimens including whole blood appropriate for DNA extraction, tumor samples and saliva samples to a central repository specified by NHGRI. To accomplish this work, Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval for the protection of human subjects is required from the contractors organization and the study will also have to be approved by the IRBs of hospitals and universities that participate in the rapid ascertainment network.

<AWARDEE>L-3 Communications Vertex Aerospace, 555 Industrial Drive South, Madison, MS 39110-9072 US
<DESC><p>As part of a broad CLS strategy to better define the Department of the Navy's NFO training requirements and to reduce total ownership costs, the Navy rebaselined the requirements for all CNATRA training platforms. Upon completion of the requirements definition process the Navy started the source selection process for a follow-on competition of this requirement. The existing contract, which has previously been extended, expires 30 September 2011; however, the follow-on contracting effort has taken longer than expected, therefore a new contract, with a nine to twelve (9-12) month period of performance is required. Without a short-term provision to bridge the gap between the end of the current contract and award of the new competitively awarded contracts, training of SNFOs and I-level maintenance services cited in Section 3 will halt on 30 September 2011.</p>
<p>The incumbent contractor, L-3 Vertex, is the only company that is in a position to immediately perform the required tasking for the limited period of time required. Any other contractor would be required to complete an inventory of the GFE, review and select qualified employees and coordinate with the unions concerning employment of the personnel covered by the Collective Bargaining Unit (CBA), and establish a management and administrative infrastructure at the two places of performance to include completion of required personnel training, licensing and certification. A Contractor other than the incumbent would need to spend a substantial amount of time during this short period of performance, becoming familiar with the platform, tools and equipment. Material requisitioning and maintenance and material management (3M) data reporting done through NALCOMIS, a system totally peculiar to the Navy, would also require considerable time to learn. Accounting of funds, inventory of all parts and materials, flight operation schedules, configuration management and delivery of associated CDRLs are requirements of this Contract that must be posted in an on-line database and accessible to Government clients on a real time basis. For this to be established in a short period of time would be extremely difficult. A sole source contract with a six (6) month base period and two (2), three (3) month options is necessary to ensure that there is no break in contract performance. Given the time constraints, there is insufficient time to award the new CLS contracts before 30 September 2011. This provision is necessary to ensure that CNATRA can complete its training mission and support fleet operational requirements while the source selection process is being completed.</p>

4.	Statutory Authority Permitting Other than Full and Open Competition: 
( X) (1) Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements per FAR 6.302-1; 
5.	Demonstration that the Contractor's Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority) 
a. Only One Responsible Source 
The SnoDragon SND580 is the only snowmelter designed to be towed with a full load of water and fuel. It has been specifically designed to have the capability of being used on the top decks of parking garages. The unique clean out system allows for cleaning of debris without having to drain the water from the hopper. The compact size of this unit fits with the facilities geography in a compact urban setting. Also this is the only US manufactured unit of this type. Parts and service are 
Page 1 of 3 
 
locally available and can be obtained within hours of the need. This is a critical requirement for the Service. It would be an undue burden to impose delays for parts and service coming from Canada during a snow emergency 
6.	Description of Efforts Made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as deemed practicable: Market research shows that there are no other US manufacturers of a comparable unit. Internet research located a Canadian company (Trecan) that manufacturers a unit with the same capabilities. 
7.	Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable: Trecan is a large business in Canada. Their pricing for a comparable unit is also $185,000. However, the Government will incur additional shipping charges estimated to be around $4,000. No other sources of this type of equipment were located. In accordance with FAR 13.106-3, pricing for this unit is deemed fair and reasonable based upon the market research conducted and identified in this paragraph. 
8.	Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results. or a Statement of the Reasons Market Research Was Not Conducted: Internet searches were conducted and only one other unit with the specific characteristics could be found. Most units are either permanently installed in or above ground or are too large and heavy to be used in parking garages. A large business in Canada sells the only other comparable unit at the same price. 
9.	Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition: Sourcing to a small business in the US is preferable to sourcing to a large business in Canada. Additionally, there is an added burden when parts and service are required. Inclement weather emergencies will not provide time for parts and service to be handled from Canada. If equipment is purchased from the US company, service and parts are local (Worcester MA). 
10.  Listing of Sources that Expressed. in Writing. an Interest in the Acquisition: See Section VI above. 
11.	A Statement of the Actions. if any. the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome any Barriers to Competition before Making subsequent acquisitions for the supplies or services required: The agency does not plan to purchase more than a single unit.

<DESC>The Joint Multinational training center acquired an additional area of responsibility which does not have an electronic access control system.  A previous contract was established in Sept 2010 which was installed with Hirsch components.  To ensure compatibility with the current access control system already in place at another building which ties into one central control station, only Hirsch can satisfy this requirement.  The central controller must be able to communicate with the access control entry points of both buildings.  Due to the proprietary nature of the Hirsch system, only another Hirsch system can tie into the central controller.  Therefore, a sole source requirement was submitted and approved for the purchase of Hirsch electronic thereby limiting competition.

<DESC>Military Post Office (MPO) located in Vicenza Italy, submitted a sole source requirement for the purchase of upgrading an already in place UPS trackpad equipment and software licensing.  Market research was conducted to determine whether there were other sources that provided postal operations tracking systems.  Although other sources are capable of providing mail room tracking systems, the UPS Trackpad is the only source compatible with the already existing tracking system that the MPO already has in place.  A sole source justification was submitted and approved for the purchase of UPS Trackpad software thereby limiting competition.

<DESC>LIMITED SOURCES JUSTIFICATION
<p>This acquisition is conducted under the authority of the Multiple Award Schedule Program FAR 8.401 and is justified by the following facts and rationale required under FAR 8.405-6 (c) (1) and (2) as follows:</p>
<p>(1)  Agency and Contracting Activity.</p>
<p>United States Agency for International Development (USAID)<br />Management Bureau (M)<br />Chief Information Office (CIO)<br />Data Management (DM)</p>
<p>(2)  Nature and/or description of the action being approved.</p>
<p>A ten and one half (10.5) month extension of Database and Tools Management task order.   The modification to the current task order will ensure no break in services and prevent degradation of quality of day-to-day operations currently being provided.  This extension will allow the Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO) sufficient time to compete and award a follow-on contract. The current task order expires on August 16, 2011.</p>
<p>Contractor:<br />AINS, Inc.<br />806 W. Diamond Ave<br />Suite 400<br />Gaithersburg, MD 20878</p>
<p>(3)  Description of Supplies/Services.</p>
<p>The Database and Tools Management task order supports and maintains over 220 databases for worldwide corporate applications, providing functionality for accounting, human resource, acquisition, assistance, and security applications to 7500 users in 81 Missions and AID/Washington.  USAID also provides global support for tools used to maintain and report on analytical and text-based data stored in USAID corporate applications, as well as maintain existing data-sharing capabilities among USAID corporate applications and applications external to the agency.  In addition, successful task order award will enable the continued support required to process data for all new system developments at USAID-including Phoenix, GLAS, JAMS, and Faith-Based Community Initiatives Reporting.    The value of the extension is estimated to be $6,368,257.</p>
<p><br />(4)  Authority and supporting rationale.</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR 8.405-6 (a) (1) (i),* <br />* (C) In the interest of economy and efficiency, the new work is a logical follow-on to an original Federal Supply Schedule order that was placed in accordance with the applicable Federal Supply Schedule ordering procedures.  If the task order expires prior to award and successful transition of operations to the new contract mechanism, the OCIO will be unable to provide essential Information Technology (IT) services. These mission critical services include: support and maintenance to over 220 databases for worldwide corporate applications, providing functionality for accounting, human resource, acquisition, assistance, and security applications to 7500 users in 81 Missions and AID/Washington.</p>
<p><br />(5)  Determination by the ordering activity Contracting Officer that the order represents the best value consistent with 8.404(d).</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer has determined that issuing the proposed task order extension to AINS to continue this effort represents the best value and will result in the lowest overall cost alternative, considering price and administrative costs, to meet the Government's needs.  This extension will be placed in accordance with FAR 8.404 - Use of Federal Supply Schedules.  GSA has already negotiated fair and reasonable pricing.  Prior to issuance of the extension, the ordering activity will consider the level of effort and the mix of labor proposed to perform the specific task being ordered, and for determining that the total price is reasonable.</p>
<p>(6)  A description of the market research conducted among schedule holders and the results or a statement of the reason market research was not conducted.</p>
<p>No market research was conducted.  However, as described in this memorandum, AINS has provided mission critical services including: support and maintenance to over 220 databases for worldwide corporate applications, providing functionality for accounting, human resource, acquisition, assistance, and security applications to 7500 users in 81 Missions and AID/Washington.  It is not feasible to change firms at this time since a follow-on mechanism is not in place.</p>
<p>(7)  Any other facts supporting the justification.</p>
<p>A sources sought noticed was released in March 2011 to determine availability and capabilities of firms under the GSA IT Schedule 70 capable of providing the follow-on activities sought by the OCIO.  The agency's Small Business Office in conjunction with the Small Business Administration subsequently halted the procurement sighting that the OCIO did not specify that preference would be given to Small Businesses.  Thus, an unforeseen delay in awarding the follow-on mechanism(s) has occurred. At this time, the OCIO's current acquisition schedule anticipates master vehicle(s) award(s) in the first or second quarter of Fiscal Year (FY) 2012; with initial task orders competed and awarded by the second or third quarter of FY 2012.</p>
<p>(8)  A statement of actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers that led to the restricted consideration before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies for services is made.</p>
<p>The purpose of the extension is to ensure that the critical services performed on this task order continue without interruption until the follow-on mechanisms are competed and awarded.</p>
<p>(9)  Contracting Officer's Certification.</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR 8.405-6(c)(2)(ix), I certify that the justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.</p>

These applications include:  Clearance Record Information System, Employee Information Management System, Financial Disclosure Tracking System, Inventory Management System, Documentum, WebPASS, Time and Attendance, Partner Vetting System, and other small and new implemented applications.

<p>(1)  Agency and Contracting Activity.</p>
<p>United States Agency for International Development (USAID)<br />Management Bureau (M)<br />Chief Information Office (CIO)<br />Business Systems Engineering (BSE)</p>
<p>(2)  Nature and/or description of the action being approved.</p>
<p>A ten and one half (10.5) month extension of Global Acquisition and Assistance System (GLAAS) deployment, operational, helpdesk services and training support services task order.   <br />The modification to the current task order will ensure no break in services and prevent degradation of quality of day-to-day operations currently being provided.  This extension will allow the Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO) sufficient time to compete and award a follow-on contract. The current task order expires on August 16, 2011.</p>
<p>Contractor:<br />Development InfoStructure, Inc. (Devis)<br />2101 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 300<br />Arlington, Virginia 22201</p>
<p>(3)  Description of Supplies/Services.</p>
<p>The GLAAS Project deployment is a few months from completion, per the established Deployment Schedule.  By June 27, 2011, GLAAS will be fully deployed to all but two USAID Missions - USAID/Afghanistan and USAID/Haiti - due to reasons beyond the control of the GLAAS Project Team. The proposed extension will not only support the final deployments to the USAID Missions in Afghanistan and Haiti by providing critical deployment expertise, training and other support services, but will also support  the end of fiscal year operations and transition to the O&amp;M "steady state". Once fully deployed, GLAAS will manage all aspects of the Agency's Acquisition and Assistance (A&amp;A) function.  The value of the extension is estimated to be $6,668,786.</p>
<p><br />(4)  Authority and supporting rationale.</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR 8.405-6 (a) (1) (i),* <br />* (C) This new work is a logical follow-on to an original Federal Supply Schedule order  and extends the period of performance for work that remains outstanding to completely deploy the Global Acquisition and Assistance System to USAID worldwide to the  remaining two USAID performance management focus missions.</p>
<p>Devis has been providing deployment, operational, helpdesk and training support services to 79 of 81 USAID Missions through follow-on award.  We will complete deployment and post-production support to all Missions in Calendar Year 11 (CY11).    The Contractor provides expertise and skilled resources in deployment, data migration, implementation, help-desk and training necessary for the deployment of GLAAS to Afghanistan and Haiti and its integration with the Agency's financial system.</p>
<p>USAID relies on the Contractor to provide subject matter expertise in variable mixes of labor in the deployment, operational helpdesk and training areas. Changing out of personnel so close to project completion would cause loss of critical knowledge of the GLAAS environment, customer's environments, USAID business processes, policies and procedures. It will result in delays in fully deploying GLAAS to Afghanistan and Haiti in CY11.  A major change at this juncture would require an additional transition phase, which would increase overall costs of the project. Many tasks performed under this project are temporary in nature, and will no longer be needed once GLAAS is fully deployed.  Extending the Devis contract period of performance is the most expedient and cost effective way to complete the project.  Devis will also support the end of fiscal year operations and transition to the O&amp;M "steady state". Once fully deployed, GLAAS will transparently and effectively manage all aspects of the Agency's Acquisition and Assistance (A&amp;A) function.</p>
<p><br />(5)  Determination by the ordering activity Contracting Officer that the order represents the best value consistent with 8.404(d).</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer has determined that issuing the proposed task order extension to Devis to continue this effort represents the best value and will result in the lowest overall cost alternative, considering price and administrative costs, to meet the Government's needs.  This extension will be placed in accordance with FAR 8.404 - Use of Federal Supply Schedules.  GSA has already negotiated fair and reasonable pricing.  Prior to issuance of the extension, the ordering activity will consider the level of effort and the mix of labor proposed to perform the specific task being ordered, and for determining that the total price is reasonable.</p>
<p>(6)  A description of the market research conducted among schedule holders and the results or a statement of the reason market research was not conducted.</p>
<p>No market research was conducted.  However, as described in this memorandum, Devis has provided deployment, data migration, helpdesk and operational support through the full rollout of the GLAAS deployment.  Use of another firm this close to successful completion of worldwide deployment presents an enormous risk to the project.   Changing resources at this crucial point of time, while GLAAS is near the end of worldwide deployment, would result in an increased cost to the Government because of the additional transition time that would be required to bring a new contractor up to speed on all the details involved in deploying a complex A&amp;A system in overseas environments complicated by security and other issues.  Once GLAAS is fully deployed, it will move into Operations and Maintenance (O&amp;M) status and the need for a discrete GLAAS contractor to perform deployment services will no longer be required.</p>
<p>(7)  Any other facts supporting the justification.</p>
<p>A sources sought noticed was released in March 2011 to determine availability and capabilities of firms under the GSA IT Schedule 70 capable of providing the follow-on activities sought by the OCIO.  The agency's Small Business Office in conjunction with the Small Business Administration subsequently halted the procurement sighting that the OCIO did not specify that preference would be given to Small Businesses. At this time, the OCIO's current acquisition schedule anticipates master vehicle(s) award(s) in the first or second quarter of Fiscal Year (FY) 2012; with initial task orders competed and awarded by the second or third quarter of FY 2012.</p>
<p>(8)  A statement of actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers that led to the restricted consideration before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies for services is made.</p>
<p>The purpose of the extension is to ensure that the critical services performed on this task order continue without interruption until the follow-on mechanisms are competed and awarded.</p>
<p>(9)  Contracting Officer's Certification.</p>

<DESC>This acquisition is conducted under the authority of the Multiple Award Schedule Program FAR 8.401 and is justified by the following facts and rationale required under FAR 8.405-6 (c) (1) and (2) as follows:
<p>(1)  Agency and Contracting Activity.</p>
<p>United States Agency for International Development (USAID)<br />Management Bureau (M)<br />Chief Information Office (CIO)<br />Information Technology Operations and Maintenance (IOM)</p>
<p>(2)  Nature and/or description of the action being approved.</p>
<p>A nine and one half (9.5) month extension of Information Technology Operations and Maintenance (IOM) Telecommunications and System Infrastructure (TSI) Support Services task order.  The modification to the current task order will ensure no break in services and prevent degradation of quality of day-to-day operations currently being provided.  This extension will allow the Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO) sufficient time to compete and award a follow-on contract. The current task order expires on September 14, 2011.</p>
<p>Contractor:<br />Computer Sciences Corporation.<br />15000 Conference Center Drive<br />Chantilly, VA 20151</p>
<p><br />(3)  Description of Supplies/Services.</p>
<p>The TSI task order supports USAID's operation of the Agency's world-wide IT network including the IT help desk, managing Agency desktops, E-mail and office automation software, application servers, and telecommunications network.  The value of the extension is estimated to be $23,000,000.</p>
<p><br />(4)  Authority and supporting rationale.</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR 8.405-6 (a) (1) (i),*<br />* (C) In the interest of economy and efficiency, the new work is a logical follow-on to an original Federal Supply Schedule order that was placed in accordance with the applicable Federal Supply Schedule ordering procedures.  If the task order expires prior to award and successful transition of operations to the new contract mechanism, the OCIO will be unable to provide essential Information Technology (IT) services. These mission critical services include: operation of the Agency's world-wide IT network including the IT help desk, managing Agency desktops, E-mail and office automation software, application servers, and telecommunications network.</p>
<p>(5)  Determination by the ordering activity Contracting Officer that the order represents the best value consistent with 8.404(d).</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer has determined that issuing the proposed task order extension to CSC to continue this effort represents the best value and will result in the lowest overall cost alternative, considering price and administrative costs, to meet the Government's needs.  This extension will be placed in accordance with FAR 8.404 - Use of Federal Supply Schedules.  GSA has already negotiated fair and reasonable pricing.  Prior to issuance of the extension, the ordering activity will consider the level of effort and the mix of labor proposed to perform the specific task being ordered, and for determining that the total price is reasonable.</p>
<p>(6)  A description of the market research conducted among schedule holders and the results or a statement of the reason market research was not conducted.</p>
<p>No market research was conducted.  However, as described in this memorandum, CSC has provided mission critical services including: operation of the Agency's world-wide IT network including the IT help desk, managing Agency desktops, E-mail and office automation software, application servers, and telecommunications network.</p>
<p>(7)  Any other facts supporting the justification.</p>
<p>A sources sought notice was released in March 2011 to determine availability and capabilities of firms under the GSA IT Schedule 70 capable of providing the follow-on activities sought by the OCIO.  Due to an unforeseen delay in awarding the follow-on mechanism(s), at this time, the OCIO's current acquisition schedule anticipates master vehicle(s) award(s) in the first or second quarter of Fiscal Year (FY) 2012; with initial task orders competed and awarded by the second or third quarter of FY 2012.</p>
<p>(8)  A statement of actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers that led to the restricted consideration before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies for services is made.</p>
<p>The purpose of the extension is to ensure that the critical services performed on this task order continue without interruption until the follow-on mechanisms are competed and awarded.</p>
<p>(9)  Contracting Officer's Certification.</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR 8.405-6(c)(2)(ix), I certify that the justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.</p>
