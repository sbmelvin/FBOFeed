<DESC>In accordance with AMS 3.2.1.2.1 of the Federal Aviation Administration Acquisition Management System (FAA AMS), industry is hereby notified that the FAA intends to extend the period of performance of contract DTFA01-03-C-00094 for a maximum of seven years, at an estimated cost of $1.5 million.  The purpose of this survey is to determine if any other vendors exist who can provide the services described in the Statement of Work (SOW).  This is not a solicitation and as such does not constitute a Request for Proposal, nor does it restrict the Government as to its ultimate acquisition approach.  The Government will not reimburse any costs for providing information, documentation, and or data submitted or preparation costs for submittals in response to this notice.
The FAA Terminal Automation Group has a requirement to continue second level engineering support services to sites currently hosting the IDS-4 workstations. The FAA intends to award a contract to replace 2,230 IDS-4 workstations at all existing IDS-4 locations some time during CY 2009.  Solicitation DTFAWA-09-R-00462 is expected to be awarded as that contract.  
Systems Atlanta Incorporated (SAI) designed, integrated, installed and currently maintains IDS-4 and owns all proprietary data rights.  Services currently provided under the host contract include support sustainment, network reconfiguration, software upgrade, general support and site support.  The intent of this agency is to decrease the amount of support services needed as the number of replacement systems are deployed to the field sites.   
 This survey is to solicit statements of capabilities from all interested vendors.  Furthermore, this survey will aid the FAA in its determination as to whether or not adequate competition exists. In order to make this determination the FAA requires the following information from interested vendors:
a)	Capabilities Statement - A Capabilities Statement which demonstrates the vendor's ability to provide the services in the attached SOW.  This includes the vendor's ability to provide and maintain appropriate levels of experienced and qualified personnel capable of supporting existing IDS-4 workstations. b)	Prior Experience with IDS-4 - For at least three past or current contracts for work similar in scope and complexity to that described in the attached SOW, vendors must demonstrate in narrative form (not brochures or catalogs), direct and recent experience and capabilities with the services and requirements of the SOW.  
c)	Business Declaration - Vendors must complete and submit the attached Business Declaration form.
The primary North American Industry Classification System Code (NAIC) for this requirement is 541511 Custom Computer Programming Services.  Inclusive of the three items above, responses should not exceed 10 pages in length and all proprietary information should be clearly marked in the responses.  Responses should be submitted no later than February 27, 2009, to Curtis Fields via e-mail at curtis.fields@faa.gov.  They may also be provided via express mail to the following address:

<DESC>In accordance with A.M.S. 3.2.1.3.12 of the Federal Aviation Administration Acquisition Management System (FAAAMS), industry is hereby informed that the FAA has a contract requirement for design and development, integration, and technical support for the fielded IACRA (Integrated Airmen Certification and/or Rating Application) version with digital signature.  The purpose of this market survey is to solicit statements of interest and capabilities from service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses (SDVOSBs), 8(a) certified firms, and small businesses capable of providing the needed design and development, integration, and technical support services.
The primary North American Industry Classification System Code for this requirement is: 541618 Other Management Consulting Services. 
This market survey is to solicit statements of interest and capabilities from interested Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses (SDVOSB) and 8(a) business concerns.  Furthermore, this survey will aid the FAA in its determination as to whether adequate competition exists to set-aside part or all of the competition amongst eligible SDVOSBs or 8(a) business concerns or whether it is more appropriate to conduct this procurement under other small business competition or full and open competition.  This process promotes competition in each tier of small business concerns while still allowing other designated businesses to participate without issuing another market survey. 
The order of precedence for determining the nature of competition in the market survey is outlined below:
(a) Service-Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) and 8(a)
(b) Small Business Concerns
(c) Full and Open Competition
This is not a screening information request or request for proposal of any kind.  The FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals.  Since this is for information and planning purposes, no evaluation letters or results will be issued to respondents.  This notice does not constitute a Request for Proposal, nor does it restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach, nor should it be construed as a commitment by the Government. 
In order to make the above determination the FAA requires the following from interested vendors:
a.	Capabilities Statement (Limited to 10 pages) - Overview description of your company's capabilities to provide the services described in the attached draft SOW.   b.	Programmatic Approach (Limited to 20 pages) - Vendors should discuss their expected programmatic approach to successfully providing these services.  This includes discussion of potential teaming and subcontracting arrangements.  If respondent is an eligible 8(a) certified business or other small business, provide a strategy in terms of percentage of work to be completed by the 8(a) or small business respondent. 
c.	Prior Experience (no page limitation)- For at least three past or current contracts for work similar in scope and complexity to that described in the attached draft SOW, vendors should demonstrate in narrative form (not brochures or catalogs), direct and recent experience and capabilities with the services and requirements of the draft SOW.  Experience three years or older will not be regarded as current.  Vendors should identify the government or commercial entity for which work was performed, provide the contract number and value, and provide a description of the work performed.
d.	Comments on Draft SOW - Vendors may provide comments or suggestions regarding the attached draft SOW. 
e.	Business Declaration - Vendors should complete and submit the attached Business Declaration form and a copy of their SBA 8 (a) certification letter, if applicable.
ONLY THOSE VENDORS THAT RESPOND TO THIS MARKET SURVEY ANNOUNCEMENT WILL RECEIVE THE REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL AND BE CONSIDERED FOR AWARD.
All qualified vendors must provide their submission via e-mail no later than 2:00 PM on March 20, 2009.  Submission received after this date will be determined late and will not be considered.  Electronic submission is preferred and should be sent to jacqueline.naranjo@faa.gov.  If necessary hard copies of the market survey response can be mailed to:
Federal Aviation AdministrationATTN: Jacqueline Naranjo, AJA-482800 Independence Avenue, S.W., Room 402Washington, DC 20591(202) 267-3163 (phone) 
The FAA will not pay for any information received or costs incurred in preparing the response to the market survey.  Therefore, any cost associated with the market survey submission is solely at the interested vendor's expense.
Updates to this announcement will be published on the FAA Contract Opportunities website (http://faaco.faa.gov/) under the Current Announcements for FAA Headquarters.   It is the vendor's responsibility to monitor this website for updates to this procurement.

<p style="MARGIN: 0in 0.5in 0pt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The Department of Homeland Security Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Individual Assistance Division (IA) mission is to ensure that individuals and families that have been impacted by disasters and major catastrophic events have access to the full range of FEMA programs in the most expeditious and cost effective manner available. FEMA's goal is to provide the highest level of quality in these services as possible to such individuals. In order to accomplish this goal, FEMA has a requirement for contractors to provide comprehensive emergency management, project management and program management services as well as construction, architectural, and engineering capabilities to support the IA mission in four areas:&nbsp; (a) Housing Support&nbsp; (b) Construction Services, (c) Mass Care, and (d) Planning, Staffing and Logistics Services. Contractor support must be available for multiple disaster missions of any size, anywhere within their awarded regional sector to provide disaster relief services to individuals within the United States and its territories.&nbsp; While these contracts are generally intended to support response to an initial recovery from high impact larger Presidentially-declared Major Disaster related missions, the contracts do not preclude FEMA from contracting with others, such as local or small businesses when market research or available information indicates that such entities have the capacity and capability to meet FEMA's requirement(s). FEMA's Acquisition strategy is to divide the U.S. and it's territories into four regional Sectors as follows:&nbsp; Alpha Sector (FEMA Regions 8, 9 and 10); Bravo Sector (FEMA Regions 1, 2 and 5); Charlie Sector (FEMA Regions 6 and 7); and Delta Sector (FEMA Regions 3 and 4).&nbsp;&nbsp; The solicitation will therefore allow for four (4) separate (single) IDIQ hybrid cost reimbursement, fixed priced, and time and materials contracts to be awarded; and each successful offeror will be assigned responsibility for one of the sectors indicated above. Each contract shall be a five (5) year contract. After the award of the four (4) IDIQ contracts to separate contractors for a determined sector, no further competition for subsequent task orders will take place, unless the Government determines that an awardee cannot perform the services and terminates the contract; the impact of a single disaster/catastrophic event is or becomes so overwhelming that it exceeds the ability, capacity, or capability of a sector awardee in a manner that the sector awardee cannot perform the services in the time and at the quality level and quantity required by the Government: in such a case, the Government reserves the right to compete the task order among the other three (3) awardees to meet the shortfall(s), or conduct an other than full and open competition to award a contract for services in that sector, to one of the other three (3) vendors, in a case where a sector awardee's contract has been terminated. The NAICS code applicable to this solicitation is 561210 Facilities Support Services. The small business size standard is $32.5 million.&nbsp;&nbsp; This requirement will be competed using FAR Part 15 procedures. The Request for proposal is anticipated to be released on February 19, 2009.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Any question regarding this pre-solicitation must be in writing and will be answered during the release of the RFP.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Questions/Answers: contractors shall submit all questions regarding this requirement by email to Zahra Hashmi, the Contract Specialist at <a href="mailto:zahr.hashmi@dhs.gov">zahra.hashmi@dhs.gov</a>, and copy <a href="mailto:charles.clemons@dhs.gov">charles.clemons@dhs.gov</a>.</span></p>

<DESC>NASA/GSFC has a requirement for the development of a high performance linear modeInAIAs avalanche photodiode (APD) arrays  to support the NASA Advanced ComponentTechnology (ACT) Program. The APD detector arrays will be integrated with transimpedanceamplifiers (TIAs) and assembled into receiver arrays. The avalanche photodiode receiverarray shall meet and demonstrate the following technical goals:- Wavelength: 1.06 m- Noise-Equivalent-Power (NEP): 300 fW/square root of Hz- Bandwidth: &gt;1 GHz- Quantum Efficiency: &gt;75%- K-Effective: &lt;0.15- Fill Factor: &gt;70%Beginning with an APD and receiver technology at Technology Readiness Level (TRL) Level2, three years of technical effort are planned. The first year will demonstrate theoptimized individual APD devices with low excess noise and high usable gain. At the endof the second year, the array and the integration with a single TIA will be demonstrated.An integrated microlens technology will be developed in this phase as well. At the end ofthe program, the fully integrated receiver array will be assembled for the ACT program,and the corresponding technology will be promoted to TRL4. The vendor will use an alternative multiplication layer structure to reduce K-Effectiveto &lt;0.15, which is a key requirement for a low-noise APD receiver. The noise from bothAPDs and TIAs are critical to the overall receiver NEP, so the careful matching of thetwo components and shielding of the external noise are extremely important to achieve thevery low NEP specification.The major objectives of this effort are to improve the performance of present linear-modeAPD arrays operating at 1.06 m, improve the quantum efficiency, reduce the NEP and darkcurrent, maintain a bandwidth no less than 1 GHz, integrate the APD array with TIAs, andfinally advance the optical detector array technology to TRL4. NASA/GSFC intends to issue a Request for Proposal No. NNG09282670R on a sole-source basisto Spectrolab, Inc. The authority of Other than Full and Open Competition is 10 U.S.C.2304(c)(1), Only one Responsible Source.Spectrolab, Inc. is the only commercial supplier of devices with the  InGaAs/InAlAsdevice structure and is the only available source that is able to develop photodiodedetectors with the following capabilities: High quantum-efficiency (&gt; 75%); Highbandwidth (1 GHz); Low temperature sensitivity; Low bias voltage (&lt; 50 V); Low-noiseperformance (ionization coefficient less than 0.3); Sensitive at the 1064 nm wavelength.The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOLE / SINGLE SOURCE, NON-COMPETITIVE NOTICE.   This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. This sole / single source, non-competitive notice is prepared in accordance FAR Parts 5 and 13.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.   FAR Part 6  Competition Requirements, is not applicable to contracts awarded using the simplified acquisition procedures of FAR Part 13, not expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.      

This announcement constitutes the only notice; proposals are not being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.   

The resultant acquisition will be conducted in accordance with FAR Part 13, simplified acquisition procedures and the resultant purchase order will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-29.

The total estimated amount of this contract is NOT expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold of $100,000.00. 

The intended procurement will be classified under North American Industry Classification System code 541720 with size standard of $7.0M.

Market Research conducted by the Government in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 10, has determined that the sole /single source reference is currently the only company that can provide the services / items specified herein.

THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH (NIH), National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), Office of Acquisition (OA) for the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research(NIDCR)  intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a sole source noncompetitive basis to Beverly Handelman, 14317 Cantrell Road, Silver Spring, Md 20905 to provide her expertise and knowledge  of the current studies in patients suffering from Sjogrens syndrome to the Molecular Physiology and Therapeutics Branch for NIDCR. These studies are covered under NIDCR protocols 84-D-0056, 94-D-0018, 99-D-0070 and ASP-07-417.  

The specific tasks to be performed are to prepare and analyze samples from Sjogrens patients or test animals for the presence of neutralizing antibodies to different sterotypes of AAV vectors and to produce recombinant stocks of vectors as outlined in the statement of work.

The sole source determination is based upon the fact that Beverly Handelman has 20 years of experience in the field of molecular biology performing tissue culture and virus production.   She has an extensive background in both AAV and Adenovirus production and has co-authored 8 articles in peer reviewed scientific journals.

This position was advertised on the NIH Office of Education website and several candidates were invited to interview for the position but none fit the requirements. 

Therefore an award to any other source is not feasible or practical. The contract will be awarded using the simplified acquisition procedures of FAR Part 13 - Simplified Acquisition Procedures, therefore the requirements of FAR Part 6 - Competitive Requirements are not applicable (FAR Part 6.001). 

Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit a response.   This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  Responses to this announcement, referencing synopsis number NHLBI-PB-(DE)-2009-092-TMB may be submitted to the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, Office of Acquisitions, Procurement Branch, 6701 Rockledge Drive, Suite 6042, Bethesda, MD 20892-7902, Attention: Tracy Brooks.  Responses may be submitted electronically to brookstr@nhlbi.nih.gov   Responses will only be accepted if dated and signed by an authorized company representative.  

A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The National Institute of Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) intends to issue a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) entitled Mechanisms of Behavior Change Initiation (MOBCI) for Drinking Behavior.  NIAAA is soliciting proposals for new, high risk approaches to traditionally intractable alcohol-related problems through the development of mechanism-based strategies that induce maladaptive drinkers to initiate and sustain a change from maladaptive drinking behaviors towards more healthful drinking behaviors.  NIAAA is looking for opportunities that will result in entirely new or quantum improvements in both the theory and methodologies used to understand how to induce sustainable, positive change in maladaptive drinkers.  Although the long-term goal of this initiative is to develop strategies for sustained, positive drinking behavior change, this BAA focuses on the initiation of change as an initial step towards this goal.  However, if suitably justified, this BAA does not discourage proposals that incorporate theory and approaches that looking at both initiation and maintenance of positive drinking behavior change.

This BAA is soliciting proposals for two types of projects, denoted by Category A: MOBCI Research Projects and Category B: MOBCI Coordinating Center. 

Category A: MOBCI Research Projects.  The present BAA is soliciting proposals for innovative, foundational, systems-oriented research aimed at diagnostically relevant, quantitative, mechanism-based, dynamical models of drinking behavior. The purpose of this BAA is to inform the design of strategies to cause initiation of sustainable, positive drinking behavior change.  Of particular interest is breakthrough research that uncovers and explicates the mechanisms and associated controllable variables underlying such change, at the following three levels of observation and analysis: 

           Neurophysiologic factors: individual neurophysiology and relevant biology,

           Intrapersonal (e.g., cognitive, psychological, affective and behavioral) factors, and 

           Immediate interpersonal factors: individual immediate social ecology (e.g., family, friends).

Multi-level, multi-scale mechanisms are an emphasis area for this BAA.

Category B: MOBCI Coordinating Center.  In order to accomplish MOBCIs goals, NIAAA expects that there will be a need to support the incorporation and use of advanced analytic and modeling methods among Category A projects.  The transdisciplinary integration of existing and new databases is of particular note in this context.  NIAAA seeks to actively foster collaboration and sharing of approaches and data sources in order to enhance both the immediate success of all participants and the long-term contributions of MOBCI.  Hence, Category B calls for proposals that would provide significant collaboration, archival, integration, and analysis services for the Category A projects. 

NIAAA anticipates awarding multiple contracts based on technical merit, availability of funds, and programmatic balance.  NOTES:  (1) In contracts awarded as a result of this BAA, the Statement of Work will be proposed by the offeror and negotiated and accepted by the Government.  (2)  NIAAA anticipates that any contracts awarded as a result of this BAA will be funded in accordance with the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA).

<DESC>The Department of Homeland Security, Science and Technology Directorate, intends to award a contract on a sole-source basis for an assessment and report on the Continuation of the exhalation of aerosols from monkeys infected with Monkeypox virus. The authority for this sole source award is FAR 6.302-1 - there is only one source that can provide these services and products to DHS. The contract will be awarded to Lovelace Respiratory Research Institute (LRRI) of 2425 Ridgecrest Dr. SE
Albuquerque, NM 87108-5127. Award of this report to another firm would result in the needless replication of laboratory results, concurrent monetary inefficiencies, and the morally problematic consequence of needlessly infecting more monkeys with this virus. The period of performance for this requirement is from the award date through September 30, 2009. The deliverable under this contract is a report that will finalize evaluation data and provide final assessment of exhalation aerosol from monkeys infected by an aerosol route with Monkeypox. This notice is NOT a solicitation for proposals or quotations; however, any entity that believes it has the expertise and licensure necessary to perform the required services may submit a letter via e-mail to the Contracting Officer identifying their interest in the requirement and their capabilities. The determination to compete this procurement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer.

<DESC>This program solicitation is for small businesses only pursuant to the Small Business Innovation Development Act of 1982 (PL 97-219, as amended by PL 106-554).  Phase I is to determine, insofar as possible, the scientific, technical, and commercial merit and feasibility of ideas submitted under the SBIR Program.  Phase I awards do not exceed $150,000 in cost nor extend beyond a six-month period of performance.  Proposals should concentrate on that research or research and development (R/R&D) which will significantly contribute to proving the scientific, technical, and commercial feasibility of the proposed effort, the successful completion of which is a prerequisite for further DHS/DNDO support in Phase II.  Several different proposed solutions to a given topic may be funded.  The measure of Phase I success includes evaluations of the extent to which Phase II results would have the potential to yield a product or process of continuing importance to DHS/DNDO and/or the private sector.  Offerors are encouraged to consider whether the research or research and development they are proposing to DHS/DNDO also has private sector potential, either for the proposed application or as a base for other applications.

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSAL
This is a notice of intent to issue an order to General Dynamics Information Technology, Inc., 3211 Jermantown Rd, Fairfax, VA 22030-2844, on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements, 10 U.S.C. 2304(d)(1) (Sole Source J & A attached).  The proposed procurement is to provide high-quality information technology, engineering, and development services to support OASD/PA and DMAs mission requirements for communicating with various audiences using DefenseLINK.mil, the official home page of the U.S. Department of Defense, and other Internet technologies.  Services include managing content on DefenseLINK.mil and associated sites; providing multimedia and graphic design development for DefenseLINK and other Defense Department sites, such as DotMilDocs and DoD Bloggers Roundtable; providing evaluative services for Emerging Media technologies and tools to be used by DoD; and responding to public queries submitted through DefenseLINK and through automated methods.  Rationale for sole source:  This sole source procurement is needed to eliminate disruption in services and unacceptable delays in fulfilling agencys requirements.  DefenseLINK receives more than 19 million unique visitors a year, therefore, it is mission critical to ensure continuity of this service requirement is not disrupted.  This is a temporary requirement (4 month bridge contract) to maintain current capability for this support until a follow-on contract for continued provisions of high-quality information technology, engineering, and development services can be fully competed to award a new contract, and will no longer be required when a replacement contract capability is fully competed and awarded.  Written response should be submitted within 15 days of this publication of notice.  Written response can be faxed to (951) 413-2432 or Email to bernice.homan@dma.mil.

<DESC>USAID/Peru will be implementing a program with the overall general purpose of helping to reduce poverty in targeted areas of Peru through trade-led growth. This activity focuses on linking micro, small, and medium sized enterprises (MSMEs) to new markets where Peruvian businesses potentially can be competitive. The recently signed U.S.-Peru Trade Promotion Agreement (PTPA), for example, will provide thousands of MSMEs a competitive advantage over MSMEs in other countries for lucrative U.S. markets. It is designed to build on the success of the previous ten year program, implemented by Chemonics International, but it also seeks to align with regional economic development initiatives implemented by the Government of Peru and Regional Governments. The objectives of this activity are to: (1) Expand the ESC model in the impoverished Sierra Departments of Peru to improve the competitiveness of MSMEs; (2) Create strategic public-private partnerships to reduce poverty through trade-led growth; and (3) Increase private and public investments in infrastructure and business development services to support market-led economic activities in the targeted regions.

Sources must have the capability to fulfill the overall goal of the potential contract to conduct KT/Implementation activities so that selected target audiences put AHRQs products, tools, and research into practice. The contractor needs to provide a broad array of support services based on AHRQ needs.   

AHRQs Knowledge Transfer/Implementation program is intended to accelerate the implementation of AHRQs evidence based products, tools and research findings into the health care system.  AHRQ has identified the key groups that will be targeted as candidates for actual implementation of its products, tools and research findings and has been developing strategies that assist key target audiences to implement those research findings that hold the most promise to their respective organizations.

AHRQs KT/Implementation projects will reflect the mission and policy emphases of AHRQ. The nature of the products used and the complexity of the health issues to be addressed will directly impact project strategy, tactics and time lines. Tactics used in current projects include, but are not limited to, personal contact with a specific target audience by phone or e-mail; on-going follow up; cold calls as necessary; webinars or teleconferences with AHRQ staff, grantees or contractors serving as knowledge experts to explain a specific piece of AHRQ research; one on one technical assistance; group technical assistance; on-going contacts with target audiences to facilitate actual use of AHRQ research; speaking engagements by AHRQ staff at meetings of key organizations; learning networks composed of different organizations to contribute to the actual use of AHRQ research; and partnerships with key organizations to disseminate and help implement AHRQ research with an organizations membership.

Over the past several years, AHRQ has focused more on producing impact from its evidence based research findings - encouraging target audiences to put research findings into practice rather than simply disseminating or transferring information.

	To provide feedback to AHRQ regarding the successes and barriers that these target audiences are experiencing in implementing AHRQ materials. 
	To give feedback to AHRQ about the kinds of research the target audience needs to provide high quality care. 
	To develop impact case studies showing how target audiences have actually disseminated and implemented specific products. 
 
Organizations should demonstrate their expertise in marketing products to specific target audiences, particularly consumers,, clinicians, health care decision makers, and policy makers, including personal, one on one technical assistance and follow up. 

Specifically, organizations must be knowledgeable in tactics that include, but are not limited to, personal contact with a specific target audience by phone or e-mail; on-going follow up; cold calls as necessary; webinars or teleconferences that explain a specific piece of research; one on one technical assistance; group technical assistance; on-going contacts with target audiences to facilitate actual use of research; speaking engagements by staff at meetings of key organizations; learning networks composed of different organizations to contribute to the actual use of research; and partnerships with key organizations to disseminate and help implement research  with an organizations membership. 

Key staff at the Project Director level should hold, at a minimum, a graduate degree in the health care or communications field and have extensive experience in program management. An understanding of knowledge transfer research and implementation is necessary.
  
Key staff shall demonstrate total work experience which includes:

It is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  A contract may not be awarded as a result of this sources sought.  <BR><BR>The US Army Contracting Agency, Contracting Center of Excellence (CCE), on behalf of the Office of the Chief of Staff of the Army / Enterprise Task Force (OCSA/ETF), is seeking contract support for the Lean Six Sigma continuous process improvement effort.  The Department of the Army (DA) recognizes the need to incorporate the most current business practices to reduce cycle times, improve productivity, reduce the cost of doing business, and to develop these skills and tools in the Army workforce.  This requirement will include DA Lean Six Sigma (LSS) Continuous Process Improvement (CPI) deployment consultation, Master Black Belt project work as the lead in enterprise-wide projects, project coaching, training that leads to certification within a prescribed timeline for Green Belt, Black Belt and or Master Black Belt Projects, and implementation and sustainment support towards the goal of the Army becoming self-sustaining.  CCE intends to procure these services as either small business set-aside or under full and open procedures.  Only small businesses are to submit capability packages in response to this request.  Interested small businesses that are certified and qualified as a small business concern under NAICS code 541614 with a size standard of $7 million are encouraged to submit their capability packages.  Capability packages must not exceed ten pages and shall be submitted electronically via email.  Small businesses are to outline their experience in the following key areas or tasks.

That is to say  experience falling in on an existing system and providing expertise within its frame work rather than imposing your own familiar methodologies and frame work.<BR><BR>* The Army currently supports over 30 commands and organizations around the world with deployment advisors and belt coaches/mentors.   Demonstrate the ability to staff up to 30 commands simultaneously with deployment advisors and belt coaches/mentors.<BR><BR>* Demonstrate the ability to fall in on an already mature LSS deployment framework particularly with mature and established Programs of Instruction without attempting to reinventing the wheel.<BR><BR>* Development and maintenance of portals, websites and sub-sites to include all data sets and applications.<BR><BR>The following questions shall also be addressed in addition to the capability package:<BR><BR>1. Typically, the Government attempts to provide a minimum of at least 21 days notification prior to performance.  However, the Government may require sufficient resources of on-site personnel within a 2-week window anywhere in the Active Army, Army Reserves or Army National Guard locations.  What limitations or constraints do you foresee with this approach to support the mission of the Program Management Office to deploy LSS?<BR><BR>2. What level of capability exists in your company to provide a cadre of individuals with SECRET security clearances for both OCONUS and CONUS efforts to include, but not limited to, Europe, Japan, Korea, Iraq, Kuwait and Afghanistan?<BR><BR>3. What experience and tools have you employed to implement the DMAIC methodology? (Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control)  Is this methodology consistent with industry standards? Is it flexible enough to morph into the Armys existing DMAIC framework and well thought out and established set of standards?  <BR><BR>4. What is your capacity to fall in on an existing training program and train up to 15 simultaneous LSS classes that include Green Belt, Black Belt, Master Black Belt, Project Sponsor Workshops and Executive Level Workshops?  What approach do you use and is it industry standard?  Can you demonstrate that you can join an already existing mature program and train it with out trying to move the Army to your existing training programs and work within the Armys framework towards achieving a cadre of enterprise level trained capability of CPI professionals?  The Army is not looking for a new approach to training. Ultimately, we are looking for a company to take the existing programs of instruction and train them. <BR><BR>5. What qualification standards do you use to qualify your personnel as Black Belts and Master Black Belts?  <BR><BR>6. What is your management process and oversight plan for both staff and sub-contractors?<BR><BR>7. What is the largest and most complex enterprise level LSS CPI effort you have engaged in terms of scope and level of effort?   <BR><BR>8. How you define an LSS CPI Enterprise-level effort in terms of scope, complexity, level of effort, varying propensities to employ the DMAIC methodology, etc?<BR><BR>If at least two responsible small business concerns are determined by the Government to be capable of performing this requirement based on an evaluation of the capability packages submitted by 12:00 PM EST on Thursday, 12 March 2009, the requirement will be solicited as a 100 percent set-aside for small business concerns.

<CONTACT>Sarah Littleton, Contracts Specialist, Phone (301) 757-7111, Email sarah.littleton@navy.mil
<DESC>This announcement constitutes a Request for Information (RFI).  This is NOT a Request for Proposal.  The intent of this RFI is to assist the Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) in conducting market research to identify potential sources of Communications Systems to replace the existing AN/ARQ-34A HF Radio Communications Set and associated equipment in the E-2C Hawkeye 2000 aircraft.  The replacement HF Radio Communications Set should satisfy the legacy system operational modes and requirements stated in this RFI.  Strong consideration will be given to the replacement set that will satisfy the potential upgrades requirements stated in this RFI as well. 


Legacy System Components:
The current ARQ-34A HF radio consists of the following:
	Antenna Coupler
	Radio Set Control
	Radio RCV/XMTRR
	Amplifier Power Assembly
	Band Pass Filter
	Data Terminal Set Electrical Equipment Rack
	Control Converter
Associated equipment consists of:
	HF Volume Control
	Control Indicator
	Low Pass Filter
	Fixed Wire Antenna
The control indicator and low pass filter are Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) all other components are Contractor Furnished Equipment (CFE). 

Configuration Options:
Replacement options requested are for a direct (no modification to aircraft wiring) and replacement system (wiring changes allowed) in the following configurations:
1)	ARQ-34A direct replacement for complete system (antenna included)
2)	ARQ-34A direct system replacement without antenna (50 ohm input impedance nominal)
3)	Direct replacement for ARQ-34A control head and power amplifier only geared towards an eventual total system replacement
4)	ARQ-34 complete  replacement system 

Operational Modes:
Clear Voice
Secure Voice
Advance Narrow Band Digital Voice (ANDVT)
Link 11

Operational Requirements:
When used in conjunction with associated weapons replaceable assemblies (WRAS), the HF radio provide a means of conducting two-way voice communication and Link 11 Data operation. Data operation and voice communication may be conducted at the same time, or the HF radios may be used for voice communication exclusively, at the sacrifice of HF radio data transmission and reception. The operational frequency range is between 2.0000 and 29.9999MHz. The HF radio may be operated on either the upper sideband (USB), lower sideband (LSB), or on both sidebands simultaneously. The latter mode of operation is known as the diversity (DIV) mode and is confined to Link 11 transmission and reception only.


Potential Upgrades:
Simultaneous secure voice and data transmit receive. Capable of supporting MIRC Airborne chat program links air, land operators in real time. Operation supports simultaneous operation of secure voice and MIRC or Link 11 and MIRC.  Options to achieve additional performance can include but are not limited to additional channels, or the addition of a separate radio.

Facilities requirements:
Power available is 400 Hz three phase and 28 VDC. 

RFI Responses:
Responses to this RFI are requested by 20 March 2009 and should include:
1.  A summary of the performance capabilities of the proposed replacement HF Radios and associated equipment.
2.  A short description of the hardware and software changes which may be required to meet E-2C unique aircraft interfaces.
3.  A rough order of magnitude (ROM) estimate of vendor non-recurring costs.
4.  A notional, high level program schedule.
5.  A ROM estimate of the HF Radio unit costs.
6.  Any other information at vendor discretion, but limited to five 8 by 11 pages.

Written responses to this announcement can be submitted to:

<DESC>U.S. Agency for International Developments Office of Food for Peace (FFP) provides grants for food assistance to private voluntary organizations (PVOs) and the UN World Food Program (WFP) under Title II of Public Law 480.  In fiscal year 2007, FFP provided 2.1 million metric tons of commodities, worth over $1.8 billion, to over 40 million people in 64 countries.  FFP provides both emergency food aid (which aims to address food aid needs arising from natural disasters, such as floods or droughts, and complex emergencies often characterized by insecurity and population displacement) and non-emergency food aid (which aims to address the underlying causes of chronic food insecurity).

Madagascar confronts chronic food insecurity, with acute crises brought on by recurrent climatic factors, including frequent cyclones and erratic rainfall.  The recurrent shocks exacerbate the underlying vulnerability of many resource-poor Malagasy households, who have little capacity to cope. FFP has addressed these problems with PL480 Title II support through four programs over the past several years -- three development programs being implemented by PVOs and emergency food aid support through the WFP.  In fiscal years 2007 and 2008, Madagascar received over $30 million in Title II food assistance.  In FY 2009, FFP expects to approve a new set of five-year non-emergency programs at a cost of $15,000,000 annually.
 
Title II food aid grants are signed by the Director of FFP, and the FFP/Washington Country Backstop Officer is usually the Agreement Officers Technical Representative (AOTR)  who is responsible for the technical oversight of the grants.  The USAID Mission has overall responsibility for assistance programs in the country.

To help determine the need for, and improve, monitor, and evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of assistance provided under the Title II non-emergency food aid program in Madagascar, USAID/Madagascar requires the services of a FFP Officer (FFPO) hired through a Personal Services Contract.  The position is based in Antananarivo, but the FFPO is expected to spend approximately forty (40) percent of his/her time traveling throughout the country to monitor program activities and assess food aid needs.  USAID/Madagascar is also in the process of creating a Food Security (FS) team, and the FFPO would serve as the head of this team.  The Food Security team is composed of the FFPO and two foreign service nationals working on the Title II program.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT  120mm GPS-guided high explosive mortar cartridges         
The US Army Joint Munitions & Lethality Life Cycle Management Command (JM&L LCMC) Acquisition Center, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07806-5000 on behalf of the Office of the Project Manager Combat Ammunition Systems has identified a need to produce a 120mm GPS-guided high explosive mortar cartridge to meet current warfighting requirements. The requirement calls for a precision mortar cartridge with a delivery accuracy of less than 10-meter Circular Error Probability (CEP) (threshold) and 5-meter CEP (objective), across gun to target ranges of 1,000 meters to 6,500 meters. The on-board guidance system shall use a direct P(Y) SAASM GPS receiver. The lethality of the cartridge shall be 70% of the current M934A1 lethality or greater, and be capable of detonating in proximity, point detonating, or delay modes. The assessed reliability requirement for Urgent Material Release in January 2010 shall be 0.9 or greater. The assessed reliability for Full Material Release by January 2011 shall be 0.92 (threshold), 0.97 (objective). All energetics and fuzing systems shall be qualified for use by the US Army or be capable of being qualified by December 2009. The cartridge shall be compatible with current US 120mm mortar systems, and require no change to current soldier skill level or size of mortar units. 
In order to assess the maturity of industry designs to enter into a production contract in September 2009, respondents shall describe in detail the capabilities of their 120mm precision guided mortar and how their design could achieve initial production delivery in February 2010, subsequently producing a total of 15,000 cartridges by 2QFY12. 
In addition to describing their 120mm precision mortar rounds capabilities and how the design would meet US requirements; interested parties are requested to include a description of their: technology and manufacturing readiness level, substantiation to meet the production timeline  to include projected per month production ramp up, substantiation for predicted accuracy, predicted maximum and minimum effective range, fire control interface required for operations, (using M32 LHMBC and M95 MFCS), overall length and weight, and lethality versus troops in the open and lightly armored vehicles.  The response should also address how the contractor intends to ramp up production to deliver the complete quantity of 15,000 cartridges by 2QFY12.  Specifically, the respondents should show how they could deliver an initial quantity of 250 systems by the end of February 2010 ramping up to 2,500 per month, and completing all deliveries early in the 2nd Qtr FY12.  If new facilities are planned or required to meet the requirements of this production program, so state, along with the detailed plans to meet the US Army delivery requirements.  The response should also include a detailed risk assessment of the respondents cartridge ability to meet the performance and delivery requirements within the identified timelines.  
Interested respondents may obtain the draft performance specification upon request and coordination with POC listed below.  A Non-Disclosure Agreement (available upon request) signed and on file and a DD2345, and Form 1350 at a minimum, will be required. This RFI is for information and planning purposes only, and does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP).  It is not to be construed as a commitment by the U.S. Government.  No award will be made as a result of this RFI.  All information is to be submitted at no cost or obligation to the Government.

The Marine Corps will NOT be responsible for any costs incurred by interested parties in responding to this RFI.

This FedBizOpps notice is an announcement seeking market information on businesses capable of providing the services as described herein. The Marine Corps is currently conducting market research to determine qualified, experienced, and interested potential sources. The information requested by this RFI will be used within the Marine Corps to facilitate decision making and will not be disclosed outside the agency. 

Objective:

Seeking training to reinforce, exercise, and enhance perishable skills taught at HUMINT based courses.  Training will exercise the HUMINT operational cycle and mission planning essentials consistent with the criterion used within the MEU.  Training will integrate Task Force specific operational tactics, techniques, and procedures used within the Marine Air Ground Task Fore (MAGTF).  Training will involve the execution of offensive HUMINT skills, defensive Counterintelligence skills, and the entire spectrum of CI/HUMINT support to Force Protection.  Training will yield an understanding of CI/HUMINT analysis and management and ultimately build upon the core CI/HUMINT trade skills taught at Navy Marine Corps Intelligence Training Center (NMITC) with quantifiable competency reviews to the supported combatant commanders. 

Event Parameters:

The duration of the training will encompass three segments.  The first segment of training will consist of a combination of platform instruction and practical exercises.  The second segment will be the exercise portion of the training which will align with the MAGTFX portion of the MEU workup cycle.  On average MAGTFXs are fourteen day exercises.  The third segment of training will align with CERTEX portion of the MEU workup cycle which is a twelve day exercise.  Both the second and third segments are performance training venues anchored on training objectives.

Training Events:

Many of the elements associated with CI/HUMINT training, referred to as tradecraft, is sensitive in nature and cannot be specifically outlined in standard unclassified media and communication channels.  However, much of the training required surrounds two elements; Military Source Operations (to include Counterintelligence Force Protection Source Operations) and interrogation.  Additionally, the remainder of training may consist of but not limited to Marine HET structure and deployment preparation, DoD standard HUMINT report writing, CI/HUMINT Equipment program (CIHEP) familiarization, Surveillance training and Technical Surveillance and use of Countermeasures.

Only propulsion contractors who are registered and certified with the Defense Logistics Services Center (DLSC) shall be provided copies of the resulting BAA or other data subject to foreign disclosure restrictions when the BAA is issued. Contact the Defense Logistics Services Center, 74 Washington Avenue N., Battle Creek, Michigan 40917-3084 (1-800-353-3572) for further information on the certification process. You must submit a copy or AFRL must have a copy on file of your approved DD Form 2345, Military Critical Technical Data Agreement, with your request for the solicitation.

All replies to this RFI are to be provided to the USAF by electronic copy and may be followed by an oral presentation not to exceed 4 hours at AFRL Edwards, CA.

Program Description
The Air Force is issuing this Request for Information (RFI) for planning purposes only to allow potential propulsion contractors to submit questions, comments and suggestions prior to the potential release of a competitive Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) PKTA-06-01.

The purpose of this RFI is to obtain propulsion contractor input to enable AFRL to define the best approach for an efficient and successful component and rocket engine concept demonstration test program. AFRL is particularly interested in technical concepts and program approaches that will insure program success while meeting all the Integrated High Payoff Rocket Propulsion Technology (IHPRPT) Hydrocarbon Boost Phase II goals and operability metrics.  Your comments/ questions are solicited on a proposed program that will analyze, design, fabricate, deliver and provide test hardware for critical component and engine system demonstration tests for innovative technologies to reduce risk for future highly operable systems. The component and engine designs demonstrated by this program could be the basis for a future contracted Rocket Engine development program and are to be traceable to the Vision design space.  Therefore, potential propulsion contractors must have existing experience or qualifications with the analysis, design, manufacturing, and testing of high thrust LOX/HC engines.  This includes the existing manpower and in-house/ contracted facilities capable of efficiently and successfully meeting both the technical and program goals of this program.

A draft of BAA-PKTA-06-01 associated with this RFI shall be forthcoming approximately 2 weeks after RFI post date.  The engine conceptual design and hot firing ground tests are to be conducted for a reusable Oxidizer Rich Staged Combustion (ORSC) cycle engine with 250K lbf sea level thrust, using the propellants Liquid Oxygen (LOx) and Rocket Grade Kerosene (per Mil-DTL-25576D) to meet all the IHPRPT Hydrocarbon Boost Phase II goals as well as additional Operability metrics.  Thus, selection of the engine pressure schedules, nozzle area ratio, propellant flow rates, turbomachinery, and mixture ratios of the preburner and the main thrust chamber must not only consider booster sea level and vacuum flight performance, but also flight reliability, reuse requirements and production costs.  Also ground and in flight ignition, cooling, combustion stability of both the preburner and the main thrust chamber, and must consider risk, reuse, and reliability of the engine system. 

The BAA is currently planned to be issued to industry in June of 2006 with a planned authority to proceed (ATP) in January of 2007.  One cost plus contract with hybrid fee structure entailing fixed fee (CPFF), and/or incentive fee (CPIF), and/or award fee (CPAF) unclassified contract may be awarded for this liquid rocket engine demonstration test program.  Maximum possible funding to contractor for the potential contact award is up to ninety-nine million dollars ($99,000,000.00), and the program including testing can be up to 8 years in duration from authority to proceed (ATP).  Tests are to demonstrate the performance and operating characteristics of the conceptual engine technologies for the potential development of future reusable LOx/RP oxidizer rich staged combustion booster engines for USAF space missions.

Potential Contracted Program
The possible LOx/RP liquid rocket engine component and engine assembly demonstration test program will be unclassified with limited distribution.  The objectives of this future contracted effort are to provide AFRL with reusable liquid rocket engine test hardware to prove out innovative technologies. The components will be integrated for engine demonstration testing. Concept demonstration test hardware is to be provided with the most cost effective schedule for component and engine system hardware tests. Major critical engine components are summarized as follows.

Rocket Engine Assembly (REA)
Major components of the REA are: the Oxidizer Rich Preburner (ORPB), Thrust Chamber Assembly (TCA), Turbo Pump Assembly (TPA), thrust mount, gimbal mount, thrust in-flight control, thrust vector control (TVC) and roll control if required by a single booster engine, heat exchanger(s) and/or bleed(s) for vehicle tank pressurization, and in-flight engine controller and health monitoring system.   The only components to be evaluated and demonstrated during this contracted program are the ORPB, TPA, and TCA.  Other engine components will not be evaluated as part of this contract unless clearly identified by the respondent as within the proposed program scope.

Oxidizer Rich Preburner (ORPB)
Major components of the ORPB are: the LOX and Rocket Grade Kerosene preburner flow control valves, nontoxic/ non-pyrophoric reusable igniter, injector, and mixer combustion chamber.  The preburner must incorporate a stable combustion zone to provide the resulting hot oxidizer rich gas exit flow stream with uniform pressure and temperature flow distribution into the turbopump assembly turbine.  A key preburner design goal is reusable and reliable ignition with the resulting stable combustion providing the uniform and repeatable temperature flow field at the exit of the preburner.  

Turbo Pump Assembly (TPA)
Major components of the TPA are: the LOX boost pump, if required, main LOX pump, Rocket Grade Kerosene boost pump, if required, main Rocket Grade Kerosene pump, seals and bearings, and uncoated oxidizer rich gas turbine. The pump assembly must consider reusability and reliability for the booster engine requirements.

Thrust Chamber Assembly (TCA)
Major components of the TCA are: the Rocket Grade Kerosene main flow control valve, the combustion chamber and nozzle cooling jacket, the LOX rich gas and Rocket Grade Kerosene liquid injector, and a nontoxic/ non- pyrophoric reusable igniter.  The TCA must meet the engine booster requirements.

Government Furnished Equipment: USAF Rocket Component and Engine Test Facility
AFRL will provide test facilities including test stand, power, instrumentation, all fluids, propellants, test stand integration management, and test facility interface management if requested. Funding previously identified does not include any of the costs of the AFRL test facilities, consumables, testing, and data acquisition which will be Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) provided by the USAF at no cost to the potential contractor.

If GFE test facility is utilized, hardware test end items will be delivered to the test site complete with all valves, controls, orifices, and test instrumentation as identified by test interface control document (ICD).  All test stand instrumentation and data acquisition systems are to be provided by the Government.  Candidate contractors are to specify all electrical power requirements for their proposed hardware and instrumentation, including any potential unique requirements. The contractor shall also provide facility pressure, capacity, and flowrate requirements for the propellants to be utilized for both component and integrated system test campaigns. Also any unique ignition system power requirements or purge requirements are to be identified.

AFRL technical POC will provide candidate contractors upon request with a test cell schematic showing all facility hookups and interconnection hardware. All mechanical, electrical, propellant, fluid, and gas interfaces/ requirements are to be compatible with AFRL Test Stand 2A capabilities unless otherwise identified. Responses to this RFI will be used by the government to make appropriate planning decisions.  

Questions for RFI Orals
In order for the government to adequately assess and improve the BAA requirements and the resulting contracted programs, candidate contractors are encouraged to provide responses to the following questions.  Answers to these questions should be in addition to other contractor comments and suggestions provided during the oral presentation. As part of the RFI the respondent should provide AFRL with an estimated total contracted program schedule and resulting ROM total program costs along with an estimated Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) funding profile required by government fiscal year (GFY) in million of US dollars per year. 

The respondent may suggest any changes to the draft BAA and contracted program scope that could improve results. Also, the respondent should discuss potential ROM program cost savings for the design and demonstration of the proposed critical component and engine assembly test program.  These recommendations must consider the program need and cost for: analysis, design, materials, fabrication, delivery of test hardware, hardware modifications during tests, test liaison, post test data analysis, and all program technical and financial reporting including interim / final technical reports. Respondents are encouraged to discuss contract and program recommendations that can reduce the baseline schedule and/or cost and still meet the demonstration test objectives. 

	1.	What are the critical components and how will component design problems be corrected during the component tests program to insure successful engine assembly tests. What is your baseline overall program schedule and estimated ROM funding requirements per government fiscal year?

2.	What hardware quantities, number and types of tests and fabrication/rework schedule would you recommend prior to and during demonstration testing to reduce program risk, maintain schedule and insure program success?

3.	Provide comments and list of any additional data required for baseline AFRL test cell installation and all mechanical, electrical, propellant interface, and sequence- timing issues.  This should include any special requirements for hydraulic, electrical or pneumatic systems.

4.	Discuss major design and demonstration test issues and risks to be considered in a BAA and the contracted program. Are there contract and program recommendations that can reduce the schedule and/or cost and still meet the demonstration test program objectives?

5.	Are there any new materials or technologies from related or unrelated applications that could be applied to the demonstration program?  If so, what are these materials and technologies and identify the risks associated with incorporating these into this contracted program.

6.	The definition of a Metric for Operability has been identified as an area of high risk in the preliminary risk assessment.  Definition of operability and how it impacts engine operations is ill-defined. What are the drivers/ factors such as supportability, cost, and engine readiness that define good goal sets to determine engine design requirements for operability? What metrics are to be measured to assesses progress on meeting operability goals? Identify areas for improvements (health management, building in robustness, etc)

7.	What analytical and software tools do you envision being required to support a contracted program and how have these tools been validated?  Do you possess sufficient computational resources either within your company or government for the proposed effort? 

8.	Summarize your companys and any potential subcontractors background, related experience and capabilities in the analysis, design, development and testing of LOX/HC booster engines.  Specifically, what lessons learned can be translated from these previous efforts into the development of a highly operable, reusable rocket grade kerosene/Lox booster.  This should include production experience with numbers of engines, thrust levels, and program time periods.

9.	 Discuss any preburner experience for possible integration into an oxygen-rich staged combustion rocket engine that could reduce program risk.

10.	Discuss current baseline design approach(s)/concept(s) for a nontoxic/ non-pyrophoric reusable ignition system for the preburner and main combustion chamber to support this potential contract.

Project Title

Development of predictive (clinically meaningful) in vitro dissolution/release test methods for oral dosage forms to assist product development and regulatory decision-making including setting drug product dissolution specification 


Background Information

Drug dissolution/release characteristics are critical product attributes and hence, are critical for ensuring that the product performs as described in the target product profile in the target patient population.  Currently, dissolution tests are not always predictive of the in vivo drug performance and many issues related to the existing typical dissolution methodologies are raised.  There are concerns that despite the advances in technology, the methods and the issues have remained fairly constant over the last several decades.    Furthermore, dissolution/release test methods, in general, follow approaches that provide limited information on product characteristics.   

Recognizing these concerns, alternate dissolution testing methods that are also clinically relevant, are being explored by academia and others for specific products.  While these efforts are acknowledged, there is a need to study and develop cohesive "integrated" dissolution/release testing paradigms that will allow building a relationship between the dissolution/release methodology, drug product characteristics and the main sources of variability.  

In addition to the concerns with dissolution testing methods, poorly soluble drugs represent majority (approximately 70%) of drugs currently in drug development, and API characteristics add to the challenges and opportunities in development of dissolution methods that are reliable, robust and predictive of in vivo drug product performance.  

Clinically meaningful dissolution methods, also referred to as predictive methods, will improve product quality, interpretation of product related clinical outcomes as well as predict the impact of product related changes on a drug's in vivo performance.  Particularly, with implementation of Quality by Design (QbD) principles, promoting science- and risk-based approaches, there is a greater need for clinically relevant, predictive dissolution/release testing, leading to relevant product dissolution/release specification which is critical to product quality, ultimately, patient benefit.  

This project will also serve as a platform for future studies which will build on the findings from this project.  Multiple approaches may evolve from this work, including, incorporation of manufacturing experiments illustrating application of QbD and biopharmaceutics principles to enrich product and process knowledge and understanding, resulting in improved product quality. 

Purpose: 

The purpose of this RFI is to identify potential sources that have the capability and qualifications to develop and perform predictive in vitro dissolution/release test methods that can be applicable for poorly soluble drugs and guide in vitro and in vivo studies conducted for APIs with similar solubility characteristics under typical (standard) conditions and under altered conditions related to unique patient characteristics.  

The developed dissolution/release testing paradigms, incorporating drug product and dosage form characteristics for oral dosage forms, should be reliable, transferable to similar products, and clinically meaningful (predictive) throughout the lifecycle of the product.  

Furthermore, while addressing existing concerns, the approaches explored will bring in new knowledge, and it is intended that the findings from this project (with necessary extensions), will lead to in vitro dissolution/release testing paradigms for a large group of drug products.  

FDA is interested in developing and advancing in vitro methodology and practices, and the fulfillment of this effort is in alignment with our mission of protecting and promoting health of the American public.  FDA may consider soliciting services for a two-year period, one base year with one option year.

RFI Submission Instructions:

FDA will not award a contract on the basis of responses nor otherwise pay for the preparation of any information submitted or FDAs use of such information.  Responses will be separated from, and have no bearing on subsequent evaluations of proposals submitted in response to any resulting formal RFP.  Eligibility in participating in a future acquisition does not depend upon a response to this notice.  Proprietary information is not being solicited.

Description:  	FDA Sentinel Initiative
RFI:	

This is a Request for Information (RFI) and is not a Request for Proposal/Request for Quotation (RFP/RFQ) in accordance with FAR 15.201(e).  This information is being sought for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  No official solicitation exists; therefore, please do not request a copy of a solicitation.  If in the future a official solicitation is released, there is no guarantee that sources responding to this RFI will be included on the source list   No telephone inquiries will be accepted.  

Purpose:

The purpose of this RFI is to identify potential sources that have the capability and qualifications to perform activities to support the planning and development of the FDAs Sentinel Initiative.  FDA is interested in evaluating and building upon models already developed by other organizations (e.g., academia, industry, other Federal agencies) in the fulfillment of this effort.  FDA may consider soliciting services for a base year and four option years using an ID/IQ task order contract vehicle.

RFI Submission Instructions:

FDA will not award a contract on the basis of responses nor otherwise pay for the preparation of any information submitted or FDAs use of such information.  Responses will be separated from, and have no bearing on subsequent evaluations of proposals submitted in response to any resulting formal RFP.  Eligibility in participating in a future acquisition does not depend upon a response to this notice.  Proprietary information is not being solicited.  Information considered proprietary, if any, should be identified as such. Responses will be reviewed only by FDA personnel and will be held in a confidential manner.

Background:

In May 2008, the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the FDA Commissioner announced the Sentinel Initiative.  The Sentinel Initiative is a long-term effort by the Agency to create a national electronic system for monitoring product safety.  The Sentinel Initiative is intended to augment the Agencys existing post-market (primarily passive) safety surveillance systems and to allow the Agency to actively gather information about the post-market safety and performance of its regulated products. 

As currently envisioned, the Sentinel Initiative will enable the Agency to capitalize on the capabilities of multiple, existing automated healthcare data systems (e.g. electronic health record systems, administrative claims databases, registries, or others) to augment the Agencys current surveillance capabilities. The Sentinel Initiative will enable queries of disparate data sources quickly and securely for relevant product safety information.  Data will continue to be managed by its owners, and only data of organizations who agree to participate in this system will be included.  Questions would be sent to appropriate, participating data sources, who in turn would, in accordance with existing privacy and security safeguards, evaluate their data and send results for Agency review.  

The Sentinel Initiative is a response to various calls for this type of effort from the Agency.  In September 2005, the HHS Secretary asked the Agency to expand its current system for monitoring medical product performance and to explore the possibility of working with multiple automated healthcare data systems to augment the Agencys current capabilities of identifying and evaluating product safety information.  The Secretary recommended that the Agency explore creating a public-private collaboration as a framework for such an effort, leveraging large, automated healthcare databases.  

In 2006, the IOM issued a report, entitled The Future of Drug SafetyPromoting and Protecting the Health of the Public.  Among other suggestions, this IOM report recommended the Agency identify ways to access other health-related databases and create a public-private partnership to support safety studies.  

In 2007, Congress enacted the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007  (FDAAA).  Section 905 of this statute calls for the HHS Secretary to develop methods to obtain access to disparate data sources and to establish an active post-market risk identification and analysis system that links and analyzes safety data from multiple sources. The law sets a goal of access to data from 25 million patients by July 1, 2010, and 100 million patients by July 1, 2012. The law also requires the Agency to work closely with partners from public, academic, and private entities.  The Agency views its Sentinel Initiative as a mechanism through which some of the requirements mandated in this legislation can be carried out.
  
The Sentinel Initiative is a long-term effort that must proceed in stages. The initial stage of the Sentinel Initiative has allowed the Agency to further refine the requirements and develop the scope.  The Agency has funded 8 contracts to support this initial stage.  In addition to this ongoing contractual work, there are many ongoing activities in the public and private sector that will inform the Sentinel Initiative.  The Agency has hosted a series of meetings with various stakeholder groups, to include other federal agencies; data sources and environments; academics and experts; patient, consumer, and provider groups; and IT vendors.  In addition, in December 2008 a public workshop was held to discuss the Sentinel Initiative with the following objectives:

	To provide an update on the current status of the Sentinel Initiative and allow for comment from all stakeholders 
	To discuss potential governance models and their implications 
	To discuss approaches to ensuring continued involvement of all stakeholders as the initiative evolves 

Future efforts will provide specific deliverables that would be integrated with what is learned from contractual work already ongoing to inform the Sentinel Initiative, as well as with other ongoing activities in both the public and private sectors to further understand the feasibility and utility of these data and methodologies primarily for active medical product surveillance.  In addition, the FDA would seek to undertake new activities to support the Sentinel Initiative including test queries, methodology development, testing and implementation support projects, proof of concept development, and technical assistance.  

Examples of tasks of interest that might be awarded under this task order contract may include but not be limited to: 

1)	Formulate an approach for selecting marketed regulated products and specific outcomes for routine surveillance.

2)	Develop, apply and/or evaluate advanced methodological approaches to safety signal detection, signal strengthening, and signal validation in automated healthcare data sources for regulated products during the postmarketing period.

3)	Formulate an approach for confirmation of signals/hypotheses generated by active surveillance of automated healthcare data sources for marketed regulated products. This task may include observational studies requiring diagnosis and exposure confirmation via medical record review or other means.  

4)	Evaluate data model characteristics pertinent to postmarket safety analysis of automated healthcare data.

5)	Identify or develop risk communication tools to facilitate responsible dissemination of findings from the queries evaluated.

6)	Develop training materials and provide training to FDA staff to ensure that staff have a full understanding, proficiency and confidence in the advanced methods and models developed under a given contractor task.

Responses shall be submitted addressing each part as follows:  

Part A. Capabilities and Technical Experience  Provide a capability statement describing the ability to perform activities to support the planning and development of the FDAs Sentinel Initiative consistent with the example tasks described above. This statement should include, but is not limited, to information about the following topics:

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends on entering into a sole source procurement with FileTrail, Inc. of San Jose, CA, under the authority of FAR Subsection 13.106-1(b). Filetrail is the only provider of FileTrail software and training services in the mid-Atlantic region. This procurement is an expansion of the existing FileTrail installation at NIST. The expansion will be additional concurrent licenses, creation of labels, Radio Frequency Identification tags, and scanner equipment to facilitate the automated tracking of grant files (approximately 1,600 existing with 300 new awards annually). Use of FileTrail will prevent a duplication of a file tracking system; the need for a different system owner, as well as an additional certification and accreditation process. This is consistent with the Office of Management and Budgets management agenda in consolidating applications to reduce information technology application redundancy. This solution also supports the NIST technical architecture using Windows 2003 as the web application and Oracle as the database backend. No RFQ package is available. Any interested party may submit, in writing, their capability statement to respond to this requirement by March 6, 2009. However, a determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. This notice of intent is not a request for quotes.

<p>STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>1. Background</p>
<p>This is a firm fixed price, non-personal service purchase order. Government personnel will be responsible for the overall scheduling of project activity and will provide the contractor's liaison/project manager, as appropriate, scheduling information. NOAA's Southwest Fisheries Science Center (SWFSC) is responsible for protecting and managing marine mammals within U.S. waters of the California Current Ecosystem along the U.S. West Coast and the eastern topical Pacific Ocean (ETP). At both a national (Magnuson-Stevens Act) and international (e.g., Party to the Agreement on the International Dolphin Conservation Program and Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission, signatory to FAO Code for Responsible Fisheries Management) level, the US is committed to an ecosystem approach to fisheries management. The SWFSC provides extensive support to this agency-wide effort through its research and development of capabilities to better assess ecosystem impacts of fishing and other anthropogenic activities. Nowhere is this more evident than in the ETP.</p>
<p><br />2. Schedule/Performance Period</p>
<p>The period of performance for this work is 1 March 2009 through 28 February 2010.</p>
<p><br />3. Scope of Work</p>
<p>The contractor will use available software (e.g., Adobe InDesign) to create, in collaboration with SWFSC subject matter experts, an ETP Report Card to raise awareness of the importance of the ETP to consumers, managers, scientists and other constituents. The report card will be in the form of an electronic document that is suitable for printing on glossy stock and distribution. The target audience for the report card is policymakers and educated constituent groups. Critical elements of the report card include: a description of the ecosystem services (and potential future services) in the ETP from which we benefit, historical and ongoing research at the SWFSC that illustrates the capability to develop ecosystem approaches to management and forecasts to better anticipate the impacts of climate change and anthropogenic activities both on the ETP ecosystem and the services upon which we have come to rely. Graphics to illustrate our work and the importance of our ability to develop forecasting capabilities will be essential to this effort. The look and feel of the document must be consistent with the SWFSC environment and the messages we are trying to convey. Most importantly, the report card must be attractive and engaging to be an effective communication tool.</p>
<p>The contractor shall also develop a website, working in collaboration with SWFSC subject matter experts and ITS experts, to support and expand upon the ideas in the Report Card. The website will contain additional references and details beyond those included in the glossy document.

<p>Background</p>
<p>Beaked whales of the family Ziphiidae are perhaps the least known of marine mammals. Rarely sighted at sea, several species are known only from dead stranded specimens. Recent mass strandings of beaked whales in several areas, including the northern Bahamas (Balcomb &amp; Claridge 2001) have correlated with international naval operations, raising concern that beaked whales may be particularly vulnerable to anthropogenic noise. As such, information on the basic population ecology of beaked whales is necessary to understand and mitigate the effects of such activities. However, ecological studies of beaked whales are logistically difficult due to the challenges of reliably detecting beaked whales at sea. <br /><br />The deep waters around the Bahama Islands are one of the few areas where beaked whales are known to regularly occur close to shore. The Bahamas Marine Mammal Research Organisation (BMMRO) has been conducting field studies of beaked whales in the northern Bahamas since 1991, primarily around Great Abaco Island. This effort has resulted in more than 300 encounters with beaked whales, comprising both Cuvier's beaked whales (Ziphius cavirostris) and Blainville's beaked whales (Mesoplodon densirostris). Using randomized boat transects and established photographic identification methods, individual whales have been re- identified and followed over multiple years. This unique dataset provides unprecedented individual-based information on the ecology of living beaked whales (e.g., site fidelity, social organization, habitat selection).<br /><br />Satellite telemetry has been shown to provide high resolution data on marine mammal movement patterns, and great progress has been made in addressing both practical and technological challenges of deploying tags on cetaceans. In particular, recent advances in component miniaturization and battery construction have allowed production of tags that are extremely small and can be remotely deployed using projectile devices fired from crossbows or pneumatic rifles (Andrews /et al./ 2005). This allows movement data to be obtained without the need for physical capture and restraint, and with negligible physical impact or behavioral disturbance. <br /><br />These "dart-tags" were first deployed on killer whales (Andrews /et al./ 2008), documenting movements of more than 1800 km (Durban /et al./ submitted), and tag longevity of up to 90 days (Durban, unpublished data). More recently these tags have been deployed on a variety of cetacean species, including gray whales (Durban, unpublished data), sperm whales, medium-sized odontocetes and beaked whale (http://www.cascadiaresearch.org/robin/satellite.htm).<br /><br />We propose to deploy dart-tags on beaked whales, sperm whales, and other medium-sized cetaceans, including pilot whales, false killer whales and melon-headed whales. Tags will be deployed by John Durban from the Southwest Fisheries Science Center and a long-term collaborator of BMMRO who has worked on beaked whale studies in the Bahamas for the past 13 years, and who has deployed dart tags on cetaceans since their first development. The 23' RHIB will be piloted for close tagging approaches by Diane Claridge (BMMRO), who has conducted small-boat studies of beaked whales in the Bahamas for the past 17 years.</p>
<p><br />2. Schedule/Performance Period</p>
<p>The research activity will be conducted between 1 April 2009 and 20 September 2009. For cost estimate purposes, it is estimated that approximately 480 hours are required to fulfill the requirements of this contract.</p>

SSAs CBSV Open for Enrollment

Announcement of New Consent-Based Social Security Number Verification (CBSV) Service by the Social Security Administration (SSA)
Social Security is pleased to announce that it welcomes new customers to enroll in its Consent Based Social Security Number (SSN) Verification (CBSV) service.  CBSV went live in November 2008 and more than 100 companies have enrolled to use this service.
CBSV permits private businesses or government agencies to verify whether a name and SSN match the data in SSAs Master File of SSNs.  It provides instantaneous, automated SSN verification and it easily handles large volume requests. Using CBSV, participating companies can verify the SSNs of their customers and clients.
CBSV requires participating companies to pay a fee and obtain the written consent of the SSN holder. CBSV results can only be used for the reason which the number holder specifies. An Employer Identification Number (EIN) is required to enroll and become a CBSV user.
To use CBSV you must pay a non-refundable enrollment fee of $5,000 and then pay a transaction fee per SSN verification request. The transaction fee is presently $0.56 and must be paid in advance. Periodically, SSA will recalculate the costs it incurs in providing the CBSV service and will adjust the transaction fee charged as needed. Subscribers will be notified in writing of any change in the transaction fee. SSA may close enrollment to CBSV at its discretion. 

Questions regarding CBSV may be e-mailed to: ssa.cbsv@ssa.gov.

<DESC>The US Army Space and Missile Defense Command intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Raytheon Missile Systems, Tucson, Arizona, for an increase to the ceiling of Option I on the current Raytheon Contract W9113M-07-C-0181.  The proposed action is pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c) (1), as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1.  This action is to support the continuation of current efforts relating to the design, fabrication, integration, testing, and demonstration of the Advanced Extended Range Attack Missile (AERAM).  Award to any source other than Raytheon would result in unacceptable delays and substantial costs.  This action will be a modification to the existing cost plus fixed fee contract.  The significant duplication of cost involved with a new contractor is considered to be well beyond any cost savings that might be achieved through competition.  Under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, this action is directed toward Raytheon Missile Systems.  This acquisition is not open to foreign firms.  All responses should be directed to Dianne Trimble at dianne.trimble@smdc.army.mil and must be received within fifteen (15) days from the publication date of this synopsis.  No telephone inquiries will be accepted.  The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  This notice of intent to negotiate a sole source modification to Contract W9113M-07-C-0181 is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination by the government not to compete this proposed contract modification based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.  All responsible sources may submit a response which will be considered.  This is NOT a formal notice of solicitation.  Telephone or facsimile inquiries and/or responses will not be accepted.

<p><br />In case a different vendor provides the microscope, it must meet the same performance criteria and warranty coverage on all components as if it were being provided directly by the manufacturer.</p>
<p><br />The characteristics that must apply to the Polara preventive maintenance contract are:</p>
<p>&bull;	Contractor shall guarantee 85% system uptime as measured on a 7x24 basis for the base year and all option years, if exercised. The uptime does not include time required for regular column bake out (estimated at 12 hours, twice a month) or other routine maintenance procedures such as column alignment, stage adjustment or detector optimization.</p>
<p>-  On-site NCI based FEI manufactured spare parts inventory to be kept by the contractor at NCI</p>
<p>-  Parts and labor as are covered.</p>
<p>&bull;	If the contractor fails to meet the 85% uptime requirement NCI shall be compensated.</p>
<p>&bull;	Downtime is measured and starts from the time the contractor is officially notified by NCI that the system is malfunctioning and considered down until the time the contractor confirms the reported failure is repaired. Officially notified is defined as NCI placing a telephone call to a contractor defined telephone number to report the system as not performing as specified or as down.</p>
<p>-  Downtime is defined as the time during which the system is not able to collect data. This includes reasons that fall within the system meeting or not meeting "original system specifications" and any upgrades inserted by the manufacturer.<br />&#61472;&#61472;&#61472;&#61472;&#61472;&#61472;<br />-  The system will not be presented to NCI as ready to resume uptime use until a mutually agreed to checklist/Sample run has been completed and the system passes the system tests on the checklist</p>
<p>-  For example, the completion of a tilt series checklist test that does not meet the specification of 200nm displacement will be counted as grounds for considering the system as still down. The 200nm test for example can also be grounds for placing a service call, and will initiate the down time clock. This may be possible as an automated procedure using a computerized measurement. The problem will be considered fixed when a tilt series from a mutually agreed upon test specimen meeting the 200 nm specification is successfully completed.</p>
<p>&bull;	Downtime does not include:</p>
<p>-  Problems/interruptions with power, utilities, and room environment control conditions as provided by NCI that negatively effect the system's performance.</p>
<p>-  Problems caused by operator error</p>
<p>-  Time required for scheduled system preventative maintenance routines and                                           upgrades. A proactive approach to preventing failures will be incorporated into this program and will include, but not be limited to, FEG tip replacement prior to failure, valve replacement prior to failure, for example. [Scheduled times to be in agreement with NCI designated responsible person or personnel]<br />&#61472;&#61472;&#61472;&#61472;&#61472;&#61472;&#61472;&#61472;&#61472;&#61472;<br />&#61472;&#61472;&#61472;&#61472;&#61472;&#61472;&#61472;-  &#61472;System use for training or applications development purposes</p>
<p>&#61472;&#61472;&#61472;&#61472;&#61472;&#61472;&#61472;&#61472;&#61472;&#61472;-  &#61472;Repair time for third party items [e.g. Gatan parts] that do not have parts on-site at NIH at the time it is determined the downtime problem source is a third party item. The downtime clock is reinstated after the third party part is received in the TEM system room.</p>
<p>&#61472;&#61472;&#61472;&#61472;&#61472;&#61472;&#61472;&#61472;&#61472;&#61472;-  &#61472;Downtime/uptime figures will be calculated and documented on a weekly basis.</p>
<p>&bull;	&#61472;NCI responsible for:</p>
<p>-  Notifying the contractor that the system is considered as being down, as stated above.  This defines the start of the downtime clock.</p>
<p>-  Supplying a secure on-site location for housing the spare FEI parts</p>
<p>-  Preparing, loading, and running all samples; and system operation</p>
<p>-  Providing operator(s) to be available on site, to support the Contractor's Field Service Engineers [FSE], as needed.</p>
<p>-  Providing 24 hour access passes to the NIH Bethesda, MD campus, the TEM system building, TEM system room, and spare parts inventory location</p>
<p>-  Providing external high speed internet access to the TEM system computer for contractor FSE for remote monitoring and diagnosis</p>
<p>-  Providing an on site cubicle or administrative facility with internet access from which the contractor personnel can conduct daily activities.</p>
<p>&bull;	Contractor responsible for:</p>
<p>-  Maintaining on-site spare parts inventory of FEI manufactured parts</p>
<p>-  Evaluating the need to change inventory items.</p>
<p>-  Installation of software upgrades and working with NCI personnel to schedule said upgrades such that it is confirmed as a time not considered as TEM system downtime</p>
<p>-  Operator training of NCI personnel</p>
<p>-  Weekly evaluation of the instrument for performance checks including a detailed instrument performance report.</p>
<p>&bull;	The contractor personnel on site must be thoroughly familiar with the use of the Polara for cryoelectron tomography as well as the types of samples and sample routines being used in the specific application.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This solicitation constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation, N00014-09-Q-0011, is issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-09 and DFARS Change Notice 20020730.  The associated North American Industry classification System (NAICS) code is 541110 and small business size standard is $7.0 million.  This is a 100% small business set-aside.  The Department of the Navy (DoN), Office of Naval Research (ONR), located in Arlington, Virginia, was established to plan, foster, and encourage scientific research and technology development as related to the development and maintenance of future naval power and the preservation of national security.  Within the Department of the Navy (DoN) Office of General Counsel (OGC) framework, the DoN Intellectual Property (IP) attorneys working in the ONR Office of Counsel (00CC) (Code BDCC)) are responsible for providing timely advice and counsel on all areas of IP affecting the development, use, and life cycle maintenance of all Navy ships, aircraft, satellites, and other weapons systems being used or supported by the DoN or its foreign strategic partners including the review of relevant potential inventions, ideas, or solutions to technological problems.  Moreover, in support of the DoNs and ONRs mission and objectives, the Office of Counsel focuses on providing both legal services and non-legal assistance including contract-invention surveillance, conducting basic legal research related to licensing regulations, prepare reports and correspondence related to basic legal issues,  and other IP support services.  1.0   Background: The Office of Counsel seeks support relating to aspects of the DoN Intellectual Property (IP) Program.  Specifically, the Office of Counsel is seeking support services to assist IP Counsel in the enterprise-wide responsibility related to acquiring rights in technology, including identifying and perfecting rights in technology, assistance in administering DON licensing program, assist in royalty distribution memorandas, and processing royalty revenue, and managing contractual and contested matters, including litigation related to IP rights in technology. The Contractor shall provide program management and support services that shall include, but not limited to, contract (or other agreement) evaluation, classification, and compliance monitoring with respect to patent rights, licensing, and providing assistance to ONR IP attorneys.  The Intellectual Property (IP) Counsel is responsible for setting policy and procedures for the enterprise-wide DON IP mission, and for executing certain IP programs within the Office of Naval Research, and Office of Counsel.  These policies, procedures and programs are primarily directed toward securing Department of Navys IP rights in technology in order to defend the DON against allegations of infringement of the IP rights of others.   Identifying and securing these rights may take place in the context of IP rights investigations conducted during the formation and execution of DON contracts, as well as during contested matters, such as litigation related to IP rights.   A subset of the DON enterprise-wide program is to conduct IP rights investigations in order to identify the sources of DON rights in IP; and to perfect such rights, as appropriate, including acquiring licenses in such rights.  It is essential to perform these investigations and analyses in solicitations, contracts and grants on both a pre-award and post-award basis.  The scope of these investigations include all aspects of analysis, research, document production, cataloging, routine contacts with outside parties and related activities necessary to prospectively secure IP rights.  Additionally, IP rights analysis is conducted as a pre-emptive defensive action to prevent or minimize allegations of infringement, thereby avoiding costly litigation.  Research and analysis related to IP rights in contested matters, such as litigation, may become very complex, but it is also a necessary and routine requirement in executing the DONs IP mission.   As a result, support service to IP Counsel is required to assist in securing IP rights in technology and matters related to DONs enterprise-wide responsibilities and those specifically involving ONR.  These responsibilities include prospectively conducting investigations to identify and perfect the IP rights of the DON in new or existing contracts; analyzing previous IP rights investigations both prior to litigation and during litigation in order to defend the DON against allegations of infringement of the IP rights of others; and in the related aspects of general support during IP litigation.

Each corner will be welded on both the inside and out for the entire length of seam. Each corner will incorporate a 1" pipe (schedule 40) welded in such a way that each of the two end openings is exposed and centered on the 3" side walls; the pipe acts as a thru and thru tube passage for the mounting bolts (drawings will be provided before the site visit). All pipes must be uniformly placed to facilitate a variety of openings. The pipe will be designated as the &lsquo;mounting hole. Each frame must be capable of being filled and transported with CMU concrete blocks or other masonry materials while safely stored in the racks. On the top, inside of each frame will be two forklift points made of &lsquo;C' channel steel welded approximately 4' apart to accommodate movement by large forklifts (Zoom Boom model ZB20044 or equivalent). All frames and hardware will be treated with a rust preventive black or gray paint. Sizes are approximate, the offeror will be required to make a site visit to re-take and confirm all measurements.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e). Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant Contracting Officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). 

Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.  Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.
(c) Special rules.  The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights.
 	(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:
(i) warrants;
(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.     It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.     Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.     Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

<a href="mailto:james.p.goodwin@conus.army.mil">ACA, ITEC4</a>
<DESC>These questions were posed to the Government in reference to this RFI.  Government responses are as indicated.<BR><BR>1)  As part of this potential acquisition activity, is a new CDD being published and will it be made available to industry?<BR><BR>Response:  A new CDD is not planned at this time.<BR><BR>2) The existence of very recent MTS awards and the wording of the RFI implies that awards for the current system will continue until July 2010.  Should industry read this as an indicator that emphasis of the follow-on contract is on operating and maintaining MTS as a service first, with the incumbent falling-in on the substantial inventory of existing equipment and only afterwards performing enhancements over time?  Or will equal weight be given to both service and capability improvements from the start?  What prioritization information and funding expectations can you give at this time?<BR><BR>Response:  Service first, but we are looking at all options.  Reprioritization and funding information is unknown at this time.<BR><BR>3) Given the stock of existing MTS equipment, networking and software, what are your expectations regarding interoperability between old system and new?  For example, will requirements drive interoperability down to a point where, say, an old screen must plug into new computer and vice versa, even at the expense of losing potentially better capability in the future?<BR><BR>Response: Old and new systems must be able to communicate with each other; actual parts interchangeability is not an issue at this time.<BR><BR>4) What are your expectations for interoperability with (or replacement by) any future FCS logistics solutions, networks and software created by the FCS program?<BR><BR>Response:  FCS is not an issue at this time.<BR><BR>5) Some enhancements discussed by this RFI are potentially covered by other PM offices and programs.  Will PM MTS provide appropriate Top Cover or must industry assume that they should synchronize with affected PMs? <BR>  <BR>Response:  PM MTS will assist industry in dealing with other PMs.  <BR><BR>6) What are your expectations regarding the use of discontinuation of relevant RFID technologies that face upcoming sunset dates? <BR>  <BR>Response:  PM MTS will continue to use current RFID technology and is already evaluating incorporation of next generation RFID technology into the MTS system. <BR> <BR> 7) Can you provide specifications on the current system so we may respond with a more comprehensive white paper? <BR> <BR>Response:  Windows XP, MTS Messenger, Tracer Link Pro  <BR><BR>8)  Hardware you are currently using?  <BR><BR>Response:  Magnus Tablet computers, CEFD MT 2012 RSI satellite transceivers, HP Inkjet Printers, assorted cabling, assorted hardware for vehicle installations  <BR><BR>9)  Current capabilities of the system?  <BR><BR>Satellite-based tracking and communication system, digital mapping  military GPS, two-way free text messaging, embedded RFID interrogator providing in-transit visibility of cargo (MTS+), 911 panic button (MTS+), interfaces with BCS3, ITV server, & FBCB2 (MTS+), 2 models-vehicle mounted and laptop control station, worldwide coverage, capability to use multiple satellites.   <BR><BR>10) Objectives listed in your ORD?<BR><BR>                                      EXCERPT<BR>                        OPERATIONAL REQUIREMENTS DOCUMENT (ORD)<BR>                                       FOR<BR>                            MOVEMENT TRACKING SYSTEM (MTS)<BR><BR><BR>1.  Mission.  The Army needs a capability to track the location of vehicles, communicate with vehicle operators (U.S., and if necessary, other nations), and redirect movements based on battlefield requirements.  The Movement Tracking System (MTS) is mission essential, is part of a suite of digitization additions planned for tactical wheeled vehicles (TWV), and will play a vital role in future battlefield distribution operations.  Both the maneuver commanders mission capability and the logistical commanders support capability will be improved by the use of the MTS.  Based on lessons learned from our most recent campaigns, the inability to track, communicate with, and reroute TWVs resulted in the inefficient use of limited assets, increased risk to personnel and equipment, and supplies delivered to incorrect locations.  MTS will provide the capability to prevent a repeat of these problems.<BR><BR>2.  Capabilities Required.  The MTS integrates computer, automatic identification, communication, and navigation technologies into a single package.  The MTS shall provide the following operational capabilities:<BR><BR>"	Receiving, storing and transmitting (read/write) data from Army specified AIT assets.<BR>"	MTS shall provide computer imaging which simultaneously displays digital maps with computer generated icons which represent the geographic positions of user selected MTS equipped platforms or operations on the control station and mobile unit-vehicle mounted.<BR>"	MTS shall provide non-line-of-sight real time two way data/messaging communication between MTS equipped operations at any distance.  MTS must be able to operate between 70 degrees North and 70 degrees South latitude.<BR>"	Message and position transmission and reception will use a system designed to lower interception, detection, exploitation, and jamming of message traffic.<BR>"	MTS shall provide geographic positioning capability and positioning data that is compliant with the GPS Receiver Application Module (GRAM) guidelines, GPS GRAM 001.<BR>"	MTS shall provide the capability for direct electronic linkage to or from an Army specified Standard Army Management Information System (STAMIS), currently identified as Global Combat Support System-Army (GCSS-Army) which will contain or interface with the STAMIS of Standard Army Ammunition System-Modernized (SAAS-MOD), Standard Army Retail Supply System-1/2A/2AC/B (SAARS-1/2A/2AC/B), Unit Level Logistics System-Ground/Aviation/S4 (ULLS-G/A/S4), Standard Army Maintenance System (SAMS), Integrated Logistics Analysis Program (ILAP), Theater Army Medical Information System (TAMIS), and SIDPERS.    Block 2 MTS shall provide for a direct electronic linkage to the Transportation Coordinators-Automated Information for Movements System (TC-AIMS) II.<BR>"	The MTS will withstand shocks and vibrations experienced by the host vehicle without becoming inoperable or displaying degraded images.  The MTS shall be capable of operating in sustained day or night operations in hot, basic, or cold climates as defined in AR 70-38.<BR>"	All MTS messages shall be delivered from point of origin to destination (mobile unit to control station; mobile unit to mobile unit; control station to control station; control station to mobile unit) within 30 seconds to include any retransmissions and message queuing.  The point of origin and destination are assumed to be in the same theater of operations.  For Block 2, point of origin and destination can be at any point worldwide.<BR>"	Logistics.  The MTS must be supported by the standard Army logistics system.  <BR>"	MTS is mission essential and high-altitude electro-magnetic pulse (HEMP) protection is required; however, operation through a HEMP event is not required.<BR>"	Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical Contamination Survivability (NBCCS).  The MTS is mission essential and NBCCS is required.  The MTS must withstand the materiel damaging effects of NBC contaminants and decontaminants, be decontaminable to negligible risk levels, and be compatible wit soldiers in MOPP IV..<BR>"	Electromagnetic compatibility and spectrum assignment.  MTS is considered mission essential and must be able to survive electronic countermeasures (ECM), electronic counter-countermeasures (ECCM), electronic magnetic interference (EMI), high-altitude electro-magnetic pulse (HEMP), manmade electro-magnetic pulse (EMP), high powered microwaves (HPM), and nearby lightening strikes in Block 1.  The system must not interfere with, or be interfered with, by other equipment or systems.<BR>"	Training Concept.  The training program for the MTS will be implemented and accomplished in three phases:  new equipment training (NET), institutional training, and unit (sustainment) training.  The training events and activities as defined in the System Approach to Training (SAT) process, will be executed in the development of training for the MTS.  The materiel developer will develop a complete system Training Support Package (TSP) and training products to support all phases of training for the MTS.<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>11) Your webpage states major objectives as:<BR><BR>a)  Enhanced signal security  Response:  LPI/LPD<BR>b) Vehicle diagnostic and prognostics integration (no response required)<BR>c) ABCS interfaces  Response:  FBCB2, BCS3, JBFSA<BR>d) Embedded GPS  SASSM?  Response:  Currently, GB Gram (Military GPS) card is imbedded in the MT 2012<BR>e) Embedded RFID interrogator  Response:  Currently an RFID interrogator is imbedded in the MT 2012.<BR><BR>

<p style="MARGIN: 0in 0.5in 0pt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The Department of Homeland Security Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Individual Assistance Division (IA) mission is to ensure that individuals and families that have been impacted by disasters and major catastrophic events have access to the full range of FEMA programs in the most expeditious and cost effective manner available. FEMA's goal is to provide the highest level of quality in these services as possible to such individuals. In order to accomplish this goal, FEMA has a requirement for contractors to provide comprehensive emergency management, project management and program management services as well as construction, architectural, and engineering capabilities to support the IA mission in four areas:&nbsp; (a) Housing Support&nbsp; (b) Construction Services, (c) Mass Care, and (d) Planning, Staffing and Logistics Services. Contractor support must be available for multiple disaster missions of any size, anywhere within their awarded regional sector to provide disaster relief services to individuals within the United States and its territories.&nbsp; While these contracts are generally intended to support response to an initial recovery from high impact larger Presidentially-declared Major Disaster related missions, the contracts do not preclude FEMA from contracting with others, such as local or small businesses when market research or available information indicates that such entities have the capacity and capability to meet FEMA's requirement(s). FEMA's Acquisition strategy is to divide the U.S. and it's territories into four regional Sectors as follows:&nbsp; Alpha Sector (FEMA Regions 8, 9 and 10); Bravo Sector (FEMA Regions 1, 2 and 5); Charlie Sector (FEMA Regions 6 and 7); and Delta Sector (FEMA Regions 3 and 4).&nbsp;&nbsp; The solicitation will therefore allow for four (4) separate (single) IDIQ hybrid cost reimbursement, fixed priced, and time and materials contracts to be awarded; and each successful offeror will be assigned responsibility for one of the sectors indicated above. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Each contract shall be a five (5) multiple-year contract (one base plus four one-year each options.)</span></strong> After the award of the four (4) IDIQ contracts to separate contractors for a determined sector, no further competition for subsequent task orders will take place, unless the Government determines that an awardee cannot perform the services and terminates the contract; the impact of a single disaster/catastrophic event is or becomes so overwhelming that it exceeds the ability, capacity, or capability of a sector awardee in a manner that the sector awardee cannot perform the services in the time and at the quality level and quantity required by the Government: in such a case, the Government reserves the right to compete the task order among the other three (3) awardees to meet the shortfall(s), or conduct an other than full and open competition to award a contract for services in that sector, to one of the other three (3) vendors, in a case where a sector awardee's contract has been terminated. The NAICS code applicable to this solicitation is 561210 Facilities Support Services. The small business size standard is $32.5 million.&nbsp;&nbsp; This requirement will be competed using FAR Part 15 procedures. The Request for proposal is anticipated to be released on February 19, 2009.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Any question regarding this pre-solicitation must be in writing and will be answered during the release of the RFP.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Questions/Answers: contractors shall submit all questions regarding this requirement by email to Zahra Hashmi, the Contract Specialist at <a href="mailto:zahr.hashmi@dhs.gov">zahra.hashmi@dhs.gov</a>, and copy <a href="mailto:charles.clemons@dhs.gov">charles.clemons@dhs.gov</a>.</span></p>

A two-phase fulfillment approach is envisioned with each phase anticipated to result in a separate contract award.

An industry day is scheduled for March 6, 2009 from 1:00-4:00 PM, Eastern Time at 301 7th Street, SW, Washington, DC in the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) Building in the lobby level GSA auditorium.

At the conclusion of industry day, comments and questions to the draft RFP shall be submitted in writing to the following address:  Biowatchgen3@hq.dhs.gov by March 10, 2009, 12:00 Noon, Eastern Time.  Responses to the comments and questions submitted to the draft RFP will not be provided.  
 
The anticipated acquisition strategy for this requirement is full and open competition in accordance with FAR Part 15.
