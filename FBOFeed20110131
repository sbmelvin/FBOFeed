As life cycle manager, CBMS implements, manages, and oversees activities associated with the acquisition, development, production, fielding, sustainment, and disposal of its products. The Joint Vaccine Acquisition Program (JVAP) is a product management office within CBMS that focuses on development and procurement of biological defense vaccines.<BR><BR>This Presolicitation Notice addresses service and support requirements for accountability, storage, testing, disposal, maintenance, security, handling, packing, and transportation of government owned CBD materiel, including Biological Select Agents and Toxins (BSAT) and materiel subject to regulations administered by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  Such materiel includes, but is not limited to, Investigational New Drug (IND) vaccines, infectious agents, prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, viruses, fractions of cells, and inorganic and organic chemicals. The Contractor will offer and show evidence of the following capabilities:<BR><BR>1. Storage:<BR><BR>Contractor will provide storage services in accordance with current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) standards  for government owned CBD materiel and paper records/files.  The Contractor shall provide the necessary qualified personnel, facilities, material, equipment, and services to ensure proper storage. The facilities must comply with FDA standards for storage and handling of medical materiel, as well as state and local requirements for commercial storage/warehouse facilities.  Facilities and/or associated equipment such as refrigeration units/freezers must be qualified/validated and in a fully operational condition.  Contractor must have a routine monitoring and preventive maintenance program for equipment.  Back-up refrigerators and freezers must be available in case of equipment failure, and back-up electrical power generation must be available in case of interruption of electrical utility service.  All equipment/storage units must have evidence/records of current qualification/validation from certifiable technical sources, and meet cGMP standards for handling and storing paper and vaccine products.<BR><BR>The Contractor shall store and maintain materiel in both temperature controlled and ambient environmental conditions.  Contractor shall provide a suitable environment with humidity control that will prevent molding or exposure to moisture.  The Contractor shall provide a detailed assessment of their current, available repository storage space to meet the following minimum requirements for storage space and associated temperature ranges:  See Table 1.<BR><BR><BR>Table 1 Storage Temperature and Space Requirements<BR><BR>-20 or -30 degrees Celsius 	1800 cubic feet (or 60 cubic meters)<BR><BR>-80 degrees C		 	100 cu ft (or 3 cubic meters)<BR><BR>Ambient 			1 cu ft (or 0.03 cubic meters)<BR><BR>Ambient (Paper Records Storage)	550 cu ft (or 15 cubic meters)<BR><BR>Liquid Nitrogen		3 cu ft (or 0.1 cubic meters)<BR><BR>2 degrees C to 8 degrees C 	30 cu ft (or 1 cubic meter)<BR><BR>Additional unspecified capacity, probably freezer space at -30 degrees Celsius, that may be required<BR>				1000 cu feet (or 30 cubic meters)<BR><BR>Excluding paper records, the inventory contains approximately 100,000 containers of material identified as approximately 330 inventory items.  Of the approximately 100,000 containers, approximately 3,500 contain material identified as Biological Select Agents and Toxins (BSAT), subject to strict regulatory controls as detailed below in item 5. <BR><BR>Ambient controlled room temperature shall be provided for long term storage of paper records/archived data in approximately 200 cardboard file boxes.  Given the need to protect documents from moisture, any fire suppression system in document storage areas must not employ water.  <BR><BR>Contractor will take 100% inventory on annual basis and will supply inventory records in Microsoft-compatible files, preferably Excel spreadsheets.  Inventory records will be updated after each and every addition to, or subtraction from, the inventory.   <BR><BR><BR>2.  Testing:  <BR><BR>Contractor will test materiel that includes, but is not limited to, biodefense vaccines manufactured under Investigational New Drug (IND) regulations per Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Part 312 regulations.  Said vaccines help sustain an immunization program that provides possible protection from tularemia, Eastern Equine Encephalitis (EEE), Western Equine Encephalitis (WEE), Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis (VEE), and Q fever.<BR><BR>Contractor will test biodefense vaccine and related materiel in accordance with 21 CFR Part 610 and Good Laboratory Practice for Nonclinical Laboratory Studies (GLP; 21 CFR Part 58) standards.  The required testing includes sterility testing (21 CFR 610.12, with tests of bacteriostasis and fungistasis) and specialized potency testing that typically involves administration of test articles to test animals, followed by challenge with infectious agents.  Only challenges administered by injection are expected, though challenges by inhalation or ingestion could conceivably be needed.  Most of the infectious agents (those of EEE, VEE, tularemia) used as challenge material are Select Agents within the regulatory jurisdiction of the Select Agent Program administered by the U.S. Departments of Health and Human Services (HHS) and Agriculture (USDA), which published final rules for the possession, use, and transfer of select agents and toxins (42 C.F.R. Part 73, 7 C.F.R. Part 331, and 9 C.F.R. Part 121).  The Department of Defense has imposed additional requirements for contracts, performance of which requires access to Biological Select Agents and Toxins (BSAT).  See item 2, below.  Generally, two lots of each vaccine will be tested every 12 to 18 months.  Potency testing of Q fever vaccine does not involve challenge with the infectious agent; it involves immunization of test animals and serological analysis by the complement fixation technique.  Potency testing of the Q-fever skin test antigen involves immunization of test animals and observation and measurement of the reaction of immunized animals to intradermal administration of test articles. <BR><BR>Contractor may be required to test vaccines for moisture; endotoxin; or other substances, as   may be specified by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in communications to the IND sponsor.<BR><BR>Contractor may be required to manufacture challenge material (infectious agents) for potency or other testing.  Such manufacture may be needed if challenge materiel currently in storage is exhausted or proves to be unsuitable for testing.  In general, manufacture would involve the cultivation of bacteria or viruses, enumeration by standard microbiological methods, determination of virulence, dispensing into containers suitable for long term cold storage, and submission to the government of documentation of procedures employed and results obtained.<BR><BR>The government will supply draft test protocols for potency testing, but protocols could be subject to change during contract performance.  The government will not supply standard operating procedures for common biological research techniques such as animal husbandry, inoculations, or enumeration of bacteria or viruses; instead, the contractor will need to develop or acquire such procedures.  The government will supply the services of study sponsor and IND sponsor's representative.  The approvals, evidenced by signatures, of the government study sponsor and IND sponsor are required as part of testing protocol development.  Similarly, the government will review draft test reports for compliance with regulatory standards before accepting the reports.  <BR><BR>Contractor will submit animal use protocols for review and approval by the Animal Care and Use Review Office (ACURO) of the U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command.<BR><BR>See Table 1, below for the annual testing requirement.<BR><BR>Table 1 Outline of representative annual testing requirement:  The contractor must have the capability to perform all of these tests each year, but the actual testing to be done by the contractor each year may be as low as zero tests because the government may choose to perform some testing in its own facilities, or for other reasons.<BR><BR><BR>EEE vaccine potency, test 2 lots<BR>VEE vaccine (C-84) potency, test 2 lots<BR>VEE vaccine (TC-83) potency, test 2 lots<BR>WEE vaccine potency, test 2 lots <BR>Tularemia vaccine (LVS) potency, test 2 lots<BR>Q-fever vaccine potency, test 2 lots <BR>Q-fever Skin Test Antigen potency, test 2 lots<BR>EEE vaccine sterility, test 2 lots<BR>WEE vaccine sterility, test 2 lots<BR><BR>For a summary of the testing procedures, see Number 5 below:<BR><BR><BR>2. Distribution:<BR><BR>Contractor will distribute designated materiel from the storage location to DOD - directed destinations.  The anticipated locations are:  (1) vaccine testing facilities; approximately 3-5 controlled temperature shipments per year; each shipment will contain approximately 10 vials of vaccine (vaccine vial capacity is generally from 1 to 20 milliliters) and may be accompanied by up to approximately 5 vials of infectious agent which alternatively may be shipped separately; (2) U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases, Frederick, MD; approximately 3-5 controlled temperature shipments per year; each shipment will contain approximately 200 vials of vaccine and may be accompanied by up to approximately 5 vials of infectious agent which alternatively may be shipped separately; and (3) U.S. Army Medical Materiel Development Activity (USAMMDA), in Frederick, MD; approximately 2-4 shipments of boxed paper records per year, with each shipment being approximately 1 to 10 boxes, and return boxed paper records to the Contractor's storage facility once USAMMDA is finished using them.  See Table 2.  Once document conversion (item 4, below) has been accomplished, such shipments may not be required.<BR><BR><BR>Table 2 Estimated Annual Distribution Requirements<BR><BR>To testing facilities		3-5 shipments of vaccine (non-hazardous)<BR>				3-5 shipments of infectious agent (may be Select Agents)<BR><BR>To USAMRIID		3-5 shipments of vaccine<BR><BR>To USAMMDA and return	2-4 shipments of boxed paper records<BR><BR><BR>The Contractor shall pack and ship all materiel, including biohazardous materiel, in accordance with applicable FDA guidance and regulations, in addition to guidance provided in United States Pharmacopeia Chapter (1079) Good Storage and Shipping Practices, and the Parenteral Drug Association Technical Report Number 39, Cold Chain Guidance for Medicinal Products:  Maintaining the Quality of Temperature-Sensitive Products through the Transportation Environment.<BR><BR>For shipments containing infectious material or Biological Select Agents and Toxins (BSAT), the Contractor shall comply with relevant Army security standards.  Such shipments require transportation protective services (for ground shipments, certified HAZMAT 6.2 carrier, 2 HAZMAT-qualified drivers, alert button on vehicle that meets Defense Transportation Tracking System requirements, and drivers cleared at the "secret" level).<BR><BR>All materiel shall be continuously maintained within specified temperature range(s) until delivery to final destination.<BR><BR>Contractor will provide documentation of temperature during transit.  Contractor must submit records of such transfer to the government, including temperature records and a statement identifying equipment, procedures, and personnel involved in the transfer.<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>3. Disposal:<BR><BR>Contractor will dispose of material no longer needed by the government.  Comply with applicable federal, state, and local regulations of waste, including waste that is biohazardous.  The government estimates that approximately 10% of the material currently stored may be subject to disposal each year.<BR><BR><BR>4. Paper to Electronic Document Conversion:<BR><BR>Contractor will, for all or some of the documents stored in approximately 200 boxes, convert the text into electronic form by storage in Portable Document Format or other suitable electronic format to be selected by the government.  Assuming 2,500 sheets of paper per box, the number of sheets is approximately 500,000.  Since some sheets may have content on both sides, the number of pages to be converted may be as high as approximately 1 million.  The indexing and file naming requirements have not been determined, but will be available in the Request for Proposal.  The contractor will deliver the electronic files to the government.<BR><BR><BR>5. Compliance with Regulations of Biological Select Agents and Toxins (BSAT): <BR><BR>Contractor will, in all relevant activities, conform to the final rules for the possession, use, and transfer of select agents and toxins (42 C.F.R. Part 73, 7 C.F.R. Part 331, and 9 C.F.R. Part 121). In addition, conform to Department of Defense Directive 5210.88; Department of Defense Instruction 5210.89; and Army Regulations 50-1 and 190-17, all of which impose requirements that go beyond the regulations administered by the Select Agent Program.  Of particular note, the DoD requires the establishment of a Biological Personnel Reliability Program at each facility in which access to BSAT is required for contract performance.  Contractor will participate in Surety Management Reviews of compliance with BSAT regulations (estimated frequency, 1 per year; approximately 3 days in duration) and will support inspections by a team from the office of the Army Inspector General (estimated frequency, 1 per year, alternating with the Surety Management Review; approximately three (3) days in duration).<BR><BR>6. Transition:<BR><BR>Contractor must have appropriate licenses and certifications at federal, state, and local levels.  Any offeror proposing to use storage facilities other than those of the incumbent storage contractor must transfer materiel from the incumbent's storage locations to those of the new Contractor.  Such transfer must comply with Select Agent program regulations, DoD regulations for biological surety, and regulations and standards associated with the movement of medical materiel.  Contractor must submit records of such transfer to the government, including temperature records and a statement identifying equipment, procedures, and personnel involved in the transfer.  Contractor will have one calendar month to effect a transition, counting from the date of contract award.  A Site Visit may be required to verify statements.<BR><BR>7. Reporting:<BR> <BR>Report on a monthly basis the following:  (a) inventory of stored items, with additions or subtractions from inventory clearly noted; (b) material distributed; (c) material disposed of; (d) number of pages converted to electronic form; (e) status of compliance with biological surety regulations, clearly identifying progress on items needing correction, if any; and (f) progress on transition, if applicable.<BR><BR>Contractor will report as required by BSAT regulations.<BR><BR>Contractor will report test results in accordance with GLP standards.<BR><BR>Contractor will report, on a monthly basis in Microsoft Word or compatible format, the following:  (a) inventory of stored test articles, with additions or subtractions from inventory clearly noted; (b) status of testing; and (c) status of compliance with biological surety regulations, clearly identifying progress on items needing correction, if any.<BR><BR>Report on an annual basis a summary of the information transmitted regularly on a monthly basis, as well as issues that have arisen.<BR><BR>Report issues promptly (within 24 hours) as issues arise.<BR><BR>Report any inventions made in the course of contract performance. <BR><BR><BR>8.

The Government reserves the right to accept other than the lowest priced offer or to reject all offers.

2. Submittal of offers.

2.1   Offerors submitting proposals for this project should limit submissions to data essential for evaluation of proposals so that a minimum of time and monies will have been expended in preparing information required herein.  However, in order to be effectively and equitably evaluated, the proposals must include information sufficiently detailed to clearly describe the offeror's experience, technical approach, and management capabilities to successfully complete the project.  Proposals should follow in the order of sequence set forth in the Request For Proposal (RFP).  Information provided out of sequence may not be evaluated and may result in the offeror's disqualification from award. Requirements stated in this RFP are minimums.  Innovative, creative or cost-saving proposals that meet or exceed the requirements are encouraged and will be rated accordingly.  Any betterments and/or deviations from requirements should be clearly noted and justified in the proposal.

2.2   Offerors must comply with the detailed instructions for the format and content of the proposal; proposals that do not comply with the detailed instructions for the format and content of the proposal may be considered non-responsive and may render the Offeror ineligible for award.

2.3   Offerors shall submit their Technical and Price proposals in two separate envelopes to the Contracting Office at the VA Butler Healthcare System 325 New Castle Road, Butler, PA 16001, Building 1, 3rd floor, Paul Sims, Chief, Contracting, Room 333W.

2.4   Offerors are required to submit a proposal made up of a Technical Proposal and a Price Proposal.  All proposal materials shall be submitted in binders with a table of contents and tabbed section dividers.  The sections should parallel the submission requirements identified below.  

Volume I: Sections 1 - 4
Volume I: Sections 1-4 shall be submitted in original, three copies, and on a compact disk (CD) to the Contracting Officer. Forms for "Prime Contractor Experience", A/E Team Experience", "Prime Contractor Past Performance", and "A/E Team Past Performance" are included in this document.  Offerors must use these forms as part of the submission. Forms must be typed.  Forms that are handwritten will not be evaluated and will result in a lower rating. Proposed innovative suggestions that would be a cost saving are to be indicated in a separate section of the proposal and tabbed "Innovative Suggestions".  These "Innovative Suggestions" must be typed. Failure to place the required submission information under the appropriate tab (factor or sub factor) and format may result in a lower rating if the evaluators cannot readily find the appropriate information.

3.  Proposal Evaluation Process.  

3.1   A Source Selection Evaluation Board (SSEB) comprised of representatives of the Department of Veterans Affairs will evaluate the proposals. The identities of the SSEB personnel are confidential, and any attempt by the offerors to contact these individuals is prohibited. The evaluation will be based on the content of the proposal and any subsequent discussions required, as well as information obtained from other sources, e.g. past performance information. Offerors are advised that the technical evaluation and rating of proposals will be conducted in strict confidence in that technical/quality proposals are reviewed and rated without knowledge of the price offered. The number and identities of offerors are not revealed to anyone who is not involved in the evaluation and award process or to other offerors. Proposals will be evaluated based on the factors described herein, and award will be made to the responsive responsible offeror whose offer in conformance with this solicitation, results in the best value to the Government, price and other factors considered.

3.2   The evaluation process essentially consists of four parts: Proposal Compliance Review with Responsibility Determination, Technical/Quality Evaluation, Price Evaluation and Cost/Technical Trade-off Analysis.

3.2.1   Proposal Compliance Review: This is an initial review to ensure that all required forms and certifications are complete and that both a technical and price proposal were received.

3.2.2   Technical/Quality Evaluation: The SSEB will evaluate and rate those proposals passing the first review, above. Proposals will be evaluated against the Evaluation Factors and Criteria identified in Attachment A.

3.2.3 Price Evaluation: The CO will evaluate price proposals independent of the technical/quality
evaluation.  The SSEB will not have access to price information until completion of the technical/quality evaluation.

3.2.4 Cost/Technical Trade-off Analysis: After all above evaluations are complete, the SSEB will
compare the relative advantages and disadvantages of technical proposals and weigh against the prices.  Note - Statement of Work (SOW) identifies design requirements and project scope. The SSEB will then consider all factors to select the proposal offering the best value to the Government

They also include school choice decisions for children in elementary and secondary schools, broader issues of parent and family involvement in education through direct involvement with children's schools and out-of-school educational activities, and postsecondary planning activities of school-aged children and their families.  To study these and related issues, the Department has relied on the National Household Education Surveys Program (NHES).  NHES is a set of surveys that have been conducted approximately every two years since 1991.  Since its inception in 1991, the NHES survey was conducted by telephone using Computer Assisted Telephone Interview (CATI) software to collect data from households sampled by Random Digit Dialing (RDD) sampling techniques.</p>
<p>As a result of falling response rates and potential coverage issues, NCES undertook a major redesign of the programming starting in 2009.  The redesign included an initial feasibility test of a two phase mail out - mail back survey utilizing an Address Based Sampling (ABS) in 2009.  This will be followed by a large scale field test in 2011.</p>
<p>A full scale data collection is planned for 2012 and would be scheduled from early January through May.  The data collection will attempt to screen approximately 200,000 households by mail and then conduct a follow up interview by mail with approximately 40,000 households that have a child under the age of 20.  The follow up will be one of three topical surveys depending on the age and school enrollment status of the selected child.   Different mailing and contact strategies will be employed at the screening stage depending on case characteristics, and then at that follow-up interview stage depending on screening approaches used for a given household.  Follow-up interview contact approaches will be based on how cases were contacted during screening mailings so firms will need experience tracking case specific characteristics to tailor mailing package across multiple mailings.  Telephone non response follow up will be conducted at the initial screening phase and follow-up interview phase to boost response rates and handle literacy issues.</p>
<p>Offerors will be expected to identify sampling frames that include mailing addresses and related telephone numbers, draw a sample of addresses that will result in nationally representative samples of children not yet in kindergarten and children in grade K-12, conduct all necessary mailing activities including production of all necessary letters and questionnaires (letters and questionnaires will be developed under separate contract and provided at the outset), and insertion of incentive materials, following up mail nonresponse with phone contacts to conduct phone interviews as needed, converting returned questionnaires and phone interview data into electronic databases, imputing the databases for item nonresponse, developing weights for the data sets, and developing all materials needed to generate proper variance adjustments for the data.  The contractor will also develop codebooks and datafile user manuals along with a detailed methodology report with sufficient information for someone to replicate the study.<br /> <br />The contract will be a small business set aside.  Companies with experience managing large scale, complex, mixed-mode (mail and telephone) household surveys are encouraged to submit offers.    A full description of the proposed methodology and forms can be found in our OMB submission for the 2011 field test http://edicsweb.ed.gov/browse/downldatt.cfm?pkg_serial_num=4351.</p>

Prospective offerors are responsible for inspecting the site and satisfying themselves as to the conditions under which they will work.

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.
<p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Office of Acquisitions (OA), on behalf of the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR), intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive sole source basis to Mary Jo Danton, 9802 Bristol Square Lane, #302, Bethesda, MD 20814-5460 to provide professional services to the NIDCR Division of Intramural Research (DIR).</p>
<p>The NIDCR DIR has a need for expertise in the writing and review of animal research protocols before submission of the monthly agenda for review by a convened meeting of the NIDCR Animal Care and Use Committee (ACUC).  The document reviewer needs to have extensive experience writing scientific publications and editing ACUC documents.  The ACUC editor must have this experience to perform technical review of items submitted for considerations and disposition.  Often new protocols or renewal protocols are rejected or delayed due to poor writing or incompleteness.  The ACUC editor's review comments and corrections will nearly eliminate these problems during the pre-review process.  The ACUC editor's expertise in assisting DIR scientists in the proper technical as well as grammatical preparation of animal research protocols will allow a more efficient use of time for the convened NIDCR Animal Care and Use Committee.  The savings in time to the ACUC will allow greater scientific productivity especially for the majority scientific members of the ACUC.</p>
<p>The sole source determination is based on the fact that Dr. Danton has extensive experience working with the NIDCR ACUC as the sole editor for the past 8 years.  She has been active in scientific research for 23 years and is also the author or co-author on 17 publications and 8 abstracts.  She has been responsible for managing and reviewing packets of patent documents as well as the detailed writing and review of office actions and restrictions.</p>
<p>The period of performance will be from 02/14/11 - 12/31/11 with potential option years 1-4.</p>
<p>The delivery point is the National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR), Bethesda, MD.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 561410 and is a small business set aside. The acquisition is being conducted under FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, therefore the requirements of FAR Part 6, Competitive Requirements, are not applicable and the resultant purchase order will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-49 (January 24, 2011).</p>
<p>Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this synopsis by February 4, 2011 at 3:00pm Eastern Standard Time.  The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct future competitive procurements.</p>
<p>Inquiries to this announcement, referencing synopsis number NHLBI-CSB-(DE)-2011-089-JML, may be submitted to the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, Office of Acquisitions,   COAC Services Branch, 6701 Rockledge Drive, Room 6151, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-7902, Attention:  Jonathan Lear.

<DESC><br />The Naval Research Laboratory intends to negotiate on an other than full and open competition basis with Object Geometries Inc., Billerica, MA for a 3D Polymer Printing System.
<p>A. Objet's Connex PolyJet system is the only 3D printing system known to have the ability to jet two distinct model materials in many preset combinations. These unique capabilities enable double injection products to be simulated early in the product design process, directly reducing the costs and risks associated with creating the complex molds for double or co-injection processes. <br />B. No other manufacturer can supply a 3D printer with the following capabilities: <br />C. All equipment must have the ability to operate as one complete system within an office environment. The selected vendor must have the knowledge to integrate the system into the existing network. <br />D. Vendor must also have the complete knowledge of the hardware and the capability to connect and install the 3D Printer System and its components (i.e., Host Workstation, parts cleaning station, and 3D Printing System).<br />E. All equipment must be delivered with appropriate operation manuals and installed by chosen vendor's authorized/certified "field engineer.<br />1. Mixed parts - Platforms printed with multiple model materials; eliminating the need to design, print and glue together separate model parts to make a complete model, leading to dramatic savings in printing and post-processing time. <br />2. Digital/Composite Materials - Composite materials made up of two model materials integrated in specific concentrations and structures to provide the required mechanical properties. Digital materials enable closely resembling the target product design and printing of a complete product, of virtually any complexity, in a single build process.<br />3. Mixed Trays - Tray of parts printed with different model materials in a single build: saves time on materials replacement and provides an answer for multiple users. Part and assembly versatility, system productivity.</p>

<DESC>In 2008 the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) established the Human Social Culture Behavior (HSCB) Modeling Program. The mission of this six-year program is to research, develop, and transition technologies, tools, and systems that will help operations planners, intelligence analysts, operations analysts, and wargamers represent, understand, and forecast socio-cultural behavior at the strategic, operational and tactical level. The HSCB Program has the following objectives:<br />&bull; Advance understanding of the influence of socio-cultural factors on behavior as it applies to military-relevant contexts and environments, and provide empirically validated theories that can be instantiated in computational models.<br />&bull; Provide new methods and technology, validated computational models, and software to assist warfighters and others in considering socio-cultural behavior factors for analysis, planning, and operations.<br />&bull; Develop methods and tools for flexible delivery of training of socio-cultural knowledge, skills, and abilities at tactical and operational levels.<br />&bull; Develop methods and tools for the collection, generation, standardization, integration, and transfer of socio-cultural data for use in computational models and decision support systems<br />Cutting across all of these objectives is the core goal of the HSCB Program, to support the integration of methods and tools developed into existing systems so as to provide the warfighter with improved capabilities to operate in a varied and dynamic socio-cultural behavior landscape.
<p>The four topic areas identified in the BAA support the four objectives above and have been broken out into Applied Research and Advanced Technology Development focus areas; however the topics are not considered to be mutually exclusive and White Papers and proposals that address multiple topics are encouraged.</p>

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>1. DESCRIPTION
The John A. Volpe National Transportation Systems Center (Volpe Center) announces a Request for Qualifications for Architect and Engineering (A&E) firms interested in contracting with the Volpe Center to provide A&E services for environmental projects outside of New York and New England.  The objective of this procurement is to acquire A&E services in support of the Volpe Center in two major environmental compliance areas:
?	Area 1:  National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) Compliance?	Area 2:  Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), and other (non-NEPA) Compliance.  
A&E services in the above two environmental compliance areas may include tasking related to air pollution; safe drinking water; wastewater and storm water; solid waste management; hazardous and toxic waste management, pollution prevention, waste reduction & recycling; emergency planning and community relations/right-to-know; soil, groundwater and surface water; natural resources and endangered species; historic and cultural resources; underground and above ground storage tanks; asbestos; lead-based paint; radon; pesticides; environmental noise; environmental aspects of the occupational safety and health act; environmental program support; environmental compliance reviews; environmental management and information systems; energy and water conservation and management; environmental risk assessment; environmental performance measures; field activities; surveys and mapping; submittal reviews; meeting support and/or other related support. 
Additionally, the (non-NEPA) compliance work may include tasking in any of the environmental specialties identified above.  
The Volpe Center supports work in these environmental compliance areas for a variety of sponsors including the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the National Park Service (NPS) as well as other Federal and state agencies.  The nature of the work is best illustrated by two ongoing projects, the FAA and NPS Air Tour Management Program that is an Area 1 type project and EPA?s Libby, Montana Asbestos Project that is an Area 2 type project.  	2. EXISTING PROJECT INFORMATION: The National Parks Air Tour Management Act of 2000 requires the Federal Aviation Administration, in conjunction with the National Park Service, develop an Air Tour Management Plan (ATMP) to regulate commercial air tour operations for each unit of the National Park System or abutting tribal land where operations occur or are proposed. An Environmental Assessment or Environmental Impact Statement will be completed for each ATMP pursuant to the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). An Offeror must have the capability to work at twelve or more parks simultaneously, in remote locations, across a vast geographic area, and to provide a wide variety of architect and engineering skills for program management, environmental analysis, and NEPA compliance. The Libby Asbestos Project requires architect and engineering support for the development of health and safety plans, conduct of sampling, air monitoring, analysis, engineering design, community involvement activities, and construction oversight. An Offeror must have the capability to support simultaneous activities at multiple Libby removal sites frequently having short turnaround times and also have significant multi-disciplinary on-site and off-site professional resources assigned to the project. The majority of the work will be performed throughout the contiguous United States; however, travel to Alaska and Hawaii may be required. The contractor(s) shall provide the necessary personnel, facilities, materials, equipment, and services as described by individual task orders in areas described above, as well as other related environmental services
3. SELECTION CRITERIA: The selection process will be in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 36 and Transportation Acquisition Regulation Part 36. The following selection criteria, listed in order of importance, will be used in the evaluation of the A&E Offerors: (1) Professional qualifications of the proposed team necessary for satisfactory performance of required services. At a minimum, key personnel are defined as Program Manager, Finance and Administration Manager, no more than 2 Project Managers for Area 1, no more than 2 Project Managers for Area 2, no more than 2 Task Order Managers for Area 1 and no more than 2 Task Order Managers for Area 2 to be assigned to this contract. (2) Specialized experience and technical competence in the type of work required. (3) Capacity to accomplish the work required in a timely fashion. Offerors may be expected to have personnel on-site within one week of each task order award.

<DESC>The Department of Veteran Affairs (VA) is issuing this Request for Information (RFI) in accordance with FAR 15.201(e).  The agency does not intend to award a contract but rather gather capabilities and market information pertinent for acquisition planning.

DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENT

The Office of Policy and Planning (OPP) occupies a central role in supporting the Secretary's Transformation 21 goals through policy analysis, strategic planning, corporate analysis and evaluation, enterprise program management, Veteran data analysis and statistics, actuarial analyses, and collaborative initiatives with the Department of Defense (DoD).  A significant amount of this support work is performed through the use of expert contractor support which provides critical market-based skills that augment the in-house activities above, as well as direct support of VA Central Office (VACO) clients as they implement their own Transformation 21-related initiatives. OPP is planning a comprehensive procurement solution that allows access to this critical contract support in a more efficient and effective manner than what is currently available under the existing patchwork of procurement vehicles currently being used to obtain contractor services.

<DESC><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">REQUEST FOR INFORMATION :</span></strong>
<p>This is a Request for Information (RFI) for market research purposes issued by the C/KC-135 Contracting Branch, OC-ALC/GKCK at Tinker Air Force Base (TAFB). The United States Air Force (USAF) is requesting information on an Advanced Ultrasonic Inspection of Aging Aircraft Structures for the C/KC- 135 model aircraft.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">PURPOSE:</span></strong></p>
<p>The C/KC-135 Aircraft Sustainment Branch Contracting Office (OC-ALC/GKCK), at TAFB is conducting market research to seek out sources capable of developing an Autonomous Ultrasonic Nondestructive Inspection Instrument (AUNDI) to meet all of the requirements as set forth in Table 1 (See attached). The purpose of this RFI is to develop a list of sources and to establish cost estimate. The AUNDI shall be programmed to scan rows of steel fasteners, or the entire skin for corrosion damage on the upper wing skins of C/KC-135 aircraft. The AUNDI addresses both the need for an efficient corrosion inspection system as well as a data management system allowing improved storage and retrieval of inspection data.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY:</span></strong></p>
<p>This RFI is issued solely for informational and planning purposes. It does not constitute a solicitation (Request for Proposal or Request for Quotations) or a promise to issue a solicitation in the future. As stipulated in FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not considered offers, shall not be used as a proposal, and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. This RFI does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. Furthermore, we are not seeking proposals at this time. Responders are advised that the Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI. All costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the responding party's expense.<br />The Government requests that non-proprietary information be submitted in response to this RFI. However, should proprietary information be submitted, it should be marked <strong>"PROPRIETARY",</strong> and will be handled accordingly. The Government shall not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for any proprietary information not properly identified. Proprietary information will be safeguarded in accordance with the applicable Government regulations. Proprietary information or trade secrets should be clearly identified.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">DESCRIPTION:</span></strong></p>
<p>The existing ultrasonic inspection device that is currently in place at TAFB takes approximately 400 man hours, and requires several people to accomplish the task. The C/KC-135 program office is looking for efficiencies that will exponentially reduce the man hours utilized to accomplish the task. Additionally, the C/KC-135 program office is seeking a source to provide an AUNDI system capable of inspecting the upper wing skin of the C/KC-135 aircraft with minimal couplant application. Nominal skin thickness varies from approximately 0.040 to 0.380 inches. The autonomous ultrasonic array inspection system must meet the safety requirements as set forth in Table 1, in accordance with military safety standards, and must function with limited human interface.</p>
<p>The Government is seeking a government off the shelf or commercial off the shelf solution which provides the capability in Table 1.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">RESPONSE:</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Responses shall address the following:</span></p>
<p>1. Developmental schedule (duration from contract award to on aircraft testing completion)<br />2. Estimated developmental cost for each phase. <br />3. Estimated cost of the AUNDI<br />4. The expected reliability maintainability &amp; availability (RMA) of the AUNDI robotic system via Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF)<br />5. Description and rational of proposed system capabilities and operation<br />6. Component lead times (longest lead time only for each system is required)<br />7. Requirements in Table 1.</p>

<DESC>Request for Information (Sources Sought Notice)  

A major objective of the Employment and Training Administration (ETA) is to provide funding for high quality job training and employment services for Americas workforce.  The investment of Federal resources through the award of grants is the primary manner in which ETA drives this effort.  Many of these grants are procured competitively which results in a large number of applications being received.  There are many functions associated with grant competitions including identifying, selecting, and paying panelists for the review of applications.

The U.S. Department of Labor is seeking qualified contractors that can perform the logistics of evaluating resumes, selecting, hiring and paying panelists for the Employment and Training Administration (ETA) Solicitation for Grant Applications (SGA).  ETA is looking for firms that qualify under the Small Business Programs mentioned in Federal Acquisition Regulation Subpart 19.  When submitting your response, please indicate under which programs you meet the criteria.  The NAICS Code is 541611, Management, Scientific and Technical Consulting Services, and the Small Business Standard is $7.0 million.

The following are examples of the areas of expertise that may be needed by the evaluation panelists:

	Delivering services in the Public Workforce Investment System; 
	Analyzing labor market information and research; 
	Administering or teaching in a technical college, a community college or a four year college with an interest in workforce connections; 
	Creating or implementing an apprenticeship program; 
	Creating or implementing a training program focused on career pathways, career clusters, or competency models; 
	Developing or operating training or hiring outreach programs for energy efficiency and renewable energy businesses and related industries; 
	Providing supportive services to individuals engaged in training; 
	Recruitment or retention of out-of-school youth in job training programs; 
	Human resources strategies within a business or industry; 
	Experience and knowledge in implementing training programs with a track record in recruiting, placing and retaining populations with multiple barriers to employment (this population may include but is not limited to: seniors, veterans, displaced homemakers, low-income adults, disconnected youth, limited English proficient persons.) 
	Designing or delivering: 
o	Clinical training in the health care industry; 
o	integrated basic reading, numeracy, writing or English language skills with occupational skills training;

All contractors responding to this RFI must demonstrate their experience in recruiting, identifying, selecting, and managing a large number of professionals with a particular functional expertise.  Pertinent consideration factors include the contractors demonstrated experience in performing the following functions:

1.	Identifying and recruiting a large number of individuals with particular functional expertise in a quick timeframe.

The exhibit must engage the latest technologies from across several industries including GEOINT sciences, audio-visual display, and exhibit design and production all while remaining within budgetary constraints: 2) develop an Exhibit Center that has approximately 350 square feet and 4200 cubic feet designated for the installation of a multi-media communications capability. Additional space internal to the existing room could be negotiated through trades between the new system and the planned briefing theater and analyst workstation areas that currently exist. There are also opportunities to utilize wall space with the Exhibit Center for visual communication installations. The Exhibit Center, with an up to date multi-media exhibit capability, will continue the communications efforts by NGA at the new facility and present NGA as the modern, forward leaning agency that our mission partners have come to depend upon. The development of this updated capability must engage the latest technologies from across several industries including GEOINT sciences, audio-visual display, and exhibit design and production, all while remaining within budgetary constraints. At minimum, the technologies that should be investigated include: full immersion environment engaging real GEOINT data, services, and products including full motion video and immersive video, advanced, high definition sound and video, touch sensitive interactive opportunities to engage GEOINT, intuitive interfaces for output and input and exhibit architecture, materials and design consistent with the NCE and the NGA brand. Additionally, this new capability must be sustainable, and updatable by NGA staff without the need of external contractors. In particular, creation and loading of updated audio and video data must be within the scope of industry standards and existing service contracts at NGA in order to insure that messaging may be regularly updated. GEOINT data used in any way should be in standard formats and use standard software for display.

<p>Notice Type: Sources Sought</p>
<p>Synopsis:</p>
<p>U.S. Department of State's Bureau of Administration, Office of Logistics Management (A/LM), is issuing a Sources Sought request to seek information and capability statements from qualified firms to provide Diplomatic Pouch and Mail services. This request is for planning purposes only and does not constitute an Invitation for Bids or a Request for Proposals. The Government does not reimburse respondents for any cost associated with submission of the information being requested or reimburse expenses incurred to interested parties for responses to this Sources Sought. The purpose of this Sources Sought is to receive feedback and capability statements from industry and is in support of market research.</p>
<p>Background:</p>
<p>This requirement is for the U.S. Department of State (DoS), Bureau of Administration, Office of Logistics Management's (A/LM), whose mission is to support U.S. diplomacy by providing efficient, economical, high-quality logistics and services to customers worldwide, so they, in turn, can create a more secure, prosperous, and democratic world for the benefit of the American people. Simply put, A/LM is the logistics manager for DoS. The vision is to become DoS customers' partner of choice for reliable and innovative logistics and business management solutions for America's diplomacy.</p>
<p>A/LM provides the logistics support needed to sustain those personnel and their organizations directly responsible for carrying out the mission of the Department of State. Though A/LM is in a supporting role, its importance is paramount because the overall mission of DoS could not be accomplished without the material and services support provided by A/LM.</p>
<p>The A/LM exists to support its customers worldwide. Customers are primarily from DoS, such as embassies, consulates, and DoS domestic offices, but also include members of other U.S. Government Agencies involved in foreign affairs and operations. Diplomatic Pouch and Mail (DPM) interfaces with the air cargo industry, the U.S. Postal Service (USPS), the Department of Defense Military Postal Service Agency, citizens, and private wholesale and retail suppliers.</p>
<p>The DPM operation is arguably the largest single federal mail operation outside of the USPS (more than 10 million pounds per year) and its volume is growing. It is, in large part, a multi-agency operation serving about 260 overseas customer locations and jointly funded through an inter-agency council. It is A/LM's expressed desire to provide the highest quality service to its over 20,000 customers, such that when given the choice or when comparisons are made, customers will view A/LM as the premier service provider for all of their logistics support requirements.</p>
<p>The Diplomatic Pouch and Mail Services acquisition provides support to three current lines of business within A/LM: 1) the unclassified diplomatic pouch operations, in a Dulles area 73,000SF warehouse, 2) the classified diplomatic pouch operations, in a Springfield, VA area warehouse of 30,000SF, and 3) the DoS interoffice mail operations to State Annexes in the Washington, DC metropolitan area.</p>
<p><br />Diplomatic Pouch and Mail Services</p>
<p>DoS A/LM plans to award a performance-based professional services contract to lead the effort to deliver diplomatic pouch and mail services to its customers and compliment the work of Agency staff. The applicable NAICS code is 492110 - Couriers and Express Delivery Services.</p>
<p>The objectives of this effort are to:</p>
<p>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Form a cooperative relationship with a contractor to provide proactive solutions, cross-functional training, and values continuous process improvement.<br />&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Provide insight into mail operations and process engineering including a deep understanding of addressing schemes, bar-code technology, mail metering, zip codes and sorting techniques.<br />&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Provide receiving, sorting, pouching and handling resources for processing packages and mail to the correct customer in a timely, consistent, secure, undamaged and accountable way at a reasonable cost.<br />&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Effectively operate Government developed safety and security screening procedures.<br />&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Provide dispatch to Government provided freight forwarders and in the case of classified diplomatic pouch operations, the Diplomatic Courier Service.<br />&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Provide efficient local mail transportation services in the National Capital area.<br />&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Provide efficient integration and utilization of Government provided automated sorting technology over the term of the contract period including letter, flat mail and package sorters and the DoS Integrated Logistics Management System (ILMS), a logistics tracking IT system.<br />&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Align workforce to seasonal volume fluctuations, changes due to sorter automation and ILMS development<br />&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Adjust quickly to emerging terrorist threats affecting diplomatic pouch and mail activities or facilities</p>
<p>Constraints:</p>
<p>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Security -- The workforce deployed to process classified diplomatic pouches will require Top Secret -Sensitive Compartmented Information (TS-SCI) security clearances for the classified pouch operations. TS clearances are required for the DOS interoffice mail operation. The unclassified pouch and mail operation will require background check, however no clearance is required.<br />&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Executive Order 13514 - Federal Leadership in Environmental, Energy, and Economic Performance imposes requirements for "green" contracting. Compliance with this executive order will be assessed and evaluated with respect to the small fleet (currently five vehicles) of mail vehicles the contractor will be responsible to provide and operate. <br />&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Small Business -- effectively utilize subcontract and teaming arrangements to meet various federal program goals for Small Business, Small Disadvantaged Business, Woman-Owned Small Business, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business, and HUBZone Small Business.</p>
<p>As-is conditions:</p>
<p>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Current transportation services utilize three box trucks, three cargo vans and a minivan utilized for 400+ miles and 20 runs per day.<br />&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Current direct labor totals 100+ FTEs in the unclassified pouch operations, supporting the interoffice mail operations and the classified pouch operations.<br />&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Current letter sorter is a Pitney Bowes Olympus II. The parcel sorter and flat sorter are planned to be operational in the base year.</p>
<p>The Government seeks and encourages innovative and creative solutions to meet these objectives.</p>
<p>Period and Place of Performance</p>
<p>The base period of performance will be one year from date of award with four one-year options.</p>
<p>The place of performance will be at Government facilities in the metro DC area. An unclassified mail facility is located near the Dulles airport. A classified mail facility is located near Springfield, VA. Interoffice mail operations are distributed between those two locations and DoS headquarters in Washington, DC where most activity is located and distributed to State Annex mailroom locations within the metro DC area.</p>

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought Notice (SSN) and does not constitute a commitment by the Government. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to conduct market research in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation, Part 10, to identify potential sources to provide the requirement and gather information on current capabilities within the market. All information submitted in response to this sources sought notice is voluntary and the Government will not pay for information requested nor will it compensate any respondent for any cost incurred in developing information provided to the Government. Proprietary information submitted should be marked appropriately. All submitted information shall remain with the U.S. Government and will not be returned.
<p>The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has a future requirement to support advanced development of domestically manufactured, next generation, portable, fully kitted (for operation "out of the box") ventilators through FDA clearance or pre-market approval. The ultimate purpose of the HHS/BARDA ventilator initiative is to eventually procure (to be determined under a separate procurement contract vehicle) advanced ventilators for the Strategic National Stockpile at a cost significantly lower than currently stocked ventilators. Therefore, a future RFP will also request a design to unit cost estimate with a goal of &lt;=$3,000 per unit with tiered volume pricing as a consideration for award and further requires design to cost documentation prior to completion of the contract effort. The ventilator goal is to advance the technology to meet the operational and clinical needs during an all-hazards event (caused by chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear exposure, pandemic influenza, other biological outbreak, or natural disaster) and provide respiratory support for large numbers of severely ill patients. The ventilator must have increased capability to meet operational and clinical needs for treatment of respiratory compromised patients during an all-hazards event in which mass casualties and shortage of experienced care providers may be expected. The device should be able to provide the same standard of performance as current FDA pre-market cleared portable ventilators but with additional characteristics that meet the following recommended requirements; ease of use for an unskilled care provider, increased patient population range from neonate to adult, portability and useable in a non-clinical environment, standard of care safety, stockpiling and maintenance ease, and use in all hazards events. The Government may procure ventilators on a future follow on contract and is interested in defining manufacturing needs through this potential requirement. Therefore, the Government will also require a domestic manufacturing plan addressing the manufacturing processes, production capacity, and ramp up capability to meet emergency surge requirement to supply at least 1700 fully kitted ventilators in one month and to meet a capability goal of at least 10,000 fully kitted units within six (6) months. Domestic manufacturing is required as well and a plan to ensure production capability if and when foreign components / supplies would be challenged during an event.</p>
<p>A potential Offeror must meet the following mandatory qualification criteria:</p>
<p>1. Historical documentation capability of Contractor (or subcontracted manufacturing partner) for at least one manufactured and marketed FDA cleared or pre-market approved ventilator.</p>
<p>2. Domestic manufacturing.</p>
<p>Attached to this notice is a Draft Statement of Work (SOW). All five (5) objectives as stated in the Draft SOW must be satisfied with verifiable documentation provided.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that a Request for Proposal (RFP) will be announced approximately March 2011 with proposals due a minimum of 45 days after RFP issuance. While the mandatory qualification criteria do not have to currently be met, all of the mandatory qualification criteria must be met by proposal submission. Proposals that do not meet the mandatory qualification criteria will not be considered for evaluation. The anticipated period of performance will be 36 months. The Government anticipates making multiple awards.</p>
<p>The Government is seeking qualified small business concerns and seeks to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUB Zone small businesses, service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses, 8(a) small businesses, veteran-owned small businesses, woman-owned small businesses, or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 339112. The small business size is 500 employees. Your response to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition strategy, including whether a set-aside is possible. Teaming arrangements are encouraged. Any organization, especially small business concerns that can perform the work is encouraged to respond.</p>
<p>Respondents to this sources sought notice may identify their interest by submitting a capability statement, including how they plan to meet the mandatory qualification criteria, the five (5) objectives stated in the Draft SOW, an anticipated delivery schedule of the product, and primary contact information at the organization (name, email, address and telephone number) handling this sources sought notice, in the event HHS has additional questions or requires clarification of the submitted information. Responses are limited to 10 pages. Data sets (i.e., tables, charts, graphs) and documents that are pertinent to the response can be submitted as appendices to the primary submission. All respondents and comments to this sources sought notice shall reference 11-100-SOL-00010 and be submitted to Kim L. Hall, Contracting Officer, at kim.hall@hhs.gov by 2:00 PM EST, February 14, 2011.</p>

<DESC>PROJECT TITLE:  Demolish and Repair the roof of Building 416 at Tinker Air Force Base, OK.  <BR><BR>The purpose of this synopsis is to conduct market research on potential sources for a future acquisition of construction services for the subject project.  This is not a request for competitive proposals or quotations. <BR><BR>Interested parties shall be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR), online at https://www.ccr.gov.<BR><BR>Background:  <BR>Building 416 is a 422,500 square foot facility that houses material for the Air Force.   The roof replacement is 10 acres.  Government, Contracted Hires, and Union Employees work in this facility on a 24 hour schedule.   This project received funding based on a RAC 1 safety rating.  RAC or Risk Assessment Codes range from 1 to 3 with RAC 1 as the highest potential for risk, RAC 2 is significant risk, and RAC 3 is marginal risk.   The current roof system is a RAC 1 which prohibits access onto the roof of the facility since the risk of roof failure and falling through is imminent.  Repairs to the roof or the mechanical equipment on the roof are prohibited.   Safety netting has been installed in certain areas inside the warehouse to protect the workers from falling material.  Workers must wear hard hats in the facility at all times. <BR><BR>Requirement:<BR>a. The entire roofing system will be removed with additional structure add to raise the roof systems to accommodate a revised/updated HVAC system for better conditioning of the facility.  The new roof will consist of new metal decking with a built up 3-ply roof system with cap sheet.<BR><BR>b. Construct a fully operating and functioning roof system, assembly, structural framework, fixture or apparatus.<BR><BR>c. The Building Ventilation System will also be upgraded to eliminate dead spots and areas of poor air circulation within the building.  This will require new and additional mechanical equipment both on the roof as well as modifications to the walls of the warehouse to allow additional ventilation.  In addition, a minimum energy savings of approximately 30% over the existing system shall be obtained.<BR><BR>Unique Project Elements:  <BR><BR>a. Restrictions/Phasing:   In addition, to the current safety issues associated with this project, the construction phase will require a Contractor experienced with scheduling and phasing work to maintain a productive schedule.  There will be at least 3 active construction projects ongoing within the facility during this roof replacement: Racking Project, Ventilation Upgrade, and Fire Sprinkler Upgrades.  Each of these projects will require coordination and care so as not to damage newly installed items or impact access to perform work.   <BR><BR>b. Occupied Facility:  The facility will remain occupied and functional during this project.  Union and non-union workers are present in this facility.  Any impact to the functionally or access to the facility requires high level and early coordination for DLA manage to alert/negotiate with labor unions. <BR><BR>c. RAC Rating:  The contractor will need to have a health & safety program to properly schedule/phase this work to protect their worker and building occupants. <BR><BR>The magnitude of this project's price is estimated more than $10,000,000.  Potential sources shall submit a capability statement of no more than six pages in length, which addresses the following key areas: (1) TECHNICAL - Potential sources shall submit a list of recent projects that demonstrate their knowledge and past experience relating to all of the varying types of work described above, particularly in the areas of  construction management of complex multimillion dollar projects involving phasing of work in occupied facilities: workings with multiple customers within a facility to schedule work, safety, and quality control.  Submit only current and past project and client information that is no more than 4 years previous.

<SUBJECT>Shipboard Ballast Water Treatment (BWT) System Approval-Testing Entity and Vessel Partnership
<SOLNBR>HSCG32-11-I-R00006
<RESPDATE>030111
<ARCHDATE>09012011
<CONTACT>Helen R Nelson, Email helen.r.nelson@uscg.mil
<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE FOR THE UNITED STATES COAST GUARD (USCG) RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT CENTER (RDC) IN NEW LONDON, CT. This Request For Information (RFI) is part of a market research effort to assess scientific and technical capabilities that will best address the USCG's need. The USCG RDC is chartered to conduct research, development, testing and evaluation activities. <br /><br />
<p>USCG has worked jointly with the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Environmental Technology Verification program (ETV) to develop a strict protocol for testing full-scale Ballast Water Treatment (BWT) systems at shoreside testing facilities. While it is possible to conduct rigorous tests of the BWT system's biological efficacy under controlled conditions of shore-based testing, these tests cannot mimic the actual conditions of routine BWT system operation aboard a vessel. Therefore, the USCG intends to require shipboard testing of BWT systems as part of evaluations for approval.</p>
<p>The USCG RDC needs to identify testing entities capable of performing shipboard tests of full scale (BWT) systems and vessel owners with vessels that routinely take on ballast in fresh water and have, or will have, installed BWT equipment sufficient to treat all of the ballast water discharged by the vessel. The USCG RDC intends to conduct research to validate and refine a standardized protocol for rigorous shipboard testing of the capabilities of full-scale BWT systems installed aboard vessels. The protocol will address biological efficacy, engineering aspects, and operating requirements and concerns.</p>
<p>In an effort to advance the development of BWT systems, the USCG has implemented the Shipboard Technology Evaluation Program (STEP) which provides an incentive to vessel owners and operators to install and operate experimental or prototype treatment systems with demonstrated potential for effective removal or destruction of organisms in ballast water. For the purposes of STEP, "experimental or prototype" refers to systems that have not been approved by the USCG. Information regarding STEP is available at http://www.uscg.mil/hq/cg5/cg522/cg5224/step.asp. STEP documentation provides recommendations for developing shipboard test plans to aid manufacturers and testers. Under STEP, USCG reviews manufacturers' previous testing results and their plans for future shipboard testing aboard a specific vessel. After review of the prior test results indicating the BWT system's efficacy, and if the proposed shipboard test plan is rigorous, the vessel/BWT system can be accepted into STEP. For the purposes of the planned research to validate and refine shipboard testing protocols, the participating vessel owners may wish to participate in STEP. Regardless, test protocols must be acceptable to the USCG under the review procedures of STEP.</p>
<p>The RDC seeks information from testing entities and vessels operating ballast water treatment systems in fresh water. The RDC is collaborating with USCG Environmental Standards Division (CG-5224) and the Maritime Administration (MARAD) to develop and verify a protocol for testing the efficacy and operating characteristics of BWT systems installed aboard vessels. The RDC needs to assess interest in participation in this research effort, determine schedule availability, and understand the potential costs that will be incurred to conduct this testing.</p>
<p>No decisions regarding selection of entities to participate in the tests have been made. In the future, it is the RDC's intention to conduct several tests and refine testing protocols subject to schedule and cost constraints. Industry responses to this RFI may formulate the basis for a future solicitation.</p>
<p>The shipboard test protocol will draw heavily on the shore-based "ETV protocol" and the testing recommendations in STEP and may be modified based on results of the tests undertaken in this effort. Interested parties can review the shore-based test protocol at the ETV website (<a href="http://www.epa.gov/nrmrl/std/etv/vt-wqp.html#bwtt">http://www.epa.gov/nrmrl/std/etv/vt-wqp.html#bwtt</a>). STEP requirements and information can be found at http://www.uscg.mil/hq/cg5/cg522/cg5224/step.asp.</p>
<p>To participate in this study, testing entity shall be required to have the following capabilities and resources:<br /><br />1) The facilities and equipment for conducting biological analyses to determine concentrations of living organisms in three size-classes ( less than 10 microns, between 10 and 50 microns, greater than 50 microns) at the levels of the proposed USCG discharge standard (specific taxa less than 10 microns - 250 Colony Forming Units/100 milliliters; between 10 and 50 microns - 10 organisms/milliliter; greater than 50 microns - 10 organisms/cubic meter);<br />2) a mix of personnel available for engineering support and for conducting biological analyses according to standard protocols;<br />3) the ability to write and follow a rigorous quality assurance plan that maximizes the production of credible results;<br />4) the capability to implement a vessel-specific test plan in accordance with the protocol being developed;<br />5) the ability to conduct tests, record and analyze data, and generate a report of the results;<br />6) the ability to interact with the developer of the protocol as a technical expert; and<br />7) all applicable permits in place for disposing of treated or augmented water.</p>
<p>To participate in this study, the vessel shall be required to have the following capabilities and resources: <br /><br />1) Commercially operate and ballast/deballast in fresh water;<br />2) have installed or be capable of purchasing/installing (with minimal modification to the vessel), and the capability to operate, a full-scale BWT system capable of working in fresh water;<br />3) have or be willing to install a sampling port within vessel's ballast water discharge piping;<br />4) have or be capable of installing a mechanism for disposal of waste sample water;<br />5) provide access for test team to the vessel, its ballast water piping, and other areas as needed;<br />6) be available for tests of BWT system a minimum of four times over the course of a 12 month period; and<br />7) sufficient trained personnel to operate a BWT system and provide assistance during tests.</p>
<p>The USCG encourages responses from partnerships between testing entities and vessel owners/operators. However, Independent responses from testing entities or vessel owners/operators are also appreciated.</p>
<p>The testing entity shall be required to implement a vessel/system-specific test plan (and provide a quality assurance performance plan) in accordance with protocols for evaluating BWT systems; conduct the tests; record and analyze the data; and generate a final report on the practicability of the test protocol and the performance of the system. The testing entity shall coordinate with the vessel operator regarding schedules and ports of call for the tests. The testing entity shall provide detailed recommendations for revisions of the primary shipboard test protocol.</p>
<p>The vessel shall be required to operate the existing or newly installed BWT system during all normal ballasting operations and document/log times of operation, volume treated, power required, supplies used, ease of operation, problems encountered, and problem resolution.

<DESC>Advance Notice for the <BR>Unmanned Aircraft System Technology Forum<BR><BR>1.  This is a special notice to industry inviting attendance to the Unmanned Aircraft Systems Technology Forum (UAS-TF).  The Government seeks involvement of industry in capturing potential improvement technology for unmanned aircraft systems, either ground sub-systems or air vehicles, including payloads.  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this invitation nor to pay for participation.<BR><BR>2.  The US Army Unmanned Aircraft System Project Office (UAS PO) is inviting AUVSI Pathfinder Symposium industry attendees and other interested industry participants to schedule one-on-one UAS-TF appointments to make brief presentations about technologies related to future payloads, sense and avoid, ground systems and air vehicles.  The industry technology presented is required to be at least a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 5 and a Manufacturing Readiness Level (MRL) 5.  Verbal commitment must be in place that the TRL / MRL 5 exist before scheduling can take place.<BR><BR>Summarizing the guidance found in Chapter 10 of the Department of Defense 2006 Defense Acquisition Guidebook, TRL 5 is defined as component and/or breadboard validation in relevant environment with basic technological components integrated with reasonably realistic supporting elements so it can be tested in a simulated environment.  Examples include "high fidelity" laboratory integration of components.<BR><BR>Summarizing the guidance found in Chapter 4 of the Defense Acquisition Guidebook, MRL 5 is defined as capability to produce prototype components in a production relevant environment.  Manufacturing strategy is refined and integrated with the Risk Management Plan.  Identification of enabling/critical technologies and components is complete.  Prototype materials, tooling and test equipment, as well as personnel skills have been demonstrated on components in a production-relevant environment, but many manufacturing processes and procedures are still in development.<BR><BR>3.  The intent of the government is to identify technology improvements or new technologies that are at TRL / MRL 5.  This technology improvement may be implemented, in whole or in part, in UAS individual projects according to specific requirements and objectives, but the UAS-TF is not involved with any specific implementation of these technologies.<BR><BR>4.  This special notice seeks to identify interested parties who wish to present new or improved technologies to the Unmanned Aircraft Systems Project Office.  All material presented or discussed must be unclassified.  The UAS-TF and its consultative body include, or may include, Government individuals from the Architecture and Technology Branch of the UAS PO, and subject matter experts from the UAS PO that pertain to the subject matter presented.  No SETA or Contractors will be present; therefore, no NDAs should be necessary.  The Government shall have in place sufficient physical accommodations so that proprietary material may be shown to the Government at the option of the TF presenters.  The UAS PO Security Officers and Legal professionals will be present.  Details related to ongoing or possible future acquisition activities or plans within DoD or any of the Services will not be discussed.<BR><BR>5.  To further facilitate communications and input from interested parties, UAS-TF will be held 16 March 2011, 0800-1600 and 17 March 2011, 0800-1600 at the AUVSI Pathfinder Symposium at the Von Braun Center in Huntsville, AL.  The Government will provide a closed session with the Architecture and Technology Lead and other subject matter experts within the UAS Project Office.  Industry is invited to present to this Technology Forum in a 30 minute appointed block of time, allowing 5 minutes for setup, 20 minutes for presentation and 5 minutes for teardown.  The Government will provide a projector and power outlets.  Presenting company must provide a laptop if deemed appropriate for the presentation.  Government requests five hardcopies of the presentation, which will be closely held and protected at the conclusion of the brief.  The Government will honor appropriate proprietary markings of the presenting company.  Presentations must contain presenters' names and contact info to include email addresses and phone numbers.  Interested parties wishing to participate in UAS-TF should register on or before 11 March 2011 by emailing Jennifer.perritt@us.army.mil.  Please follow email requests with a phone call to Jennifer Perritt at 256 876 5515 to ensure that your contact info and description of technology to be presented has been received.  Appointments are received on a first come, first served basis by receipt of email.  <BR>

<DESC>The 10th Contracting Squadron, United States Air Force Academy (USAFA) Colorado, has received a request for Sole Source purchase of Annual Membership in the Faculty Resource Network at New York University. This contract will be written for a base period of one year with four option years. This notice document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular FAC 2005-49, January 24, 2011. The North American Industry Classification System Code [NAICS] is 813920 and the size standard is $14.0 million.
<p>USAFA requires week-long, discipline specific seminars during June and July for college instructors. Members of the USAFA faculty are required to teach at least every other day during the academic year, creating extremely limited availability to attend seminars except in June and July. In addition, professors participate in research, curriculum development and summer classes. These additional demands make it impossible to allow for maximum faculty participation in other than one-week seminars.</p>
<p>USAFA currently conducts a week-long Faculty Orientation that is mandatory for all members of the faculty. This orientation provides basic instruction in the art of teaching and how to promote learning, but is not discipline specific. USAFA also conducts periodic workshops throughout the academic year and a Course Design Retreat during the summer, none of which is discipline specific. Because instructors are already exposed to a number of general educational seminars, USAFA requires discipline specific seminars to augment their knowledge base within their particular academic areas. Such seminars will avoid duplicative training, provide the faculty with fresh perspectives and improve their ability to provide a top-notch undergraduate learning environment for cadets.</p>
<p>The Faculty Resource Network at New York University is the only organization that could be identified that provides week-long, discipline specific, collegial seminars during June and July. These seminars include, but are not limited to, topical areas within the physical and social sciences, liberal and performing arts, and health and business.</p>
<p>Place of performance will be at New York University, New York, New York.</p>
<p>This synopsis is for notification purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation for bids or proposals. DO NOT submit a bid/quote at this time.</p>
<p>Any offerors believing they can provide the required faculty development seminars that meet all of the features and functions of the requirement described above may provide evidence for consideration. Evidence must support the offeror's claim they can provide all services with properly qualified personnel as identified in the agreement. All qualified sources may submit a response, which if timely received, will be considered by this agency. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether a competitive procurement can be conducted. A determination not to compete this proposed procurement based on response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Responses must be received NLT 5 p.m. Mountain Standard Time on February 3, 2011. Responses received after this will be considered late IAW FAR 52.212-1(f) and will not be evaluated.</p>
<p>The Government does not intend to pay for any information provided under this announcement. Contractors must have a current registration with the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) at http://www.ccr.gov and with Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) at http://orca.bpn.gov .</p>
<p>Questions should be addressed to the Primary POC James Lovely, Contract Specialist, (719) 333-8161 or sent via e-mail to James.Lovely@usafa.af.mil. Alternate POC is Nicole Baert, Contracting Officer, (719) 333-8924, Nicole.Baert@usafa.af.mil.</p>
<p>5352.201-9101 OMBUDSMAN (APR 10)</p>
<p>(a) An ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition. When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official. Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern.</p>
<p>(b) Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution. Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMB Circular A-76 competition performance decisions).</p>
<p>(c) If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the USAF Academy Ombudsmen, <br />Kim Diercks<br />8110 Industrial Drive, Ste 103<br />USAFA, CO 80840<br />Telephone number 719-333-2074<br />FAX 719-333-9018<br />email: kim.diercks@usafa.af.mil</p>
<p>Concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations that cannot be resolved at the MAJCOM/DRU level, may be brought by the concerned party for further consideration to the Air Force ombudsman, Associate Deputy Assistant Secretary (ADAS) (Contracting), SAF/AQC, 1060 Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC 20330-1060, phone number (703) 588-7004, facsimile number (703) 588-1067.</p>
<p>(d) The ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds the agency.</p>
<p>(e) Do not contact the ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical requirements. Such inquiries shall be directed to the Contracting Officer.</p>

<a href="mailto:sarah.r.wiley@usace.army.mil">USACE HEC, Ft. Belvoir</a>
<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers intends to award a sole source firm fixed price type contract to Maritime Strategies International Ltd (MSI).   The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), in cooperation with the Georgia Ports Authority (GPA), is currently engaged in the conduct of studies to evaluate the need and justification for waterway improvements (notably deepening) for Savannah Harbor, Georgia.  While economic studies and evaluations for improvements will address all vessel types, findings from studies completed to-date indicate the primary beneficiary will be fully-cellular containership operations.  As a consequence of studies completed to-date and related technical review, it has been determined that because the fully-cellular fleet appears to be the most critical to plan formulation, update or revision of associated forecasts or projections are needed due in part to changing economic conditions.  In addition, the world fully-cellular containership fleet is also still evolving in terms of upper echelons of the world fleet as measured by (increasing) capacity and requirements for credible analyses indicate that evolving size delineations within the world fleet need to be further reviewed and evaluated in context for propensity of extending vessel service(s) regarding Savannah, Harbor.  <BR><BR>Prior projections for fully-cellular container fleet service as applied to studies of Savannah were prepared by Maritime Strategies International (MSI).  Estimates prepared by MSI for subject studies were employed as an input for assessment of potential fleet service frequency and array of vessel size class.  Due to  evolving changes in the world fully-cellular fleet and the notable dynamic of the domestic and international economies from 2007 through to the present (2011) it has been determined that an update of evaluations undertaken by MSI  concerning the world and regional fully-cellular containership fleets as relevant to studies for Savannah Harbor need to be undertaken.  MSI's services are requested in support of what constitutes follow-on work as described given prior involvement and familiarity with typical requirements USACE-sponsored studies and in particular, how they have been conducted to-date for Savannah Harbor.  <BR><BR><BR>Requirements\Tasks<BR><BR>The contractor will review prior investigations for fleet service evaluations as prepared for Savannah Harbor and with efforts to provide update(s) of forecast estimates in similar form or format, compile or assemble data and information needed to credibly reevaluate and  update projections for fleet service at both the world and regional fleet levels with respect to fleet service composition and timing.  While most models developed for ocean-going fleet service projections emphasize general cargo carrying or deadweight (DWT) capacity, needs for studies concerning Savannah Harbor involve not only gross cargo carrying capacity but evaluation across several criteria descriptive of physical size including (but not necessarily limited to)  length, breadth, maximum summer loadline draught, maximum nominal TEU intake, and air draft.  These characteristics are critical to studies related to Savannah due to limitations on channel dimensions, potential restrictions due to bridge clearances, and the direct effort to incrementally analyze needs and economic justification for increased depth(s).  Due to the emphasis of waterway plans for improvement based on increased depth and relationships of vessel breadth versus length, draught, and carrying capacity, the contractor will be required undertake evaluations and develop fleet service projections according to stratification by the aforementioned criteria with an emphasis on vessel breadth or beam, draught, and nominal carrying capacity.  Criteria for stratification respective to breadth shall address grouping according to Panamax (extreme breadth of approximately 98-106 feet and length overall not exceeding 950 to 960 feet), sub-Panamax (extreme breadths notably less than 98 feet, Post-Panamax classifications of  can be termed Generation I (extreme breadth of approximately 120-138 feet), Generation II (extreme breadth of 140 to 152 feet) and New- Panamax (extreme breadth of 152 to 160 feet;  perhaps as much as 168 feet and lengths overall not exceeding 1,200 to 1,220 feet) and new Post-Panamax (extreme breadths exceeding 160 to 168 feet with breadths typically equaling 170 feet or more and lengths overall exceeding 1,220 feet).  Sub-stratification will be according to maximum summer loadline draught (MXSLLD), deadweight tonnage (DWT) and nominal TEU capacity as appropriate.  As with prior work, projections are to be updated or developed based on general assumptions for deployment based on regional carrying capacity without concerns for limitations imposed by depth.  Adjustments to fleet service forecasts  based on depth will be undertaken by USACE based on application of USACE aggregate vessel operating costs and efficiencies associated with increased waterway system depth as deemed appropriate. <BR><BR>Due to potential concerns for evaluation of maximum ship size (as measured by TEU carrying capacity) that may or could service Savannah Harbor the contractor will include particular investigations for hull designs with maximum draughts of 47 to 50 feet with quantification of associated physical dimensions (breadths, length, and airdrafts, etc.) in addition to evaluation of vessels with split versus single accommodations that are projected to have breaths, lengths, air drafts, and maximum draughts which could, with sufficient supportive measures (i.e., tug assistance, tidal advantage, etc.), be generally accommodated at Savannah Harbor (i.e., maximum airdraft of 180 to 185 feet, maximum breadth of approximately 140 to 148 feet and lengths overall limited to approximately 1,180 feet or less).<BR><BR>Respective to estimated or projected service frequencies, the contractor shall also provide estimate(s) as to the number of unique or individual hulls by draft or capacity class required to support the number of vessel calls projected for any given year.  Also required by delineated class of containership is an estimate of the percentage of carrying capacity each class represents of total Savannah trade each forecast year in addition to estimation of capacity allocated to Savannah along the itinerary (where practical or possible).<BR><BR>Respective to timeframe or horizon for future projections the contractor shall evaluate information and data for short, interim and long-term trends to formulate projections for a base horizon of fifteen (15) to twenty (20)  years into the future (beginning with a base year of 2010; with the lower bound being the maximum horizon generally acknowledged within the industry for formulation of described projections) with continuation or mathematical extrapolation of terminal year forecast estimates based on extrapolation of trend statistics an additional ten to fifteen years into the future. <BR><BR><BR><BR>Deliverables & Schedule or Time Allowances for Delivery<BR><BR>The contractor will produce a written report of sufficient detail and content to substantiate findings and conclusions. Also included will be a summarization of fleet service projections in table format delineated by appropriate detail of physical characteristics.   Content will include general identification of data and information sources employed for analysis and formulation of updated projection estimates.  Also included will be discussion as to how prior estimates or projections compared to updated projections with discussion as to associated factors and influences resulting in any applicable change of estimates.  It is anticipated that explicitly compensated travel on the part of the contractor will not be required therefore no associated allowances are included in the scope of work.<BR><BR>This is a special notice prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii), Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  However, any firm that believes it can meet this requirement may give written notification to the Contracting Officer within 10 days from the date of publication of this announcement.  Supporting evidence must be in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to comply with the requirement.  Responses received will be evaluated; however, a determination by the Government to compete the proposed procurement based on the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  If no responses are received, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers will proceed with awarding a Firm Fixed Price contract to MSI for Acquisition of Professional Services for Review, Evaluation & Update of Existing and Projected Physical Characteristics & Trends for the World Fully-Cellular Containership Fleet & the Fully-Cellular Containership Fleet Projected to Serve the Port of Savannah, Georgia.  These services will be provided to the US Army Corps of Engineers, Institute of Water Resources, Alexandria, VA.

<p><br />PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer.</p>
<p>The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made by the Contracting Officer. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:</p>
<p>Factor 1 - Provider Capability</p>
<p>1a. This factor is met when the Offeror provides evidence they are a telecommunications company which owns most of its own facilities such as switching equipment, transmission lines and infrastructure, having the capability to provide Primary Rate Interfaces (PRI), Direct Inward Dial (DID), and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Factor 2 - Local Communications Services. This factor pertains to switch and PBX sites only.</p>
<p>This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a SITE-SPECIFIC diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix 10 requirements. Reference generic example diagram in Appendix 10.</p>
<p>Factor 3 - Enhanced 911 Service.</p>
<p>This factor is met when the Offeror presents a detailed plan for interfacing and complying with State 911 requirements that meets the following criteria:<br />[a] A sound methodology of how the Offeror will comply with State 911 interface requirements for commercial subscriber lines and trunks.<br />[b] A sound methodology of their process for updating Automatic Line Identification 911 database.<br />[c] A description of alternating routes of 911</p>
<p>(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will be performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(iv) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />(v) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(vi) If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence"<br />performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer.</p>

This procurement is being issued as small business set aside. Only small businesses under NAICS Code 721110 are being solicited resulting in a COMPETITIVELY awarded purchase order contract. The current size standard for this NAICS code is $30.0 Mil. If you are under the $30.0 mil gross sales then you are considered a small business. (Please update your CCR records to reflex this change) <BR><BR>The contractor shall provide all personnel, equipment, tools, materials, supervision, and other items necessary to provide contracted services as set forth below and in the attachments.<BR><BR>The anticipated award will be a Firm-Fixed Price (FFP)-type contract. Offerors must submit quotes on the full quantity identified. The Government will award a purchase order contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following evaluation factors shall be used to evaluate offers: Technical (Facility Assessment consisting of cleanliness, security,  amenities, availability of meeting space & rooms to support conference requirements), Location and Price.  Award will be based on the best value to the Government. Best value is based on the above criteria in the following manner: Technical is somewhat more important than Location which is somewhat more important than Price.<BR><BR><BR>A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offers specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<BR><BR>QUOTES MUST INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION:<BR>a) a list of three (3) references for a similar stay.

Failure to provide this information with your quote may deem your quote to be TECHNICALLY UNACCEPTABLE and/or NON-RESPONSIVE.<BR><BR>This is NOT a solicitation for Event Planning Services, Conference Planning or Third Party Hotel Resellers.

The gallery will display objects primarily from the Library's Prints and Photographs Division, and specifically from the Swann Collection of Caricature and Cartoon and the Herbert L. Block (Herblock) Collection of editorial cartoons. </span></h2>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">The <strong>Arts Gallery</strong> will be divided into <span style="text-decoration: underline;">three distinct spaces</span>:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>1) The <strong>Swann Gallery</strong> will feature a permanent display of 10-15 facsimiles, that will demonstrate the strength and range of the Swann Collection; 2) The <strong>Herblock Gallery</strong> will be a rotating exhibition space dedicated to displaying 10 original Herblock drawings at all times, with the display to include original artifacts, introductory text and labels changing every 6 months, and 3) <strong>a temporary exhibition space</strong>, which will focus on a theme featuring items drawn primarily from the Swann and/or Herblock collections augmented with other items from the extensive Prints and Photographs collections. The first exhibition will feature recent cartoon acquisitions. </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">&nbsp;</span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">As mandated by agreements with both the Swann and Herblock Foundations, the Swann and Herblock galleries will be opened permanently to visitors, except during installation periods.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The temporary space will be blocked off from the permanent part of the gallery if no exhibition is scheduled.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />FAX: 202.475.3904 <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695</p>

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>EVALUATION-COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999) <br />(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this synopsis/solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: <br />1. Past Performance: In accordance with FAR 52.212-1(b)(10) and the following, the offeror is required to identify past or current contracts for efforts similar to this requirement. Offerors shall provide the information shown below for at least three (3) and no more than five (5) contracts for the same or similar items. Provide as a minimum the following applicable information for each contract:</p>
<p>a. Contract number, Names of contracting parties or agency, point of contact, specifically the Contracting Officer and the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR), including email address and telephone number of these identified individuals.<br />b. Ship name, hull type, length, and displacement.<br />c. Type of availability (dry dock, dockside, etc.) and where performed;<br />d. Original contract commencement and completion dates, actual commencement and completion dates, and explanation of (i.e. reasons for) schedule slippage/extensions, if any;<br />e. Award price and final contract price (award plus growth), including the total number of growth work changes and scope of these changes. <br /><br />Past Performance will look at relevant experience, responsiveness, resources, quality and consistency of services, customer satisfaction, and management.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Price: The total price will be the evaluated price.<br /><br />(a) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. <br />EVALUATION APPROACH</p>
<p>1. An evaluation plan has been established to evaluate the factors set forth below and all proposals shall be subject to evaluation by a team of Government personnel in accordance with the plan.</p>
<p>2. The Government will evaluate each proposal strictly in accordance with its content and will not assume that performance will include areas not specified in the offeror's written proposal. The Government reserves the right to contact other government and commercial sources to validate information submitted in a proposal and to assess capability, past performance and responsibility.</p>
<p>3. Proposals, which are unrealistic in terms of price, will be deemed reflective of an inherent lack of technical competence or indicative of a failure to comprehend the complexity and risks of the proposed contract. Such proposals may be rejected as unacceptable without further discussions. In addition, the Government reserves the right to eliminate from consideration those proposals as deficient in information as to require a major re-write or revision in order to become acceptable.</p>
<p>4. The technical evaluation factors and other factors other than price, when combined, are approximately equal to price. Price will not be a numerically weighted factor in the evaluation of proposals. If the two or more highest rated technical proposals are considered to be essentially equal in terms of technical competence, price may become the determinative factor in making an award.</p>
<p>5. The Government reserves the right to award a contract on the basis of evaluation of the original submission without discussions or call for Final Proposal Revisions. The contract will be awarded as a firm fixed price contract using simplified acquisition procedures.</p>
<p>The Government will award a contract resulting from this synopsis/solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be more advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. For the purpose of this solicitation technical capability and past performance are approximately equal to price.</p>
<p>Potential sources having the expertise and required capabilities are invited to submit proposals that will be considered by the agency. Proposals must fully address all Technical Capabilities Factors and Past Performance. No reference to Price shall be included in the Proposal. Proposals must contain the contractor's Tax Information Number, and DUNS Number. Proposals must be received not later than <br />10 FEB 2011, 11:00 A.M. Local California time. Proposals received after the date and time specified will not be considered. Proposals may be submitted as an attachment to an e-mail addressed to: Brenda.l.lentz@uscg.mil .</p>

<p><br />OMBUDSMAN NOTICE</p>
<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</p>
<p>It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested Parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>INFORMAL FORUM WITH THE OMBUDSMAN. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>FORMAL AGENCY PROTEST WITH THE OMBUDSMAN: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protests to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:</p>

(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:

(A) The tax liability is finally determined.
 The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.

(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.

(ii) Examples. 

(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec.  6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency.
 This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.

(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec.  6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability.
 This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.

<p>3. CLOSING DATE/TIME FOR RECEIPT OF APPLICATIONS: February 15, 2011, 5:00 pm EST</p>
<p>4. POSITION TITLE: Administrative Program Assistant</p>
<p>5. MARKET VALUE: This position has been designated as a "tandem/ladder" position. The highest level of this position is a GS-10; however, USAID intends to fill this position at the entry GS-7 (Salary range: $42,209 - $54,875 per year) or GS-9 equivalent level (Salary range: $51,630 - $67,114 per year). The actual salary of the successful candidate will be negotiated within the pay range of the GS-7 or GS-9 level depending on qualifications, previous relevant experience and work history, salary and educational background. Salaries over and above the top of the pay range will not be entertained or negotiated. Candidates who live outside the Washington, D.C. area will be considered for employment but no relocation expenses will be reimbursed.</p>
<p>The title of the position at the GS-7 and GS-9 levels will be "Administrative Program Assistant". Following at least one (1) year at the GS-7 equivalent grade the candidate may have the opportunity for advancement to a GS-9 equivalent grade. Following at least two (2) years at the GS-9 equivalent grade the candidate may have the opportunity for advancement to the GS-10 level. In order to be advanced to the higher grade, the incumbent must meet the minimum qualifications of the higher grade, and receive an "Excellent" performance rating in the annual performance evaluation. The evaluation must include a statement by the supervisor that the employee is performing successfully at the current grade and is considered ready to perform at the higher grade level. Neither advancement nor extension of the contract is guaranteed.</p>
<p>NOTE: Applicants who submit an application for the GS-9 grade level, but do not meet the minimum qualifications as outlined in this solicitation and as reviewed by the Technical Evaluation Panel (TEC) will not be considered for the GS-7 positions if they have not submitted a separate application for the GS-7 level. Similarly, applicants who apply for the GS-7 position even though they might meet the minimum qualifications for the GS-9 position will not be considered for the higher graded position if they have not submitted a separate application for the GS-9 position. Applicants who are unsure of which grade level they meet the minimum qualifications should submit a separate application for each grade level.</p>
<p>6. PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: 2 years, with 3 one-year options</p>
<p>7. PLACE OF PERFORMANCE: Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>8. STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p><br />POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local, indigenous partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries by providing fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous local partners such as civil society groups (non-governmental organizations or informal community groups), local governments, private businesses, media groups, and others, through identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public understanding and participation in their country's political process.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note: Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical</p>
<p><br />emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided</p>
<p>that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<p>8. STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local, indigenous partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries by providing fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous local partners such as civil society groups (non-governmental organizations or informal community groups), local governments, private businesses, media groups, and others, through identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public understanding and participation in their country's political process.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: <br />http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/</p>

<p><strong>PROPOSALS DUE: 9 Feb 2011 at 12:00pm (CST)</strong></p>

<p>The clause at 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition. The clause at 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statutes Or Executive Orders -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition.

The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:<br /><br />(i) Price<br />(ii) Technical Acceptability</p>
<p><strong>BASIS FOR CONTRACT AWARD</strong> <br />This is a competitive best value evaluation in which the competing offerors will be ranked by price and then determined technically acceptable (LPTA). Certifications and past performance experience will be evaluated in order to determine if the offeror is technically "acceptable". By submission of its offer, the offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements. Unless explicitly noted in the proposal, all offers shall be treated equally except for their prices and technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Offerors must clearly identify any exception to the solicitation terms and conditions and provide complete accompanying rationale. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br /><br /><strong>A. Price Evaluation.</strong> Initially offers shall be ranked according to price, including any option prices if applicable. An offeror's proposed prices will be determined by multiplying the quantities identified in attachment 5 by the proposed unit price for each Contract Line Item Number or Subcontract Line Item Number to confirm the extended amount for each. The extended amounts will be added together to determine the total evaluated price. When applicable, the price evaluation adjustment for HUBZone small business concerns will be applied in accordance with FAR 52.219-4, Notice of Price Evaluation Preference for HUBZone Small Business Concerns, to arrive at an evaluated price. The price evaluation will document (for the offers evaluated under paragraph B below) <br />the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price.<br /><br /><strong>B. Technical Acceptability.</strong> Only the five (5) lowest price offeror's past performance information will be analyzed. This solicitation does not require the submission of a separate technical proposal however; maintenance on the digital secured trunking system located on Barksdale AFB must be performed by a factory trained Motorola technician using only genuine Motorola replacement parts in accordance with the warranty. In order to determine technical acceptability, training certificates are required to be included with past performance information. <br /><br /><strong>(1)Certificates</strong> must indicate training on a Motorola Astro 7.4 Digital Secured Trunking System or higher. Certificates should be submitted for the person who will be performing the actual maintenance. <br /><br /><strong>(2) Past performance</strong> The five (5) lowest price offerors will be evaluated based on (1) their past performance information submittals and (2) data independently obtained from other government and commercial sources. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment as "Go/No Go". The evaluation of the five (5) lowest price offers past performance until an offeror is rated "Go" or until all offerors are evaluated. While the Government evaluation team and the contracting officer will strive for maximum objectivity, the evaluation process, by its nature, is subjective and therefore, professional judgment is implicit throughout the entire evaluation process. <br /><br />Relevant past performance includes, but is not limited to, digital trunking system maintenance experience. Recent past performance consists of contracts, completed or in progress, performed for Federal agencies and commercial customers within the last three (3) years from date of issuance of this solicitation. The purpose of the past performance evaluation is to allow the government to assess the offeror's ability to perform the effort described in this RFQ, based on the offeror's demonstrated present and past performance. <br />Past performance regarding joint ventures, key personnel who have relevant experience, or sub-contractors that will perform major requirements or critical aspects of the requirement will be considered as highly as past performance information for the principal offeror. Offerors with no relevant past or present performance history or the offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned shall receive the rating "No Go," meaning the rating is treated unfavorably. <br />Past performance data required is: contract number, contract performance period, contract award amount, brief description of effort, and government or private issuing activity point of contract/telephone number. <br /><br />C. The government intends to award a contract without discussions with respective offerors. The government, however, reserves the right to conduct discussions if deemed in its best interest.<br /><br />(End of provision)<br /><strong>SITE VISIT INFORMATION<br /></strong>A site visit will be held on <strong>Wednesday, February 2, 2011 at 10:00 am</strong>. Attendees are requested to arrive at the <strong>Contractor's Gate (East Gate), located on Industrial Loop</strong>, <strong>no later than 9:45 am</strong> to be signed onto base. <strong>This is where you will be met.</strong>&nbsp;A guided tour will be given to show the prospective offerors the sites where work is to be performed. This is the only time a site visit will be arranged.<br /><br /><strong>THE GOVERNMENT WILL NOT ACCEPT INCOMPLETE PROPOSALS.</strong> Offers will be evaluated on the prices as offered. The Contracting Officer is not responsible for locating or obtaining any information not identified in the offer. If an offer cannot comply with every requirement, then the offer will not be rated as technically acceptable, and therefore will not be considered.

<DESC>The purpose of this Amendment 0003 to RFP W25G1V-11-R-0013 is to make the following change to the combined synopsis/solicitation, combined synopsis/solicitation Attachment 1, Statement of work, answer offeror questions received and extend the offer due date:  <BR><BR>1.  Reference combined Synopsis/Solicitation W25G1V-11-R-0013, Paragraph 1, and combined synopsis/solicitation Attachment 1, Statement of Work, Paragraphs 1, 3, and 6, DELETE reference to "....technical manual TM 5-807-10, Appendix C1, dated 8/29/86";  ADD:  "....technical manual TM 5-807-10, including Appendices A, B, C and D".    <BR>	<BR>2.  The following offeror questions received are provided with the government's response:<BR>	Q1.  (a) What are the minimum specifications for each of the sign materials:  i) Aluminum - what type of aluminum (.063, .080, .100 etc.?  Is alodine required?  ii) Steel - what thickness/gauge? Is it galvanized?  iii) Vinyl sheeting - Is PVC Panel an acceptable option?  iv) Polycarbonate - what thickness and color is required? <BR>	        (b) Could you provide the thicknesses for each media?<BR>	A1.  The thickness of material is addressed in the Department of the Army Technical Manual TM 5-807-10, Appendix A, Exterior Sign Fabrication and Appendix B, Interior Sign Fabrication.  Pricing shall be provided per material per sign size classification.  Steel sheeting shall be galvanized prior to finishing as stated in Appendix A, Paragraph A-6(b).  Anodizing of aluminum (Paragraph A-6a) and PVC (Paragraph A-2c) is not addressed.  Therefore, PVC is not an acceptable option for vinyl sheeting.  Polycarbonate sheeting is addressed in Paragraph A-6(c).<BR><BR>	Q2.  Could you explain vinyl sheet?  Is it adhesive vinyl or banner vinyl?  <BR>	A2.  Refer to Technical Manual TM 5-807-10, Appendix A, Paragraph A-2c.<BR><BR>	Q3.  Is engineer grade sheeting to be used on all signs or might it vary?  (if type of sheeting changes this will affect the price).<BR>	A3.  Combined synopsis/solicitation W25G1V-11-R-0013 Attachment 1, Statement of Work, Paragraph 5, refers to engineer grade reflective or non-reflective type.  Provide pricing according to the specifications provided.<BR><BR>	Q4.  Is it possible to define the "parts" that we are to include during installation (does this include posts, brackets etc or is it just nuts and bolts)?  These items could vary greatly depending on where the sign is to be installed.<BR>	A4.  Parts include the standard items required to fabricate, print and install the signs.  Refer to Technical Manual TM 5-807-10, Appendices A and B.<BR><BR>	Q5.  Based off the walk through, the modular interior sign systems seem to be a large part of this bid, but I do not see them listed or asked for anywhere on the request.  How should we factor that in our proposal?<BR>	A5.  Interior sign fabrication is addressed in Appendix B of Technical Manual TM 5-807-10.  Signs shall conform to the solicitation statement of work and the Department of the Army Technical Manual.            <BR><BR>	Q6.  Will proposals be accepted if only some of the above sign materials are quoted?<BR>	A6.  As stated in Combined synopsis/solicitation, Proposal Requirements, pricing shall be provided for all items on the pricing schedule at Attachment 1.<BR><BR>	Q7.  Are there minimum amounts of signs that will be replaced each time a request is made?  In other words, what is the minimum amount of signs to be ordered for install per request?<BR>	A7.  The number of signs to be replaced per request will vary.  There is no stated minimum requirement; however the government will attempt to maximum the number of signs to be ordered per request.<BR><BR>	Q8.  The pricing on the schedule, should that reflect a per-sign price (including all supervision, equipment, materials, hardware, fabrication, installation, and labor required for the production and installation of signs) or should we show it as a quantity of (600) of each sign size and material type?<BR>	A8.  Provide pricing on the schedule as a per sign price (one each) for each sign size and material listed to include all supervision, equipment, materials, hardware, fabrication, installation, and labor required for the production and installation of signs.<BR><BR>	Q9.  Can the proposal be e-mailed, or does it have to be printed and mailed?  Does anything have to accompany this price schedule?<BR>	A9.  The proposal can be e-mailed to jane.allardyce@us.army.mil/ ; faxed to 570/615-7525; or mailed to Tobyhanna Army Depot, D/Contracting, 11 Hap Arnold Blvd, Tobyhanna PA 18466-5100 to be received by the time and date specified for receipt of offers.

QUESTION: Is there an EPA or escalation adjustment clause over this 5 year period? If not, can or should the clause be included in the offerors' proposal?<BR>RESPONSE:  No, an EPA or escalation adjustment clause will not be incorporated in the instant solicitation because the Contracting Officer has made a determination that the use of the clause at FAR 52.216-2 is inappropriate as specified in FAR 16.203-3.<BR><BR>2.

QUESTION:  What are average orders and how often historically have they been placed? Are orders usually for over 300 suits total?<BR>RESPONSE:  The estimated quantity of 9000 suits is not annual quantity.  This is an initial fielding to meet the unit's current requirement.

QUESTION: Firm fixed price - Will an EPA be acceptable for years 2 through 5 with a firm fixed price for year 1?<BR><BR>RESPONSE:  No, an EPA or escalation adjustment clause is not applicable and will not be incorporated in the instant solicitation because the Contracting Officer has made a determination that the use of the clause at FAR 52.216-2 is inappropriate as specified in FAR 16.203-3<BR><BR>12.	QUESTION:   Does suit have to be tan or will gray be acceptable?<BR>RESPONSE: No, The Government specifications require the suit to be tan in color.<BR><BR>13.

"	PICK-UP LOCATION:Rocky Mountain National Park1000 Hwy 36Estes Park, CO 80517	Contact:   Rudy Marquez	Ph# 970.586.1277___________________________________________________________________________________________ATTACHMENT 3:  BRAND NAME JUSTIFICATION:  
Rocky Mountain National Park has several pieces of John Deere equipment; we have some older models and some very new models. For us to keep up with today's technologies we had to purchase expensive software to trouble-shoot John Deere equipment. We have an inventory established to keep our repairs down to a minimum and to keep our John Deere equipment in the best running condition possible. Our technicians are trained and understand the complexities of the new JD Tier III and IV systems and have familiarized themselves with John Deere equipment, which has taken years of experience to acquire. Adding any additional manufactures would burden Rocky with additional costs to pay for more specialized training, special tools and diagnostic software.  
ALL OTHER TERMS AND CONDITIONS REMAIN UNCHANGED.

<p>Repair Contract for Landing Gear Components for C-130, KC-135A/R, E-3 aircraft</p>
<p>NAICS: 336413<br />Contracting Office Address<br />Department of the Air Force, Air Force Global Logistics Support Center, 748 SCMG/PKAB 6050 Gum Lane (Bldg 1215), Hill AFB, UT, 84056-5825.<br />Description<br />This announcement constitutes a Sources Sought Synopsis and Request for Information. The following information is provided to assist the Air Force in conducting market research of industry to identify sources of repair that meet Air Force requirements. This is neither a request for proposal nor an invitation for bid. There will be no reimbursement for the information provided. <br />The Landing Gear Supply Chain Management office is considering competing the repair/overhaul of landing gear components associated with the C-130 (all models), KC-135A/R, and E-3 (all models). This contract will initially encompass all three aircraft weapon systems; however, the Air Force may decide to reduce or eliminate the requirement for contract repair on one or more weapon system at its discretion. An initial list of National Stock Number Items being considered for inclusion on a contract have been attached to aid in planning, however this list may be modified prior to solicitation. <br />Landing Gear Component Repair is a major depot-level repair program for the USAF. This activity will procure the capability to repair and overhaul current landing gear and return serviceable landing gear components for the Landing Gear Component Repair program.</p>
<p><br />Special Considerations</p>
<p>Contract award decision may be based upon an evaluation of cost and non-cost factors (i.e., technical capability, past performance, etc.).</p>
<p>Minimum Mandatory Requirements</p>
<p>The Minimum Mandatory Requirements (MMR) reflects the government's minimum needs and are the lowest threshold acceptable. Failure to comply with the MMR will cause a proposal to be rejected.</p>
<p>--The contractor would be expected to ramp up for production in 180 days or less after contract award, with initial deliveries to begin 60 days or less thereafter.</p>
<p>--The government would expect to see a company capable of performing in the magnitude of 10,000 man-hours experience in the repair and overhaul of hydraulic components and 80,000 man-hours experience in the repair and overhaul of landing gear components within the last five years.</p>
<p>--Engineering and other key personnel shall be familiar with landing gear overhaul. They shall be able to communicate in English with Air Force personnel verbally and in writing. Technical personnel shall be able to interpret engineering and technical data written in English. The contractor shall be able to perform the contract requirements from the data provided in English.</p>
<p><br />RFI</p>
<p>1. Are you a qualified source to repair landing gear components? If so, by whom are you qualified and for what components? <br />2. What is your experience providing landing gear (or similar) repair?<br />3. If this workload were to encounter a split award, what would be the impact on your <br />own participation? From your perspective, what would be the best arrangement for a <br />split award?<br />4. The current government plan for this effort is not to offer Government Furnished <br />Equipment (GFE).<br />a. What equipment, tooling and fixtures do you have in your possession that would allow you to do this work? <br />b. What equipment, tooling or fixtures would you need to acquire that would allow you to do this work?<br />6.

Within the Industry Day presentation (slide 14), it stated the facility would by CRNF...however it appears CLS costing for ITEM 001 in the final RFP includes the warehouse...as the warehouse is referenced in the Help Desk section of the PWS. This would make it FFP. I would like confirmation on whether the facility storage is FFP or CRNF.<br />A: The Final RFP is the deciding document. There is not a CLIN for the warehouse.</p>

<DESC><BR>The purpose of this sources sought/market survey is to identify sources that are capable of producing the Nuclear, Biological and Chemical Sensor Processing Group (NBCSPG), which is a mission equipment package used in the Stryker Nuclear, Biological and Chemical Reconnaissance Vehicle (NBCRV) to integrate the vehicle's on-board systems.  The NBCSPG plays a vital role in digitizing the NBC battlespace and provides the soldier with a set of user interfaces to command and monitor disparate NBC sensors and other reconnaissance vehicle systems.  The NBCSPG automatically integrates contamination data, time and location data, meteorological data, and data from other systems to produce NBC hazard intelligence reports.  The NBCSPG interfaces with the NBCRV Command and Control system, Force XXI Battle Command Brigade and Below (FBCB2), and automates transmission of NBC reports to and from the NBC battlespace.  A Best Value, full and open competition solicitation is contemplated resulting in a single, 3 year Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract.<BR>The NBCSPG is a collection of hardware and software that processes the information gathered by the sensors, stores it in a database, and helps crewmembers analyze the information, and send electronic reports.  Nuclear Biological Chemical Joint Reconnaissance Application Software (NBCJRAS) is the software that controls and manages the NBCSPG, meteorological, vehicle sensors and other devices.  NBCJRAS includes a Joint Warning and Reporting Network (JWARN) software application to provide connectivity to the vehicle's Command and Control (C2) program.  The C2 system for the NBCRV is FBCB2.  <BR>The description of the NBCSPG hardware items are as follows:<BR>NSN for the NBCSPG is 6665-01-537-6899, PN: 5-15-31404. The NBCSPG performance specification is EA-S-2262 and the Interface Control Document is NBCSPG-ICD-31404. <BR>The NBCSPG hardware provides the interface between sensors and crewmembers, and gives crewmembers a way to print the information about the samples collected, and send it to the NBC Operations Center.  It consists of the following components.<BR>1.	 Rugged Notebook Computer Assembly to include a solid state disk drive, battery pack, and CD-RW/DVD-ROM drive module.  The rugged notebook computer assembly has a touchscreen and keyboard that allows it to function as a standalone workstation when docked in the notebook computer docking station.

DLA Distribution's core function is to provide military and commercial repair parts, clothing and textiles, medical supplies, industrial and electronic components (as well as other functions) to military customers and others throughout the world. DLA Distribution utilizes a sophisticated and detailed enterprise wide Warehouse Management System (WMS) to provide for distribution operations of that part of the supply chain. A key component of the WMS is the use of a secure 802.11g/n wireless connection to a strategically placed DOD mainframe system in the United States. <br />It is the goal of the DLA Information Operations to provide a viable and supportable wireless network among all DLA Distribution sites and locations. The wireless network infrastructure at many of the sites is beyond its estimated useful life and must be upgraded, or in some cases, there may not be an existing wireless network infrastructure.<br />Specific Characteristics of the Solution:<br />The Contractor will be responsible for providing management, personnel, supervision, materials, tools, and equipment in support of the major functional areas. The requirement is for a complete IEEE 802.11g/n (and complete migration strategy to 802.11n) wireless blanket system to be deployed at select DLA distribution sites or to augment the wireless systems currently in place at those sites by adding components or devices to attach to the current system. The major functional areas include:
<p>(a) Survey of identified sites/locations worldwide and development of a detailed design specification for wireless network upgrade/installation, to include equipment and labor required for those sites/locations.<br />(b) Purchase of required components per the approved site survey specification.<br />(c) Upgrade existing or install new hardware and/or software at identified sites/locations worldwide per the approved site survey specification.<br />(d) Provide on-going telephone and/or on-site support to installed locations.</p>
<p>Salient Characteristics:<br />The upgraded wireless network must be compatible with existing hardware, to include handheld terminals (Psion 7535 G2), vehicle mounts (Psion 8525), access points (Psion 9160 G2), controllers (Psion 9500), and gateways (Air Fortress 7500 and Air Fortress FCX 250).<br />FUNCTION DESCRIPTION<br />802.11g/n Handheld terminals 802.11g/n capability, Windows CE \Mobile, RFID capability, Cellular capability, CAC enabled, FIPS 140 Compliant, Long Range Scanning capability, 2D , 3 of 9, 128, code 39, pdf 416 barcode scanning capable<br />Vehicle mounted terminals 802.11g/n capability, Windows CE \Mobile, RFID capability, Cellular capability, CAC enabled, FIPS 140 Compliant, Long Range Scanning capability, 2D , 3 of 9, 128, code 39, pdf 416 barcode scanning capable<br />802.11g/n Access Points 802.11 g/n compliant, FIPS 140 compliant, SNMP <br />3.0, Intrusion Detection/Prevention system, Rogue AP detection, must be POE compatible.<br />VPN client software for handhelds and vehicle mounted terminals WIN CE /Mobile compatible<br />VPN hardware and software WIN CE /Mobile compatible<br />Terminal emulation software 3270 Terminal Emulation compatible.<br />Man portable printers Wireless Handheld printer, thermal laser compatible, barcode printing capable</p>

The Government is seeking to lease approximately 3310 contiguous rentable square feet of office and related space. The rentable space must yield a minimum of 3050 contiguous ANSI/BOMA Office area square feet (OASF). The lease term requirement is for 5 years. The space must be available for occupancy on or before 9/1/2011. The delineated area is bounded or affronted on the</p>

In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Government's requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications infrastructure, and non-productive agency downtime.</p>

Indicate whether or not the quoted rental rate includes an amount for tenant improvements and state the amount, if any.<br />&bull; Date of space availability.<br />&bull; Method of rentable space measurement.<br />&bull; Building ownership information.<br />&bull; Amount of parking available on-site and its cost. Include whether expected rental rate includes the cost of the required Government parking (if any).<br />&bull; Energy efficiency and renewable energy features existing within the building.<br />&bull; List of building services provided.</p>
<p>The Government's decision regarding whether to relocate will be based, in part, on information received in response to this advertisement.</p>

<DESC>Work breakdown structure
<p>The Contractor shall provide communication between the Barrow community and researchers, serving as a liaison between these groups. In particular, the Contractor shall serve as the infield coordinator of BOWFEST by informing the researchers of any problems that may arise as a function of the planned projects and by informing the community, as necessary, what the researchers are planning to do.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall oversee boat-based surveys, conducted by the local community, designed to document whale distribution and identify feeding areas. This shall be done by providing boats and crew with local knowledge of the area and a keen understanding of bowhead whale behavior. Inupiat hunters shall be hired by the Contractor to conduct boat-based surveys of the study area. Observations of whales shall be made using Contractor-supplied binoculars to determine number and behavior of whales. When a whale is sighted, the following data shall be collected: date, time, position (latitude and longitude), number seen, swim direction, and behavior. Whales exhibiting apparent feeding behavior shall be approached, and additional data collected shall include: position (latitude and longitude), number seen, respiration rates, as well as notes on presence of sediments in the water column or on the animal. Photographs shall be taken by the Contractor with a Contractor-supplied digital camera during boat-based behavioral surveys of feeding whales to document behavior. If suitable for identifying individual animals, these photos shall be entered into the photographic catalog. The Contractor shall be experienced in operating safely in arctic waters northeast of Barrow and also know how to make stealthy approaches towards whales without disturbing them when making close approaches.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall provide assistance to BOWFEST researchers as needed, particularly in regard to boat operations. Upon the completion of the field project, the Contractor shall provide quarterly reports describing coordination and field activities and a final report before the contract is complete. The Contractor shall work closely with NMFS scientists during the preparation for field operations, while in the field, and in reviews of any resultant documents.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall collect samples from bowhead whales landed during subsistence hunts by Alaska Natives in Barrow, Kaktovik, and up to 9 other villages, if possible, along the Chukchi, Beaufort and Bering Sea. Access to these villages will likely be by commercial air.</p>

<a href="mailto:John.Huss@dot.gov">Contracting Officer</a>
<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to provide answers to questions received from offerors, extend the response date, and to provide clarifications and changes to the presolicitation notice as follows:
1.  Section 2 of the original synopsis is clarified as follows:  The synopsis utilizes the ATMP and Libby Programs as examples of the type of work the Volpe Center encounters.  Although these programs are fundamental to the current work portfolio of the Volpe Center, they are not the only programs the Volpe Center would anticipate support from offerors.  They generally represent the skills and experience the Volpe Center would need the offeror to provide in the areas of NEPA and non-NEPA compliance.  Projects that require similar expertise could likely be for the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA), United States Coast Guard (USCG), National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), United States Air Force (USAF), United States Navy (USN), Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) and/or other agencies within and outside of the Department of Transportation (DOT).  Furthermore, the project locations may be anywhere in the United States (except New York state and New England).  Therefore, the solicitation is not only satisfying the NEPA requirement at National Parks for the ATMP program or the non-NEPA requirement for architect and engineering support at the Libby Asbestos Project for the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in Montana.  Proposals should reflect the fundamental work required for the ATMP and Libby Asbestos programs, but should also recognize the larger need of working at different locations and different agencies within the scope of the Pre-solicitation Description.
2. Section 5 of the original synopsis is changed to require offerors who plan to provide a form SF 330 for both Areas 1 and 2, to provide a separate form SF330 for Area 1 and a separate form SF330 for Area 2.  Section 5 is also changed to extend the form SF330 submission date and modify formatting requirements.  As a result, Section 5 of the Synopsis is changed to read as follows:  5. SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS: Offerors interested in providing A&E support services to the Volpe Center for Environmental Compliance Area 1 only, or Area 2 only, or both Area 1 and 2, as defined above, are to submit six (6) copies of completed form SF330, Architect-Engineer Qualifications Parts I and II no later than 2:00 PM EDT on October 29, 2009 to the attention of John Huss, RVP-31, 55 Broadway, Kendall Square, Cambridge, MA 02142.  A separate form SF330 should be provided for each Area.  Those Offerors responding to Area 1 only or Area 2 only will submit one form SF 330.  Those Offerors who are responding to both Area 1 and Area 2 will submit two separate form SF 330s, one for each Area.  Each completed form SF 330, Part 1 ? Contract Specific Qualifications shall not exceed 25 printed pages total.  Double-sided pages shall be counted as two pages. Pages shall be 8 ? x 11 inch stock in portrait orientation. Should the Offeror require fold out pages, one fold out page shall not exceed either 8.5 inches x 22 inches or 17 inches x 11 inches, which when folded in half will be no larger than 8.5 inches x 11 inches.  The fold out will count as two pages.  Print should be Times New Roman, 12 point font.  Text included on figures, charts, tables, and/or matrices may be reduced to Times New Roman 9 point font. Any additional items, either not requested, or in excess of the above specified page limits, or in the incorrect format, will not be included in the evaluation process.   There is no specific page limit on Part II ? General Qualifications.  The format for Part II will be the same as for Part I.  Electronic responses will not be accepted. Late responses will be handled in accordance with FAR 52.214-7, Late Submissions, Modifications, and Withdrawals of Bid. No materials will be returned. Do not fax or e-mail any material. This is not a request for proposal.  Offerors may send e-mail questions to the Contracting Officer?s e-mail address listed below.  Questions will be accepted through September 24, 2009, 2:00 PM EDT.  Telephone calls will not be accepted.  
3.  There are no changes to Sections 1, 3, and 4 of the original synopsis.  
4. Responses to Offeror Questions:
	a. Question:  Does the font type and size (Times New Roman, 12 Point) include the actual SF330 form? 
Response:  Yes, all fill-in information provided by the offeror must be Time New Roman 12 Point.  The GSA on-line Microsoft version SF330 will accommodate this. 
	b. Question: Are non-standard matrices allowed and would they count as a page?
Response:  Should the Offeror require fold out pages, one fold out page shall not exceed either 8.5 inches x 22 inches or 17 inches x 11 inches, which when folded in half will be no larger than 8.5 inches x 11 inches.  The fold out will count as two pages. 
	c. Question: Under Area 1, is the expectation that the Offeror must be able to do ATMP noise measurements at twelve or more parks simultaneously?  
Response: Yes.  But keep in mind that noise measurements may be for different projects from agencies such as FRA, FAA, USAF, USCG, NASA, FMCSA and/or others.  The Government is looking for offerors who have the potential capacity to work on multiple projects simultaneously that may or may not include the ATMP program. 
	d. Question: Under Area 1, would the Offeror be expected to provide the necessary equipment for any number of simultaneous ATMP noise measurement studies, whether it is one or twelve? 
Response: Yes.  But keep in mind that the Government is using the ATMP Program as an example.  The noise measurement requirements may be for different projects for FRA, FAA, USAF, USCG, NASA, FMCSA and/or other agencies.  The Government is looking for Offerors who have the potential capacity and access to equipment that enables them to work on multiple projects that may or may not include the ATMP program and may or may not include noise measurement requirements.
	e. Question: If an Offeror who submits an SF330 for Area 1 and Area 2 is not selected for one of the aforementioned areas, will the offeror still be considered for the other area? 
Response: Yes, per Section 3 of the Synopsis, an Offeror who submit an SF330 for Area 1 and Area 2, may be selected for both Area 1 and 2, or only Area 1, or only Area 2. 
	f. Does the requirement to use Time New Roman 12-point font apply to graphics and tables? 
Response: Text included on figures, charts, tables, and/or matrices may be reduced to 9 point.
	g. Question: Can information regarding Oral presentations be provided at this time?
Response:  Details regarding Oral presentations will be provided to Offerors at the time that they are invited to provide an Oral presentation. 
	h. Question: Regarding the many services listed in Section 1, Description with respect to Area 1 and Area 2.  Are offerors expected to focus on the subset of these services that they deem directly relevant to a particular Compliance Area (1 or 2)? 
Response:  All of the environmental services listed in Section 1 could potentially be applicable to each of the two Areas.  The synopsis identifies the ATMP and Libby Programs as examples of the type of work Volpe Center encounters under Area 1 and Area 2.  Although these programs are fundamental to the current work portfolio of the Volpe Center, they are not the only programs the Volpe Center would anticipate support from the contractor for Area 1 or Area 2.
	i. Question:  Is a cover letter included in the stipulated page count limits?
Response:  No.  However, information contained in the cover letter will not be used in the Government evaluation.
	j. Question:  Who is the incumbent?   
Response:  This question is outside the scope of the synopsis.

<DESC>PROJECT TITLE: Demolish and Repair the roof of Building 416 at Tinker Air Force Base, OK. <BR><BR>The purpose of this synopsis is to conduct market research on potential sources for a future acquisition of construction services for the subject project. This is not a request for competitive proposals or quotations. <BR><BR>Interested parties shall be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR), online at https://www.ccr.gov.<BR><BR>Background: <BR>Building 416 is a 422,500 square foot facility that houses material for the Air Force. The roof replacement is 10 acres. Government, Contracted Hires, and Union Employees work in this facility on a 24 hour schedule. This project received funding based on a RAC 1 safety rating. RAC or Risk Assessment Codes range from 1 to 3 with RAC 1 as the highest potential for risk, RAC 2 is significant risk, and RAC 3 is marginal risk. The current roof system is a RAC 1 which prohibits access onto the roof of the facility since the risk of roof failure and falling through is imminent. Repairs to the roof or the mechanical equipment on the roof are prohibited. Safety netting has been installed in certain areas inside the warehouse to protect the workers from falling material. Workers must wear hard hats in the facility at all times. <BR><BR>Requirement:<BR>a. The entire roofing system will be removed with additional structure add to raise the roof systems to accommodate a revised/updated HVAC system for better conditioning of the facility. The new roof will consist of new metal decking with a built up 3-ply roof system with cap sheet.<BR><BR>b. Construct a fully operating and functioning roof system, assembly, structural framework, fixture or apparatus.<BR><BR>c. The Building Ventilation System will also be upgraded to eliminate dead spots and areas of poor air circulation within the building. This will require new and additional mechanical equipment both on the roof as well as modifications to the walls of the warehouse to allow additional ventilation. In addition, a minimum energy savings of approximately 30% over the existing system shall be obtained.<BR><BR>Unique Project Elements: <BR><BR>a. Restrictions/Phasing: In addition, to the current safety issues associated with this project, the construction phase will require a Contractor experienced with scheduling and phasing work to maintain a productive schedule. There will be at least 3 active construction projects ongoing within the facility during this roof replacement: Racking Project, Ventilation Upgrade, and Fire Sprinkler Upgrades. Each of these projects will require coordination and care so as not to damage newly installed items or impact access to perform work. <BR><BR>b. Occupied Facility: The facility will remain occupied and functional during this project. Union and non-union workers are present in this facility. Any impact to the functionally or access to the facility requires high level and early coordination for DLA manage to alert/negotiate with labor unions. <BR><BR>c. RAC Rating: The contractor will need to have a health & safety program to properly schedule/phase this work to protect their worker and building occupants. <BR><BR>The magnitude of this project's price is estimated more than $10,000,000. Potential sources shall submit a capability statement of no more than six pages in length, which addresses the following key areas: (1) TECHNICAL - Potential sources shall submit a list of recent projects that demonstrate their knowledge and past experience relating to all of the varying types of work described above, particularly in the areas of construction management of complex multimillion dollar projects involving phasing of work in occupied facilities: workings with multiple customers within a facility to schedule work, safety, and quality control. Submit only current and past project and client information that is no more than 4 years previous. Include a brief description, identifying the capacity the firm worked in on the project (prime or subcontractor), the contract type (list by task order if Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity), contract or task order value, dollar value of work subcontracted, percent complete, date completed if complete, name and title of customer POC and current phone number. (2) BUSINESS SIZE - Potential sources shall identify the type/size of business certifications (small, Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB), 8(a), women-owned, veteran / disabled-veteran owned small business, HUBZone, etc.). If the firm is a small business, the response to this synopsis shall include how the firm will meet the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) requirement for limitations on subcontracting for the proposed solicitation (or completed contracts of a similar nature and size) that states "The concern will perform at least 15 percent of the cost of the contract, not including the cost of materials, with its own employees." <BR><BR>This is not a request for competitive proposals or quotations.<BR><BR>All interested parties may respond or submit statements of qualifications via mail, fax, or email. All responses are due to US Army Corps of Engineers, Tulsa District Office, Attention: Jonathan Nadig, via mail: 1645 S 101 E Ave, Tulsa, OK 74128, fax: 918-669-7495, or email: jonathan.nadig@us.army.mil, not later than 4:00pm CST on February 15, 2011.

<DESC>Questions and Answers Round 1
12/22/2010

1. Is CDN new work or is there currently a contractor fulfilling the same work?  If it is not new work, who is the current contractor performing the work?

A: This work is currently being performed by FedStore Corporation.

2.  This appears to be a very well thought out and comprehensive project.  I am concerned that we will not be able to effectively respond to all of the requirements within the requested timeframe and as a result will not be able to effectively compete for this opportunity.  Can you please clarify why the timeframe for the response is so short (especially given that it is over a holiday weekend)?

A: This is strictly a sources sought notice, not a formal Request for Proposal (RFP).  At this time the Government is looking for capability statements that demonstrate a vendor's ability to perform the required work, not a complete proposal.

<DESC>This contract action was accomplished using other than competitive procedures because there is only one responsible source and no other supplies or service will satisfy agency requirements (FAR 6.302-1). See posted J&A for further information.<br><br>This contract action was not awarded as a fixed price type because uncertainties involved in contract performance did not permit costs to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed price contract. As such, a cost-reimbursement type action was awarded (FAR 16.301-2).<br><br>Mission and Installation Contracting Command (MICC) - Fort Irwin, intends to award a sole-source modification to extend contract DAKF04-00-C-0002, Installation Support Services, for a period of nine(9)months and six (6) one-month option periods.

Suite 300, Burlington, VT 05401 US
<DESC>The type of contract instrument selected for this procurement is a Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) term contract. The scope of work is described in general terms and obligates the contractor to devote a specified level of effort for a stated time period. Per FAR 16.306 (d) (2), if the performance is considered satisfactory by the Government, the fixed fee is payable at the expiration of the agreed upon period, upon contractor statement that the level of effort specified in the contract has been expended in performing the contract work, renewal for further periods of performance is a new acquisition that involves new cost and fee arrangements.
<p>The objective of LARA is to develop a robust, enduring, Afghan owned-and-managed land market infrastructure that encourages investment and productivity growth, resolves or mitigates land-based conflict, and builds confidence in the government's legitimacy, thereby enhancing overall stability in Afghan society.</p>
<p>In accordance with the Activity Approval Document, the LARA program was mainly designed to contribute to COIN Strategy through the contribution to the following components:</p>
<p>&bull; Conflict Mitigation/Government Legitimacy by organizing itself at provincial and regional levels so that it can leverage local expertise, and train military and Provincial Reconstruction Team personnel to employ land use rights and tenure formalization as a tool for combating insurgency.</p>
<p>&bull; Job Creation and economic recovery in Afghanistan by facilitating leasing of government-owned property to put lands to more productive use and provide an alternative to poppy production.</p>
<p>&bull; Contribution to Afghanization by the creation of employment and building the capacity of about 500 local Afghan staff either directly or through partner NGO institutions.</p>
<p>LARA is primarily a technical assistance type activity and specific end results are yet to be defined.</p>

<DESC>The Government intends to award a sole source contract to Fastenal for procurement of COCESS in accordance with FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii). Only one responsible source and no other services will satisfy agency requirements as this is only a three month award until the new solicitation is awarded. This notice is not a request for competitive proposals. The acquisition of this service contract is necessary for the 9th Civil Engineer Squadron to satisfy mission accomplishment. The procurement of this service must be completed in a timely manner in order to meet mission requirements. Market research has identified Fastenal as the only practical provider for the COCESS program for this 3 month period. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 444130 and the Standard Industrial Code (SIC) is 5251. The small business size standard is $7,000,000. Questions should be directed to Douglas Strong via email: douglas.strong@beale.af.mil or by phone at (530) 634-3305

<p>Above pricing is based on pricing from Meridian Medical Technologies' current contract (Bridge 3), which will expire on September 30, 2010.</p>
<p>The following is a brief description of the services:</p>
<p>i) Base Maintenance Service. This requirement includes services that are industrial, technical, managerial, and administrative, for the purpose of maintaining a "warm industrial base". On this line Meridian covers the salaries and benefits of managerial personnel (indirect labor) who are responsible for the program. This line allocates plant overhead costs computed as a percentage of Cost of Goods Sold and profit associated with the production of the estimated quantity of auto-injectors indicated. This line partially prepays unit prices for each auto-injector purchased.</p>
<p>ii) Logistics Maintenance includes services for the storage and stock rotation of DLA-owned pre-positioned components.</p>
<p>iii) The Readiness Enhancement Program involves maintaining a trained contingency of twenty-five (25) second and third shift workers to insure adequate production of the auto-injectors in the event of a Surge.</p>
<p>iv) Due to the critical nature of the items involved, the Surge Option will still be included, which will enable DLA to maintain the supply requirements of a 2 Major Theatre War (2MTW). The Surge, when invoked, is to be delivered in 150 days.</p>
<p>v) An Additional Quantity provision is separately priced and only invoked if the 2-month estimate of auto-injectors is exhausted. The price of the auto-injectors on this line will not contain any prepayments already contained under the line for Base Maintenance (CLIN 0001) and will fully reflect all the costs to manufacture the additional specified quantity estimates. Ordering the full additional quantity would constitute the maximum quantity amount under the bridge contract authorized herein. <br /><br />4. The statutory authority for Other than Full and Open Competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(3), as implemented by FAR 6.302-3, Industrial Mobilization.</p>
<p>5. The nerve agent antidotes are used to counteract the effects of nerve agent poisoning in a combat situation. The morphine is a potent pain killer. Because of their critical application, these items have been designated as mobilization essential by the Services. These supplies and related services are covered under an existing Industrial Base Maintenance Contract (IBMC) with Meridian Medical Technologies (Meridian). The current contract, SPM200-05-D-0010, is due to expire on September 30, 2010.</p>
<p>Three bridge contracts have been issued since the expiration of the base contract. The first bridge ran from July 31, 2008 to March 31, 2009. That bridge was necessary due to changes in the requirements of the follow-on contract. The changes were necessary to accommodate Meridian's growing non-Government business and to find ways of meeting the Services' surge requirements. These changes added considerable time to the planning phase of the acquisition.</p>
<p>The second bridge was started on April 1, 2009 and expired on December 31, 2009. This second bridge was necessary because the evaluation on Meridian's follow-on proposal was still ongoing when the first bridge was set to expire. An audit by the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA) on Meridian's proposal was also ongoing. The DCAA informed our office that Meridian failed to obtain and perform an adequate analysis of their subcontractor's cost and pricing data. DLA Troop Support did not anticipate this action by the DCAA because, on previous contracts, DCAA had not questioned Meridian's subcontractor cost data, and the data that was provided was always considered adequate and thorough. A further finding of the DCAA was that Meridian's costs were not considered recent enough to make an assessment. The firm provided actual 2007 rates and DCAA asked for 2008 rates, which Meridian eventually provided in July 2009.</p>
<p>The third bridge was started on January 1, 2010 and is set to expire on September 30, 2010. The third bridge was necessary because the audit on the follow-on proposal took an unanticipated seven (7) months and was not delivered until July 20, 2009. The audit found a majority of Meridian's proposal unsupported, which complicated developing negotiation objectives. In fact, DLA Troop Support had to request additional DCAA assist audits on subcontractors after receiving DCAA's audit of the proposal. Additionally, after opening negotiations with Meridian on November 17, 2009, DLA Troop Support found that the parties were far apart on resolving major issues, and could not find the follow-on proposal fair and reasonable. During this bridge, DLA Troop Support studied changes to the minimum sustaining rate (MSR), which is the rate believed to be necessary to maintain a warm industrial base. Changes to the MSR resulted in further changes to Meridian's proposal.</p>
<p>The price of the third bridge was determined not fair and reasonable. Negotiations had been elevated, in accordance with regulations, to include the Chief of Pricing &amp; Strategy, in an attempt to obtain fair and reasonable pricing. The Director and Deputy Director of Medical Supplier Operations were also involved in negotiations; however, Meridian would not yield on the 18% profit level, which far exceeded the Government objective. (The weighted guidelines suggested a profit range of 11-13% based on contractor risk.)</p>
<p>A fourth bridge is necessary because we are unable to make an award on the follow-on contract before the September 30 expiration of the current bridge contract. Although we are nearing the end of discussions, such discussions have taken longer than anticipated because Meridian is unwilling to revise its proposal, which the Government does not consider fair and reasonable. Negotiations for the follow-on once again included the Chief of Pricing &amp; Strategy in an attempt to obtain fair and reasonable pricing. While Meridian made some concessions on price, there is still a very large difference in price and the Contracting Officer is unable to support Meridian's prices.</p>
<p>The 2-month period on the fourth bridge will be used to finalize discussions and obtain final review and approval of Meridian's proposal. The Director of Medical Supplier Operations was once again involved in discussions for this fourth bridge.</p>
<p>In lieu of letting the current contract lapse for this short period, the Government has determined that it is essential to maintain the readiness and surge capability that the contract provides. Meridian is the only known domestic source for these specialty auto-injectors, which have been designated as mobilization essential by the Services. As the incumbent contractor for the auto-injectors, Meridian possesses a state-of-the-art, FDA-approved manufacturing facility; a workforce specially trained in the production of these highly specialized items of supply; production molds and equipment; a ready source of components from suppliers; a reliable sub tier vendor base from which to secure immediate additional components during a crisis; and a surge capability for national and contingency situations.</p>
<p>Meridian additionally provides unique technical, qualitative, and managerial services for the purpose of maintaining readiness and mobilization capability (i.e., Base Maintenance/Service). The services provided incident to the supply contract ensure that adequate capacity is available - to maintain a warm industrial base. This investment partially prepays unit prices for each auto-injector purchased. When orders are placed for new injectors, DLA pays for the direct labor, direct materials, G&amp;A overhead, and profit associated with the ordered production. Meridian also provides special services such as storage and stock rotation of DLA-owned pre-positioned components.</p>
<p>6. The search for potential alternate sources for these items is a continuing function of DLA Troop Support's Medical Readiness Unit. Currently no other domestic or Canadian firm has a license to market these highly specialized items. One other firm, Sanofi-Aventis, has expressed interest in entering this market and may have the capability to produce these items; however, they are only in the research and development stage. Even if they proceed with the project, they would need to complete regulatory compliance with the FDA, a process that could take 2-4 years, and they would need to produce the auto-injectors in the U.S. or Canada.</p>
<p>The auto-injectors are military-unique items for which a very limited commercial market exists. (Most non-DoD purchases of the auto-injectors are by other state and local governments.) Additionally, any alternate manufacturing sources must have approval of one or more New Drug Applications (NDA) from the FDA at time of award, under federal law. There are no known firms currently going through the NDA process. This bridge will not be synopsized in accordance with FAR 5.202(a)(10).</p>
<p>This justification will be made available for public inspection, after award, in accordance with FAR 6.305.</p>
<p>7. The pricing for the fourth bridge is based on the current contract pricing of the third bridge, which was determined to be not fair and reasonable. Since we anticipate that the fourth bridge will also include an 18% profit rate, the Contracting Officer cannot make the certification that the anticipated price will be determined fair and reasonable. Due to the critical nature of these items, the bridge should proceed with the determination that the offered price be considered not fair and reasonable, and the award decision document will contain a determination to this effect.</p>
<p>8. Market research for additional sources is an ongoing task of DLA Troop Support's Medical Readiness (MR) Commodity Business Unit. Currently, no other domestic or Canadian firm has the capability to produce nerve agent antidotes and morphine auto-injectors.</p>
<p>9. In accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2534 and defense industrial mobilization requirements, the Government is restricted from acquiring chemical weapons antidote contained in automatic injectors, or the components for such injectors, unless the chemical weapons antidote injector or component is manufactured in the United States or Canada by a company that is a producer under the industrial preparedness program; has received all required regulatory approvals; and has the plant, equipment, and personnel to perform the contract in the United States or Canada at the time of contract award (ref: DFARS 225.7005). Meridian is the only known source that meets all criteria of this DFARS requirement.</p>
<p>10. No other sources have expressed an interest in this bridge contract.</p>
<p>11. Due to the critical nature of this item, public law 10 U.S.C. 2534 and DFARS 225.7005 govern the procurement of this item and cannot be waived. DLA Troop Support will, however, entertain any future inquiries from possible sources that meet the above requirements at time of any subsequent award.</p>
<p>12. I hereby certify that this justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.</p>

<DESC>1. Summary/Introduction
<p>a) The Defense Logistics Agency, Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP), Medical Supplier Operations, is the contracting activity.</p>
<p>b) The acquisition is for various Nerve Agent Antidotes and Morphine in autoinjectors and related services. Items included in this acquisition are as follows:</p>
<p>Routine items/bought Add'l Quantity/Surge Items:<br />on an ongoing basis:</p>
<p>0001 Base Maintenance/Service 0006 Surge<br />0002 Logistics Maintenance 0007 Additional Quantity<br />0003 Nerve Agents/Morphine 0008 990K Stockpile Management<br />0004 Autoinjector Trainers 0009 Off Shift Personnel<br />0005 Readiness Enhancement Program</p>
<p><br />c) The total duration of this acquisition is five years, 1 annual base period and 4 annual option periods. (The contract base period may be less than one year to coincide with the contractor's fiscal year, which also runs concurrent with the calendar year.) The estimated dollar value of this acquisition is $182,696,809 for line items 0001 through 0005, that is those supplies and services that are ordered on a routine and ongoing basis and excludes the value of line items 0006 through 0009, additional quantity and three contingent surge lines. The maximum dollar value is $327,422,158, which, in addition to routine supplies and services, includes line item 0007, Additional Quantity, which will only be ordered if demand exceeds the estimated annual quantity. The Surge line values are over and above the estimated value and maximum value above.</p>
<p>d) The statutory authority for Other than Full and Open Competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(3), as implemented by FAR 6.302-3, Industrial Mobilization.</p>
<p>2. Description of Agency's Need (10 U.S.C. 2304(f)(3)(a)):</p>
<p>a) The proposed action is the sixth in a series of Industrial Base Maintenance Contracts (IBMCs) for Nerve Agent Antidotes and Morphine in autoinjectors and related services. The antidotes are used to counteract the effects of nerve agent poisoning and the morphine is a powerful painkiller. Because of their critical application, these items have been designated as mobilization essential by the Services. The current IBMC with Meridian Medical Technologies, Inc. (Meridian) expires on March 31, 2009. This contract was recently extended by placing a bridge contract. The bridge contract is for a period of 8 months and was required primarily because the planning phase of this acquisition took much longer than expected, due to a need to devise new scenarios for satisfying the surge requirements. The new contract must be in place before the expiration date in order to avoid a lapse in coverage.</p>
<p>b) The type of contract contemplated is an Indefinite Quantity Contract. The quantity estimates for this new acquisition are based on the current contract's annual estimated demands to maintain a warm industrial base. The estimated dollar value is obtained by using the unit prices of the final option year of contract SPM200-05-D-0010 as a base and increasing that by 8 percent. We then escalated each succeeding year of the proposed contract by 5%. Historically, the approximate amount of increase between contract years has been between 4 and 5 percent.</p>
<p>c) The specific supplies under this proposed acquisition are: <br /><br />Item Est. Ann. Qty Add'l Ann. Qty Surge Reqmt.<br />(Line 0003) (Line 0007) (Line 0006)</p>
<p>Antidote Kit, Nerve 99,700 ea 99,700 ea 100,000ea<br />Agent, Mark I</p>
<p>Atropine Injection 351,680 ea 351,680 ea 298,000ea</p>
<p>Pralidoxime Injection 80,120 ea 80,120 ea 359,000ea<br /><br />Diazepam Injection 302,178 ea 302,178 ea 834,000ea</p>
<p>Morphine Injection 28,442 ea 28,442 ea 130,000ea</p>
<p>Antidote Treatment Nerve 1,438,180 ea 1,438,180 ea 1,596,000ea<br />Agent Auto. (ATNAA)</p>
<p>Total 2,400,000 ea 2,400,000 ea 3,417,000ea</p>
<p>Note: Each Mark I counts as 2 autoinjectors, so that the 99,700 amount is counted twice (= 199,400) in the 2.4M total.</p>
<p>i) Line 0001 Base Maintenance/Service. This requirement includes services that are industrial, qualitative, managerial, and administrative in nature, in order to maintain the technical expertise, facility, and equipment, to insure production and mobilization capacity. This line permits the company to retain the necessary production capacity to keep a warm industrial base since the Government cannot guarantee the quantities necessary (2.4 million autoinjectors) to keep the company in continuous production. The requirement covers the salaries and benefits for managerial personnel (indirect labor) who are responsible for this program. This investment partially prepays unit prices for each autoinjector purchased. The amount of this line will be determined by plant overhead costs computed as a percentage of Cost of Goods Sold and profit associated with the production of the annual quantity of autoinjectors indicated. This is the only line that includes plant overhead. Costs are not duplicated between the various lines. The dollar value of this line is estimated at $11,415,187 for the base year and $63,076,116 for the 5-year period.</p>
<p>ii) Line 0002 Logistics Maintenance, which includes miscellaneous warehouse expenses and services for the storage and stock rotation of DLA-owned pre-positioned components. A large part of this amount pays the salaries of personnel who handle this inventory. Corporate G&amp;A and profit are also applied. The dollar value of this line is estimated at $1,367,249 for the base year and $7,554,912 for the 5-year period.</p>
<p>iii) Line 0003 Estimated Annual Quantity includes the estimated annual quantities, which will be ordered on a routine and ongoing basis. They are based on a total purchase quantity of 2.4M autoinjectors per year. According to Meridian, the 2.4M quantity total is the quantity required for maintaining a warm industrial base. In the past year, the demand level from the Military Services has decreased to about 1.6M. Since this level determines the amount paid on Line 0001, Base Maintenance, we intend to negotiate a lower demand level, more in line with actual demands. However, Meridian typically maintains that 2.4M is the amount necessary to maintain a warm base. Thus, we use the 2.4M as a "going in" quantity level that represents the highest annual level that the Government may be obligated to support. Because of Meridian's increase in commercial business, we will also conduct discussions on their need now or in the future for an IBMC or a reduced IBMC. The dollar value of this line is estimated at $19,841,850 for the base year and $109,638,744 for the 5-year period.</p>
<p>iv) Line 0004 Autoinjector Trainers: These items contain no drugs and are designed to simulate the autoinjectors with nerve agent antidote for training purposes. They are the same size, work in the same manner, and can be reset after activation and reused. These items are being added to the IBMC for the first time. The prices for the base year are based on Meridian's 2008 price list. The dollar value of this line is estimated at $324,908 for the base year and $1,795,322 for the 5-year period.</p>
<p>Item Est. Ann. Qty (Line 0004)</p>
<p>Antidote Kit, Nerve 550 pg <br />Agent, Mark I</p>
<p>Atropine Injection 60 pg</p>
<p>Pralidoxime Injection 130 pg <br /><br />Diazepam Injection 30 pg</p>
<p>Morphine Injection 30 pg</p>
<p>Antidote Treatment Nerve 150 pg<br />Agent Auto. (ATNAA)</p>
<p>Total 950 pg</p>
<p>(Note: The unit of issue for each item is a package of 25 autoinjectors.)</p>
<p>v) Line 0005 Readiness Enhancement Program, which involves maintaining a trained contingency of twenty-five (25) second and third shift workers to assure adequate production of the nerve agent antidote. Meridian secures a business arrangement with a subcontractor to set up, train and maintain this contingency worker pool. Three-shift production shall ensure that production capacity is adequate to meet the requirements of a 2-Major Theatre War (2MTW). The dollar value of this line is estimated at $114,324 for the base year and $631,715 for the 5-year period.</p>
<p>vi) Line 0006 Due to the critical nature of the items involved, a Surge Option will be included, which will enable DLA to maintain the supply requirements of a 2 Major Theatre War (2MTW). The Surge quantity is required, when invoked, to be delivered in 142 days. The dollar value of this line is estimated at $23,618,234 for the base year and $130,505,651 for the 5-year period.</p>
<p>vii) Line 0007 Additional Quantity provision, which is not an option, but a provision to address un-programmed demands in excess of the annual estimated quantity, will be included as a separate line on the solicitation because the price of the autoinjectors here will not contain any prepayments already contained under the line for Base Maintenance (Line Item 0001) and will fully reflect all the costs to manufacture the additional specified quantity estimates. Ordering the full additional quantity would constitute the maximum annual quantity amount. The dollar value of this line is estimated at $26,191,641 for the base year and $144,725,349 for the 5-year period.</p>
<p>viii) Line 0008 990K Stockpile Management and Line 0009 Off-Shift Personnel. These requirements are new and serve the purpose of facilitating a Surge in the event inventory levels that the Services are holding get low. These lines are contingent, thus the estimated amounts were not included in "routine" lines. If exercised, Meridian will place in its inventory (at contractor expense) a quantity of 990,000 autoinjectors. This is the quantity of autoinjectors deemed necessary to implement a Surge without impairing Meridian's non-government production. Meridian will manage and rotate finished goods and components by filling new routine orders from this stock. Meridian will also staff an "off shift" crew of approximately 15 people. The purpose of the off shift personnel will be to reduce ramp-up time from 4-6 months to 2 months and increase run rate capability to 16 million in 30-60 days from 12 million annually. These lines were also devised to facilitate capacity in view of the fact that Meridian will no longer agree to halt non-DoD production to comply with DLA demand levels in excess of the estimated annual amount. The initial price estimates for these lines were provided by Meridian. The dollar value of these lines is estimated at $3,022,250 for the base year and $16,699,840 for the 5-year period. The cost of these lines will be funded with war-stopper funds.</p>
<p>3. Authority for Other than Full and Open Competition (10 U.S.C. 2304(f)(3)(B):</p>
<p>The applicable statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(3), FAR 6.302-3, Industrial Mobilization; engineering, developmental, or research capability; or expert services. Use of this contracting authority is necessary to maintain a facility, producer, manufacturer, or other supplier available for furnishing supplies to achieve industrial mobilization. Nerve agent antidotes and morphine in autoinjectors have been designated as mobilization essential by the Services and Meridian is the only known source for these supplies.</p>
<p>As the incumbent contractor for the nerve agent antidote and morphine in autoinjectors, Meridian is the only known source that possesses a state-of-the-art, FDA-approved manufacturing facility; a workforce specially trained in the production of these highly specialized items of supply; production molds and equipment; a ready source of components from suppliers; a reliable sub tier vendor base from which to secure immediate additional components during a crisis; and a surge capability for national emergency and contingency situations.</p>
<p>Meridian additionally provides unique technical, qualitative, and managerial services for the purpose of maintaining mobilization capability (i.e., Base Maintenance/Service, CLIN 0001). This covers the level of production needed to maintain a warm industrial base. Consistent with previous contracts, plant overhead with applicable profit was allocated to this CLIN. The amount of overhead used was the amount applied to an annual production quantity of 2.4 million autoinjectors, which is the amount considered necessary for maintaining a warm industrial base. This investment partially prepays unit prices for each autoinjector purchased. When orders are placed for new injectors under CLIN 0003, DLA only pays for the direct labor, direct materials, and profit associated with the ordered production. Meridian also provides special services such as storage and stock rotation of DLA-owned pre-positioned components.</p>
<p>In accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2534 and defense industrial mobilization requirements, the Government is restricted from acquiring chemical weapons antidote contained in automatic injectors, or the components for such injectors, unless the chemical weapons antidote or component is manufactured in the United States or Canada by a company that is a producer under the industrial preparedness program at the time of contract award; has received all required regulatory approvals; and has the plant, equipment, and personnel to perform the contract in the United States or Canada at the time of contract award (ref: DFARS 225.7005). Meridian is the only known source that meets all criteria of this DFARS requirement.</p>
<p>4. Price/Cost Considerations (10 U.S.C. 2304(f)(3)(c)):</p>
<p>As the Contracting Officer, I hereby determine that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable based on an analysis of certified cost or pricing data. Additionally, this data will be audited by the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA) for verification and supportability.</p>
<p>5. Market Research/Efforts to Obtain Competition (10 U.S.C. 2304(f)(3)(D) &amp; (E)):</p>
<p>Market Research for additional sources is an ongoing task of DSCP's Medical SMSG Readiness Division (FSG). Currently, no other domestic or Canadian firm has the capability to produce nerve agent antidotes and morphine in autoinjectors. The autoinjectors are military-unique items for which a very limited commercial market exists. (Most non-DoD purchases of the autoinjectors are by other state and local governments and non-government organizations, such as hospital groups, that purchase on behalf of first-responders.) This acquisition will not be synopsized in accordance with FAR 5.202(a)(10).</p>
<p>6. Actions Being Taken to Overcome Barriers to Competition (10 U.S.C. 2304 (f)(3)(F):</p>
<p>As discussed in paragraph 5 above, the search for potential alternate sources for these items is a continuing function of DSCP's Medical Readiness Unit. To date, no other domestic or Canadian firm has been found to possess the capability to produce these highly specialized items. Additionally, such firms must have obtained approval of their New Drug Applications (NDA) from the FDA at time of award, which is required by federal law. There are no known firms currently going through this process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hereby certify that the information contained in this justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.</p>

The Government intends to award this contract to National Court Reporters, Inc. based on their response to provide the services required upon short notice.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon time restraints is solely within the discretion of the Government.  No solicitation document is available.
