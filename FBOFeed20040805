A report shall be included with the product that shall convey the data and analytical tools needed to operate the product; identify sources and likely costs for those data and analytical tools and assess their quality and suitability with respect to the intended uses; discuss the accessibility of the data and analytical tools to the target users; identify any data and information gaps that limit uses of the demonstration product.  The report shall also include a section that provides recommendations on how NOAA should proceed with developing data, tools, and knowledge to product climatology products useful to coastal manager.  The period of performance will be from date of award through 12 months thereafter.  This is a simplified acquisition and the applicable NAICS Code is 541690, size standard of $6,000,000.00.

<DESC>Eglin AFB intends to solicit and negotiate a sole source contract to perform Teleradiology services with University of South Alabama Health Services Foundation (USAHSF), Mobile, AL under the authority of FAR 13.5 and FAR 6.302-1(a)(2).         The Purchase Request Number is F77SGL41940200.     The NAICS Code 621512.     The small business standard is $11.5M.     USAHSF and Eglin are presently connected by a T-1 secure electronic communication line for the sole purpose of sending digitally telecommunicated images and mailed diagnostic studies for radiology interpretation and diagnostic film reading services.     Eglin will move to an AGFA IMPAX 4.5 DIN-PACS System and provide USAHSF with a Government-provided AGFA DS3000 Photographic Archive Control System (PACS) workstation.     Eglin Base Communications has approved the existing forms of telecommunication with USAHSF and to implement a new form of telecommunication would take 6 months to one year because firewall issues would have to be evaluated and approved prior to implementation of any other source.     USAHSF has established an approved interface with the Eglin Diagnostic Imaging Flight; has JCAHO accredited and board certified radiologists; whose credentials have been reviewed and are on record with the Credentialing Committee of the requesting military treatment facility; and a well-established support network for any missed communications.       The period of performance will be a base year, plus four option years as a firm-fixed price contract.     This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, the government will consider all quotations/responses received by 31 Aug 04.     This announcement is published for informational purposes only.     No other solicitation documents are available.     A determination by the government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.     Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.     Any quotations or questions can be faxed to Carmella Noll, AAC/PKOB, (850) 882-0334 or e-mailed to carmella.noll@eglin.af.mil no later than 10:00 AM CST, 31 Aug 04.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Panama City, FL intends to issue a purchase order on a sole source basis to Magneto Inductive Systems Limited (MISL) USA of San Bernardino, CA for conduct of a Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) planning study for the Magneto Inductive-Remote Activation Munitions System (MI-RAMS) program.  The MI-RAMS system is currently being developed under a sole source contract by MISL, Nova Scotia.  The LRIP planning study will include the development of plans and critical actions associated with LRIP of the system, identification of risk areas, and development of critical processes and procedures in preparation for LRIP and production.  The LRIP Planning Study will also include the identification of long lead items required for production of the various MI-RAMS components.  This requirement is unsuitable for full and open competition for the following reasons.  The MI-RAMS cannot be procured competitively utilizing a technical data package. Curre! ntly the patents and intellectual property rights to the relevant MI technologies either belong solely to  MISL or are Government patents licensed to MISL.     The company is thus the only source sufficiently knowledgeable in details of the system design and MI technology to perform the LRIP study.  Additionally, per the approved MI-RAMS program Acquisition Plan, the LRIP and production quantities will be acquired from the system developer. MISL is the sole developer of MI-RAMS.  Accordingly, MISL USA will be the sole provider of MI-RAMS LRIP and production quantities.  NAICS Code 541710 applies. SBA Size Standard is 750 employees (based on NAICS Code 334290). FSC is 5895.

<DESC>Specific Work Requirement:  The client requires dry-wood termite fumigation and glycol borate treatment inside three identically sized warehouses, constructed with cinder block and terra cotta walls, and exposed wooden ceiling, rafters, and interior floor-to-ceiling beams.  Each building measures 497 feet long by 202 feet wide.  Each building is topped with a series of three lengthwise curved-arch roofs.  Picture three loaves of bread placed side by side by side.  Each of the three arched roofs is topped by a windowed crows nest running the entire 497 foot length of the arch and measuring approximately ten feet wide and eight feet high.  The base of the roof is approximately 17 feet above floor level at 1) the exterior walls and at 2) both points 67 feet in from the exterior walls, where the three lengthwise arches join.  Height at the top of the arch is approximately 25 feet.  The crows nests were designed to allow in light and are open to the floor below.  The warehouses contain a number of wooden crates and boxes and care should be taken to minimize dripping or spray of glycol borate.  Computer workstations and forklifts will require tarp covering.  Based on the dimensions cited, the government estimates each building to contain approximately 2,500,000 cubic feet of space requiring Vikane/Chloropicrin fumigation.  The ceiling area is estimated at approximately 100,000 square feet, plus a factor of 50% to cover rafters, crows nest, floor-to-ceiling beams, and various doorways.  Therefore total glycol borate treatment area per building is estimated at 150,000 square feet.  Total gassed volume for all three buildings is estimated at 7,500,000 cubic feet and total glycol borate treated areas for all three buildings is estimated at 450,000 square feet.
Site Visit:  A site visit will be provided for any contractor requiring one, scheduled for 9:00AM Tuesday morning 17 AUG 04, otherwise, you may rely on the government estimates.

<DESC>National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG), Occupational Epidemiology Branch (OEB) plans to procure services for Epigenetic Studies of Bladder Cancer in the Spanish Bladder Cancer Study, on a sole source basis with FUNDACIO IMIM, 80 Drive Aiguder Road, Barcelona, E-08003, Spain.  The supplies and services herein are being procured in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures authorized in FAR Part 13.  The North American Industry Classification System Code is 541990 and the business size standard is $6M.  The Occupational and Environmental Epidemiology Branch (OEEB) is primarily involved with epidemiology studies of occupational exposures and other risk factors for cancer.  The Spanish Bladder Cancer Study-Support Service is currently being performed under NCI contract N02CP11015.  The purpose of the proposed project is to: 1) Measure the %5-MeC content in DNA samples currently stored at IMIM (Barcelona, Spain) from 2269 cases and controls enrolled in the Spanish Bladder Cancer Study 2) Calculate the percent of 5-MeC/Total Cytosine content for all participants with genomic DNA samples from this study 3) Conduct a pilot study to determine if DNA extracted from formalin fixed paraffin embedded tumor blocks collected from this study can be used to conduct a larger epigenetic study of bladder cancer etiology.  The data will be used by the government to determine whether lymophocyte global DNA hypomethylation is higher in cases compared to controls and whether an in vivo exposure such as smoking can directly influence global methylation profiles in humans.  Part two of this study will provide valuable information that will be used to determine the possibility of using bladder tumor blocks collected in the Spanish Bladder Cancer study for larger studies utilizing methylation- specific PCR to measure promoter hypermethylation in bladder cancer genes.  Fundacio IMIM is the only source known to the NCI that can provide the services required.  Between 1998-2001, Drs. Malats, Real, and Kogevinas of Fundacio IMIM served as co-principal investigators in the Spanish Bladder Cancer Study.   For the purpose of scientific continuity and comparability with the earlier data, the scientific expertise, knowledge and familiarity of all past and ongoing work is necessary.   This is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can perform the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The statement of capabilities and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can perform this requirement.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 PM EST, August 20, 2004.  If you have any questions they must be submitted in writing to Malinda Holdcraft, Purchasing Agent, at holdcram@exchange.nih.gov or by fax 301-402-4513.   A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Solicitation number must be cited on all correspondence, NCI-40125-NG.

Due to the proprietary nature of the VX-In software, the existence of limited rights in data, patent rights and copyrights, MTS Systems Corporation is the only know source with the unique capabilities, required access, and knowledge to provide the upgraded dyno controller and more importantly the modifications to the VXIn system. The upgrade to HD Cell 1 is required to sustain functionality and maintainability of the HD Cell 1 aging DC dyno control system.  The existing dyno controller in HD engine Cell 1 is dated and is no longer serviceable or available.  The contractor shall configure, assemble, install and implement a replacement for the Digalog 2022 in Heavy Duty Engine Cell 1.  The upgrade shall include a new field supply installed in the existing Siemens drive cabinet, wiring, hardware, installation, commissioning, VXIn modifications, VXIn interfacing, acceptance testing, and documentation. All current capabilities/functionality of HD Cell 1 shall be preserved after the upgrade.  Acceptance testing shall include Demonstration of Successful Transient Cycle Performance per CFR 86.1341-98 Test Cycle Validation Criteria.  The EPA anticipates the award of a firm fixed price type contract.   THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.  However, any firm believing itself capable of meeting EPA requirements may submit technical documentation to establish the potential of completing this work.  Such documentation must be submitted to the POC by August 19, 2004 in order to be considered by EPA.   TELEPHONE RESPONSES WILL NOT BE HONORED.  A determination not to compete the proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>The Contraception and Reproductive Health Branch, Center for Population Research, and National Institute of Child Health and Human Development has a requirement for the synthesis and testing of nonsteroidal and nonhormonal male contraceptive agents which prevent the formation of spermatozoa in the testis, prevent the maturation of spermatozoa in the epididymis, and alter the integrity of stored spermatozoa. Such compounds should be devoid of (or have minimal) ancillary endocrine, central nervous system, cardiovascular and/or other side effects. The reversibility of infertility after drug treatment is desirable. Safe drugs that result in sterility will be considered. Organizations must have adequate facilities and capabilities to carry out the proposed synthetic chemical and testing program. The Federal Government is prepared to test such compounds in several standard assays if the contractor is unable to perform such testing. Specifically excluded from this project are GnRH analogs, gossypol derivatives, steroids, cytotoxic agents including triptolide, tripdiolide and tripchlorolide, and all alkylating agents including expoxy compounds, fluoroacetamide, chloro- and bromohydrin, deoxyhalosugars, thiosugars, nitrogen mustards, ethyleneimines, and sulfonoxylalkanes including ethylene glycol disulfonate. Also excluded are nucleosides, nucleotides, nonspecific antimetabolites, antimitotic agents such as colchicine, N-substituted diamines (i.e., WIN. 13,099), most major classes of antibiotics including the macrolides, penicillins, cephalosporins, quinolones and tetracyclines, sulfasalzazine, cotrimoxazole, and ketoconazole. Nitroheterocyclic compounds are also excluded. Proposals to merely collect compounds from various sources and/or only perform biological assays will not be considered. All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by the agency. It is anticipated that three (two (2) for synthesis and testing and one (1) for synthesis only) cost-reimbursement incrementally funded type contracts will be awarded as a result of the RFP for a period of thirty-six (36) months each with options to renew for two years. This announcement is not a request for proposals (RFP).
The required service is defined as code 541990 under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS). The Request for Proposal (RFP) will be available on or before August 5, 2004 through the web site at http://FedBizOpps.gov. All responses must be submitted on or before October 15, 2004, to: Robert Stallings, Contract Specialist, Contracts Management Branch, OAM, NICHD, 6100 Executive Boulevard, Suite 7A07, MSC 7510, Bethesda, Maryland, 20892-7510 (if sending by overnight carrier, use 6l00 Executive Boulevard, Suite 7A07, Rockville Maryland, 20852) or Email at: nichdcmb@mail.nih.gov.

Firms responding to this announcement are further requested  to consider and disclose any potential conflict of interest issues in their responses.  No phone calls will be accepted.   Requirement and programmatic information including PWS task areas are outlined below: GENERAL DESCRIPTION:  The requirement for Technical Support for the Development of  Outcome Measures for the Federal Facilities Superfund Response Program will provide research, analysis, and associated support to gather, analyze and prepare data necessary for EPA to make informed policy and program management choices to support the evaluation and development of outcome oriented  performance and accountability measures to assess the effectiveness, efficiency, and results of the implementation of the Federal Facility Superfund Response program.   The contractor shall have NO input in making policy decisions and will be strictly employed in providing support in developing  outcome based measures to adequately measure the benefits of the response actions EPA undertakes and participates in at the nation's federal facilities.   PROGRAMMATIC INFORMATION AND BACKGROUND:  Throughout the United States, thousands of federal facilities are contaminated with hazardous waste,  unexploded ordnance, radioactive waste, fuels, and a variety of other toxic contaminants.  These facilities include a variety of sites, such as abandoned mines, nuclear weapons production plants, fuel distribution areas, and landfills on active or closed military and energy facilities.  In 1994,  EPA established the Federal Facilities Restoration & Reuse Office (FFRRO) in response to challenges that contamination poses at federal facilities.  FFRRO's overall mission is to facilitate faster, more effective and less costly cleanup and reuse of federal facilities.  FFRRO works with DoD, DOE,  and other federal entities to help them develop creative, cost-effective solutions to their environmental problems, as well as with states who often serve as co-regulators.  These efforts include, but are not limited to, oversight and approval of cleanup activities and community involvement  efforts, as well as coordinating, tracking, and monitoring site cleanup efforts by the federal agencies.  The EPA Superfund Federal Facilities program has a number of milestones in the cleanup process where progress is measured by counting the number of actions undertaken, or program 'output'  measures.  However, the program currently lacks the ability to adequately measure the ultimate benefits of environmental restoration activities at federal facilities, or environmental 'outcome' measures, and is particularly interested in determining if it is possible to put such measures into terms  that the public, Congress, and others can readily understand and appreciate.  These types of measures are of particular importance given Congress' and the Administration's focus on program reviews (e.g., OMB's Program Assessment Rating Tool (PART)) and determining the level to which a particular  program is providing benefits to the public with taxpayer dollars.  The EPA Superfund Federal Facilities program needs to develop measures where the outcomes of the work it conducts can be successfully measured and provided to stakeholders, as well as provide a possible avenue for joint  measurement by all Federal cleanup programs.  Given that EPA is not the lead agency responsible for the cleanup of sites designated as federal facilities, our role is much different from that of the Superfund program addressing private sites. TECHNICAL TASK REQUIREMENT Development of Potential  Environmental, Human Health, and Property Transfer Outcome Measures.   Provide technical assistance, conducting research, and performing analyses to support FFRRO's efforts to measure results in terms of outcomes to complement its suite of output measures.  The program currently tracks output  measures such as the number of construction completions achieved and a determination of the final remedy selected for a site.   "	Provide technical support for identifying and communicating techniques and methods for developing valid outcome-focused performance goals and measures.  This may  include searching literature and databases for information on public health, environmental and other performance goals, measures and indicators, as well as compiling information on environmental conditions from other federal programs as well as federal and state cleanup partners. "	Develop a draft  list of 15 to 20 possible outcome measures that focus on the outcomes and benefits to human health, the environment, and economic revitalization from the restoration and transfer of contaminated federal properties.  EPA is particularly interested in the means to which these benefits, or outcomes,  can be valued in monetary terms.   "	Assess the availability, relevance, and quality of data to support any outcome performance measures.  Any outcome measures developed which do not use data already collected by EPA should include a description of the data that would be needed for the measures to  be implemented and the mechanisms through which such data would be found and collected.   Finalization of Environmental, Human Health, and Property Transfer Outcome Measures Developed Upon finalization of the performance measures by the program, develop an appropriate baseline for the selected  measures.  Assist in developing an implementation plan for those measures to include appropriate data rules necessary to ensure data quality and a description of appropriate methods to uniformly collect needed data across the EPA regions.

SOLE SOURCE DETERMINATION IS BASED UPON THE FOLLOWING:


TESTING A METHOD TO DEVELOP A STATE LEVEL DATABASE FOR HEALTH AND RELATED ANALYSES

QUANTRIA STRATEGIES, LLC IS A VERY SMALL BUSINESS AND IS UNIQUELY QUALIFIED TO COMPLETE THE WORK REQUIRED UNDER PROCUREMENT FOR THE OFFICE OF THE ASSISTANT SECRETARY FOR PLANNING AND EVALUATION (OASPE).  THIS PROCUREMENT WILL TEST A CONCEPT AND METHODOLOGY, DEVELOPED BY QUANTRIA, TO CONSTRUCT A DATABASE WHICH SUPPLEMENTS THE DATA AVAILABLE 2000 DECENNIAL CENSUS PUBLIC USE MICRO-DATA SAMPLE WITH DETAILED INFORMATION ON INCOME, HEALTH STATUS AND HEALTH INSURANCE FROM OTHER NATIONAL SURVEYS AND ADMINISTRATIVE DATABASES TO PROVIDE A TOOL FOR ASSESSING STATE LEVEL INFORMATION.  THE METHODOLOGY, BIPARTITE WEIGHTED CONSTRAINED MATCHING, PERMITS HITTING CONTROL TOTALS WHILE AT THE SAME TIME ALLOWING FOR CORRELATION AMONGST KEY VARIABLES.  THE RESULTING DATABASE WILL PROVIDE THE DEPARTMENT WITH A CRITICAL TOOL FOR ADDRESSING POLICY QUESTIONS RELATED TO HEALTH INSURANCE AND THE UNINSURED, BOTH ISSUES CENTRAL TO THE DEPARTMENT'S MISSION.  ONE OF THE SECRETARY'S PRIORITIES IS DEVELOPING AND IMPLEMENTING STRATEGIES FOR REDUCING THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS WITHOUT HEALTH INSURANCE.  AS SUCH, OASPE IS CURRENTLY INVOLVED IN EXAMINING A WIDE RANGE OF ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES IN SUPPORT OF THIS PRIORITY. WITHOUT ADEQUATE ANALYSIS OF STATE LEVEL INFORMATION, OASPE WILL NOT BE IN A POSITION TO ADVISE THE SECRETARY ABOUT THE RELATIVE EFFICACY OF THESE OPTIONS IN REDUCING THE NUMBER OF UNINSURED.  THEREFORE, THE NEED FOR THIS WORK IS IMMEDIATE.

THE PRINCIPALS AT QUANTRIA STRATEGIES HAVE A LONG HISTORY OF SUCCESSFULLY CONSTRUCTING TIMELY AND WELL-DOCUMENTED COMPLEX DATABASES AND SIMULATION MODELS FOR CLIENTS SUCH AS THE CONGRESSIONAL RESEARCH SERVICE AND THE CONGRESSIONAL  JOINT TAX COMMITTEE AND UNIQUELY QUALIFIED TO COMPLETE THIS EFFORT WITHIN THE TIME FRAME AND BUDGET AVAILABLE FOR THE PROJECT..  IN ADDITION, THE PRINCIPALS HAVE EXPERT KNOWLEDGE AND EXTENSIVE EXPERIENCE IN USING THE MANY DATABASES THAT MAY BE AN INTEGRAL PART OF THIS PROCUREMENT (E.G. THE STATISTIC OF INCOME, NATIONAL HEALTH INTERVIEW SURVEY, DECENNIAL CENSUS MICRO FILES, CURRENT POPULATION SURVEY).  THE PRINCIPALS OF QUANTRIA HAVE EXTENSIVE EXPERIENCE IN DEVELOPING AND IMPLEMENTING AN ARRAY OF STATISTICAL DATA MATCHING AND IMPUTATION METHODS CRITICAL TO THE SUCCESSFUL AND TIMELY COMPLETION OF THIS PROCUREMENT INCLUDING THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE BIPARTITE WEIGHTED CONSTRAINED MATCHING METHOD.  THE METHOD RELIES ON SPECIAL RANDOMIZED ALGORITHMS (SIMULATED ANNEALING) RATHER THAN USING THE USUAL 
NON-LINEAR PROGRAMMING METHODS.  THE SOFTWARE IS PROPRIETARY, AND IT IS NOT SOMETHING THAT IS GENERALLY AVAILABLE.   THEREFORE, FOR THE REASONS CITED ABOVE, WE ARE CONFIDENT QUANTRIA STRATEGIES, LLC WILL BE ABLE TO COMPLETE THE WORK UNDER THIS PROCUREMENT IN A RAPID, TIMELY FASHION, WHICH WILL BE CRITICAL FOR HELPING ASPE DEVELOP THE TOOLS TO EXAMINE POLICY OPTIONS AT THE STATE LEVEL.

 
THE PROPOSED SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION IS FOR SERVICES FOR WHICH THE GOVERNMENT
INTENDS TO SOLICIT AND NEGOTIATE WITH ONLY ONE SOURCE (FAR 6.302-1).  A DETERMINATION BY THE GOVERNMENT NOT TO COMPETE THIS PROPOSED SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION BASED UPON RESPONSES TO THIS NOTICE IS SOLELY WITHIN THE DISCRETION OF THE GOVERNMENT. CONTRACTORS MAY FORWARD CAPABILITY STATEMENTS TO THE REFERENCED ADDRESS.  INFORMATION RECEIVED WILL NORMALLY BE CONSIDERED SOLELY FOR THE PURPOSES OF DETERMINING WHETHER TO CONDUCT A COMPETITIVE PROCUREMENT. 

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION, PLEASE CONTACT DARREN JANSEN, IN ROOM 5C-13, PARKLAWN

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The FAA Oceanic and Offshore Integrated Product Team has developed and deployed the Microprocessor Enroute Automated Radar Tracking System (MEARTS).  This system receives and integrates radar data from multiple sensors and displays the information for use in control of air traffic.  MEARTS is currently installed in nine FAA and Department of Defense locations and at the William J. Hughes Technical Center (WJHTC) and the FAA Academy. The MEARTS was developed and installed, and is maintained by, the Lockheed Martin Corporation under a five year contract that was awarded in December 1994.  The contract was subsequently extended until December 2004.  This procurement will be for services to maintain the MEARTS for five years.  Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMCO) is the current contractor providing these services; therefore, LMCO will not be required to submit documentation evidencing their capabilities. The potential contractor must have expert knowledge of the MEARTS and the MEARTS air traffic control environment and must have the capability to develop, maintain, archive, and control access to MEARTS source code through an established configuration controlled process.  The contractor must have expert knowledge of all MEARTS external interfaces, i.e. flight data processors, Minimally Attended Radars (MAR-1 and MAR-4), ARSR-3, ARSR-4, ASR-9, ASR-11, common digitizers, the Capstone Communication and Control system, SITA, NADIN, and WARP.  The contractor must maintain a logistic and depot capability that supports all MEARTS sites.  Minimum technical hardware and software capability requirements include: 1.	Complete MEARTS software and hardware maintenance and testing capability adaptable to emulate all MEARTS facilities; 2.	An established software maintenance infrastructure allowing simultaneous access to MEARTS source code by both contractor and government organizations while protecting the confidentiality, configuration, and integrity of baselined and in-process modification  copies; 3.	The contractor must be able to dispatch properly trained and qualified support personnel, as necessary, to any MEARTS facility on 24 hour notice to restore MEARTS service; 4.	Expert knowledge of MEARTS software and hardware and established procedures for maintenance and modification of MEARTS software or hardware; 5.	Recent experience developing and maintaining a NAS certified operational Radar Data Processor capable of integrating primary and secondary radar, Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast, Automatic Dependent Surveillance Addressed, and NEXRAD weather radar sensor inputs; 6.	ISO-9001 certification; 7.	Recent experience operating a contractor depot logistics system. The vendor will be required to furnish labor, facility, materials, special tools, parts, and test equipment to perform software and hardware maintenance and Contractor Maintenance and Logistic Support at all MEARTS sites and support facilities.  MEARTS contains some proprietary software and the vendor will have to negotiate with LMCO for use of this software.  Alternatively, the vendor may recreate the functionality.  The anticipated contract type for this procurement is Time and Material.  The total period of performance is five years, and the total estimated cost is $20,000,000. Interested vendors shall respond with a technical statement of experience and proven capabilities of working technically equivalent systems in a similar environment, and proven record of providing timely and efficient support services.  Vendors must address all items 1-7 above.  Vendors shall also provide a transition plan detailing steps needed to transfer the sustainment work without impacting the schedule of fixes to software troubles or impacting the maintenance of the system hardware at the sites.  The FAA will not pay for any information received or costs incurred in preparing responses to the announcement.  Any proprietary information should be marked.  Also, this announcement shall not be construed as a request for proposal or as an obligation on the part of the FAA to acquire these services.  Responses must be received NLT June 18, 2004.

<DESC>NOTE:  A NEW ATTACHMENT HAS BEEN ADDED AT THE END OF THIS SYNOPSIS.  THIS IS AN INVITATION FOR INDUSTRY TO MEET WITH THE GOVERNMENT. The Joint Primary Aircraft Training System (JPATS) Aircraft Program, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH is conducting an additional market survey for the follow-on Contractor Logistics Support (CLS) of the T-6A Texan II aircraft.  We anticipate at most a  10-year (9 month basic and 9 annual ordering periods) Firm-Fixed Price/Time and Materials, Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity IDIQ) contract with contract award in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 15 no later than 30 Sep 2005.    NOTE:  THIS MARKET SURVEY SUPERCEDES PIXS SYNOPSIS 03R0009W (SOLICITATION #F33657-03-R-0009), WHICH WAS  PUBLISHED ON 28 Mar 03.  OUR ORIGINAL REQUIREMENT HAS  CHANGES; WE WILL BE ACQUIRING CONTRACTOR OPERATED MANAGED  BASE SUPPLY (COMBS) ONLY.  AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE SERVICE  WILL NO LONGER BE INCLUDED ON THIS ACTION.   T-6A Background The T-6A is a derivative of the Swiss Pilatus PC-9 MK II, which  uses Non-Developmental Items (NDI) or derivatives of  commercially available items to meet most system requirements.   The   T-6A was missionized by Raytheon Aircraft Company  (RAC), Wichita, Kansas to replace the United States Air Force  (USAF) T-37B and the United States Navy (USN) T-34C primary  training aircraft.  Raytheon owns the data rights to the T-6A  design and all peculiar support equipment.  The T-6A is a low  wing, high performance, pressurized, turboprop aerobatic trainer.   The T-6A will provide entry-level students with the skills  necessary for contact/familiarization, instruments, formation, and  navigation during both day and night conditions.   T-6A training  will lead to a level of proficiency that permits transition into one  of the USAF or USN advanced pilot training tracks.   Current Environment There are presently 143 T-6As stationed at four main operating  bases (MOB):  Randolph AFB, Texas; Moody AFB, Georgia;  Laughlin AFB, Texas; and Naval Air Station (NAS) Pensacola,  Florida.  At the end of this 10-year CLS follow-on support  contract (through FY 2015), there will be a total of 782 aircraft in  the field stationed at these four MOBs and these additional bases:  Sheppard AFB, Texas; Vance AFB, Oklahoma; and Columbus  AFB, Mississippi; NAS Whiting, Florida; and NAS Corpus  Christi, Texas.   Currently, approximately 18% of the fleet has been delivered and  the production line is scheduled to continue through FY 2015 with  the production of 40-70 aircraft per year.  In addition, the USAF  anticipates approximately 30 Class I Engineering Change  Proposals through FY 2012 that will involve (but are not limited  to) both the airframe structural components (e.g., landing gear)  and avionics subsystems.  Attached is a list of some of the tasks in  the execution or planning stages that will affect the upcoming  CLS requirement. At this time, Raytheon Aircraft Company (RAC) provides both  the T-6A production and CLS COMBS functions for this program.   Presently, there are 4,000 line items that need to be managed; this  figure may change as engineering changes are accomplished to the  aircraft.  If the awardee of this contract is other than the  incumbent, the Government would require the establishment of an  Associate Contractor Agreement (ACA) with the aircraft  manufacture/ sustaining engineering contractor (Raytheon Aircraft  Company, Wichita KS) and major subsystem contractors for  avionics, engines, etc.  Approximately 60% of the dollar value of  spare parts is controlled by RAC proprietary drawings and designs  which only specific suppliers are licensed to manufacturer.  In  addition, all aircraft parts are required to be manufactured and  repaired under Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certified  processes to maintain airworthiness certification for military use. Follow-On Contract Description The CLS follow-on contract will procure COMBS support in  accordance with FAR 15 for the   T-6A aircraft at 11 Air Force  and Navy sites.  The contractor shall establish, operate and  manage a COMBS at each operating base providing a range and  depth (contractor determined) of spare parts/bench stock including  parts for off-equipment/I-Level backshops, spare engines, engine  Quick Engine Change (QEC) kits, engine modular components,  repair parts, peculiar (special) hand tools, support equipment (SE)  and expendables (including aircraft and SE bench stock) necessary  to support the assigned JPATS aircraft at the specified utilization  rate.  The contractor will ensure that all COMBS components are  FAA certified in accordance with FAA (Federal Aviation  Administration) Part 23.  The contractor shall ensure that all spare  parts are configured, painted and balanced (if required) for  immediate installation on JPATS aircraft in accordance with the  approved government technical data.  The contractor shall ensure  that all items with shelf-life restrictions are maintained within items  allowable limitations and tolerances.  No JPATS aircraft  component repair/maintenance shall be accomplished in the  COMBS.  The contractor shall only store JPATS aircraft parts,  TCTO kits and SE in the COMBS.  The contractor shall maintain  data outlining required protective packaging and transportation  requirements (electrostatic discharge sensitive items, fragile items,  hazardous materials, etc) for contractor furnished spare parts and  SE subject to special packaging requirements. The contractor shall support the bases’ daily flight operations and  any OPLAN, exercise, deployment, static display, fly-by,  incentive flight or open house that involves JPATS aircraft or  COMBS.  The contractor shall have spare parts and expendables  (not maintained in bench stock) available for the operating  command within 30 minutes after receipt of a valid demand on the  COMBS during normal duty hours and 30 minutes after arrival at  the base when on-call.  In addition, the contractor will ensure  housekeeping is performed in the COMBS facility. The COMBS contractor will be expected to maintain a current  COMBS spare inventory.  As     T-6A configuration changes are  accomplished on the production line, the COMBS contractor will  update COMBS inventory as appropriate. The COMBS contractor will be expected to provide all support  equipment required to operate and maintain the T-6A.  A list will  be provided in any request for proposal. The COMBS contractor will be expected to perform or  subcontract off-site Intermediate and Depot level repair of failed  reparable components.  A list of historical failure rates and the  CAGE code of the manufacturer will be provided in any request  for proposal. The COMBS contractor will be expected to provide their own  office equipment, phones, phone service, furniture, material  handling equipment, etc., required to operate the COMBS. The COMBS contractor will be expected to manage hazardous  material IAW current Federal, State and Base regulations.  T6-A  hazardous materials are limited to paints/solvents, oils/greases and  explosive components of the escape system. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL  SUBMISSION.  It is a market research tool to determine the  availability and capability of potential sources.  Firms responding  to this announcement should indicate whether they are a large or  small business, small disadvantaged business, woman-owned  small business, HUBZone small business and/or service disabled  veteran-owned small business.

<DESC>PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDEMENT 015 (5 AUG 04)-Hoist Requirements In response to a question concerning additional hoist requirements, the  Government provides the following response: At this time, we have no additional specification requirements other than the  ORD requirement for a hoist to conduct PRV missions.  Performance requirements  for PRV subsystems, such as the hoist, shall be generated by the Prime  Contractor after a PRV contract award. The PRV System Program Office will not  prepare subsystem requirement documents at any time. It is recommended that potential suppliers of PRV subsystems contact potential  Prime Integration PRV companies for information and integration at the  subsystem level. PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDEMENT 014 (27 Jul 04)-Program Office Estimate The Air Force team is working on a program office estimate (POE) for the  Personnel Recovery Vehicle (PRV).  The POE team is chartered to develop an  estimate by work breakdown structure (WBS) for SDD, production and O+S for a  fleet of 130 aircraft. The team is lead by the Aeronautical Systems Center (ASC) cost staff and includes members of the PRV program office. The POE will be  establish as a cost guide for future PRV administrative hurdles including the  source selection process and MS B DAB review.    As a crucial POE building block for PRV presentations to DOD and AF review  boards, we would like to have actual cost from recently completed helicopter  programs as a starting point. We request that each participating RFI contractor  submit actual cost/price info from a recent sale of the proposed helicopter.  This info should justify the WBS level 3 information which you have previously  submitted. We are particularly interested in separating recurring and non- recurring airframe, engines, avionics and mission equipment for the development  and production portions of the program. Production weight of the airframe  should be included. Also, the information should be phased by year and  associated quantities (see below table).   	 	200X	 	200X	 	200X	 	200X  	      N/R    Rec     N/R    Rec	     N/R    Rec	      N/R   Rec Development	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	  Qty	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	  Airframe	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	  Engine 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	  Avionics	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	  Mission 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	  Production	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	  Qty	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	  Airframe	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	  Engine 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	  Avionics	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	  Mission 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	  Since some late summer acquisition briefings (Courses of Action) are required  we would like to have the information by 15 Aug 04 to incorporate into the POE.

PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDEMENT 006 (31 Mar 04)- Sikorsky Briefing In response to questions during the one-on-on sessions between Prime  Contractors and the ASC/LUH at the 4 March Industry Day, Sikorsky plans to  brief the SPO on 14 April at 15:00 for about 1hour. PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDEMENT 005 (22 Mar 04)- Team 101 Briefing In response to questions during the one-on-on sessions between Prime  Contractors and the ASC/LUH at the 4 March Industry Day, Lockheed Team 101  plans to brief the SPO on 13 April at 10:00 for about 1 hour. PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDEMENT 004 (19 Mar 04)- Questions and Answers The following questions were submitted to the government.  All questions and  answers have been cleared through the Public Affairs office. 1.  Question:  Could you give a brief description of the areas that are not  currently met by the existing fleet of helicopters now or in the expected  future that are driving the need for a new platform? Answer:  Current deficiencies are: -Service Life.  The HH-60G is approaching the end of its useful service life. -Survivability.  Insufficient survivability (susceptibility and vulnerability)  to ensure mission success against the Defense Planning Guidance (DPG) validated  threat environment. This includes a limited electronic warfare suite,  insufficient defensive armament for suppression of air and ground threats, and  inadequate protection from small arms fire -Range / Combat radius. Aircraft and rotor system design limit unrefueled  combat radius.  In certain theaters, these characteristics do not meet  Combatant Commanders mission requirements for mission execution. -Payload capacity / Cabin volume. Extremely limited cabin space for stowage and  employment of mission equipment and crew served weapons, infiltration of  Recovery Teams, exfiltration of Recovery Teams and isolated personnel, and  medical treatment of isolated personnel. -Battlespace awareness.  Lack of line-of-sight (LOS) and BLOS high speed LPE  data links for battle space/situational awareness of isolated personnel’s  location, threat information, and location of friendly forces. -Mission react time. Deployment shortfalls that prevent current combat rescue  forces from being mission ready upon commencement of hostilities – the most  likely time for losses.  -Adverse weather capability.  Lack of adverse weather penetration system(s) to  perform PR missions in a combat environment. ACC conducted an AoA to evaluate potential solutions to current validated  deficiencies. A new medium-lift helicopter was recommended as the most cost- effective solution to replace the aging HH-60G. This recommendation was briefed  to and approved by the AFROC in June 01. 2. Question:  Could you describe the KPPs as they exist for the program now? Answer:   •The PRV with a full, standard configuration load (SCL) must have a straight- line unrefueled combat mission radius of 325 nautical miles (nm). •The downwash in and around the recovery vehicle produced by the PRV during Hot  Day tactical hover operations in all environments (to include heavily forested,  steep mountainous, smooth-level, rough-level, smooth-sloped, and rough-sloped  terrain in calm and high crosswind conditions with loose particles such as tree  limbs, sand, water or rocks in the hover zone) at mid-mission gross weights  with SCL in Appendix C must not prevent recovery team or injured and uninjured  isolated personnel safe operations (hover extraction operations (hoist),  providing emergency lifesaving measures to isolated personnel, placement of a  non-ambulatory personnel in a hoist recovery device, overland movement, self- protection, communication, and swimming). •The PRV must satisfy 100% of top level information exchange requirements (IER)  designated as critical.  Satisfaction is defined as sender/receiver must be  able to execute the required function/mission task without operator  intervention.  (Interoperability KPP).   •To support Air and Space Expeditionary Force (ASEF) tasking requiring little  or no warning, mission ready PRV aircraft, weapons, and support equipment must  be capable of worldwide self-deployment (4000 nm) and mission ready within 24  hours of notification or configurable to fit within existing transport aircraft  (USAF AMC C-5 and C-17 transport aircraft) within 3 hours of initial  notification and capable of being made mission ready within 3 hours upon  arrival at destination. 3. Question:  What is the projected timeline for the program? Answer:  To accelerate procurement and fielding as much as possible from the  currently planned IOC of 2014 4. Question:  Does the PRV program expect to utilize other platforms, such as    UAVs as part of its organic group of systems? Answer:  The mission area of CSAR is expected to utilize UAV gathered  information to support successful mission execution. 5. Question  Mr Vokits spoke of the "Technical Descriptions + Challenges."  Could any of those be shared? Answer:  The PIXS PRV website contains a downloadable copy of all the briefings  used at Industry Day, including those on Technical Descriptions + Challenges.   These are related to translating operational requirements into specific  technical understanding of the performance requirements.  The user, the  acquirer, the sustainer and Industry must maintain an active interface and  continual interaction throughout the acquisition and sustainment phases to  ensure there is minimal confusion on requirements interpretation.  This is  especially true when using an evolutionary acquisition approach (today+s  standard DOD approach to weapons systems procurement). 6.  Question:  Milestone dates for RFP, SDD award, first flight, opeval, LRIP,  RAA, FRP? Answer:  No milestone dates have been set.  Programmatics are still being  developed.  A draft schedule leading to contract award was part of the  information provided to industry.  Please refer to ASC PIXS web site as these  dates are developed.   7.  Question:  Structure and details of competitive phase?   Answer:  Programmatics are still being developed.  Please refer to ASC PIXS web  site for updates.   8.  Question:  Specific Block 0 vs. Block 10 capabilities    Answer:  The block approach requirements are still under development.  Please  refer to ASC PIXS web site for updates.   9.  Question:  Concepts for future spirals?   Answer:  Technology insertion and future requirements will be addressed in the  Draft RFP.   10.  Question:  Development and operational test plans? How many test flights  are planned?   Answer:  The details have not been worked out.  The Test + Evaluation Master  Plan (TEMP) has not been drafted but is anticipated on being completed by RFP  release.   11.  Question:  How is the program balancing the risks poised by the aggressive  development timeline?   Answer:  The Air force has a Risk Management Process.   This process will begin  with a Risk Workshop on 23 Mar 04 and will continue throughout the development  acquisition phase.   12.  Question:  From lessons learned in Iraq and Afghanistan, any changes to  requirements for performance, range, onboard capabilities, fleet size?   Answer:  The PRV ORD was developed from requirements derived during the CSAR  AoA. Lessons learned from Afghanistan and Iraq were incorporated during the  draft and coordination process.  They will continue to be analyzed as we write  and coordinate Change 1 to the ORD.  The process to produce Change 1 to  incorporate a Block modification approach has already begun. 13.  Question:  Any participation with navy and marines at this stage in the  program? Answer:  Not at this time.

Using your current production or anticipated design(s) as a technical  starting point, what would be the minimum timeframe, including long lead  procurement, and minimum number of test assets that would be required to  design, integrate, test, ensure adequate production capacity, and produce four  LRIP aircraft in both of the configurations listed above? PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDEMENT 001 (6 Feb 04)- Industry Day Announcement  The Special Operations Forces-Combat Search and Rescue Systems Program Office  SOF-CSAR SPO) will host an Industry Day on 4 March 2004 at the Holiday Inn in  Fairborn, Ohio to inform industry of a new program to develop and procure 132  Personnel Recovery Vehicles (PRV).  This procurement activity is scheduled to  begin sometime later this year, and will be a very aggressive, quick moving  development program.  This Industry Day will be a one day event where the  program office will brief industry on what the program entails to ensure that  industry has an understanding of the requirements and intent of the PRV  program.    The agenda is being developed at this time.  It will include government  briefings on the program, possible acquisition strategies, operator  requirements and a question and answer session in the morning.  The afternoon  will be reserved for prime contractors to meet one-on-one with government  representatives to ask questions of a proprietary nature and describe their  unique abilities to meet the requirements stated in the operational  requirements document.    Individuals wishing to attend this Industry Day must register online via the  MarketSpace link at the bottom of this page.  This Industry Day is restricted  to United States citizens.  All attendees must present a government issued  photo identification, as well as a birth certificate or U.S. passport for registration on the day of the event.  The Industry Day will be oriented  toward rotary wing prime contractors; contractors who have the ability to  design and manufacture medium lift vertical take-off/landing medium lift class  vehicles.  Suppliers to these prime contractors will also be eligible to  attend.  Contractors who are interested in obtaining a copy of the draft Operational  Requirements Document (ORD) and a draft of the Statement of Objectives (SOO)  may request them by sending an e-mail message to SOF.PRV@wpafb.af.mil. All  requests must include the company name as well as the Commercial and Government  Entity (CAGE) code.  REGISTER FOR PRV INDUSTRY DAY: All individuals planning on attending the PRV Industry Day must register online  through MarketSpace via the link at the bottom of the announcement. PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE (Initial) (29 Jan 04) The Special Operations Forces-Combat Search and Rescue Systems Program Office  at Aeronautical Systems Center (ASC) is starting up a new program to develop  and procure 132 Personnel Recovery Vehicles (PRV).  This effort is follow-on to  the Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) completed by Air Combat Command (ACC) in  2001 which recommend replacing 104 HH-60G light helicopters with 132 medium- lift helicopters for the combat search and rescue mission.  The responsibility  for combat search and rescue was transferred from ACC to Air Force Special  Operations Command (AFSOC) on 1 October 2003.  The operational requirements  developed by ACC at the end of the Analysis of Alternatives remain essentially  the same.  Recently, the USAF has decided to evaluate the possibility of  accelerating Initial Operational Capability of the PRV Program.   An Industry Day will be held on a date TBA (March 2004 timeframe) at a location  TBA in the Dayton, Ohio area.  A follow-up announcement specifying the date and  place is forthcoming.  This is an initial opportunity for industry to meet with  cognizant government representatives and discuss the known requirements and  intent of the PRV program.  This Industry Day will also provide industry an  opportunity to comment on the Operational Requirements Document (ORD), to be  provided at a later date, and for industry to express an interest in becoming a  contender in the PRV program.  Contractors will be given an overview of the PRV program.  Contractors will  also be given an opportunity to discuss their understanding of the program and  to present their capabilities/ concepts in general terms during subsequent  meetings with the government.  This is to be considered an initial step in  establishing industry understanding of the PRV program and to allow the  government team to determine market understanding and capability to integrate  and complete the program. This is not a Request for Proposal.  The Government does not intend to award a  contract on the basis of this announcement.  Submitting capabilities and  concepts in response to this announcement is voluntary, and participants shall  not be compensated.  Any organization or company can obtain Personnel Recovery Vehicle announcements  and instructions via the Web at http://www.pixs.wpafb.af.mil.   Questions regarding technical information and/or this announcement should be  directed to SOF PRV Program office at the following email address:   SOF.PRV@wpafb.af.mil.

<DESC>This is a modification to the synopsis entitled Human & Robotic Technology which was posted on Jun 29, 2004. You are notified that the following changes are made:  Posting of Questions and Answers related to the Broad Agency Announcement (BAA). The due date for responses is not extended. Documents related to this procurement will be available over the Internet.  These documents will reside on a World Wide Web (WWW) server, which may be accessed using a WWW browser application.  The Internet site, or URL, for the NASA/HQ Business Opportunities home page is http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/eps/bizops.cgi?gr=D&pin=04  Offerors are responsible for monitoring this site for the release of the solicitation and any amendments.   Potential offerors are responsible for downloading their own copy of the solicitation and amendments (if any). A link to briefing charts and further details on the Broad Agency Announcement is located at: https://naccsli1.msfc.nas.gov/ExplorationPortal H&RT Pre-Proposal Conference, Q&As (2) Q29.  What level of subsystem is contemplated and would a propulsion system subsystem which would include propellant, piping, the control system be appropriate for the H&RT response? A29.  The TRL range dictates the level of technology research in ASTP and TMP.	Component level research occurs in ASTP and system level research in TMP.  It is up to offeror to determine how this research will be carried out within the constraints of his technical and management resources. Q30.  Are Technology Maturation Projects appropriate as options to advanced space technology projects?  Example:	 Base year      AST Theme Option 1       AST-TA Option 2	TM Program A30.   The H&RT program is looking for projects that will lie within the scope of the ASTP and begin a one-year Phase 1 study and subsequently qualify to go to Phase II development.  Just because an ASTP project is successfully completed does not necessarily mean that it will automatically be placed in the TMP.  Depending on how the H&RT portfolio is managed, ASTP completed projects will still need to be evaluated for consideration as TMP projects.	As a minimum, this will be accomplished using the BAA process in order to maintain a comprehensive up-to-date portfolio for the current research spiral. Q31.  How are low TRL technologies being identified for a given spiral? A31.  The process for any technology identification is based on what we call a strategy-task-to-technology approach.  This is basically a top down approach where at the high level you identify what are your basic strategic goals and objectives that you want to accomplish.	Given these guidelines, you can then begin to identify the specific tasks that are needed achieving the goals and objectives.  After accomplishing this, you can then define what flight element, systems and component technologies that are required for implementation.  This approach also helps NASA to determine what technology deficiencies or gaps exist in order to make the exploration vision a reality.   Q32.  With regard to the technology readiness levels that were specified for the various programs, if you say a technology maturation program is from TRL 4 to 6 does that mean it has to have already achieved TRL 3 or has already achieved TRL 4? A32.  The concept is that things going into technology maturation would be essentially at TRL 4 and would be progressing through the course of the full technology maturation project form TRL 4 to TRL 6.  Any TFE project that exists TMP has to be at a TRL&gt;=6 in order for Project Constellation to consider this technology for further development in its Exploration Systems Programs. Q33.  Could you give some details on what happened with the intramural proposal selections, what kind of technology do you find you are going to get solutions form through that? A34.  Results are posted on the Exploration Portal website. Q35.  Regarding the tools and databases, particularly when it comes to new technologies in the IT.  Do you envision supporting the other mission directives with that and also are you interested in improving the business processes associated with the systems? A35.  Yes, we are anticipating and looking for these investments to yield databases of broad value to NASA, including information technologies. Q36.  Cryogenic propellant was mentioned a couple of times for the main in space engine.  Is it necessary that it be cryogenic if a non cryogenic propulsion system can meet those requirements in a practical and affordable way and you also mention high energy space systems, if you have a system that is not high energy and it meets the requirements is it the high energy the important part, the cryogenic important part or is it the work that is produced is important? A36.  The technology themes mentioned in the High Energy Space Systems (HESS)  Element Program are the areas that we feel have the most potential for H &RT.  Q37.  Is the completion of the deliverable section of the NOI submittal form required?  If so what is the weighting criteria for it?  A37. Yes.  This information will help ascertain the appropriateness of the proposed deliverables. This information will be evaluated as part of the Technical Merit criteria as stated on page 16 of the BAA.  Q38.  Is it preferable to propose the development of a set of technologies to address an entire "specific area of interest" (which usually combines multiple disciplines), or a single technology that may have impact on a number of these areas? A38. We are not requiring that responses cover an entire "specific area of interest".  There is merit in addressing multiple tall poles in a single area to ensure the viability of a "complete" capability, but also in proposing breakthroughs that have the potential for broad applicability.

<DESC>Concerns having the ability to furnish the services described herein are requested to give written notification (including the telephone number for a point of contact) to the procuring office above within 30 calendar days from the date of this synopsis.  The U.S. Geological Survey, Geologic Hazards Team, has a requirement for services to develop a comprehensive regional catalog of all instrumentally recorded and historical earthquakes in Afghanistan and adjacent regions that influence the country's seismic hazard.  These services will involve specific cataloging tasks and special seismological studies as follows:  1) Compile a comprehensive Afghan earthquake catalog from preexisting computer databases and printed studies; 2) Design a procedure for identifying and removing duplicate entries from the catalog; 3) Evaluate cataloged hypocenters for their accuracy of locations; 4) Relocate earthquakes that are critical to the seismic hazard study; 5) Apply a hypocentral relative-location method to better define the distribution of earthquakes that might be associated with specific crustal fault systems; 6) Ensure that each earthquake listed in the comprehensive catalog has mb, mB, Mw magnitudes listed; and 7) Write a summary report on preparation of and characteristics of the comprehensive catalog.  Contractor must have experience in the evaluation of earthquake catalogs for accuracy of hypocenters, must have extensive knowledge of problems affecting earthquake locations in central Asia, as well as an understanding of regional tectonics and earthquake processes by analysis of earthquake locations, focal mechanisms, and focal depths.  Based on information available at this time, and in accordance with 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), implemented by FAR 5.302-1, the Government considers the items specified as a sole source from Global Seismological Services, 1900 19th Street, Golden, Colorado, and proposes to negotiate a contract with that firm on that basis.  However, should additional sources be identified, they will be considered.  Firms who feel that they can furnish the required supplies are invited to submit in writing an affirmative response to this announcement, and such other materials which correspond to the required items stated herein.  This information will be evaluated and used to determine if competitive opportunities exist.  Since no solicitation document exists, requests for such documents without accompanying information will be considered non-responsive to this request without further consideration.  This notice may represent the Government's only official notice of this procurement. See Note 22.

This Sources Sought Synopsis is published for market research purposes only, and in no way obligates the Government to issue a solicitation or otherwise make a contract award. 

The Defense Threat Reduction agency (DTRA) is seeking to identify qualified sources capable of providing support in the areas of database management, dose assessment and veteran assistance tasks in support of  the Nuclear Test Personnel review (NTPR) program.  The NTPR program is a Department of Defense (DoD) program, managed by the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) that provides crucially important information about veterans who participated in U.S. atmospheric nuclear testing between 1945 and 1962 and in the post-World-War II occupation of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.    The NTPR program is mandated by Public Law to supply veteran participation and dose information to the Department of Veteran Affairs (VA) and the Department of Justice (DOJ), so that Veteran claims can be adjudicated.  Without this information, VA and DOJ cannot complete their service to claimants.  The NTPR program acts as role model for other DoD and federal government programs dealing with the support of veterans and related claims and compensation programs and also in maintaining and preserving crucial documents for access by government researchers and the general public.  This program spawns a constant dialog with the military services on how to optimally process veterans’ radiation claims with the ultimate goal being to render the most efficient and effective service to veterans within the spectrum of like DoD programs.

  Qualified sources must have a secret facility clearance and contractor personnel must have a secret security clearance.  Qualified sources must be able to demonstrate that they can process claims in a timely manner.  Qualified sources either alone or with appropriate teaming partners must have demonstrated expertise/capability in all the following areas:   Performing dose reconstruction using dosimetry records and film badges; Reconstructing doses in cases where dosimetry records or film badges are unavailable or incomplete; Researching and verifying a veteran's participation at a specified location or test site; Collecting and analyzing all known sources of recorded dosimetry and radiation data applicable to test participants; Maintaining an existing comprehensive database of participation and dose information, along with supporting archival materials and documents; Conducting an extensive public outreach program to ensure maximum interface with the supported participants; Maintaining a database of the history of each U.S atmospheric nuclear weapons test operation; Supporting studies to determine whether participants experience adverse health effects as a result of their test activities; Providing accurate and timely responses to requests for information from incoming inquiries; Providing technical assessment of original film badge dosimetry;  Accessing and obtaining military documents, military service, medical, and organizational records in a timely fashion; Conducting declassification activities and coordinating public release; Conducting independent technical reviews and validations.  Sources having the capability to provide support for all of these requirements are invited to submit capabilities statements (6-10 pages maximum); capabilities statements need to include sufficient technical/management information for a panel to assess the contractor qualifications and experience in work of this nature.   Company information should include business size and a point of contact name, address, phone number and email address.   Documents shall be provided in electronic form (Microsoft WORD, EXCEL, or Power Point) to the Contract Specialist at:  DTRA, Attn:  BDCT/Debra L. Maschino, via email:  Debra.Maschino@DTRA.mil no later than 07 September 2004.  Any information submitted in response to this synopsis is strictly voluntary.  The Government will not pay for any information submitted in response to this Sources Sought.

<DESC>The US Army is currently in the process of modernizing several of its Sets, Kits and Outfits (SKOs) programs to coincide with the modernization and transformation of the US Army. The intent of issuing this sources sought synopsis is to solicit genera l information, brochures, sales and marketing pamphlets that will explain and describe in detail the pieces of equipment that may meet the U.S. Armys needs.  The information should include basic equipment design characteristics, hands-on/user experience, s hortcomings, or problem areas related to the use of your specific equipment. This information should be mailed to Executive Agent, Sets, Kits, Outfits and Tools, ATTN: AMSTA-LC-CTMM, Barry Hartleben or Larry Kemper, TACOM-RI, Rock Island, Illinois 61299-76 30 by 19 Sept 2004.  The specific system that TACOM-RI is currently reviewing and interested in developing a new or modernized system is the Hydraulic Systems Test and Repair Unit (HYSTRU).  This system was originally designed to be a 4ft by 8ft watertight  compartmentalized enclosure on a towed trailer, that would contain all the necessary tools to fabricate, fix and repair both metal, rubber and composition hydraulic tubing and hoses and house the associated hose adapters, connectors, elbows etc.  This wou ld also include a set of hydraulic tools, that would include hose and tube cutters and prepares, tube benders and flaring tools along with hydraulic system diagnostic testers all capable of working on multiple types of systems and equipment.  Consequently the Army is interested in systems that have more advanced technologies to test and repair newly made hydraulic hoses and lines from multiple manufacturers on many different systems as well as clean and recharge fluids.  Additional Information: Currently th e US Army is starting their review on several other associated Sets, Kits and Outfits (SKOs) that will become part of the Allied Trades Initiative.  The HYSTRU may also evolve as a module associated with this program. Our intent in issuing this synopsis is  to use the commercial market place as a springboard to assist us in developing our requirements based on the best commercial equipment and practices available for the soldiers use in the field. The Allied Trades system will either be enclosed in a shelter  or trailer/truck mounted.  The HYSTRU will be used both in CONUS and OCONUS and subjected to various battlefield environments throughout the world.  It will also be subject to all types of environmental conditions and terrain to include extremes of hot, c old, sand and dust.  This hydraulic unit may be moved forward in a battlefield condition or used in a Field Level Maintenance (formerly known as Direct Support Maintenance) and Sustainment Level Maintenance (formerly known as General Support and Depot Supp ort Maintenance) level of work.  The HYSTRU can be operated from fixed facilities as well as mobile maintenance facilities.  This equipment may be located at rear echelon areas or base operations locations that may or may-not be environmentally controlled.   If you have any commercial literature, brochures, trade journals, catalogs and pricing information please provide that information for our review and use to support our marketing research efforts and development of a future purchase description.   Please provide your information to the POCs listed below by COB 19 Sept 2004.   If you have any other comments and or questions on this synopsis, please contact Larry Kemper (309) 782-3110, mailto:kemperl@ria.army.mil. or Barry Hartleben (309) 782-1913, mail to: hartlebenb@ria.army.mil.

<DESC>The purpose of this Sources Sought/Market Survey is to identify production sources for the family of Hand Held Signals, M125A1 NSN 1370 01-341-6282; M158 NSN 1370 01-343-1966; M159 NSN 1370 01-345-4300; M126A1 NSN 1370 01-343-1965; M127A1 NSN 1370 01 -341-5159; M195 NSN 1370 01-342-6872.  The technical data packages are Distribution D. The family of hand held signals (HHS) is used for both daytime and nighttime signaling. They are used by all military services. The star clusters consist of five (5) star illuminant assemblies and a rocket motor propulsion assembly contained in a hand held  aluminum launching tube. The parachute signals consist of a parachute suspended illuminant assembly and a rocket motor propulsion assembly contained in a hand held aluminum launching tube. Both cluster and parachute type signals reach an average altitude of 725 feet. Physical dimensions for both are Length 10.16 in.; Diameter 1.67 in.; Weight approx. 1.2 lbs. In the parachute signals the suspension chords are packed on top of the illuminant, and the tube end is sealed with a cork disk (rocket barrel seal). In the cluster signals a center hole is preformed into all illuminant cluster to transfer the initiation c harge, and the tube end is sealed with a cork disk (rocket barrel seal). Both cluster and parachute type signals share the following same components and arrangement. The base of the launching tube contains a primer and an initiating charge. As shipped, the firing pin cap is assembled to the forward end and must be reversed for firing. Stabilizing fins on the tail assembly of rockets are folded parallel to the axis of the signal. A bolt, which also transfers the initiating charge flash to the propellant, extends into the center of the solid propellant which fills the propulsion a ssembly. The illuminant assembly is mounted on top of the propulsion assembly with a delay assembly and an expelling charge between. A label specifying firing procedures is secured to the body of the signal. The propelling charge for both cluster and parachute type signals is a black powder composition mixture with about 9% calcium carbonate premixed from the manufacturer. Black powder is used for the initiating and expelling charge for both cluster and parach ute signals. The primer is percussion no. 68 and is used in both cluster and parachute signals. Request interested parties provide list of currently or previously produced items that are representative of the hand held signals family. Include information on pyrotechnic formulations/handling, pressing, and assembly. All pertinent information provided will be evaluated. Request interested parties provide an approximation of production capacity for the hand held signals family, one shift production for one month rate and maximum capacity achievable during contract performance. Include approximate timeframe to reach maximum  production capacity, and any significant assumptions made.

<DESC>The purpose of this Sources Sought/Market Survey is to identify production sources for the Personnel Distress Kit, Red, A/P25S-5A NSN 1370 00-490-7362.  The technical data package is distribution D. The Personnel Distress Kit, Red, A/P25S-5A is used by downed airmen or others exposed to emergency escape and evasion situations. The kit includes a hand fired  launcher  and a bandoleer assembly. The bandoleer assembly contains a plastic molded bandoleer holding seven red signals. The signals consist of small solid propellant rocket motors actuated by a percussion primer, a delay element, and a pyrotechnic candle in a metal case. The surface of the metal case is dyed red to match the color of the candle. The  launcher is black anodized aluminum, it has a retaining device and a firing mechanism. The  retaining device precludes the signal from falling out of the launcher when the loaded  launcher is aimed vertically at the ground. The firing mechanism consis ts of a free traveling firing pin with an actuation knob and spring. The  launcher is connected to the bandoleer by a lanyard. Physical dimensions for the launcher are Length 5.5 in.; Diameter 0.8 in. Signals are loaded individually into the launcher with nozzle down into the launcher until the signal bottoms out. The firing pin inside the launcher upon firing, strikes the primer in the signal which ignites the propellant. Exhaust gases are expelled thr ough nozzle holes in the signal and propel the flare out of the launcher in a spin stabilized flight. The signal should be able to completely penetrate moderately dense jungle or forest foliage. After traveling approximately 600 feet, the payload ignites c ausing separation from the rocket motor. Burning time is approximately  9 seconds and provides an average candle power value of 2,500 lumens for the first 7 seconds. Physical dimensions for the signal are Length 2 in.; Diameter 0.5 in. Request interested parties provide list of currently or previously produced items that are representative of the Personnel Distress Kit, Red, A/P25S-5A. Include information on pyrotechnic formulations/handling, pressing, and assembly. All pertinent informa tion provided will be evaluated. Request interested parties provide an approximation of minimum kit quantities required for order to sustain production capacity for the Personnel Distress Kit, Red, A/P25S-5A.  Include the approximate shift times to meet this minimum value, and any significant assumptions made. Request interested parties provide an approximation of minimum kit quantities required to be ordered by the government to consider bidding for the Personnel Distress Kit, Red, A/P25S-5A. Include required minimum reorder quantity in option years of a contra ct to sustain contractor participation.

<SUBJECT>J -- Provide Tower Space and Maintenance Services for the NOAA Weather Radio System in the State of Alabama
<DESC>In the absence of other qualified sources, it is the intent of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration/ National Weather Service (NOAA/NWS) to negotiate with the Alabama Educational Television Commission, located at 2112 11th Avenue South, Suite 400, Birmingham, AL  35205-2284, for tower space and preventative and remedial maintenance of NOAA Weather Radio (NWR) transmitters, antennae and transmission lines located at seven (7) AETC owned and operated tower sites located in Alabama in 
Anniston, Demopolis, Montgomery, Florence, Huntsville, Louisville, and Dozier.  In addition, AETC, will provide the same maintenance services in Birmingham and Tuscaloosa at non-AETC tower sites.  Tower space at these two sites are contracted by NWS separately.  Each of these sites have limited access.  The separate contracts permit AETC access for maintenance services only.   BACKGROUND: In a January 1975 White House Policy Statement, NOAA’s NWR was designated the sole government operated radio alert system to provide direct warnings into private homes for both natural disasters and nuclear attack. The mandate requires uninterrupted transmission capability 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. Since 1978, the State of Alabama has had access to NWR service through successive contracts between the NOAA/NWS and AETC. SCOPE: This procurement is for a follow-on contract for tower space and maintenance services.  PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: The contract to be negotiated is for a three month base period of performance, followed by four 1-year option periods, followed by one 9-month option period for a total of 5 years. SOLE SOURCE: NOAA/NWS has determined that AETC is the only contractor that can provide 1) tower space on strategically located towers and allow for placement of antennas at the needed heights to provide the required NWR broadcast service coverage. 2) AETC is the only contractor that can provide the 24 hours per day, 365 days per year maintenance services since no other contractor can have access to the towers and equipment for maintenance after hours due to Homeland Security issues. Since outages and emergencies can occur at any time day or night, access to the sites for maintenance must be available 24 hours a day. This is not a formal solicitation.  This notice may represent the only notice. The acquisition is a commercial item acquisition. See note 22 except 45 days is changed to 15 days for commercial items/services.

HSAR 3009.104-75 Prohibition On Contracts With Corporate Expatriates (Dec 2003)
(a) Prohibitions. 
Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause.  The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
“Expanded Affiliated Group” means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for `at least 80 percent' each place it appears. 
“Foreign Incorporated Entity” means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
“Inverted Domestic Corporation.” A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)— 
(1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held— 
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or 
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
“Person”, “domestic”, and “foreign” have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs 
(1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
(i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or 
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 
(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 
(e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
(i) warrants; 
(ii) options; 
(iii) contracts to acquire stock; 
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and 
(v) others similar interests. 
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. 
(f) Disclosure. 
By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296 of November 25, 2002. 
(g) If a waiver has been granted, a copy of the approved waiver shall be attached to the bid or proposal.

<DESC>The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) has a small business set-aside requirement for local courier services within the Washington Metropolitan area in support of the OPM Center for Investigations Service, located in the Theodore Roosevelt Federal Building (TRB), Washington, DC.  The North American Industry Classification System Code for this acquisition is 492110.  The small business size standard is 1,500 employees.  This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial services prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6 and 13.106, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Solicitation OPM-RFP-04-00033TLA is issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP).  This solicitation and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-14.  

 The Government intends to award a firm-fixed price contract with a base period of one year and two one-year options for a total period not to exceed three (3) years.  The Contractor shall provide the labor, and equipment necessary to perform the services set forth in the Work Statement.  These services will include pickup and delivery of freight (3 cubic feet, locked footlocker type trunks weighting approximately 40-80 pounds) from OPM headquarters, 1900 E. Street NW, Washington, DC to the following Federal Investigative Services locations: 1.  OPM-Center for Investigations Service, 7630 Little River Turnpike, Suite 400, Annandale, VA 22003; 2.  OPM-Center for Investigations Service, 6525 Belcrest Road, Suite 600, Hyattsville, MD 20782; 3.  OPM-Center for Investigations Service, 4205 Suitland Road, Suitland MD 20746; 4.  OPM-Center for Investigations Service, 2231 Crystal Dr., Suite 410, Arlington, VA  22202.  

Timeliness of the deliveries and the secure transport and handling of freight is a major priority.    The contractor will provide secure, accountable courier service between the hours of 8:00 AM and 2:30 PM, Monday –Friday, excluding the 10 Federal holidays.  Freight will be picked up from OPM headquarters between 8:00 AM and 9:00 AM and delivered to the established exchange locations.  At each established location an exchange will take place dropping off and picking up freight to be returned to OPM headquarters.  Deliveries and pickups at the established locations will occur between the hours of 9:00 AM and 2:30 PM.  Freight from the established exchange locations will be returned to OPM headquarters by 2:30 PM each day.  

There are occasions that will require pickup to be delayed.  The vendor and OPM contact officials will arrange scheduling of any delayed pickups.  Furthermore, there may be occasions that require delivery on a holiday, weekend, or times other than normal hours of operation, when no employee(s) are available to receive the delivery.  On those occasions the delivery will be made on the next business day, or by mutual arrangement between the landlord, receiving facility and contractor.  Additionally, where the vehicle will be left unattended for an hour or longer the contractor must provide an OPM approved “permanent” secure holding area to maintain the material until the delivery is accomplished.  The minimally acceptable “permanent” secure holding area must be fully enclosed and deter theft and/or vandalism to the freight.  Whenever the freight is to be left unattended for a period of less than one hour, it must be in an OPM approved “in transit” secure holding area.  The minimally acceptable “in transit” secure holding area may be the transport vehicle so long as it is completely secured before leaving the vehicle unattended.  OPM will provide a security appraisal for both the “permanent” and “in transit” secured holding areas. 

The contractor must ensure their transport vehicles (TVs) are secure in a manner that will protect sensitive, but unclassified materials from theft or destruction.  The TVs must be closed, above average in reliability, safety, and energy efficiency for TVs in their class.
TVs must have their cargo compartment separated from the cab preferably with steel mesh or grating.  Cargo doors must be secured with a high-security locking device.
Additionally TVs must be minimally equipped with the following: (a) Two-way mobile radio or cellular telephone communications; (b) Lockable passenger compartment cab; (c) AM/FM radio.  
OPM will provide security appraisals to ensure TVs are acceptable.
Only OPM may grant one-time authority to use a temporary “closed-type” replacement vehicle to prevent mission degradation.
The usual freight from the Center for Investigations Service offices would be no more than (15), footlocker type trunks, locked, weighing approximately 40 pounds each, but could be as much as 80 pounds, and are roughly (3) cubic feet each.  The contents of the locker type trucks would consist of paper, magnetic tape, equipment, etc.  Some freight from the Center for Investigations Service may also be in sealed boxes.  The workload/volume is subject to change with little notice.  The Center for Investigations Service will attempt to provide a two-day notice to the contractor. 
The contractor will provide drivers who will be responsible for loading and unloading at origin and destination and must be insured and bonded.  Furthermore, the contractor should have an OPM approved plan to secure the Governments’ information in case of unforeseen circumstances (i.e. – breakdowns or accidents) while en route between the OPM facilities.  The contractor should ensure the plan is disseminated to and utilized by its drivers.
All drivers, personnel, and passengers in the TV having access to or handling freight must pass the appropriate level background investigation approved by OPM.  The cost associated with all contractors background investigation(s) shall be incurred by the contractor.

As authorized by 5 CFR 731 and 736, the Contractor will provide qualified personnel with appropriate suitability investigations to meet the requirements of a sensitivity designation level of Critical Sensitive.  The investigative requirement is, at a minimum, the following:

Background Investigation (BI) - if no prior BI has been conducted on the contract employee or any prior BIs were completed more than three years ago; or

Periodic Reinvestigation (PRI) - if the Federal government has conducted a BI level of investigation on the contract employee within the last five years; or

Upgrade to BI (BGI) – if the Federal government has conducted a Limited Background Investigation (LBI) within the last two years.

OPM will require all contractor personnel to be investigated.  Background investigations will be adjudicated by OPM's Security Officer prior to personnel beginning work under the awarded contract.  This requirement may be temporarily excepted as shown below.  

Within 30-days of contract award, Contractor shall make arrangements through the COR for EXPEDITED (35-day) OPM investigations on all proposed personnel to determine their suitability for employment.  This shall include providing the COR with the following completed documentation for each person to be investigated: (1)Standard Form 86, Questionnaire for National Security Positions; (2) Original Fingerprint Card (FD-258); (3) Declaration for Federal Employment (OF-306).

Upon receipt of the required forms, the OPM Security Officer will obtain any existing reports of previous investigations and will determine if the personnel suitability requirements can be met by such investigations or if additional investigation is required.

Contractor is cautioned that current or previous investigation by the OPM or another investigative organization, e.g. the Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office (DISCO), will not automatically result in a favorable adjudication by the OPM Security Officer without the need for further investigation.

The Government reserves the right to make temporary exceptions to allow Contractor personnel to begin work or to allow limited access to a system after having examined partial investigatory data with some items incomplete.   If, at any time during the investigation, information that could result in an unfavorable evaluation is reported to the Security Officer, the temporary exception may be withdrawn pending resolution of the issue.

(a) The Contractor will pay for each required individual investigation.  The cost for the BI is $1,961.55; the cost for a PRI is $335.13; and the cost for a BGI is $916.30.

(b) Some typical disqualifying issues that can result in an unfavorable adjudication are: Current drug or alcohol abuse; Pattern of financial irresponsibility; Improper or illegal sale of firearms; Patterns of violence; Patterns of dishonesty.

(c) The Contractor may, from time-to-time, seek advance guidance from the Government in cases where potential-disqualifying issues may be present.

Purpose of Contacts:

Contacts are to exchange and gather information, keep up with work in progress, negotiate, persuade, and otherwise obtain cooperation of the persons being contacted.

The following Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and Homeland Security Acquisition Regulation (HSAR) provisions and clauses apply:

52.212-1	Instruction to Offerors- Commercial Items (Jan 2004)
52.212-2	Evaluation- Commercial Items (Jan 1999), award will be made utilizing the following factors, in descending order of importance, The Coast Guard intends to award one contract to the Contractor whose proposal is identified as offering the best value solution.

§	The selection team may determine the best value for the Coast Guard merits a higher price based on technical superiority.  The selection, using sound business judgment, will base the selection decision on an integrated assessment of the proposal’s relative capability as measured against the below evaluation factors:

o	Factor 1 – Schedule
o	Factor 2 – Technical/Management Solution/Approach
o	Factor 3 – Past Performance
o	Factor 4 – Cost/Price

Factor 1 is the most important.  However, while the price is an important part of the integrated selection decision, the non-price factors are significantly more important than the price factor.  However, as the technical and schedule elements of  the quotes become substantially equal, price may be the determining factor in selecting a proposal for award.

Enclosure (1) Detailed Factors

DETAILED FACTORS

FACTOR 1:   SCHEDULE 

A schedule which meets USCG requirements and demonstrates an understanding of the time required to perform and document the work. Any  proposed schedule will be evaluated for reasonableness and ability to meet the stated required schedule.

FACTOR 2:	TECHNICAL/MANAGEMENT SOLUTION/APPROACH

	Technical factors which include a proposed contract breakdown structure that identifies the services to be delivered to meet the mission requirements set forth in the performance work statement, a sound partnering approach to management that demonstrates the ability to aggressively identify and apply information technology solutions to business processes.  The Contractor’s validated process and procedures that ensure high quality performance which indicate a highly probability of a quality outcome for the aircraft refurbishment without harming the environment or compromising flight safety. Evidence of High Quality and experience personnel with a proven track recod of success in providing the same or similar services. Evidence of ability to maintain a quality system acceptable to the Coast Guard.  Impact of environmental characteristics of all products proposed and any enhancement or mitigation provided by filters, gas burning, or other technology. Provide statement describing environmental licensing and permitting for proposed paint and stripping process and materials. Evidence of proper facility FAA certification and evidence of required environmental licensing and permitting to accomplish the proposed work are required. Vendors detailed work statement and process descriptions.  

FACTOR 3:     PAST PERFORMANCE

Past Performance will consider documentation for having performed installation, repair, and paint of similar or like items.  Past performance will consider the information from  existing and former customers during the past 2 years.  References will be asked about quality and schedule performance of the Vendor.  Any conversations with present or former customers will be documented.  The past performance factor will be based on adherence to ability to perform a successful installation, a successful repair, a quality paint job, delivery schedule, and willingness and ability of contractor to resolve problems.  

FACTOR 4:	PRICE RELATED FACTORS

Comparison of quotes against the Government estimate and review each quote for level of work offered based on number of labor hours, hourly rates, and material costs to evaluate price reasonableness.  Cost fully burdened to deliver and return the aircraft based on a location, which includes man-hours, gas, usage of airplane, and a wear and tear calculation will be added to the quote to assess overall cost to the Government.
 
Realism: A realism assessment will be accomplished by technical review and evaluation of the skill mix, specific hours, and material kinds and quantity for each identified CLIN/Sub-CLIN in the Vendor's Quote.  The intent of the evaluation is to determine whether the estimated proposed price/cost elements are realistic for the work to be performed; reflect a clear understanding of the requirements; and are consistent with the approach described in the Offeror's technical proposal.

The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 

(b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 

"Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent’ for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears. 

"Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 

"Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- 

(1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 

(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held- 

(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or 

(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 

(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 

“Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 

(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 

(i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or 

(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 

(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 

(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 

(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
(i) warrants; 
(ii) options; 
(iii) contracts to acquire stock; 
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and 
(v) others similar interests. 
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:
