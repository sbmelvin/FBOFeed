<DESC>The Judicial Administrative and Management Reform Project (JAMR) is designed as a four-year, $3-4 million activity.  It is an intervention to support and move the judiciary to become an independent yet equal branch of government through a comprehensive program for improved court administration and case management throughout all the courts of Georgia including the 46 magistrate courts.  Based on the Georgian judicial leadership’s commitment to and provision of resources for judicial reform, the overwhelming need for improved court administration and case management will be addressed by a comprehensive program to: 

-improve the quality and timeliness of judicial decision making since court administrative and management issues will be delegated to court administrative staff;

-improve court practices by providing the technical assistance necessary for the court administrative staff to process cases in a timely and efficient manner;

-train the judiciary to formulate and manage the courts’ budget;

-improve public access, services, uses and understanding of the courts and their facilities.  

In addition, the existing information technology system now being used in the courts will be examined for adequacy according to international standards and improved as necessary to meet the needs of the Georgian reality, building on the work of earlier projects, especially the World Bank judicial reform project.

The principal Government of Georgia (GoG) counterpart will be the Supreme Court of Georgia, the High Council of Justice (HCoJ) and all courts:  the 20 enlarged first instance courts; 2 appeals court; and, the 46 magistrate courts.

The Pre-proposal Phase involves the submission of a short white paper describing the proposed project and partnering arrangements. FHWA will provide feedback on the white paper, making recommendations for changes to the project to better meet the requirements of the BAA solicitation. The Proposal Phase is the request for complete BAA proposal submissions. BACKGROUND. The Transportation Analysis and Simulation System (TRANSIMS) is an agent-based travel simulation system designed to meet the State Department of Transportations? (DOTs') and Metropolitan Planning Organizations? (MPOs') need for more accurate and more sensitive travel forecasts for transportation planning and emissions analysis. It consists of mutually supporting simulations, models, and databases. By employing advanced computational and analytical techniques, it creates an integrated environment for regional transportation system analysis. Because TRANSIMS simulates and tracks travel by individuals, the benefits to and impacts on different geographies and travel markets can be evaluated as well. Furthermore, TRANSIMS has the capability to evaluate highly congested scenarios and operational changes on highways and transit systems. TRANSIMS differs from previous travel demand forecasting methods in its underlying concepts and structure. These differences include a consistent and continuous representation of time; a detailed representation of persons and households; time-dependent routing; and a person-based microsimulator. There are four primary modules: Population synthesizer, Activity generator, Route planner, and Traffic microsimulator. Using these components, a model may be constructed that estimates activities for individuals and households, plans trips satisfying those activities, assigns trips to routes, and creates a microsimulation of all persons, vehicles and resulting traffic on modeled transport systems in given study area. Researchers at the Los Alamos National Laboratory (http://www.lanl.gov) designed and developed the original TRANSIMS algorithms and software. The design for TRANSIMS is based on requirements in the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (ISTEA) (Public Law (PL) 102-240), the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21) (PL 105-178) as amended by the TEA 21 Restoration Act (PL 105-206), and the Clean Air Act of 1990 (PL 101-549) Amendments. The development of TRANSIMS has been funded by the Federal Highway Administration with support from the Federal Transit Administration, the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Transportation Policy of the United States Department of Transportation, and by the Environmental Protection Agency.

CURRENT STATUS. TRANSIMS development has proceeded along several lines. These include development of application methods, software and supporting utilities. Methods Development. Currently USDOT is sponsoring the development of a tour-based model, using TRANSIMS, in Portland, Oregon. The effort has been divided into two tracks: Track 1 uses existing trip tables, combined with the TRANSIMS Router and Microsimulator, to develop regional simulations of travel. The Track 1 effort has demonstrated that using network and trip table data currently available at most MPOs, regional simulations can be conducted. As part of the Track 1 effort utilities have been developed to convert existing networks and trip tables to TRANSIMS format. Track 2, currently underway, will develop tour based forecasting procedure based on the Portland transportation network and demand data available to the Portland MPO. Track 2 is expected to be completed by June of 2007. Software. The software and source code is now available under an the NASA Open Source Agreement v1.3. This license makes the source code publicly available and requires that any changes to the original code also be made publicly available. For further information on the license see http://www.opensource.org/licenses/nasa1.3.php.     
In addition to the core software, supporting utilities have been developed based on the work in Portland, these utilities include methods to convert node and link data into TRANSIMS format, to estimate intersection signalization and to assist with data preparation and application. The TRANSIMS software is written in standard C++. 32-bit and 64-bit binaries are available for Linux and Windows (pre-Vista). Support is available via documentation and forums on http://transims-opensource.net/index.php. The source code is available from http://sourceforge.net/projects/transims/.

OBJECTIVES. FHWA seeks to expand the knowledge, understanding and implementation of TRANSIMS capabilities and applications, and seeks to develop new approaches/tools/applications covering a diversity of methods, users and geographic area. Prospective offerors will submit proposals which: 1. Increase deployment of TRANSIMS, and/or 2. Broaden the TRANSIMS user base, and/or 3. Develop new applications of TRANSIMS. 

INSTRUCTIONS FOR PREPARATION OF PROPOSALS. The scope of this announcement is intentionally broad to invite innovation and to provide the FHWA the flexibility to sponsor research which best addresses its objectives. In keeping with FHWA's desire for innovation and flexibility, the specific approach in the selected proposals will vary and will be negotiated. Any resulting contracts will contain appropriate federal agency clauses for the type of procurement vehicle awarded. Prior to award, the Offeror shall be required to submit 'Certifications and Representations.' Data and reporting requirements will be negotiated with the firm(s) selected for award(s). As stated previously, the objectives of this solicitation are to expand the knowledge, understanding and implementation of TRANSIMS capabilities and applications, develop new approaches/tools/applications covering a diversity of methods, users and geographic area which will increase TRANSIMS deployment, broaden the user base and to develop new applications. Multiple awards are anticipated and offers will be selected so as to meet these objectives individually as well as collectively. That is, individual offers may be stronger in specific objectives and taken as a whole the selected offers will support all objectives. The proposal submission shall be conducted in two phases; 1) an optional Pre-proposal Phase for FHWA review and comment, and 2) The Proposal Phase which is the request for complete BAA proposal submissions. 

Pre-proposal Phase
To improve the quality of proposals, offerors may submit a short Pre-proposal describing their proposed work and partnering arrangements. The Pre-proposals shall address the problem statement, workplan, data sources, rough order of magnitude (ROM) budget, staffing and planned agency support (Formal agency support is not required at this time although we suggest that the Pre-proposals be coordinated with the agency). Offerors should refer to the BAA Evaluation Criteria to ensure that their Pre-proposal addresses the FHWA's requirements. The pre-proposals shall include: BAA Number, project title, name of organization, principal investigator and contact information on the first page. After receiving the Pre-proposals, FHWA will provide comments to offerors on strengths and weaknesses of the proposed projects and make recommendations for changes in the final submission. FHWA shall make all material submitted as part of a pre-proposal and feedback on specific proposals confidential. The material shall not distributed to other offerors. Pre-proposals are limited to four single sided typewritten pages, double spaced, 12 point font, with one inch margins on all sides and shall be in Microsoft Word 2003 or equivalent, or Adobe portable document format (pdf). Offerors may submit a proposal without having submitted a Pre-proposal. Pre-proposals must be submitted via electronic mail, and must be received by FHWA on or before 4:00 PM (local time) on May 17, 2007. Facsimile transmissions or hard copy transmissions of the Pre-proposal will not be accepted. Pre-proposals shall be sent to rick.murray@fhwa.dot.gov and to melissa.rosendorf@fhwa.dot.gov. Comments will be provided to offerors by June 1, 2007.     

PROPOSAL PHASE. Refer to the attached solicitation package for detailed instructions. 

CONTRACT PERIOD. The contract period is negotiable but shall be no more than 18 months from date of award.

CLARIFICATIONS AND ADDITIONAL INFORMATION. Experience in running TRANSIMS is desirable but not essential. Funding must be sufficient to cover the scope of the proposed project. Additional resources from other than Federal sources are encouraged. Applications will be evaluated on the ability to accomplish the offeror's proposed scope and resources. Since the overall goal is the dissemination of TRANSIMS and building a TRANSIMS user community, consortiums of applicants are encouraged. Consortiums may include, but are not limited to, combinations of consulting firms, universities and MPOs or State DOTs. All proposals must have the endorsement of a planning agency and a process for the planning agency to review results. Consortiums may be led by a university, a consulting firm or a planning agency.
The Department of Transportation is developing a TRANSIMS installation package which will include TRANSIMS software, test set ups to support the installation of the software and test data sets. Offerors are expected to provide problem data and computer capability. Each proposal shall include an initial task to install TRANSIMS and successfully verify installation using the test procedures and data prior to commencement of the rest of the project. In the event the installation package is not complete at the time of the award, commencement of the project will be delayed until the package is available. Peer reviews will play a key role in deployment. These peer reviews will be funded and implemented separately from the deployment funding, however Offerors should budget and schedule resources for preparation and presentation as well as commenting on the peer review report. An initial peer review will be conducted upon completion of the base year model to examine approach, calibration, and validation results. If the work plan includes additional scenarios or future forecasts, the initial peer review will also include the plans for implementing and applying the additional model capability. A final peer review will be conducted upon completion of the analysis. Each peer review is expected to last no more than two days and be comprised of no more than five peers. Awards are anticipated to be made prior to September 30, 2007.

EVALUATION OF PROPOSALS AND AWARD EVALUATION CRITERIA. Proposals received will be evaluated in accordance with the evaluation criteria specified herein through a peer review process. The primary basis for selecting proposals for acceptance shall be technical, importance to agency programs, and funding availability. Cost realism and reasonableness shall also be considered to the extent appropriate. Technical factors are more important than cost factors, and technical evaluation will be based on the following criteria listed in descending order of importance: 1. Ability to complete the proposed work within available resources, 2. Level of commitment by the planning agency to the proposed project. One of the primary objectives of this deployment is the use of TRANSIMS by planning agencies. Use does not necessarily mean installing and running TRANSIMS but does imply integrating the results of TRANSIMS into the agency decision-making process. It is not expected for agencies to immediately commit to the use of TRANSIMS, but priority will be given to agencies, which express an interest in the use of the results, 3. Broadening of the TRANSIMS user community - While agencies use the results of model, universities and consulting firms play a critical role in the dissemination of new technologies. Universities play a role through research and training of students on transportation planning methods. Consultants have developed most of the models in use in the United States. Proposals, which involve Universities, consultants or others, who play a major role in technology deployment are encouraged; 4. The ability of the proposed analyses to take advantage of TRANSIMS capabilities. TRANSIMS is a new technology with new capabilities. Offerors should carefully review the capabilities of TRANSIMS and identify how those capabilities address the proposed application.

Offerors should address in full each of the above criteria in Part I, Technical Proposal. The comprehensiveness and quality of the proposed research study, especially the completeness of the proposed work plan, will contribute significantly in the selection process, and innovative solutions, approaches and techniques which address the stated objectives will be considered. The offeror's ability to identify technical needs and to design a study to meet these needs within budget are essential skills in the accomplishment of the announcement objectives. The FHWA reserves the right to select for award any, all, part or none of the proposals submitted.

AWARD CRITERIA. The Government anticipates that approximately $600,000 will be dedicated to this program, subject to availability of funds, and anticipates making multiple awards. It is anticipated that no single proposal will be funded for more than $300,000 in federal funds. This Broad Agency Announcement does not commit the Government to pay for response preparation costs.

ELIGIBILITY. All responsible sources may submit a proposal that shall be considered by the FHWA. Consortium arrangements and industrial partnering agreements are encouraged.

JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION
INTERSPIRO SELF-CONTAINED BREATHING APPARATUS (SCBA) MASKS

I.	CONTRACTING ORGANIZATION:  The contracting organization responsible for this action is the 4th Contracting Squadron, 1695 Wright Brothers Avenue, Seymour Johnson AFB, NC, 27531.

II.	DESCRIPTION OF ACTION:  The contractual action is a Brand-Name Firm-Fixed Price Contract for the purchase of Interspiro Self-Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA) Masks.

III.	DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES/SERVICES:  The required purchase of forty (40) Interspiro SCBA Masks, Part Number 3368900432.  

IV.	AUTHORITY:  The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition for this acquisition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (1) and the Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 6.302-1(c).

V.	APPLICABILITY OF AUTHORITY:  The Interspiro SCBA Masks are available from Interspiro and their only authorized distributor, the TMC Company.

4.	PURPOSE OF SYNOPSIS:  The purpose of this synopsis is to inform the vendor community of DISA?s proposed contract actions.

Enclosed is the approved justification and approval for use of other than full and open competition pursuant to the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304 C (1).

5.   SYNOPSIS CLOSING DATE/TIME:  07 May 2007
 
6.	BACKGROUND: The DISANet represents the baseline data and telecommunications infrastructure installed and operational at the Headquarters, DISA, and its national capital region (NCR) and field offices.  The purpose of this information system is to support the Director and his supporting directorates in their efforts to provide timely and effective information and communications services to the war fighter.  The services provided by DISANet include electronic mail, office productivity applications, and Internet and intranet access, Voice over IP, information services, collaborative services, and formal message service.  DISANet also provides network access to mission oriented databases and applications maintained on non-DISANet networks.  Support will become effective ONLY upon issuance of a written task/delivery order.  The task/delivery order will describe in detail the current configuration of the information system to be supported and the specific services to be provided by the Contractor.  Several other networks are expected to be merged into the DISANet.  When these networks become the responsibility of the DISA Information Systems Center, the Contractor may be required to provide support for these networks, as tasked by written task/delivery orders.

6.1. The DISANet consists of over 35 locations worldwide.  Within the National Capitol Region (NCR) the use of Metropolitan Area Network (MAN) services provide connectivity between the smaller NCR locations and the two primary DISANet locations and datacenters.  The two primary DISANet locations as well as all DISANet field offices are connected via Wide Area Network (WAN) services being provided by the DISN (Global Information Grid (GIG), NIPRNet and SIPRNet).  These DISANet MAN and WAN connections are established on our DISANet Perimeter (Cisco) Routers.
6.2  Every network exists to serve its users.  Currently, there are 8902 unclassified users on the DISANet, with this number expected to ultimately grow to 10,000.  The classified DISANet has 3574 users at 12 locations world-wide, with this number expected to grow proportionally.
7.	DESCRIPTION OF WORK: The purpose of this contract is to provide support for that portion of the DISA Information System (DISA-IS) Infrastructure over which the DISA Information Systems Center (DISC) has operational responsibility, hereafter referred to as DISANet.  The DISA-IS consists of all computer systems, both networked and stand-alone, which support the information needs of DISA.  In addition, the Contractor may be required to provide similar support to other Information Systems (IS) and/or networks (OSD, Joint Staff, etc.) that are assigned to the DISA Information Systems Center for support and maintenance.
7.1 The Contractor shall provide necessary personnel, supervision, and management to perform integration, implementation, network monitoring and control, call center, administration, operation configuration management and security management for the DISANet and other information systems as tasked by specific task orders.  Services the Contractor will perform may include analysis, integration, implementation, operation and administration of information system components; software support of network devices, servers and client workstations; asset management; requirements management and solution; performance evaluation; product assessment and recommendations; documentation; Help Desk call center, help desk support; installation support and testing; training; configuration management; resource management; and implementation and maintenance of applicable security programs and procedures.

(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:

Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for at least 80 percent each place it appears.

Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.

(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;

(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held?

(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or

(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and

(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.

Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.  (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.

(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:

(i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or

(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).

(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.

(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights.

(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:

(i) warrants;

(ii) options;

(iii) contracts to acquire stock;

(iv) convertible debt instruments; and

(v) others similar interests.

<DESC>The Minerals Management Service's Gulf of Mexico Region, and specifically, the Office of Resource Evaluation (RE), has a requirement for a complete solution to convert the thousands of paper documents, contained within the 1300 plus Field Studies, into digital files, spatially enable identified maps and documents, and create a meta-data repository for these unstructured documents. RE estimated that the geoscientists spend up to 30% of their time gathering data before they can begin their work process.  Having Field Studies easily accessible and in digital format would accelerate business process cycle-time, increase productivity by making it easier to find and use information, allow geoscientist to focus work on value added areas, provide real time information to support quick and reliable decision making, and effectively re-use interpreted data, thus saving critical resources.  The primary objective is to provide MMS's geoscientists with a complete set of easily accessible digital field study files.  The secondary objective is to provide a working set of digital Field Study files that can be easily backed up and restored in support of the MMS, Continuity of Operations Plan (COOP).  Field Study files are unique and the loss of these records would be detrimental to the mission of Resource Evaluation and MMS. All equipment and services must be provided by the contractor.  In addition, the following requirements/tasks must be met: Project Management Oversight; Knowledgeable Staff; Provide a complete inventory of field studies; Provide a document imaging plan; create a meta-data repository (Oracle based database); Provide a data entry form for meta-data capture; geo-reference identified maps; provide documentation.   This acquisition is set-aside 100% for small businesses.  The North American Industry Classification System code for this acquisition is 518210, "Data Processing, Hosting and Related Services".  The size standard for this NAICS code is $23.0 Million.  All interested parties must qualify, as a small business, under this code.

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division (NAWCAD), Patuxent River, MD, announces its intent to contract for Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RT&E) engineering and technical support services for low temperature curing paint systems for use on military aircraft. The scope of this effort is to develop an epoxy or urethane based paint system, consisting of both primer and top coat, that is sprayable and curable at conditions below 55 degrees F and 45& RH, (or more preferably between 40 and 50 degrees F and at relative humidity of 30-40%, while maintaining the performance properties of currently qualified mil-spec primers and topcoats. The developmental efforts are divided into two phases that could be conducted consecutively or in parallel. Phase 1 will be focused on the development of a low temperature-curing topcoat, whereas Phase II emphasis will be on the development of a primer that is sprayable and curable at the specified conditions. Performance characteristics of the system and its individual components will be evaluated in accordance with MIL-PRF-85582 and MIL-PRF-23377 for primers, and MIL-PRF-85285 (Type I or Type III) for top coats. Materials will be evaluated in the laboratory. After satisfactory performance in the lab, aircraft and/or components will be painted and subjected to field testing. A successful field demonstration by NAVAIR will consist of at least two years of operational exposure, and in the case of carrier-deployed assets, two carrier deployments of 6 months or longer. Field test results will be considered satisfactory if no additional or excessive maintenance of corrosion control efforts are associated with the new systems when compared to control aircraft. Regular maintenance and touch-up re-pairs are acceptable.
 This proposed effort will be a Full and Open Competitive.  This notice provides pre-solicitation information to parties who feel they are capable of providing the above mentioned services.  It is the Government’s intent to award a FFP single contract to the offeror who provides the best overall value to the Government.  The anticipated period of performance is 2 years.  It is anticipated that a request for proposals will be available through the NAVAIR solicitation homepage, http://www.navair.navy.mil/doing_business/open_solicitations/ approximately 2 May 2007.   Phone and fax requests for a copy of the solicitation will not be accepted.  This announcement is NOT a Request for Proposal (RFP) and does not commit the Government to award a contract under the above listed terms.

The contractor will be responsible for establishing the initial databases, and then maintaining and upgrading the databases on a regular basis to ensure up to date information.

In addition to the databases to be established by the contractor, the contractor will also be required to provide access to "Persons-of-Interest" database sources that are the domain of various federal, state and international law enforcement agencies. The contractor shall provide the users, U.S. Mint Police Officers, all necessary training to successfully operate all systems and their associated equipment. Appropriate equipment and installation warranties are expected. The Government anticipates the award of a commercial Firm Fixed Price type contract.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) intends to procure biostatistical support services for the NICHD Intramural Data Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC). The Institute intends to procure these services by other than full and open competition from Frontier Science & Technology, Research Technology, 900 Commonwealth Ave, 2nd Fl, Boston, MA 02215.  These services include the preparation, analysis and interpretation of clinical research data from NICHD intramural study protocols that will be used by the DSMC in regular reviews of these studies for Fiscal Year 2007. The specific tasks involve intellectual understanding of biostatistics and clinical research data analysis.  The unusual complexity of this contract arises from the fact that multiple studies are reviewed at each meeting and that the studies under review can change from meeting to meeting.  Frontier Science has provided statistical support to the Office of the Clinical Director, NICHD in previous years and is knowledgeable in the requirements for the DSMC.  It would be extremely time consuming and costly to train someone else to perform the same services.  This is not set aside for small business. 

PLEASE NOTE:  In order to receive an award, contractor must be registered and have valid certification in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) (http://www.ccr.gov).

Offerors may request a copy of the Request for Quotation (RFQ) in writing or by FAX to the Contracting Office prior to the closing date of this notice.  It is anticipated that the RFQ NIH-NICHD-07-233 will be available fifteen (15) days after the publication of this synopsis.  Receipts of quotations will be due ten (10) days after the release of the RFQ.   If you have any questions regarding this announcement, please contact Tina Robinson via email.

Request for copies of the RFQ must be submitted to the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive Kidney Diseases, 6707 Democracy Boulevard, Two Democracy Plaza, Room  774C, Bethesda, MD 20817 or via email: Robinsti@mail.nih.gov to the Attention:  Tina Robinson.  FAX quotations must contain offerors name, address, telephone number and fax number.  FAX quotations will be accepted if dated and signed by an authorized company representative.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b) (1), with Rigaku Americas Corporation, of The Woodlands, Texas, for the acquisition of an X-Ray Generator to be used by the Biochemical Science Division at NIST in Gaithersburg, Maryland.

*****Sole source determination is based on the requirement for the x-ray generator to be capable of producing an intense x-ray beam focused into a spot no larger than a 70 micron X 70 micron round spot at 6 degrees take off angle.  If the beam is larger than the crystal, the background noise is increased and the signal to noise ratio is decreased. Since the protein crystals are composed of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen atoms, a diffraction pattern for a protein crystal is optimized by x-rays generated at a certain wavelength achievable only by a beam of electrons hitting a copper anode. The filaments which generate the electrons are required to be precrystallized and prealigned in cassettes to eliminate the requirement for aging the filament before use and to allow for easy and reproducible installation of the filaments by the user. In order to spin the anode at a constant high rate to maintain the constant intensity of the x-ray beam, the copper anode of the generator must be directly rotated by gears and not through use of a belt-drive mechanism.  This ensures precise balance of the anode and a highly stable beam over the duration of the measurements (hours to days per crystal), which is critical for measurement accuracy. To increase the usage of the x-ray generator, the generator is required to produce two x-ray beams, approximately in opposite directions, and have two output ports equipped with independent electromagnetic shutters so that two detectors can be mounted and two different experiments can be conducted at the same time.  To enable the two-detector functionality, the table top supplied with the generator should be large enough to also accommodate two x-ray detectors.  Rigaku Americas Corporation is the only known vendor capable of supplying the required x-ray generator.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b) (1), with Measured Solutions, Incorporated, of Greenville, South Carolina, for the acquisition of FAVIMAT Testing Instrument to be used by the Polymers Division at NIST in Gaithersburg, Maryland.

*****Sole source determination is based on the need for the instrument to be identical to the ballistic fiber industries? existing technology.  The FAVIMAT, an automated single fiber testing machine (SFTM), is the standard equipment used by ballistic fiber manufacturers for the measurement of single fiber properties.   This equipment is being purchased to develop testing methodologies that will be used by NIST/The Office of Law Enforcement Standards (OLES) and the manufacturers to monitor the performance of soft body armor.  The instrument will be used to automatically measure the strength, strain-to-failure, and modulus of single fiber ballistic fibers.  These properties have been theoretically linked by researchers to their ballistic performance.  Therefore, determining these properties on small amounts of material may provide a minimally invasive testing methodology for monitoring the in-use performance of soft body armor.

The essential automation requirement will be the sequential loading of 100+ individual fibers into the SFTM from a suitable multi-fiber transfer device.  After the fibers are placed in the transfer device, the automated instrument, without human intervention, shall perform a tensile test on each fiber, analyze the data in terms of modulus, strain-to-failure, ultimate tensile strength.  The instrument will then, again without human intervention, merge the data from the individual tests and provide a report that includes the average values of the above properties with statistical distributions.  

Measured Solutions, Incorporated, is the only known vendor capable of supplying the required testing instrument.

***Delivery shall be FOB DESTINATION and be completed in accordance with the Contractor?s commercial schedule. ***

*** As defined in the Federal Acquisition Regulation, (FAR), FOB Destination means: The contractor shall pack and mark the shipment in conformance with carrier requirements, deliver the shipment in good order and condition to the point of delivery specified in the purchase order, be responsible for any loss of and/or damage to the goods occurring before receipt and acceptance of the shipment by the consignee at the delivery point specified in the purchase order; and pay all charges to the specified point of delivery.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

An oral presentation may be required.  If scheduled, the oral presentation will be approximately sixty minutes, including a twenty-minute overview of your quotation by the responsible manager with the contractor team in attendance, a twenty to thirty minute question and answer session, and a ten- minute introduction by the Government.

(g)	Be otherwise qualified and eligible to receive an award under applicable laws and regulations.
	
	Evaluation

?	Small Business Status ? Those firms that state they are small shall receive a Good rating; those that state they are not small shall receive an Adequate rating.
?	Approach ? The likelihood of effectively meeting requirements
?	Past Performance ? The relevance and quality of prior performance
?	Price ? The amount, realism, balance, and consistency of the evaluated price.

The evaluation will be based on use of an adjectival scheme as follows:

?	Excellent (E) ? Very good of its kind; eminently good, superior or first class
?	Good (G) ? Beneficial and worthwhile; sound and valid

The B-2  Training System also includes a Training System Support Center (TSSC)  which provides on-site sustaining engineering support activities for the  training system.  There is also a Training System Center (TSC), located at  the contractor’s facility, to handle any software updates to the  maintenance training system. There are 58 devices as follows: Device	                    Number    Location	        Location Weapon System Trainer	    3	      Whiteman AFBMission  Trainer	            2	      Whiteman AFB (1)  Contractor’s Facility (1) Cockpit Procedures Trainer  8	      Whiteman AFB (4)	Contractor’s Facility  (4) Computerized Maintenance Training System                            6	      Whiteman AFB (5)	Contractor’s Facility (1) Weapon System Training Aid 36	      Whiteman AFB (30)	Contractor’s  Facility (6) Crew Escape System Maintenance Trainer                            1	      Whiteman AFB Flight Control System Trainer                            1	      Whiteman AFB Weapons Loader Trainer	    1	      Whiteman AFBTotal  Devices	           58Services Anticipated The anticipated need for the B-2 TS will include: field services for  training systems, academic instruction, training system contractor  logistics support, and concurrency management and software and systems  engineering.  The effort will include work associated with Distributed  Mission Operations (DMO), the Radar Modernization Program (RMP), and the  Extremely High Frequency (EHF) SatCom Program, as well as future efforts  needed to maintain training system concurrency with the jet. DMO For DMO, the B-2 Weapon System Trainers and Mission Trainers will connect  into the DMO Network (DMON) via a portal provided by Northrop Grumman  Mission Systems (NGMS), the DMO Operations and Integration contractor, and  will have to meet the Combat Air Forces (CAF) DMO Interoperability  Standards.  The contractor will be responsible for ensuring that the WST  design achieves and maintains compliance with DMO System Standards as they  evolve. RMP The B-2 RMP modifies the radar system to operate in a different, approved  radar frequency band.  The B-2 RMP does not provide new capability;  however, it is forcing changes to the aircrew and maintenance training  systems. EHF Satellite Communications (SATCOM) The B-2 EHF SATCOM and Computer Upgrade Program provides a secure, command  and control EHF communications system that ensures the interconnectivity  with a survivable communications link in either a nuclear or conventional  combat-stressed environment at all times throughout the mission. The  Training System will have to evolve in step with the changes being made to  the jet. Security Contractors will be required to have a secure facility.  Personnel working  on the B-2 Training System are required to have security clearances. Contract Items Effort for the B-2 Training System is desired to begin 1 January 2009  (immediately after the current contract expires on 31 December 2008). The Government anticipates a 10-year service delivery period. The B-2 Training System will remain at Whiteman Air Force Base, MO, where  it will be operated and maintained under Contractor Support.  The customer  at Whiteman is Air Combat Command (ACC) and Air Education and Training  Command (AETC). CONTRACTOR CAPABILITY SURVEY B-2 Training System Part I.

<DESC>This requirement is being procured in accordance with FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisitions Procedures. The office of Pacific marine environmental laboratory, located in Seattle, WA intends to acquire the following items:  Six (6) each Paroscientific Inc. brand Model Met 1-2 Intelligent Barometer, P/N 1488-002, pressure range 800-1100 HPA in environmental enclosure with gill pressure port and RS-232 interface via VSG-4-BCL connector.   The Paroscientific Met 1-2 Intelligent Barometer measures atmospheric pressure on remotely moored ATLAS buoys.  These buoys are part of a large international effort to monitor ocean conditions along the equatorial Pacific and have been an ongoing effort since 1982.  Paroscientific is the only brand that possesses the accuracy and resolution proven on large scale deep ocean tests.  These sensors can be used in the equatorial region where the atmospheric pressure signal is small, thus requiring a higher accuracy and greater resolution than in other regions in the world such as the Gulf of Alaska.  Existing equipment is designed to interface with the Paroscientific?s output and is compatible with the PMEL logging instrumentation.  Changing to any other vendor would require redesign of input circuitry, changing instrumentation software, and scheduling testing, which would result in additional time and expense to the Government.  Delivery required no later than August 6, 2007.  The intended acquisition is for supplies for which the Government intends to acquire from one source under the authority of 41 USC 234 (c) (1), Only One Responsible Source.   This is not a request for proposals and there is no solicitation available at this time. The government reserves the right to solicit offers based on receipt of affirmative responses to this notice, or issue a contract to Paroscientific Inc. Only firms that can provide the exact items described herein will be considered. All interested parties must respond to this announcement within fifteen (15) calendar days of its publication. All responses must be in writing and may be faxed to (206) 526-6025 attention to Mona Ash.   ****The Western Regional Acquisition Division, requires that all contractors doing business with this Acquisition Office be registered with the Central Contractor Registry (CCR). NO award can be made unless the vender is registered in CCR.  For additional information and to register in CCR please access the following web site: http://www.ccr.gov.  In order to register with the CCR and to be eligible to receive an award from this acquisition office, all offerors must have a Dun & Bradstreet Number. A Dun & Bradstreet number may be acquired free of charge by contacting Dun & Bradstreet on-line at www.dnb.com/eupdate or by phone at (800) 333-0505.

<DESC>*** FOR CLARIFICATION ONLY **** NOTICE OF INDUSTRY DAY ANNOUNCEMENT FOR JTC TRS TUESDAY, 22 MAY 2007 AT 0900-1130. Interested parties should review the attached Industry Day Announcement  for further details. ************************************************************************************ The Joint Terminal Controller Training and Rehearsal System (JTC TRS)  project under the Tactical Airborne Control System funds developments  necessary to provide Distributed Mission Operations (DMO) capable  high-fidelity Joint Terminal Attack Controller (JTAC), and Combat Control  Team (CCT) training and rehearsal system. The JTC TRS will be able to  connect to DMO networks to allow geographically separated high-fidelity  close air support platforms and JTACs/CCT teams to train together. The JTC  TRS will enable operators to conduct Joint Close Air Support (JCAS)  training/mission rehearsal using tailored, dynamic scenarios that are  relevant to mission tasking. Furthermore, the system will be capable of  providing air traffic control training for CCT using tactical application  of austere airbase operations. Using a system of systems approach JTC TRS  shall have the capability to network in Increment 1 to aircrew full  mission trainers and mission training centers, and by Increment 2, to Air  Support Operations Centers (ASOCs) for Joint Tactical Air Strike Requests  and air-ground coordination of Joint fires. JTC TRS will also allow  JTACS/CCT teams to use their actual equipment in the trainer. Its primary  focus is to provide a persistent total air-ground virtual training  environment for networked air ground training and mission rehearsal  capability that will develop both JTAC/CCT skills and train those air  crews assigned to accomplish complex JCAS missions in close proximity to  ground forces. JTC TRS will be fully interoperable with joint/sister  Service air ground simulation using industry standards. SEE BELOW FOR  ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.

<RESPDATE>050907
<ARCHDATE>05012008
<CONTACT>Carmen Bernhardt Purchasing Agent 7022938309     CBernhardt@lc.usbr.gov;
<DESC>The Bureau of Reclamation, Boulder City Regional Office, Boulder City, Nevada, intends to award on a sole source basis a purchase order to Orion Monitoring Systems, Inc., for unique portable and semi-permanent high precision Global Positioning System (GPS) for Operational Safety Survey and Monitoring equipment and training.  This monitoring survey system based on Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers, data receiver/transmitter units (RTU), connecting to both GPS receivers and a central processing node, and unique, proprietary local data collection, evaluation, and recording software.  This system will support fulfilling statutory and regulatory requirements for condition monitoring of dams under the Safety of Dams Program that the Lower Colorado Region has not fully complied with in recent years due to existing aging and unreliable equipment. This procurement will be awarded using Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  The anticipated award date is May 11, 2007.  Questions may be directed to Carmen Bernhardt at (702) 293-8309 or email to: cbernhardt@lc.usbr.gov.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 334220, and the size standard is 750 employees. Sole Source Justification:   THE PROPOSED CONTRACTOR POSSESSES THE FOLLOWING UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS WHICHA RE REQUIRED FOR THIS ACQUISITION. Orion has a monitoring survey system appropriate to the above-described purpose.  The principal of this firm is an acknowledged expert in the field, with similar (in some cases more complex) systems installed at a variety of facilities worldwide including open-pit mines, hydroelectric and recreational dams, and other facilities.  While components of the Orion system are available from other vendors, Orion provides a unique and purpose-specific integration and data post-processing, storage, and presentation that is not available at this time through other potential sources of GPS-based survey and position-locating systems.  Additional recent market research determined that other potential sources limit integration of data collection to collection, storage, and downloading with no post-processing, trend analysis, or other additional capabilities that are essential data elements for annual and periodic Dam Safety and Operations and Maintenance reporting.  Several vendors can rapidly develop such a capability, but it is a custom development.  The Regional Safety Officer has determined that the foregoing market research indicates that the Orion system is the only readily-available system that provides the required capabilities to restore Regional compliance with the requirements (regulatory and statutory) of the Dam Safety Program within the near term since time is of the essence.

<DESC>DOI Bureau of Reclamation, Region 8, Denver, Colorado intends to award a non-competitive, sole source contract with HKM Engineering, Inc. for the continued implementation of asset management plan prioritization.  HKM Engineering Inc. has developed the process in order to provide a consistent evaluation of the current status of BIA's irrigation projects, and a condition assessment tool within the database to automate costs to irrigation systems that have already been developed.  HKM has developed both a standardized approach and unique database of their findings.  No other contractor, to the best of our knowledge, can provide this database.  This procurement is authorized in accordance with 41 USC 253(c)(1).  The proposed solicitation is for services for which the government intends to solicit and negotiate with one responsible source under authority of FAR 6.302-1.  Previous acquisition has been conducted for the same services.  Interested parties may identify their capability to respond to the requirement via email to bhayden@do.usbr.gov.  Telephone requests will not be honored.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL.  A determination by the government to compete this proposed action based on the responses to this notice will be based solely within the discretion of the government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  See Note #22.

<DESC>This notice is issued by the NASA/JSC to post a Request for Information (RFI) via the internet and to solicit information from Industry regarding the Constellation Program’s Rescue and Recovery Methodologies.   This document is for information and planning purposes and to allow industry the opportunity to verify reasonableness and feasibility of the Government needs, as well as broaden industry participation in meeting Government requirements. The Constellation Program is being designed by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) to replace the Space Shuttle in providing the capability for manned space exploration.  The initial missions will support the International Space Station (ISS), to be followed by missions to the moon as early as 2018.  The intent of this request is to solicit input from the commercial community regarding means and methodologies through which the Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV) Crew Module (CM) and potentially the Flight Crew may be safely recovered following a landing in the water.  These data obtained through this RFI will then be evaluated in trade studies to derive the most efficient support plan. The CEV CM will have the same conical shape of the Apollo capsule, but scaled up in size to accommodate a crew of six.  In landing configuration, the vehicle will weigh approximately 20,000 pounds, and have a height of approximately 11 feet and a diameter of 16.5 feet.  The CEV will not contain any toxic commodities, but will contain high pressure systems including gaseous oxygen and methane.	There may also be some pyrotechnic devices that will be ‘safed’ at landing.   The CEV is designed to be able to land nominally at a designated landing site in the Western United States, but the possibility of a contingency following launch or upon reentry requires the spacecraft be able to land on water and provide the crew a 36-hour safe haven until rescue forces arrive.	Currently, a wide range of rescue and recovery methodologies are being considered to safeguard for contingencies which would result in the need to recover the CEV in the Atlantic Ocean in the event a malfunction necessitates a launch abort.  Such an abort would likely place the CEV in the Atlantic Ocean offshore of the Eastern Seaboard of North America from Florida up to Newfoundland for missions intending to reach the International Space Station (ISS), or out to the more moderate but potentially more distant waters east of Florida to the west coast of Africa for lunar mission trajectories.  There is a remote possibility that a failed ascent along the trajectory to the ISS could place the CEV in the cold and high sea-state waters of the North Atlantic. Industry response to this inquiry shall support a comparative analysis of baseline and valid alternate recovery methodologies for launch abort scenarios.  The specific objective of this RFI is to request information on available assets, technologies, and/or services which could effectively and affordably conduct the in-water recovery operations following an ascent abort.  Responses are requested to any or all of the following topics: 1.	Methodology.  How would the recovery operation be performed and with what assets?  Please include the resident location of existing assets, potential response zone(s), and recovery times within that zone. 2.	Performance of Recovery Assets.  Please comment on relevant performance aspects (e.g. cruising speed, hoisting capability, etc.) as a function of various sea state and wave form for any vessel involved.  Please also include the resident location of existing assets, potential response zone(s), and recovery times within that zone. 3.	Risk associated with recovery operations.  Please comment on methods through which risk associated with recovery operations may be mitigated both to the flight crew and to any potential ground operators (e.g. divers, helicopter crew if applicable).    Also, how does this risk change with sea state?   4.	Incapacitated Crewmembers.  What would be the recommended method to rescue injured crewmembers?  Would a different recovery methodology be required if any or all of the crew is incapacitated? 5.	Night Recoveries.  What would be the recommended method as well as the risks involved in conducting recovery operations at night or in poor visibility?  6.	Inshore versus Offshore Recovery.  Most launch vehicle faults would cause the launch escape system to place the CEV within 500km from the Eastern Seaboard.  A slight possibility still exists that the CEV could be placed in high sea-state waters between Newfoundland and Ireland.  Would a different recovery methodology be required if a recovery needed to be performed in the North Atlantic? 7.	Costs.	Please estimate any acquisition, maintenance, and/or operations costs.	 8.	Affordability and Acquisition Strategies.  NASA seeks the most affordable way to acquire recovery capabilities for an average of two launches per year.	Affordability includes the cost to acquire the capabilities sought.  As these proposed operations are contingency safeguards for two launch operations per year, would there be more affordable acquisition strategies, such as asset sharing with industry or other governmental organizations, .  9.	Maturity of Technologies or Concepts.  What operational experience exists with the proposed assets?  Have similar services been provided to prior customers?  If no direct analogies exist, what testing would need to be done to mature a prototype for this specific application?  What would be the cost, risk, and time to mature such technology? Additionally, responses must include the following: name and address of firm; size of business.  Industry is invited to submit written comments or questions to Lisa Spence no later than May 25, 2007.  Responses shall not exceed 30 pages and shall reference NNJ07ZTA005L.  Comments may be forwarded to Ms. Spence via electronic transmission at elizabeth.a.spence@nasa.gov or by facsimile transmission to (281) 483-6092. All information received in response to this RFI that is marked Proprietary will be handled and protected accordingly.	NASA will likely provide proprietary information to its support service contractors who are under an obligation to keep third-party Proprietary information in confidence.  By submitting a response to this RFI, the responder is deemed to have consented to release of Proprietary information to such NASA support service contractors.	Responses to the RFI will not be returned.  No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If a solicitation is released it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps and on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service. It is Industry's responsibility to monitor these sites for the release of any solicitation or synopsis. This is a request for information only and does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that the NASA Johnson Space Center (JSC) will take procurement action in this matter.  Further, neither NASA JSC nor the government will be responsible for any cost incurred in furnishing this information.  Respondents will not be notified of the results.  This presolicitation synopsis is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government pay for the information submitted in response.	Respondents will not be notified of the results. An ombudsman has been appointed -- See NASA Specific Note "B". The solicitation and any documents related to this procurement will be available over the Internet.  These documents will reside on a World Wide Web (WWW) server, which may be accessed using a WWW browser application.  The Internet site, or URL, for the NASA/JSC Business Opportunities home page is http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/eps/bizops.cgi?gr=D&pin=73	 It is the offeror's responsibility to monitor the Internet cite for the release of the solicitation and amendments (if any).

A.	 General Information

The Tri-Service Mid-Atlantic Region, a military integrated delivery network, comprised of Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps and Coast Guard medical commands and medical treatment facilities (MTFs) in the states of Virginia and North Carolina announces a Request for Regional Incentive Agreement Quotation (REFRIAQ) for the standardization of  Examination Table Paper.  The major facilities in the area includes: 1st Medical Group, Langley AFB, VA; 43rd Medical Group, Pope AFB, NC; 4th Medical Group, Seymour Johnson AFB, NC; Womack Army Medical Center, FT Bragg, NC; McDonald Army Community Hospital, FT Eustis, VA; Kenner Army Health Clinic, FT Lee, VA; Naval Medical Center Portsmouth, Portsmouth, VA; Naval Hospital Camp Lejeune, Camp Lejeune, NC; Naval Hospital Cherry Point, Cherry Point MCAS, NC.      

The primary objective of this standardization initiative is to achieve a best value determination for Examination Table Paper that represents the clinically preferred product or source at the best possible price.  It is also intended that standardized product be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program. 
 
     This procurement is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia, Directorate of Medical Materiel.  In order to participate your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendors for the program.  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their items. This is a supplement to the Prime Vendor Program and it is not a contract.  For additional information regarding DSCP?s Prime vendor program please access our web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil

The TRBO will provide anticipated volume (quantity) based on historical usage/forecasted requirements. The agreement will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of award with three (3) 12-month option periods. Anticipated award date is June 2007. The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors. The award will be determined utilizing Best value/ trade off criteria.    
   
Point of Contact Robert Meinertzhagen, 757-953-2134, Bob.Meinertzhagen@med.navy.mil

B.	Products & Performance Required

The Mid-Atlantic Region is seeking product line items in the category of Examination Table Paper.  

The approximate annual purchase volume of $34,000 is based upon the historical usage of standardized Examination Table Paper over a one year period.  The overall evaluation will be based upon clinical, technical and pricing factors.  The final award recommendation will be determined by utilizing the Best Value and trade off criteria.  The Prime Vendor for the Mid-Atlantic Region is Owens & Minor.  

At the request of the Mid-Atlantic Region Military Treatment Facilities, vendors will provide on-site support and in-servicing, educational resources and tools for clinical use of the product, conversion information, prime vendor order numbers, MSDS information, and itemization of the brands, types and packaging information of the products offered by the vendor.

Emails and correspondence may be sent to Bob.Meinertzhagen@med.navy.mil .

D.	 Evaluation Criteria

The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing board of the standardization process. This board includes clinicians and logisticians from all of the Military Treatment Facilities within the Mid-Atlantic Region. They are the decision makers for this initiative.
Vendors will be required to provide responses to the technical/company criteria. The TPRB will review the responses and determine acceptability. After review of the technical/company criteria, the Region will eliminate those vendors who fail to meet the criteria.  Those companies who do meet the technical/company criteria will be invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation.  
For those companies that meet the criteria above and below under Technical/Company Criteria, the TPRB will request samples from the product group to be clinically evaluated at select Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs). Vendors are required to ship samples direct to the MTFs.  Vendor samples must be received no later than 4:00 P.M., two (2) weeks after the request for samples is issued to the vendors. Vendors failing to ship by the deadline will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process.

1.	The MTFs will evaluate the products provided with the clinical/performance criteria identified in this announcement using a zero to seven rating scale. Zero is equal to not acceptable and seven is equal to highly acceptable. All criteria are weighted equally. The TPRB has set a 3.75 acceptability threshold for all products.  Summary ratings for each vendor will be an average of their numerical scorings combined with an adjectival scale of highly acceptable, acceptable, minimally acceptable, and not acceptable.  All clinical criteria are weighted equally. The scale descriptors are: 0 = not acceptable and 7 = highly acceptable.  Clinical/performance results lower than 3.75 will not be considered acceptable and will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process. 
      
2.	 After the clinical/performance evaluation are completed and analyzed, all vendors in the clinical evaluation group who met the 3.75 threshold will be asked to submit their best pricing offer representing a discount from their DAPA pricing based on a minimum committed volume of 80% of the total requirements for MTFs in the Mid-Atlantic Region.  Vendors that fail to offer pricing that is discounted from their DAPA pricing will be eliminated from further consideration.  Vendor Product and Price Proposals will be in the Excel template provided by the government.  The vendors will provide their completed Excel template by email to Bob.Meinertzhagen@med.navy.mil.

Pricing responses must be received by 4:00 P.M. two (2) weeks from the date the request is initiated by the TRBO.  Failure to respond within this timeframe will result in your company being excluded from further participation/consideration.

Clinical/performance factors will be weighted more heavily than price. Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two-year period with possible one-year option periods (not to exceed 5 years). 

Technical/Company Criteria:


The TPRB will review the following technical criteria responses from each vendor and determine acceptability. Acceptability for the purpose of evaluation of the technical criteria means the responses to all questions in this section demonstrate that: 1) the vendor, who will be named the quoter, offering the quote is a distributor or manufacturer of a complete line of the subject medical/surgical consumables; 2) based on the quoter?s responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the product line or products and/or services offered meet the medical standards of care of the community in which such products and/or services are applicable; 3) the quoter has or is obtaining a DAPA for the product line, products and/or services; 4) the quoter has or is obtaining an agreement covering the product line, products and/or services with Owens and Minor, the Prime Vendor for the region. 

1.	Does your company manufacture a full line of Examination Table Paper products to include multiple widths and lengths to accommodate patient contact areas on different sized exam tables?
2.	Do you offer Examination Table Paper products in varying non-abrasive textures/finishes (e.g. smooth, crepe-paper like, water-resistant)

The Department continues to be committed to fully engaging small businesses, including small disadvantaged, 8(a), women-owned businesses, HUB Zone, and Service-Disabled Veteran-owned small business concerns, in DOE's core missions.  DOE purchases over $23 billion worth of goods and services annually including facility management, remediation, construction, research and development, management and scientific consulting, plate work manufacturing, administrative services, data processing, security, engineering, and waste treatment and disposal.  Features of this yearâ€™s conference include: -- PLENARY SESSIONS featuring prominent government, corporate and business leaders who will discuss ways small businesses can have better access to DOE procurement opportunities; -- BUSINESS EXPO providing an opportunity for businesses to showcase their products and services to hundreds of corporate and government attendees, including DOEâ€™s Prime Contractors; -- MATCHMAKING FORUM providing a unique opportunity to schedule one-on-one meetings with procurement representatives from DOEâ€™s Prime Contractors and share in over $1 billion of possible subcontracting opportunities within FY 2007; DOE has received positive reviews on the previous conferences. This year's conference will continue to provide the essential information and guidance needed to do business with the Department.  It is through outreach activities such as this that the Department finds small businesses with the capabilities to match its contracting opportunities.

	DEMONSTRATION THAT THE CONTRACTOR?S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS OR NATURE OF THE ACQUISITION REQUIRES THE USE OF THE AUTHORITY CITED ABOVE (APPLICABILITY OF AUTHORITY). 

DRS Universal Power Systems is the only company that produces the 1500TR-III-359. The 1500TR-III-359 On-line UPS has characteristics that MUST be met in order to fully safeguard and maintain operations of the Joint Communication Support Element?s (JCSE) classified mobile communication systems at our deployed locations:

The DRS Universal Power Systems model 1500TR-III-359 is a modified UPS system. The -359 option adds a STAND ALONE FACEPLATE, which allows the UPS to be used in a stand alone (out of rack) application. DRS Universal Power Systems model 1500TR-III-359 is the only system on the market that meets all electrical specifications and can handle 200 percent output rating for 8 seconds with a rear connection for additional battery packs. 
The electrical specifications are: 
1. 1500VA/1050W Global UPS
2. Automatic Input Voltage sensing any source of input voltage between 92 to 254 Volts AC ? 
 world wide input voltage selection
3. Built-in input isolation transformer
4. User-selectable output voltage 100/110/115/120/127 VAC
5. Auto input frequency selection 40-70 Hz
6. User selectable output frequency 50-60 Hz
7. 120 VAC output voltage plus or minus 3 percent
8. No more than 5 percent THD full non-linear load
9. Auxiliary output receptacle NEMA 5-15R
10. Removable battery storage
11. Automatic bypass capability for servicing batteries
12. Rear connection for additional battery packs
13. Front Panel Indicator for batter conditions/status
14. 7 min. battery reserve
15. NEMA 5-15P input power cable
16. Four NEMA 5-15R output receptacles
17. Handles 200 percent of output rating for 8 seconds
18. Meets MIL-STD-167-1

The classified mobile communication system does not allow for an alternate back up power source. If any other electrical configurations are used with the mobile communication system, it would create fluctuation/variation in power voltage. A fluctuation/variation in power voltage would, within seconds, damage over $9,000,000.00 worth of deployed mobile communication equipment and leave war fighters in the JCSE Theater of Operations without communications, which would be catastrophic.

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation number is 
263-2007-P(GQ)-0145 and is issued as request for proposal (RFP).  The solicitation/contract will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-16.  This RFP is set-aside for Small Business Concerns.    This acquisition is to be a Firm Fixed Price contract. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 337211 and the business size is 500.  

The National Institutes of Health (NIH), Office of the Director (OD) believes that Washington Group Sales, 450 West Broad Street, Falls Church, Virginia is the only source that can appropriately meet the requirements.    Any other firm that believes that it can appropriately meet the below specifications may submit an offer to the NIH.  

The NIH/OD requirement is for Conference Room?s, Privacy Panel, and Reception Desk material systems with continuation of associated services, as follows.

Geometry Rationalization shall be as follows:
Pony wall geometries will be rationalized for fabrication purposes. (2) Molds will be used in fabrication of all pony wall panels. Molds will be created with information from this 3D model. Elliptical conference room panels will be rationalized so that (2) molds will be used for fabrication.

Lighting considerations shall be as follows:
	3form manufacturer will coordinate with the lighting designer.
Finishing considerations shall be as follows:
	Conference room panel finishes will be Markerboard.  Other panel finishes to be 	determined. 

Brand Name Justification:  This requirement to Washington Group Sales for the purchase of 3-form product material and directly associated services appears to meet the criteria for a Brand Name (other than full and open competition) acquisition for the following reasons.  

As a cost-saving measure, the architect factored this project into the design of the space.  This project has been essentially completed in the design phase.  This specific product was designed in by the architect, a potential change to another product may not allow for the successful completion.  We expect that once the building permit issue is resolved, it will take approximately three (3) weeks to complete the construction.  The building permit issue should be resolved in approximately 1-2 weeks.  The area specified for the 3-form design need to be completed in order to pass final inspection and be ready for staff move-in within two weeks after completion.  Delay in moving into the space as scheduled will have a major impact on other NIH components scheduled to backfill the space we vacate.

The contractor shall deliver the products and services after receipt of award, the Government will evaluate based on F.O.B. destination, and acceptance at Bethesda, Maryland.     Information provided must demonstrate the ability to meet the specifications described herein.  Sources demonstrating the capability to accomplish the above shall provide pertinent information that is in sufficient detail to demonstrate their ability to perform within 5 days of this notice.

 conditions are favorable until all the tasks associated with a mowing cycle are completed. 
F. If, at any time, the COTR determines that the work is unsatisfactory or being conducted in an unsafe
 manner, the contractor will be notified and shall immediately cease all work activities until corrections
 satisfactory to the COTR have been accomplished.  
G.All work shall be completed, inspected, and accepted by the COTR in accordance with the procedures stated
 herein before beginning work on another section and/or cycle.  An inspection shall be scheduled between the

cost to the Government.
ADJUSTMENT FOR INADEQUATE PERFORMANCE:
A.Well maintained turf areas are Mt. Weather?s goals and while the deduction provision for work omitted or
 improperly performed is designed to protect  FEMA?s interests, it is not a desirable substitute for
 accomplishing the job through the normal process.  It is designed only to assure that FEMA pays only for
 services provided and is fairly compensated for damage(s) resulting from such operations.
B. Failure to perform the required services as indicated in the specifications herein shall constitute a deficiency.

Foreman. Deficiencies in daily tasks shall be completed within the day the deficiency is noted.  All other 
deficiencies shall be corrected within 24 hours or the period indicated by the COTR. If such deficiencies are of 
a nature, which precludes satisfactory re-accomplishment within the specified time frame, no further 
opportunity will be provided to the contractor to cure the deficiencies and the provisions for monetary 
adjustments will apply.  
C. In the event the contractor, for any reason whatsoever, fails to successfully perform a task, the Federal 
Emergency Management Agency has the right to:
		1.	Obtain performance of the deficient task from some other source or the in-house work forces.  The costs of such performance, and any other additional costs incurred to Agency as a result of such actions shall be charged to the contractor: or

		2.	At the discretion of the Contracting Officer, to terminate the contract upon ten (10) days notice in writing to the contractor.
D. It is mutually agreed that failure to satisfactorily accomplish work in accordance with the specifications and 
provisions stated herein when due to the fault of the contractor, shall constitute a deficiency under this contract.  
If deficiencies are not corrected in a satisfactory and timely manner, a monetary reduction will be made as
 follows:
		1.	Ten (10) percent of the mowing bid item price for each failure to perform each of the following:
			A.	Not having the necessary equipment or labor to complete the mowing operations within the specified time frame.
                         B.	Using mowers, trimmers or other equipment that has not been approved by the COTR.

                	2.	Failure to initiate mowing operations within two (2) working days from notification will result in  a reduction of 10% of the bid item price for mowing for each day beyond two days.
3.	Damage to existing trees from the careless operation of mowers or trimmers, or 
 irreversible damage to trees will be subject to Far Clause 52.237-2 ?Protection of Government Buildings, Equipment, and Vegetation (Apr 1984)?.

If the Contractor fails or refuses to make such repair or replacement, the Contractor shall be liable for the cost, which may be deducted from the contract price. 
4.	Failure to repair damaged grounds and or tree mulch rings within five (5) working
                 days will result in a reduction of 10% of the bid item price for mowing for each

EXECUTION
Note:  A complete mowing cycle must be completed within five (5) working days (weather permitting)
 including trimming and cleanup.
Mowing
	A.Prior to commencing the first mowing cycle, the COTR will indicate the mow lines through visual 
                    inspection and tour of area to be mowed. 
	B. The contractor is responsible for conducting a visual verification prior to start of mowing
                   operations to ensure that the areas are free from trash and debris that would interfere with mowing 
                   operations.  Note:  The Agency will assume responsibility for picking up trash and debris before 
                   mowing operations begin; however, any additional trash or debris that would interfere with the 
                   mowing operations shall be removed by the contractor.  The contractor is responsible for notifying 
                   the COTR if trash is not being properly removed or if pick up exceeds the provisions stated herein.
C.	To ensure a high quality cut, all mower blades shall be sharpened before each mowing and shall be
        adjusted to a height of 3 inches.  Mowing heights may be adjusted at the discretion of the COTR as 
        necessary to adapt to seasonal conditions.
D.	The turf shall be cut to a uniform height; skips and patches of uncut grass or windrowing will not be permitted.  
            E.   All grass clippings shall be directed away from roadways and paved surfaces.

                 therewith. 
           B.	Line trimming shall include:

                1.Areas around trees, shrubs, signs, guardrails, retaining walls, utilities, the back side of the guard walls leaving a mow strip of 2 foot, and other obstructions or structures that can not be cut with conventional mowing equipment. The height for line trimming shall be the same height at which the grass is cut.
                2.The edge(s) of grass areas where such areas meet walks, curbs, or roadways and expansion Joints in curb and gutter and/or sidewalks.  The height  for line trimming

      COTR and Contractor disagree on work completed and accepted, his or her comments shall be noted 
      thereon or attached thereto. The Acceptance Report will serve to document completed work and/or 
      deficiencies and to determine whether the provisions for the deduction clause applies.
     C. Failure of the contractor to obtain signed Acceptance Report will release the Government from any 
     obligation to pay for services claimed but not documented by a signed Acceptance Report.
     D.	The amount to be paid will be based on the actual bid items completed and accepted.  Quantities so

Protests filed with the agency should clearly state that they are an "Agency Level Protest under Executive Order No. 12979." (Note: DLA procedures for Agency Level Protests filed under Executive Order No. 12979 allow for a higher level decision on the initial protest than would occur with a protest to the contracting officer; this process is not an appellate review of a contracting officer's decision on a protest previously filed with the contracting officer).

(b) Before either party determines ADR inappropriate, that party must discuss the use of ADR with the other party. The documentation rejecting ADR must be signed by an official authorized to bind the contractor (see FAR 52.233-1), or, for the Agency, by the contracting officer, and approved at a level above the contracting officer after consultation with the ADR Specialist and with legal counsel ( see DLA Directive 5145.1).
