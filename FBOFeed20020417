<DESC>DESCRIPTION:  The Government of the Philippines (GOP) has undertaken a massive counter-terrorism effort in Southern Mindanao.  In support of GOP's efforts, USAID/Philippines proposes to implement a 5-year program aimed at accelerating economic growth throughout Mindanao with a special focus on the conflict-affected areas, including the 5 provinces that comprise the Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao (ARMM).

The proposed 5-year program called Growth with Equity in Mindanao II (GEM II), is envisioned to be a follow-on to the current GEM I which has been operational since 1996 and shall end in September 2002.  GEM I has achieved many positive impacts.  GEM II shall build upon and evolve from them.

As in GEM I, the proposed program shall be an "umbrella" program under which a wide range of activities shall be carried out.  These activities may include, but shall not be limited to:

&#61656; a subprogram aimed at assisting thousands of former combatants of the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) to diversify their production activities.  Under GEM I, these former combatants received basic agricultural production assistance, 

&#61656; a subprogram to construct small community infrastructure facilities such as water systems, water systems, culverts, warehouses, etc. in several hundred villages in the conflict-affected areas; 

&#61656; a sub-program aimed at improving governance capability of the ARMM Government in a number of key areas;

&#61656;  a sub-program aimed at establishing or strengthening 10-15 key Business Support Organizations (producer associations, chambers of commerce, etc.) in the conflict-affected areas; and 

&#61656; a sub-program focused on education sector intervention such as reducing drop-outs from primary and secondary schools in the conflicted-affected areas.

The contractor will also be expected to be alert for "targets of opportunity" as they emerge during the course of the GEM-2 Program, and to focus program resources on those areas.

USAID anticipates awarding a cost-reimbursable contract for the 5-year program.

<DESC>The purpose of this box is filtration of milk house waste, or other polluted water at maximum flow rate of 30 gallons per minute.  Incoming water will be filtered using out lignocellulosic filters.  Filters are placed in stainless steel frames and the dimension of frame is 23 3/4 x 23 3/4 x 3/4.
The frames should be installed into the box eith minimum friction and water should not (or minimum) by-pass through the gap between the frames and the box.  The frames will be changed every three to four months and should be removed with minimum friction.  Our design shows half cirlce slots, but it is up to the manufacturer to make changes to fit the filters into the box with best of their imagination.  It is not shown but a cover to prevent vandalism and contamination is needed.  It is preeferred the cover be in two sections so that any small person can lift and take samples and finally the cover needs to be locked.
Sometimes the box will be buried completely under the ground or above the ground.  The thickness of fiberglass should be able to stand the pressure from the soil and water inside, and to keep the weight minimum.  Supporting ribs should be considered to be installed/attached to the outside of the box to sustain water and soil pressure.
Contact Dave Eustice with technical questions @ 608/231-9560
Drawings availabe by emailing slacina@fs.fed.us with a request.

<DESC>NASA/GRC plans to issue a Request for Quotation (RFQ) for annual renewal of maintenance on existing UGS CAD/CAM/CAE software licenses. This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). NASA/GRC intends to purchase the annual maintenance from UGS, the original supplier of the software.  UGS is the only entity with access to the source codes for this software, therefore, UGS is the only entity capable of providing maintenance for this software.  No other source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. This announcement is for information purposes only, however, interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to supply software maintenance (bug fixes, updates, help line support, etc.) for UGS CAD/CAM/CAE products.  All submittals shall be in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on 4/26/02.  To be considered, a submittal shall either specifically address how the submitting company plans to assure concurrent real-time updates to UGS-proprietary software, or, a submittal that recommends acquisition of alternative software shall address the associated additional consumption of the government's resources (dollars, workhours, user training, conversion of existing programs, etc) and how the submitter will offset those costs.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>DESCRIPTION:  The Government of the Philippines (GOP) has undertaken a massive counter-terrorism effort in Southern Mindanao.  In support of GOP?s efforts, USAID/Philippines proposes to implement a 5-year program aimed at accelerating economic growth throughout Mindanao with a special focus on the conflict-affected areas, including the 5 provinces that comprise the Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao (ARMM).

The proposed 5-year program called Growth with Equity in Mindanao II (GEM II), is envisioned to be a follow-on to the current GEM I which has been operational since 1996 and shall end in September 2002.  GEM I has achieved many positive impacts.  GEM II shall build upon and evolve from them.

As in GEM I, the proposed program shall be an ?umbrella? program under which a wide range of activities shall be carried out.  These activities may include, but shall not be limited to:

&#61656; a subprogram aimed at assisting thousands of former combatants of the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) to diversify their production activities.  Under GEM I, these former combatants received basic agricultural production assistance, 

&#61656; a subprogram to construct small community infrastructure facilities such as water systems, water systems, culverts, warehouses, etc. in several hundred villages in the conflict-affected areas; 

&#61656; a sub-program aimed at improving governance capability of the ARMM Government in a number of key areas;

&#61656;  a sub-program aimed at establishing or strengthening 10-15 key Business Support Organizations (producer associations, chambers of commerce, etc.) in the conflict-affected areas; and 

&#61656; a sub-program focused on education sector intervention such as reducing drop-outs from primary and secondary schools in the conflicted-affected areas.

The contractor will also be expected to be alert for "targets of opportunity" as they emerge during the course of the GEM-2 Program, and to focus program resources on those areas.

USAID anticipates awarding a cost-reimbursable contract for the 5-year program.

<DESC>The Office of Justice Programs (OJP) of the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) is issuing this Presoliciation notice concerning the forthcoming National Criminal Justice Reference Service (NCJRS) Contract recompetition requirement. The current NCJRS contract with Aspen Systems Corporation, located in Rockville, Maryland, is in its fourth and final year of performance and is scheduled to expire on November 30, 2002.  OJP may exercise an option to extend services for up to six additional months, if necessary, to continue services during the recompetition period.  To provide increased competition and to seek out alternate approaches and solutions, OJP has decided to unbundle the task areas of the current NCJRS contract and compete each identified task separately.  Solicitations for some of  the tasks may be issued under full and open competition conditions on the open market, while others may be awarded through competition among vendors with the General Services Administration's (GSA) Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) contracts.  The five task areas will include (1) publication support; (2) warehousing/document shipping; (3) call center, information collection, archives, and library functions; (4) electronic development (including websites, online databases, electronic documents, etc.); and (5) user surveys/outcome measures.  It is anticipated that offerors will be able to bid for one or any number of the task areas.  However, separate responses will be required for each task area.  Either separate solicitations  will be issued for each of the five tasks, or some solicitations may combine up to two tasks.  If the latter occurs, multiple awards will be allowed under the solicitations with two separately priced tasks.  Availability of draft Statements of Work and details regarding the recompetition  will be announced on GSA's Federal Business Opportunities Website at "fedbizopps.gov" and will be posted on the Office of Justice Program's website at: "www.ojp.usdoj.gov."

<DESC>NASA/GSFC plans to issue a Request for Quotation (RFQ) for a CW Free Space Single Frequency NPRO Laser and a Microprocessor-Controlled Power Supply Unit. This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). NASA/GSFC intends to purchase the item(s) from Lightwave Electronics.

The laser must be of this type to match and be compatible with the one that is baselined to fly on the LISA mission.  After an extensive market search, it was determined that Lightwave Electronics is the only company that manufactures tunable ND:YAG non-planar ring oscillator single mode lasers.     The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on May 1, 2002.

The anticipated award date is May 1, 2002. 

The propose of the requirement is to conduct a 5-year prevention trial focused on reducing rates of Alcohol, Tobacco and Other Drug(ATOD) among high risk children residing in rural Midwestern communities. The trial was initiated as part of a SAMHA-CSAP sponsored cooperative multi-site agreement ?Prevention Intervention Studies on Predictor Variables by Development Stage.? Children attending 20 rural elementary schools were screened for aggressive behavior during the kindergarten year, followed by randomization of schools to the program condition (Early Risers ?Skills for Success? Program) or a no-intervention (control)condition.  The requested Sole Source Contract shall permit prevention researchers at the University of Minnesota to complete the five-year prevention intervention program and collect Wave 5 outcome data.

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division, Lakehurst, NJ has a requirement for one (1) Rynglok Fittings Set  for the V-22 which uses hydraulic power to provide for operation of the flight control and utility functions of the aircraft.  The hydraulic system consists of three independent systems identified as systems No. 1, No. 2, and No. 3.  All three systems operate at a nominal pressure of 4850 to 5100 PSI at a peak flow of 38 GPM (EMD configuration aircraft 7 through 10 and subsequent).  The No. 1 and No. 2 systems are dedicated to flight controls.  The systems provide hydraulic power to extend or retract electrohydraulic actuators, which position the swashplates , flaperons, elevator, rudders, and rotate the nacelles.  The No. 3 system has three functions.  (1) Provide power of the following hydraulically actuated subsystems: wing-stow, cargo ramp, landing gear extension and retraction, braking, noise wheel steering, rotor brake, internal cargo handling, rescue hoist, engine air inlet control, engine starter, blade fold and vibration suppression.  (2) Provide power for one elevator and two flaperon electrohydraulic actuators.  (3) Provide power for the swashplate actuators in the event of a failure of the No. 1 or No. 2 hydraulic system.  Hydraulic fluid is distributed to the various components via a network of tubing and hoses.  When manufactured, the various tube sections will be assembled using cryofit, welded and rynglok fittings.  Once the V-22 has been fielded, the maintenance concept is to accomplish all tubing repairs using rynglok fittings.  Therefore, a requirement exists for a tool or set of tools to be used for the installation of rynglok fittings at the organizational level of maintenance.  The rynglok tool kit is a portable self-contained tool kit designed to install rynglok fitting sizes 03 through 24.  Design features include: small envelope; lightweight; hand operated; minimum skill training; works with all tubing materials and wall thickness.  The tool kit includes: case; hand pump assembly; marking gage tools; 12 foot hose assembly; inspection gages; marking pen; and instructional video tape.
This RFQ is being issued as a Small Business Set-Aside. All contractors seeking award must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database.  Contracts cannot be awarded to contractors unless they are registered.

This requirement will encompass missile design, design analysis, integration, manufacture of demonstration hardware, test and demonstration of a hard target penetrating variant of the  Block IV missile.  This effort will provide for the integration of a Government furnished penetrator warhead and Hard Target Smart Fuze (HTSF) into the Block IV missile.  This will require structural modification of the forward and mid-body sections of the missile to accommodate the longer penetrator warhead.  The changes to the forward and mid-body sections of the missile will also include modification of the baseline II fuel system.  These changes will alter the missile?s center of gravity and, therefore, require modification of the guidance navigation computer.  In addition, this effort includes the manufacture of three missiles for flight test and demonstration of the TTPV.  NAVAIR intends to award this effort to Raytheon Company, Missile Systems Business Unit (RMS), P.O. Box 11337, Tucson, AZ 85734 ?1337.  RMS is the sole designer and developer of the TT missile.  In June of 1998, NAVAIR awarded a contract to RMS for the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) of the Block IV missile.  The TTPV will be a variant of the basic Block IV missile and it will share a significant portion of the basic Block IV missile design.  It is essential that the TTPV integration effort be performed concurrently with the development of the Block IV missile in order to achieve the Defense Threat Reduction Agency requirement for completion of this program.  Therefore, RMS is the only source capable of accomplishing this requirement in the required timeframe and without duplication of costs. *****

<DESC>NASA/ARC plans to issue a Request for Quotation (RFQ) for a production data acquisition and organization capability to enable the continued development of NASA/ARC's Aviation Security Passenger Screening System.  The system will demonstrate the Information Technology capabilities developed at ARC and the relevance of those technologies to ensuring flight safety through the identification of potentially threatening passengers. This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). NASA/ARC intends to purchase the items from Voquette Inc, of San Mateo, CA, under the authority of FAR 13.106 (b) (1) based on its unique capabilities to provide production data acquisition software and to provide speed of data acquisition.  Voquette software has already been used to develop a baseline database generation capability at NASA Ames.  In order to continue this development, NASA Ames intends to procure a license to the Voquette software so that Ames personnel can develop new capabilities in-house. This data acquisition system is a critical building block for the baseline database generation capability and must be established immediately.  Other factors for the procurement include the speed of data acquisition of the Voquette product, Voquette's experience in the development of terrorist information systems, and Voquette's exclusive patent rights to a semantic processing capability, enabling the aforementioned delivery of data pertinent to the situation and the dynamic definition of "interesting" data. Continuation of the use of Voquette software is also expected to be cost-effective with regards to installation, personnel training, engineering services from company experts, and the expense of further interruption in the development of the system, supporting the Ames role in Aviation Security. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 12:30 p.m. local time on May 2, 2002.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>NASA/JSC plans to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) for an Extension to the NASA Contract NAS 15-10215 for Information Systems Analysis and Integration Team. The contractor will continue to provide services for Information Systems Analysis and Integration Team Contract (ISAC) - The contractor will continue to provide access to, and maintain, critical program data and data base tools necessary for ISS participants to meet program commitments.  The contractor will also continue to operate/maintain platforms on which the program tools reside.   NASA/JSC intends to continue to purchase these services from Barrios Technologies, Inc. from April 19,  2003 (current contract period of performance end date) through December 31, 2003.  The authority cited permitting other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) or 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1); Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The Government does not believe that competing this effort at this time is to its advantage or to industry's advantage, since the period of performance for this extension is only 8.5 months, and any cost savings achieved through competition would be diminished and overshadowed by costs, including phase-in costs, and time delays needed to build relationships with both the ISS Program Office and users of the applications and services provided by Barrios.  However, NASA does intend to compete this effort in the near future. This effort will be combined and competed as part of the Program Integration and Control effort resulting in a contract to be awarded by 12/31/03. To that end, NASA has issued a Request for Information Synopsis (9-BG-12-2-69P), which indicates the ISS Program's Contract Consolidation Strategy. This synopsis discusses the strategy developed to consolidate contracts and offer competition opportunities to those interested. To obtain a copy of the strategy, please view website  http://jsc-web-pub.jsc.nasa.gov/bd01/excellent-strategy/   The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. See Note 26.  See note 22.  Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform this effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on May 31, 2002. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, as required by the Federal Acquisition Regulations, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  An Ombudsman has been appointed. See NASA Specific Note "B".  All qualified responsible sources may submit an offer, which shall be considered by the agency.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute proposes to enter into a purchase order with Dr Anna D. Barker, Cincinnati, Ohio, to provide advice and consultation to the National Cancer Institute on a temporary basis.  Dr Barker will be involved in linking state-of-the art research and clinical care activities within the NCI , and the formation of key partnerships with industrial, community, and state health organizations outside of the Institute.  There is a critical disconnect between scientific discovery and cancer care delivery in our national effort against cancer.  This disconnect is itself a key determinant of the unequal burden of cancer in our society.  Barriers that prevent the benefits of research from reaching all populations, particularly those who bear the greatest disease burden, must be identified and removed.  Dr Barker will develop new intergovernmental and public/private partnerships to improve the dissemination and diffusion of evidence-based interventions. Dr. Barker holds a Ph.D. from Ohio State University in Immunology and Microbiology.  She is extremely well qualified for this type of work as she has held positions in academia, commercial and non profit organizations, giving her a very diverse background and base of experience.  She has held numerous positions as President/Chief Executive Officer of several commercial firms and has sat on the Boards of Directors for numerous commercial organizations.   Dr Barker has also been or is a member of various educational, government,  advocacy and/or non profit committees and boards, both national and international.  She has extensive management/business experience and training in strategic business planning, public and private financing, alliance/partnership development, drug discovery and development, clinical trials planning and implementation, and diagnostics development and commercialization.  Dr Barkers' experience and her familiarity with the NCI programs since 1983,  matches extremely well with her primary goal of linking state-of-the art research and clinical care activities within the NCI, and the formation of key partnerships with industrial, community, and state health organizations outside of the Institute.  This is not a request for quotations and there is no RFQ.  It is a notice of intent to contract with Dr Barker on a sole source basis.  Offerors who feel they are qualified for this effort should submit an original and one copy of their qualifications to the contracting office by 2:00 p.m. EDT, on May 1, 2002. All questions must be in writing and can be faxed (301) 402-4513 or emailed to dm170b@nih.gov .   It is the vendors responsibility to call 301-402-4509 to ensure that their questions have been received.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The reason for this amendment is to address a question raised concerning the actuation specifications.  The question, response and a change in the specifications is identified below:  

Question:

Regarding the actuation, it appears that a direct acting actuator with an overall length dimension of approximately 49" is essential due to size contraints.  This actuator will require an accumulation tank and dump valves, tubing etc.  Will Edwards be taking care of the accumulation tank and assorted valve and tubing or would you prefer the contractor to quote the tank and accessories as well as the actuator.  For complete testing, the tank is necessary.

Response:

	After reevaluating the size and type of actuator, the following changes to the original specification are made:

	1. The overall size of the actuator shall be no longer than 50" and the overall diameter shall be no greater than 25".  The actuator shall be oriented lengthwise along the valve body.

	2. The vendor may substiture a pneumatic actuator in place of the hydraulic actuator specified provided it meets the same functional and operational requirements, and the spatial requirements identified in item 1 above.  The Contracting Officer has up to 1500 psi GN2 available to operate the actuator.  

	3. If  the vendor elects to provide a pneumatic actuator then the vendor shall be responsible to provide a GN2 accumlator as well.  The accumulator shall be pressure rated at least 20% greater than the design actuation pressure.  It shall be sized such that it can open and close the ball valve three complete cycles without recharging.  The accumlator shall be designed, fabricated and stamped in accordance with ASME Section VIII, Division 1.  The inlet/outlet connection shall be either an MS 33649 straight thread or FNPT.  The connection shall be sized to accommodate the required flow.   The accumlator be lined with either baked on phenolic resin, electrodeless nickel plating or epoxy coating.   All supporting documentation for the acculator required by the ASME code shall be provided.  

	4. The vendor may use the accumulator for shop testing of the valve to verify proper actuation and operation.  After testing the accumlator shall be cleaned to level 300 of MIL-STD-1246C, and the openings shall be plugged or otherwise protected for shipment.  

	5. All interconnecting tubing between the accumulator and valve actuator required for shop testing only shall be furnished by the vendor.  The Contracting Officer shall supply all interconnecting tubing, valves, filters, etc. for permanent field installation of the valve and accumulator.  

No other changes indicated.

<DESC>The Department of Defense Education Activity (DoDEA) European  Procurement Office anticipates awarding a Firm-Fixed Price type contract resulting from solicitation MDA412-02-R-0030 to XDesigners of Goffstown New Hampshire.  The services under this solicitation will require the contractor to redesign an existing health course into a Health Education Multimedia Coures.   This effort will require the contractor to have extensive experience integrating Lotus Notes and Macromedia Director through the use of Visual Basic.Net and COM object.  In addition, this effort will require the contractor to have experience using 3DS Max 4, Macromedia Flash and Director Movies, Macromedia Fireworks and Dreamweaver, Photoshop, and Illustrator.  The period of performance for this effort is from 17 Jun 02 to 27 Jan 2003.  The period of performance shall begin on 17 Jun 02 with a  conference to be held in Germany.  During this conference, the contractor shall provide technical input to the Government, so that the Government can decide on the final structure of the redesigned Health Course.  Then, after the conference, the contractor will be tasked with developing the different parts of the course and then integrating them together into a complete Health Education Multimedia Course.  This work shall include; the creation of a 3D hospital environment with interactive hospital staff and numerous interactive rooms, the creation of an interactive glossary, the creation of multiple 3D simulators, and other programming work associated with developing this course.  The reason the Government anticipates awarding to XDesigners is that based on the Market Research performed, XDesigners is the only company with the extensive experience integrating Lotus Notes and Macromedia Director necessary to perform this requirement successfully.  However, the Government will accept proposals from other contractors who are interested and capable of  performing this effort.  The Government anticipates issuing the solicitation on or about 01 May 01.  THIS MODIFICATION CORRECTS THE TYPOGRAPHICAL ERROR IN THE PREVIOUS SENTENCE.

SCOPE OF SERVICES FOR CONTRACTOR'S PREFERRED PRICING PROGRAM  A.  Purpose of  Preferred Pricing Program (PPP) The purpose of the PPP is to assist the VA in meeting their economic objectives.  The VA shall not endorse or refer eligible veterans to individual physicians or PPO networks.  When eligible veterans receive their healthcare from providers in the private sector through the VA Fee Basis, the PPP allows participating VAMCs to share in the savings available through the discounts in managed care networks.   The program allows savings for a variety of health care services through Contractor's provider networks including  hospitalization, outpatient care, ambulatory surgery, behavioral health, ancillary and other services. B. Preferred Pricing Program Processes The contractor shall perform preferred pricing services.  This includes making health care provider networks available to the VA and providing the preferred price to the VA so the VA can then pay the provider.   1. When eligible veterans use PPP providers for hospitalizations, inpatient services, outpatient care, ambulatory surgery, dental, professional services, ancillary, and other services; discounted rates shall be available to VAMCs participating in the PPP. 2. All PPP providers shall submit their claims to the individual VAMC.  The VAMC establishes eligibility, that the service is a covered benefit, and determines the VA allowable (the amount the VA shall pay on that particular claim).   The participating VAMC shall document the VA allowable amount on the claim and forward claims greater than $150 to the contractor.  The contractor shall verify the providers participation with the contractor's PPO and annotate their best price for the services claimed, returning the information to the VAMC.  The VAMC shall determine the best value to the government and make payment on that basis.  Reporting and invoicing protocols assume the VA shall select the lesser of the two prices.   3. The contractor shall provide monthly reports detailing the price the VAMC would have paid comparing it to the Contractor preferred price.  These reports sha be provided within 10 days of the end of the calendar month in which the service was provided.  Contractor shall calculate the amount saved and use that amount for invoicing. C. Preferred Pricing Program requires activities from four different entities.     The VA shall exercise oversight of the contractor and shall have responsibilities for some portions of the claims flow.   The VA shall issue the payments to providers from VA funds.  D. VA Responsibility: 1. VAMCs shall appoint a liaison to assist in coordinating with internal VAMC assets.  2. VAMCs shall: copy claims; forward and receive copied documents from the PPP contractor; track and reconcile claims; reconcile and certify monthly invoices.  3. The VA shall retain responsibility for payment to providers submitting authorized claims. 4. VAMCs shall retain the responsibility for making payments to the contractor for certified savings in accordance with Section V.  Participating Medical Centers may provide a No Charge (N/C) purchase order to the contractor to initiate this BOA.   E. Contractor Responsibility: 1. The contractor shall serve as the prime contractor with overall responsibility for program management.  The contractor shall integrate all subcontractor activities.  The contractor shall ensure access to and adequacy of a discounted network to achieve savings from Medicare rates.  The contractor's payment administrator shall process the claims from receipt up to, but not including, issuance of payment. 2. Provide VAMCs access to managed care provider networks offering discounts. 3. Working with internal and external claims personnel. 4. Re-pricing and returning claims within 6 business days for paper or fax claims and 3 business days for EDI claims.  Invoices not processed within the designated turnaround time shall be treated as non-discountable and processed by the VA accordingly.  The contractor fee shall be paid only when the network price is used, claims not meeting the turnaround time shall not be considered for reimbursement unless the PPP is utilized. 5. Contractor shall prepare an individual pricing form for every claim and return it to the VA with the discounted price clearly written on it. 6. Provide opportunity for future EDI transmission of claims. 7. Submit standard reports in a timely manor.  Quarterly reports to VISN 10 shall include a summary of each participating facility's demonstrated cost savings.  Monthly summary reports for each VAMC's COTR shall be provided with the invoice for fee reimbursement. ( See Paragraph I B 3 and Section III.) 8. The contractor shall pay for overnight or second day shipping when it is used.  II.  PROJECT PLAN  A Project Plan shall be developed that includes the following: 1. Implementation Meeting (Representatives from the contractor, VAMC fee or business office, and the COTR) a. Review process b. Review responsibilities c. Identify key contact personnel d.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT: Contractor to furnish all necessary labor, materials, and equipment to complete repairs to the American Shoals Light, a historic offshore structure located approximately six (6) miles offshore on Sugarloaf Key, Monroe County, Florida.   Work includes but is not limited to all labor, equipment, materials, and tools necessary to complete the following work:  repairing and painting the exterior surfaces of this 110 foot tall skeleton structure.  Structural repairs include the replacement of clamps on the connection nodes at the first level above the water line; installation of reinforced concrete pile jackets; and renewal of cathodic protection anodes.  Other work items include the selective refurbishment and painting of interior and exterior items and the replacement of the lantern room windows.  The applicable North American Industry Class System (NAICS) Code is 235910.    The small business size standard is a three-year averaged annual gross receipt of $11.5 million.   Estimated construction price range is $500,000.00 to $1,000,000.00.  Bid, payment and performance bonds are required.  Performance period is 180 calendar days.  There is no charge for the solicitation package.  All bid requests must be submitted in writing, and may be faxed to (305)278-6696.  No telephone requests shall be accepted.  All responsible sources may submit a bid, which will be considered by this agency.  This action is being considered for 100 percent set-aside for HUBZone small business concerns.  Interested HUBZone small business concerns should indicate their interest to the Contracting Officer, in writing, as early as possible but to be received not later than 15 calendar days of this notice.  As a minimum, the following information is required:  (a) a copy of the certificate issued by the SBA of your qualifications as a HUBZone concern, (b) a positive statement of your intention to submit an offer for this solicitation as a prime contractor,  (c) evidence of experience in work similar in type and scope to include contract numbers, project titles, dollar amounts, and points of contacts and telephone numbers and  (d) provide evidence of bonding capability to the maximum magnitude of the project, to include both single and aggregate totals.   All  information must be submitted in sufficient detail for a decision to be made on availability of interested HUBZone concerns.  Failure to submit all information requested will result in a contractor not being considered as an interested HUBZone concern.  If adequate interest is not received from HUBZone concerns by close of business 15 calendar days from the date of this notice, this solicitation will be issued on an unrestricted basis without further notice.  Therefore, replies are requested from large and small business concerns, as well as from HUBZone concerns.    ATTENTION:   Minority, Women-owned, and Disadvantaged Business Enterprises: The Department of Transportation (DOT) Office of Small Disadvantaged Business Utilization (OSBDU), has a program to assist minority, women-owned and disadvantaged business enterprises to acquire short-term working capital and bonding assistance for transportation-related contracts.  This is applicable to any eligible prime or subcontract at any tier.  The DOT Bonding Assistance Program enables firms to apply for bid, performance and payment bonds up to $1.0 million per contract.  The DOT provides an 80% guarantee on the bond amount to a surety against losses.   Loans are also available under the DOT Short-Term Lending Program (STLP) at prime interest rates to provide accounts receivable financing.  The maximum line of credit is $500,000.00.  For further information and applicable forms concerning the Bonding Assistance Program and/or the STLP, please call the OSDBU at (800) 532-1169.*****

<DESC>This Sources Sought Synopsis - Market Survey is being conducted to identify potential sources that may possess present expertise, capabilities, and experience to meet the requirements for qualification and production of the Self Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA) for use by USAF fire fighting and emergency services personnel.  The projected requirements for the SCBA (NSN: 4240-01-333-3495) are approximately 14,000 SCBA units until with deliveries until 2009.  The requirement for a new SCBA system is driven by Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) standards with which the Air Force must comply.  The proposed new system must meet the criteria contained in the NFPA and OSHA standards.  Secondly, the NIOSH approved system must be capable of providing a compressed air supply for normal fire fighting operations and a filtered air system for full spectrum threat operations (weapons of mass destruction (WMD):  chemical, biological, radiological, hazardous material, etc.)  Conversion from compressed air to filtered air must be achieved without subjecting the firefighter to inhalation, ingestion, or absorption contamination.  Additionally, the new system must be compatible with the Joint Service ? Lightweight Integrated Suit Technology (JS-LIST) and the Joint ? Firefighter Integrated Response Ensemble (J-FIRE).  The Requirements Correlation Matrix (RCM) Part I is included in the FedBizOpps for your review.  After reviewing the RCM, please respond to the following: 1.)

<DESC>The FAA releases the final Screening Information Request (SIR). The NEXCOM Ground Network System Program will design, develop, and produce the cost-effective and logistically supportable ground network/switching communications components required to integrate the NEXCOM Multi-mode Digital Radio with the existing voice switches and the FAA backbone data routers. The resulting integrated system consisting of subsystems such as the Radio Interface Unit (RIU), and the Ground Network Interface (GNI) will provide the air/ground communication transmission system for both backward compatible analog voice and the new digital voice and the ATN subnetwork for datalink based on VHF Digital Link Mode 3 standards. This scalable system will be implemented first in the en-route domain and subsequently in the terminal, tower and flight service station environments.  The FAA has reviewed the comments submitted by industry and has incorporated the comments where appropriate.  A complete ! list of all comments received and the FAA's response will be posted on the AND-360 website within the next week. <P> Reference material not readily available to offerors will be posted on the NEXCOM web page (i.e. White Paper referencing ICAO Doc X). <P> The FAA shall not be liable for any costs associated with the preparation of comments/responses to this public announcement or SIR.

Identify optimal simulation tools and design methodologies within the computer-aided design framework.
(2)	Standard Cell/Topologies in radiation-hard SOI:  Develop radiation-hard SOI analog or mixed signal sub-circuits and architectures for RF, communication, and signal processing applications.
(3)	Reconfigurable mixed signal electronics:  Develop radiation-hard SOI analog or mixed-signal sub-circuits or architectures capable of adapting to changing applications.
(4)	System-On-a-Chip: Develop integrated simulation tools with the ability to model mixed mode RF/communication of entire Systems-On-a-Chip. Identify cost-effective packaging concepts for systems-on-a-chip.
(5)	Predictive Radiation Effects Models:  Develop predictive models for total dose and single event effects in analog/microwave circuits. Integrate radiation-hardening models to allow rapid trade-off between cost, electrical performance and hardening.
(6)	Ultra low-power technologies: Develop analog and mixed signal ultra-low power applications (i.e. body or substrate bias) reminiscent of emerging digital technology.
Research teams addressing two or more of these areas should consist of U.S. university faculty and students, in partnership with active U.S. industrial manufacturers of radiation-hardened integrated circuits (manufacturers who currently have radiation-hardened circuits commercially available).  Proposals need not address specific research plans for every one of the six areas above, but rather should define an organizational framework through which specific research projects can be later formulated in two or more of the areas by academic-industry teams, and then evaluated and selected by industry experts and AFRL.  A single award will be made to the industry/university team with the best proposal, but the team may be composed of more than one university member and more than one commercial manufacturer of radiation-hardened integrated circuits.
Work performed under any resulting agreement/contract may be classified up to the Secret Level.  The DD254 is available at www.eps.gov.  The contractor who is selected for an award under this PRDA may be required, and then must be eligible to obtain, a Secret facility clearance. Technical point of contact: AFRL/VSSE, Capt Joseph W. Tringe, 505-846-4049, fax 505-846-2290, email:  joseph.tringe@kirtland.af.mil.  Evaluators may contact an offeror to clarify a point of information before completing the evaluation.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Tank-Automotive and Armaments Command, Armament Research, Development and Engineering Center (TACOM-ARDEC), Picatinny Arsenal, NJ is  contemplating the issuance of a Solicitation for existing 155mm suite of non- developmental artillery projectiles for achieving range and lethality  objectives in United States 39 and 52 caliber systems.  The projectile suite  must have demonstrated interoperability and be compatible with NATO 52 caliber  self-propelled howitzers.  The projectile suite desired is High Explosive (HE),  Dual Purpose Improved Conventional Munitions (DPICM), Smoke, Red Phosphorus,  Illumination and Extended Range HE projectiles.   A reduced cost HE or practice  variant with the same range and aero-ballistic profile should be made  available.  All projectiles within the family must have a common external  profile for auto-handling operations, and must have ballistic similitude and  use one common set of firing tables, with the exception of the extended range  projectile.  The HE projectiles in the 52 caliber system must have a maximum  unassisted range of at least 30 km and a maximum assisted range of at least 40  km, at sea level.  The projectiles should be capable of achieving a Range  Probable Error (PE) of 0.34% or less at 75% of maximum range without a course  correction fuze.  If an extended range variant is available, the extended range  HE projectile in a 52 caliber system must have a maximum range of at least 50  km at sea level, and a Range PE precision of less than 0.5% at 75% of maximum  range without course correction fuze.  In a 39 caliber system the extended  range projectile must have a maximum range of at least 40 km, with a Range PE  of 0.4% at 75% of maximum range without a course correction fuze. The assisted  and unassisted projectiles must have the ability to change from a boat tail  configuration to a base bleed configuration without affecting the overall  projectile mass.  The DPICM projectile bomblets must have self-destruct fuzing  and achieve a penetration of at least 120mm in Rolled Homogeneous Armor.  A low  cost DPICM-PRAC training option should also be made available.  (Note:  It is  desired to have the combined primary and self-destruct functions produce a non- neutralized dud rate of 0.2% or less).  All respondents must provide  documentation demonstrating recent past performance (within the last five  years) of the projectile suite in both 39 and 52 caliber cannons to the above  specified ranges and Range PE; as well as historical information supporting the  companys capability in the areas of system engineering, system integration,  production, and its ability to meet planned vs. actual contract cost and  schedule requirements.    All respondents must also provide information on the  advantages and disadvantages their prospective systems, i.e., the transfer of  producibility technology for these systems to the Government, and  compatibility/interoperability with the existing United States 155mm ammunition  Industrial Base.  TACOM-ARDEC hereby requests that any firm that may have the  capability of meeting this contemplated requirement provide a Statement of  Capability and supporting rationale to Ms. Deborah G. Bankit at Area Code 973- 724-3455 so that it may be properly evaluated prior to synopsis and  solicitation of the requirement.
