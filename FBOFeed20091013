<DESC>The 642 ELSS proposes to execute, by means of other than full and open competition, a modification to the IBDSS IDIQ contract F19628-03-D-0019 to extend the Ordering Period to 31 December 2009. This modification also increases the ceiling by $8,000,000, from $562,000,000 to $570,000,000.
This action will enable follow-on support for AFCENT Security Forces in support of operational deployments in Southwest Asia (SWA), area of responsibility (AOR) for a period of 6 months by extending Order 0076 from 29 November 2009 to 28 May 2010.  Due to the present situation in Afghanistan and Iraq specifically, SWA in general, and the urgent nature of force protection as a whole, the requirements necessitate the need to continue support that AFCENT is receiving from incumbent contractor, Northrop Grumman (NG).  This action will provide the continuation of  Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF)  and Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF)  support currently awarded under the IBDSS contract F19628-03-D-0019 Order 0076.

<DESC>DLA Contracting Services Office Philadelphia (DCSO-P) intends to acquire, on a competitive 8(a) basis, End-to-End Analytical and Process Documentation Support for the DLA Enterprise Technical Infrastructure and Architecture Business Cycle Team (TIA BCT) in support of DLAs J-6 Division.  The TIA BCT is a chartered effort within DLA Information Technology community to develop end-to-end process documentation for the enterprise IT operations using an expanded and tailored ITILv3 service management framework.  The outcomes of the TIA BCT will serve to directly support the Defense Logistics Agency resource stewardship governance efforts and Enterprise-level strategic objectives.  The successful contractor will deliver recommendations, Plan of Action and Milestones, process decompositions, and other work products that will enable DLA to design, refine, and implement standardized, repeatable, and compliant best practice IT operations processes in all phases of the IT life cycle.  These repeatable processes will be defined in accordance with a DLA IT Operations framework, which is based on the Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL), expanded to include the development and sustainment of new systems capabilities.  The contractor will assist DLA J6 in fulfilling the requirements of the first three phases of the prescribed stewardship process; Discovery and Correction; Validation, and Assertion (but not Assessment or Audit).  The Technical Infrastructure and Architecture Business Cycle Team (TIA BCT) will not be creating an assertion package.  It will act solely in a supporting role, ensuring that end-to-end Information Technology (IT) business processes are standardized, repeatable, and in compliance with all applicable laws, regulations, standards and policies.  In addition, the  TIA BCT will prioritize efforts based on the systems that DLA uses to generate its financial statements to insure these systems will withstand a Federal Information Systems Control Audit Manual (FISCAM) audit.  Substantial familiarity with FISCAM policy is required of contractor personnel at time of award, with the RFQ document to describe this minimum standard more completely.  Knowledge of other DOD Guidance is required as well (e.g., DoD Lifecycle Management, DODI 5000.2, 5000.1 and Guidebook).  The quality of services provided shall conform to the highest standards in the profession.      
 
Contractors are hereby notified that the presence of Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCI) issues is expected to be moderate to substantial and appropriate actions will be put into place to mitigate or eliminate such OCIs.  Contractors may be precluded however, from later work under this or other DLA projects.

The Government anticipates that this acquisition will be competed amongst eligible 8(a) firms.  Quotes from firms other than those designated as 8(a) firms by the Small Business Administration (SBA) will not be considered for award.  Certifications shall be submitted via Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA).  Non-price factors will be considered in the award decision, and will be more important than that of price.  Performance is anticipated to occur predominantly at the contractors facility.  

The solicitation is anticipated to be released within the next several weeks and will be posted at this website.  Interested parties are solely responsible for monitoring the website for posting of the solicitation and any amendments thereto.  The closing date will be established in the RFP. 
 
The applicable NAICS is 541614 and the size standard is $7.0 million.  The anticipated period of performance is a base year, with 4 (four) one-year option periods.  

Interested parties should retrieve a copy of the solicitation from this website after release and, if there are any questions, direct them to Joanne Reinert at joanne.reinert@dla.mil no later than 10 calendar days after the date of solicitation release.

<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Headquarters, Washington, DC, contemplates the procurement of material parts (kits) in support of the FAA's Configuration Material - Enroute Racks.  The desired delivery is FOB: Destination.
The FAA's requirement is as identified in the attached Material Parts (Kits) Listing or equal in accordance with Attachment 1.  Attachment 2 represents copies of the associated drawings applicable to the parts identified on the listing.  
Delivery and Place of Delivery/Period of Performance: To be cited on each individual order.   
To fulfill the Government's immediate need under this requirement, the FAA intends to establish a Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) for a period of one year; with an option to extend the BPA for an additional year should it become necessary.
A BPA is a simplified method of filling the Government's anticipated repetitive needs for supplies or services by establishing charge accounts with qualified sources of supply.
The anticipated total ceiling amount under the acquisition has been established at $1,400,000.00 annually, or $2,800,000.00 should the Government elect to exercise the option period.  
The NAICS Code under this acquisition is 332313, Plate Work Manufacturing, with a Small Business Standard Size of 500 employees.  Firms shall complete and submit the attached Business Declaration form with their reply.
Purpose of Announcement:  To solicit sources that would be interested in establishing a BPA under this requirement.  Interested vendors should submit to the Contracting Officer a statement of interest along with a copy of their price list for the kits identified under Attachment 1 no later than 12:00 Noon, EST, 6 November 2009.
At this time the nature of the competition has not been determined.  The FAA may decide to do a full and open competition or set aside all or part of the procurement for small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the SBA for participation in the SBA's 8(a) Program.
The purpose of this market survey is to solicit statements or interest and capabilities from small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses and 8(a) certified firms, capable of providing FAA's Configuration Material - Enroute Racks.
This market survey is also being conducted in order to obtain the information necessary to determine whether adequate competition exists to set-aside the competition among small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or 8(a) certified firms.
No further screening information request (SIR) or other postings will be issued as a result of this announcement.  The FAA reserves the right to make multiple awards as a result of this posting based on the best value to the Government, price and delivery being of equal importance.     
In order to receive an award from the FAA, regardless of dollar value, vendors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA).  For registration procedures and information, please call 1-888-227-2423, or visit the Business Partner Network (BPN) at www.bpn.gov.
Due to the sensitive time frame involved with this acquisition, questions may be submitted; however, the FAA does not guarantee a response prior to the award a BPA.  No questions will be entertained after 22 October 2009.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<CONTACT>MS. STACY MCATEE, 812-854-1988

<a href="mailto:stacy.mcatee@navy.mil">POINT OF CONTACT</a>
<DESC>This synopsis is being posted to both the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) page located at www.fbo.gov and the Navy Electronic Commerce on line (NECO) site at www.neco.navy.mil. While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the Internet, NECO is the alternative in case that FBO is not available.  Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by NSWC Division Crane. The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division requires Miniature Day/Night Sight subsystems for Crew-Served Weapons (MDNS-CSW).  A five year indefinite-delivery indefinite-quantity contract is anticipated; expected quantity is a minimum of 15 units and a maximum of 3000 units.  Delivery shall be FOB Destination NSWC-Crane.  Fifteen (15) units required 150 days from award date of contract with subsequent deliveries at a rate of 200 units every 30 days until order is complete.  Preliminary inspection will occur at source by a Government QAR and final inspection and acceptance will be at destination by NSWC Crane personnel.  This solicitation will be issued on a full and open competition basis using a performance specification. The MDNS-SCW required is a system of common, standardized aiming modules, illumination modules, and mounts that are system-integrated for use on crew-served weapons.  Prior public Market Survey activity on MDNS-SCW occurred pursuant to two previous NSWC Crane announcements: N00164-06-R-4887 WEAPONS QUADRANT MOUNTS (WQM) and N00164-06-R-4803 CREW SERVED AND HEAVY WEAPONS AIMING LASER (CSHWAL).  The original Market Surveys can be downloaded by clicking on the foregoing links; then entering the announcement numbers in the Search by Solicitation / Award Number block in the provided form.  No Performance Specification for the WQM is yet prepared.  A Preliminary Draft of the Performance Specification for the CSHWAL, dated April 25th, 2006, remains posted, but is closed for receipt of comments.  Market Survey results and field trials of commercial offerings in July 2006 revealed that no known existing laser meets the requirements for the CSHWAL.  Also revealed was that the future!   CSHWAL and WQMs need to be fully system integrated with a Visible Bright Light-Heavy (VBL-H).  Therefore, NSWC Crane intends to develop a new Performance Specification that unifies the CSHWAL, VBL-H, and WQMs subsystem capabilities into an integrated MDNS-CSW system.  The MDNS-CSW Performance Specification will be published on or about September-October 2006.  When it is published, interested parties are invited to comment on the MDNS-CSW Performance Specification.  The Closing Date for receipt of comments on the MDNS-CSW Performance Specification is Friday, 1 December 2006. NSWC Crane will hold a public pre-solicitation conference for the MDNS-CSW acquisition.  The tentative date for this pre-solicitation conference is Thursday, 19 October 2006, in Indianapolis, Indiana.  Attendees must register for this conference with the Contracting Officer no later than Friday, 15 September 2006.  No additional attendees will be accepted for this conference after Friday, 15 September 2006, in order to accommodate the correct seating capacity at the conference site.     It is expected that the competitive solicitation will require offerors to submit two product samples, technical, past performance and price proposals.  Award will be on a best value basis.  To be eligible for award, contractors must be properly registered in the Government's Central Contractor Registration (CCR).  Offerors may obtain information on CCR registration and annual confirmation requirements by calling 1-888-227-2423, or via the Internet @ www.ccr.gov. It should be noted that during the course of this acquisition program, the Government plans to utilize employees from Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC), Wexford Group International (WGI) and possibly other direct Government contractors as advisors to the Government participants.  This sources sought announcement does not constitute an Invitation for Bids (IFB), a Request for Quote (RFQ), or a Request for Proposal (RFP) and it should not be construed as a commitment of any kind by the Government to issue a formal solicitation or ultimately award a contract.  The U.S. Government is in no way liable to pay for or reimburse any companies or entities that respond to this announcement.  Any costs incurred by interested companies in response to this announcement or incurred for participation in the pre-solicitation conference will NOT be reimbursed.  Any information provided that is marked as proprietary information will be safeguarded to prevent disclosures to !  non-government personnel and entities.  Your interest in this program is appreciated.  Questions should be directed to Stacy McAtee, Contracting Officer, Code 0562NS, telephone 812-854-1988, fax 812-854-5095, e-mail stacy.mcatee@navy.mil.

<DESC>The National Institute of Justice (NIJ) will be entering into an agreement with USAID to conduct studies and evaluations of overseas activities conducted by two Department of Justice (DOJ) agencies -- the International Criminal Investigative Training Assistance Program (ICITAP) and the Office of Overseas Prosecutorial Development, Assistance and Training (OPDAT) - on behalf of justice reforms supported by USAID. NIJ is seeking qualified consultants and consulting firms to conducts these studies and evaluations. The number and relative frequency of these assignments is unknown at this time.
<p>As their names imply, ICITAP provides a range of training and technical assistance on law enforcement topics and OPDAT performs similar services for prosecutors. These activities can be as brief as single training sessions or can involve multi-year, multi-faceted support and assistance. They can take place in any country supported by USAID; i.e., less than fully-developed economies.</p>
<p>By way of examples, one recent ICITAP project involved training and technical assistance to support anti-corruption efforts in Tanzania. ICITAP staff and consultants provided training of Tanzanian instructors, coursework on financial fraud, case management, and questioned documents. They also helped the Tanzanian Police Force establish case tracking and management systems, and internal affairs divisions to investigate internal bribery and other forms of corruption. This project took more than two years.</p>
<p>Similarly, OPDAT worked with Ukrainian officials on other anti-corruption activities. They worked within multiple Ukrainian governmental ministries to institute judicial and legislative reforms, and best practices in the transparency of government transactions. They also helped the government establish a system for monitoring and enforcement of ethical standards, the streamlining and enforcing of business regulations, and procedures to combat corruption in higher education. This was also a multi-year program.</p>
<p>USAID is asking NIJ to conduct reviews and assessments of programs like these to help officials answer questions such as:</p>
<p>&bull; How well did the project achieve its stated objectives?<br />&bull; Were training and technical assistance activities conducted as planned?<br />&bull; What mid-course changes had to be made and why?<br />&bull; In what ways are the aided governments improved? By what evidence?<br />&bull; Were lessons learned that could improve the conduct of future USAID activities?</p>
<p>OJP is requesting statements of qualification from interested organizations. Qualifications should include:</p>
<p>&bull; Evidence of performance in similar consulting assignments, especially related to, but not exclusively, criminal justice;<br />&bull; Evidence of performance off work in developing nations; and<br />&bull; Demonstrated ability to conduct work in languages other than English.</p>
<p>INSTRUCTION FOR RFI SUBMISSION:<br />After review of the attached documentation, interested parties may submit a response in an electronic format only. Electronic files should be in Microsoft Office Word 2003 or PDF format. All information should be UNCLASSIFIED material only.<br />Respondents should include as part of their submission:<br />a A synopsis of the company's capabilities to provide qualified professional and administrative personnel (limit 2 pages)<br />b. DUNS Number<br />c. Company Name<br />d. Company Address<br />e. State whether the firm has a current GSA Federal Supply Schedule contract<br />f.

<DESC>Space and Naval Warfare SystemsCenter (SPAWARSYSCEN) Atlantic,intends to award a commercial, sole-source contract IAW FAR Part 13, toIntelsat General Corporation, 6550Rock Spring Dr 450, Bethesda, MD20817.  The proposed acquisition is toreserve and obtain selected services ofan existing communications satellite(SKYNet-4C) for National ScienceFoundation (NSF) data communicationsbetween the Continental US and SouthPole Station Antarctica. Theprocurement includes incidentalengineering services to support systemimplementation, as well asprocurement and testing of the SouthPole Ground Terminal.  The SKYNET-4Cwill replace the MARISAT-F2 satellitewhich was de-orbited in October 2008.Since the de-orbiting of the MARISAT-F2, NSFs South Pole data link to therest of the world has bee significantlylimited. NSF has identified the satelliteSKYNET-4C as having both theinclination required and capacityavailable to replace the MARISAT-F2 inthis critical role.  The SKYNET-4C is theonly available commercial satellite thatcan communicate with the South PoleStation; therefore, Intelsat in the onlyknown source for these services.A Firm Fixed Price, Indefinite Delivery,Indefinite Quantity type contract isanticipated with a one-year base periodand four one-year options. Theapplicable North American IndustryClassification System (NAICS) code is517410 and the size standard is $15million.  This notice is not a request forcompetitive proposals.  Any responseto this notice is due no later than 20October 2009.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)<BR>Enabling User Innovation at the Edge<BR>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY. THIS REQUEST IS FOR PLANNING PURPOSES, AND DOES NOT CONSTITUTE AN INVITATION FOR BIDS, A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS, A SOLICITATION, A REQUEST FOR QUOTES, OR AN INDICATION THE GOVERNMENT WILL CONTRACT FOR THE ITEMS CONTAINED IN THIS NOTICE. THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT REIMBURSE RESPONDENTS FOR ANY COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH SUBMISSION OF THE INFORMATION BEING REQUESTED OR REIMBURSE EXPENSES INCURRED TO INTERESTED PARTIES FOR RESPONSES. THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT INTEND TO AWARD A CONTRACT ON THE BASIS OF THIS RFI OR TO OTHERWISE PAY FOR THE INFORMATION SOLICITED.<BR><BR>BACKGROUND & DESCRITION<BR><BR>This Request for Information by the Communications-Electronics Research Development and Engineering Center Command and Control Directorate (CERDEC C2D) Battle Command Division, Advanced Applications Branch seeks to determine methods to facilitate warfighter innovation at the edge. CERDEC C2D is soliciting new and novel ideas from industry and academia that will help foster an open and collaborative environment, supporting Network-Centric Operations, where soldiers can find, create, customize, share and evolve software capabilities that can be adapted to meet unanticipated requirements. CERDEC C2D is investigating methods to enable and capture user innovation at the edge, making it available to the community at large and improving the Armys agility and adaptability in the face of changing missions.<BR><BR>New soldiers enter the Army with an increasingly higher level of technical competence, most of whom, at the very least, use various App Stores, Web Gadgets and software to compose their own web and computing environments at home. Therefore, it should be of no surprise that Warfighters are already innovating in an attempt to accomplish similar capabilities on the battlefield. Frequently, user innovation is the response to a problem not anticipated by the designers of existing systems. However, the intent of this effort is not to replace existing systems, but rather to fill the gaps between and around them so that ultimately, the Warfighter can be as effective as possible, using the right tool for the job. <BR><BR>OBJECTIVES<BR><BR>Objectives for this RFI include the following:<BR><BR>"Gather information on current and future industry and technology trends that may assist in facilitating user edge programming (For simplicity, we refer to programming as any form of customization by the end user, and not necessarily the act of writing code)<BR>"Gather information on industry experience in software systems, architectures and technologies relevant to this research area<BR>"Gather information regarding industry experience in rapidly developing, integrating, testing and deploying software<BR>"Gather programmatic information relevant to deploying an environment for edge programming<BR><BR>TOPICS FOR RESPONSES<BR><BR>CERDEC C2D seeks to develop, demonstrate and transition the tools and environment that facilitate edge programming by Warfighters with a range of technical skill sets. <BR><BR>CERDEC C2D envisions a centralized and social environment that enables the discovery, rating, suggesting and requesting of capabilities; an environment for sharing best practices and lessons learned; solutions on thick, thin and mobile platforms that work seamlessly; and the integration with existing and future DoD and commercial systems.<BR> <BR>CERDEC C2D must address the many implications that result from a bottom-up approach to innovation, including but not limited to development, deployment, testing security and governance. Considerations may include a mechanism to monitor applications and resources in real time; a centralized authority to remotely distribute, patch or roll back deployed software; a sandbox environment to test applications; methods to automatically certify applications prior to deployment.<BR><BR>PROPOSED ACQUISITION STRATEGY<BR><BR>CERDEC C2D has an existing Broad Agency Announcement (BAA SOLICITATION W15P7T-08-R-P001) as well as other contractual vehicles that may be leveraged to provide a contract award.  However, industry is also welcome to describe any contractual vehicles that may be leveraged to perform work in described in respondents information paper.<BR><BR>RESPONSES<BR><BR>Interested parties are encouraged to submit ONE non-proprietary Statement of Capabilities (SOC) PER COMPANY which includes the following information: <BR>a)Coversheet to identify this RFI number & title, your organization(s), responder's technical and administrative points of contact - including names, titles, postal address, phone and fax numbers, email addresses, and CAGE code (if applicable).<BR>b)An executive summary with a one page limit should summarize the key ideas.<BR>c)Responses to the topics, in minimum 12pt font<BR>d)Significant claims or reports of success must be justified with specific citations, URLs, and/or references.<BR><BR>Responses will be reviewed as they are received. SOCs may also be reviewed by government consultants who have executed Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs).<BR><BR>CERDEC C2D will attempt to review SOCs within 30 days after receipt.  Papers with strong scientific and/or technical merits and relevance to the US Army CERDEC C2D mission and goals may be invited to submit proposals in accordance with the acquisition strategy described below.<BR><BR>Submissions do not necessarily need to address all aspects of Edge innovation. If the submitting party has expertise in a specific domain, a deep dive may prove more advantageous. On the other hand, this RFI is in no way inclusive of all Edge innovation issues. CERDEC C2D encourages submissions to include information on additional problems as well as creative techniques and approaches that facilitate Edge innovation. <BR><BR>Information Paper Requirements<BR><BR>The document should be a maximum of five (5) pages in length, in PDF document format (PDF), single line spaced, and utilizing 1 inch margins and Times New Roman font size 12.  At a minimum, the following should be discussed in the information paper:<BR><BR>"A high level description of the concept, technology, or product<BR>"Is the proposed technology or product a proprietary solution?<BR>"Does the proposed technology leverage commercial or open-source software?<BR>"Expected deliverables (hardware/software)<BR>"Maturity level (Technology Readiness Level  TRL  is one way of describing this)<BR>"Does the proposed technology leverage past or existing DoD research programs?<BR>"List of contractual vehicles that exist and may be leveraged to perform work described<BR><BR>CERDEC C2D will attempt to review information papers within 30 days after receipt.  Information papers with strong scientific and/or technical merits and relevance to the US Army CERDEC C2D mission and goals may be invited to submit proposals in accordance with the aforementioned acquisition strategy or invited to provide additional information through a one-one discussion as described below.<BR><BR>One-on-One Discussions<BR><BR>Subsequent to the review of submitted information papers, the Government may hold one-on-one discussions with select respondents to this RFI, if needed.  Any information provided to the Government during one-on-one discussions will be treated as proprietary upon your request to treat it as such.  <BR><BR>To the extent possible, all responses should be unclassified and for general access by the Government, other evaluators, and other respondents. All material provided (responses, discussions, questions/answers, and other data) that is not related to competition sensitive or contractor proprietary material may be provided (without attribution) to other respondents. Any material provided may be used in development of future solicitations. Any proprietary information submitted must be clearly and separately identified and marked and will be appropriately protected. The Government will NOT be responsible for any proprietary information not clearly marked.<BR>Any classified responses must meet the format and delivery instructions described in this RFI. In addition, classified delivery must be arranged in advance. Responses at classification levels above DoD SECRET are discouraged, but may be considered. Classified responses must include identification of their source of classification guidance.<BR><BR>Responses should include the name and telephone number of a point of contact having authority and knowledge to discuss responses with Government representatives.<BR>Only electronic submissions of information provided to the email address specified will be accepted. RFI responses should be sent to the following email address: https://abop.monmouth.army.mil. All emails should include in the subject line the RFI number and the submitting organizations name.

<DESC>The Department of the Army, Corps of Engineers, New York District is issuing this Sources Sought Notice as part of market research to identify potential small business manufacturers or kit processors as sources for the purchase of Commercial Off the Self (COTS)   office furniture products.  The Buy American Act applies to this requirement.  FAR 25.101 states in general that (a) The Buy American Act restricts the purchase of supplies that are not domestic end products.  For  manufactured end products, the Buy American Act uses a two-part test to define a domestic end product.<BR>(1) The article must be manufactured in the United States; and <BR>(2) The cost of domestic components must exceed 50 percent of the cost of all the components. In accordance with 41 U.S.C. 431, this component test of the Buy American Act has been waived for acquisitions of COTS items (see 12.505(a)). <BR>(b) The Buy American Act applies to small business set-asides. A manufactured product of a small business concern is a U.S.-made end product, but is not a domestic end product unless it meets the component test in paragraph (a)(2) of this section<BR><BR>This synopsis is for planning purposes only and is issued in accordance with FAR Clause 52.215-3.  No solicitation document exists at this time.  Issuance of this notice does not constitute any obligation on the part of the Government to procure these items or to issue a solicitation.  In addition, the Government is under no obligation to pay for information submitted in response to this synopsis, and responses to this notice cannot be accepted as offers.  The applicable NAICS code is 337214 and the Size Standard is 500 employees.  Based on the response to this Sources Sought and other market research conducted, the Army Corps of Engineers will decide if any separable part or the entire requirement will be set-aside for Small Businesses under the size standard for the NAICS and/or specific small business programs  8(a) Program, HUBZone  Small Business, or Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses), or Full and Open Competition. Below is the description of the services required:<BR>  <BR>REQUIRED PRODUCTS:  Workstation, executive office furniture, task chair seating for the BRAC #133 facility located in Alexandria, Virginia, which will house over 1.8 million square feet of administrative office space to accommodate approximately 6600 personnel and their work.

<DESC>
The Government posts this notice for INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY to issue a contract award seeking contractor assistance to provide Loan Limit Data by County (Median Home Price Data based on County Recorder Data required for FHA Loan Limits).  HUD will issue a Sole Source Award to  First American CoreLogic in accordance to FAR 6.302-1.  This service required by HUD is available from only one source.  No other type of service would satisfy the agencys requirements, therefore, full and open competition need not be provided for.  

First American CoreLogic (FACL) collects and maintains the largest repository of recorded property sales transactions collected from the 2100 most highly populated counties in the US.  Those 2100 counties represent 90% of the recorded transactions in the country.   During the course of this acquisition effort, it was discovered that only one company was the source of the comprehensive data.  Third party vendors were not permitted by the Sales and Licensing Agreement with First American to resell this data.

HUD will gain access to this data by purchasing a 12 month subscription to two of the contractors databases (HPI and Market Trends), and by obtaining three downloads of required statistical data over a 12 month period.

At this point, final decisions about this acquisiton strategy, contract(s) structure, contract(s) duration(s) have NOT been made. Industry feedback indicates DISA efforts to visually inform industry about scope and content are being interpreted as reflecting contract structure. DISA strongly suggests that industry NOT attempt to extrapolate or deduce anything regarding contract structure from publically presented materials. Once final decisions are made, hopefully within the next two months, DISA will conduct an industry day explaining the strategy so that industry can prepare for the solicitation.

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs, VA Boston Healthcare System, has a requirement for expertise and support in engineering science applications for a healthcare setting.  A fixed price contract with a base of November 16, 2009, through November 15, 2010 with four (4) 1-year option periods is anticipated and shall be awarded.  It is the Government's belief that only  Northeastern University possesses the required capabilities to successfully meet this requirement.  It is the Government's intention to solicit and negotiate only with this source.  Please refer to the Sole Source Justification.  This is not a solicitation; it is notice of intent to sole source a requirement.Inquiries/information received after the established deadline shall not be considered.  The submission of any data for review shall not impede award of this contract as planned.  The Government does not intend to pay for information solicited.  This synopsis is issued pursuant to FAR 6.302-5.  JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION1.  Identification of the agency and the contracting activity: The agency is the Department of Veterans Affairs.  The activity is New England Healthcare Engineering Partnership (NEHCEP), a Veteran's Engineering Resource Center (VERC).2.  Nature and/or description of the action being approved.The nature of the action is a sole source solicitation to Northeastern University..3.  The description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs (including the estimated value).The New England Healthcare Engineering Partnership (NEHCEP) has received funding from the national office of Systems Redesign to establish a Veteran's Engineering Resource Center.  Included in this award is funding to establish academic relationships with University departments of engineering.  One of the academic affiliates is Northeastern University department of engineering.The estimated total value of this service is $640,209 for the base year.  Total estimated value is approximately $3.4M .4.  Identification of the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition.FAR 6.302-5, Authorized or Required by Statute and 38 U.S.C. 8153(a)(3)(A) provides:"If the health-care resource required is a commercial service, the use of medical equipment or space, or research, and is to be acquired from an institution affiliated with the Department in accordance with section 7302 of this title, including medical practice groups and other entities associated with affiliated institutions, blood banks, organ banks, or research centers, the Secretary may make arrangements for acquisition of the resource without regard to any law or regulation (including any Executive order, circular, or other administrative policy) that would otherwise require the use of competitive procedures for acquiring the resource."	48 CFR 873.104(a) provides:"Without regard to FAR Part 6, if the health-care resource required is a commercial service, the use of medical equipment or space, or research, and is to be acquired from an institution affiliated with the Department in accordance with section 7302 of title 38 U.S.C., including medical practice groups and other approved entities associated with affiliated institutions (entities will be approved if determined legally to be associated with affiliated institutions), or from blood banks, organ banks, or research centers, the resource may be acquired on a sole source basis."5.  Demonstration of the contractor's unique qualifications:The New England Healthcare Engineering Partnership (NEHCEP) located at VISN 1 and Boston VA Healthcare System has been created through special funding provided by the VHA Systems Redesign Program Office. The purpose of the VERC is to facilitate innovative solutions to health care delivery challenges identified by national, network, and facility leadership as well as to propose important opportunities for change and improvement.  Central to this award is to create partnerships with university engineering departments.  These faculty and students will work to provide engineering solutions to critical VA operational issues and will work closely with VA leadership, and clinical staff.  These university partnerships were developed and laid out in the proposal documents that were submitted prior to the award.  Now that our VERC has been awarded funding we are moving to establish the contracts with these universities so that the work can commence.  An Affiliation Agreement with Northeastern University has been signed.   Towards that end, NEHCEP requires an contract with Northeastern University to provide engineering expertise through its faculty and students, to the center as a whole, and for projects designated by NEHCEP leadership.  6.  Description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable, including whether a notice was or will be publicized as required by subpart 5.2 and, if not, which exception under 5.202 applies.	FAR 6.302-5, Authorized or Required by Statute7.  Determination by the contracting officer that the anticipated cost to the government will be fair and reasonable.	The costs are based on standard academic salaries and stipends for students which are set by the University, and these practices are in keeping with standards of practice in use at academic educational institutions.		A determination of fair and reasonable pricing will be made prior to award.8.  Description of the market survey conducted (i.e., names of firms and date(s) the firms were contacted) and the results or a statement of the reasons a market survey was not conducted.During the proposal development process VISN 1 solicited the involvement of universities and explored the interest of a large number of potential collaborators.  Ultimately, Northeastern University, Worcester Polytechnic Institute and MIT were identified as the most suitable academic partners.9.  Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition, such as an explanation why technical data packages, specifications, or engineering descriptions, statements of work, or purchase descriptions suitable for full and open competition have not been developed or are not available.The VA and NEHCEP will be working with multiple academic institutions, Northeastern University, Worcester Polytechnic Institute, and MIT.10.  A listing of the sources, if any that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition.The VA and NEHCEP will be working with multiple academic institutions, Northeastern University, Worcester Polytechnic Institute, and MIT.11.  A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required.The VA and NEHCEP may solicit additional universities in the future as the work expands.  This is one of the goals of the Veteran's Engineering Resource Centers.

A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.<br />Listed End Product Listed Countries of Origin <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />(2) Certification.

<DESC><p>tThe current Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) System at the Ronald Reagan Building in the Customs and Border Protection space utilizes outdated technology and is in need of an upgrade to facilitate better use of current technology. A system upgrade will allow greater system and monitoring flexibility by use of Internet technology. The use of internet technology will eliminate the need for the use of a Digital Video Recorder (DVR) Keyboard Video Mouse (KVM) matrix switch, analog CCTV matrix switcher, Pan Tilt Zoom (PTZ) controller, and analog CCTV monitors. The tasks of the obsolete equipment will be accomplished through a TCP/IP scheme with standard office computers with specialized video management software. The use of standard office computers and flat screen monitors will greatly reduce the space currently occupied by obsolete analog equipment. The use of TCP/IP will allow the CCTV system cameras to be viewed from anywhere on the CBP computer network. This will allow the monitoring of pertinent cameras by guard personnel in remote or outlying post where network connections are available.</p>

<DESC><p>The purpose of this modification is to include a question and answer section requested from vendors:
<p>1. Will the contractor get a copy of the current database to work with, including the followings;<br />a. tables<br />b. queries<br />c. views<br />d. reports<br />e. forms</p>
<p>ANS: Winning vendor will get a copy of the complete database including tables, queries, views, reports, and forms</p>
<p>2. For the quote can you tell us the following;<br />a. How many tables are in the database? ANS: 946<br />b. How many reports? ANS: 456<br />c. How many forms? ANS: 204</p>
<p>3. Who is the incumbent on this contract and will the incumbent be submitting a quote?<br />ANS: Application developed years ago in-house. No incumbent.</p>
<p>4.) Is a database entity relationship diagram available? If not, how many tables are in the database? <br />ANS: No database entity relationship diagram available. Total of 946 tables<br /><br />5.) Can the database contents be exported to a text file (preferably, XML)? Does this ability exist today? <br />ANS: No. To our knowledge, Paradox 8 did not have this capability.<br /><br />6.) Are there any "errors" in the current database, such as broken links, etc? <br />ANS: No.<br /><br />7.) Does the conversion involve any database cleanup? <br />ANS: Not that we are aware of.<br /><br />8.) Can the server be upgraded to Windows Server 2008? <br />ANS: Scope specifies 2008 server<br /><br />9.) What are the plans to upgrade the clients to Windows 7?<br />ANS: No plans. If it does happen, it will be YEARS before the USAF deploys it.</p>
<p>10.) How many forms are there in the present application? Can screen-shots be provided of these forms? <br />ANS: 204 Forms.</p>
<p>11.) Is there a firewall between the end-user client computers and the database server? If so, can that firewall be configured to pass arbitrary types of traffic (eg, SQL Server)? <br />ANS: Firewalls are everywhere. Database data exchange occurs frequently between PCs and servers. <br /><br />12.) Is there a LAN (10Mbps or faster) between the client computers and the server? Or does the connection between client and server traverse any slower-speed (eg, WAN) links? <br />ANS: The base LAN (10Mbps or faster) connects all PCs with servers.<br /><br />13.) Is "remote" or "portable device" (PDA, etc) access to the application needed, or will it be needed in the future? <br />ANS: No, not at this time.<br /><br />14.) How many concurrent users will there be?<br />ANS: No more than 40 users</p>
<p>15.) Will the application need to integrate with an existing access control "security" system (Windows Active Directory, etc)? If not, should the application implement its own user definitions and administration?<br />ANS: Windows Active Directory security would be preferable.</p>
<p>16.) Will there be a database administrator available to perform ongoing database "tuning" activities, such as database index reorg/rebuild? If not, should this be provided as part of the bid?<br />ANS: Yes, to some degree. The bid should not include database support.</p>
<p>17.) Do various users of the application have different levels of "permissions" (access to data, forms or application functionality)? Will this be needed in the future?<br />ANS: Yes for both questions.</p>
<p>18.) Will there be a system administrator who will define which users have the various levels of access? Should there be administrative forms included as part of the application to perform this activity?<br />ANS: Yes, there will be a system administrator to define users. It would be preferable if the application had administrative forms.</p>
<p>19.) Do users have administrative access in order to install software on their own computers?<br />ANS: NO. Administrative access is strictly enforced. Users do not have local drive write permissions or access to the registry.</p>
<p>20. Is there a preference of web-based versus ms access? Is one easier to support by your organization?<br />ANS: At this point, no preference. However, it will difficult to design a web-based application that is easily user-modifiable. We do not have web programmers within the squadron to make modifications to the web code. Access front-ends are easy to modify and we have several people onsite who can make these modifications in Access. MS Access 2007 is also loaded on all AF PCs.</p>
<p>21. Is there someone onsite to maintain web-based applications versus MS Access?<br />ANS: No onsite programmers for web-based applications.</p>
<p>22. If web-based is selected can the solution be hosted offsite?<br />ANS: Absolutely NO. Must reside on secure AF network (non-classified).</p>
<p>23. What are the security requirements that will be needed to comply with?<br />ANS: AF networks are highly secure in nature and many web-based tools for web display are NOT allowed for use including flash players, ActiveX controls, and certain Java scripting. AF group policy strictly enforces these regulations.</p>
<p>24. What is the budget for this endeavor?</p>
<p>ANS: Cannot disclose during the proposal period.</p>

If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible contracting officer.  However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

<DESC>Solicitation W911QY-10-T-0001:  Questions and Answers<BR><BR>Q)  Since this is part of an R&D project that utilizes a refrigerated TriCon container, is this the preferred or commonly used storage/ transport format being used by the end-user?<BR><BR>A)  The Combat Feeding Program focuses on development of refrigerated storage containers in TriCon, QuadCon and 8' x 8' x 20' ISO sizes.  And we may eventually be looking at BiCons.  Two temperature realms are typical: freezer and refrigerator (38F).  <BR><BR>The end user (our troops) in fact employ all sizes of containers, because they lease or purchase local assets, or the assets are provided by a contractor as part of a larger service.  These include everything from household-sized refrigerators, to 15' refer trucks, to 40' freezer trailers dropped onsite.<BR><BR>Q)  I assume that since the TriCon is used that there is some level of acceptance and use of intermodal containers, which utilize common standards of construction and usage, and incorporate enhanced interoperability (due to their ANSI/ISO corner fittings and forklift pockets).<BR><BR>A)  Yes, all military containers must conform to ISO standards, for all the same reasons shipping companies have agreed to the standard.  There might be additional military requirements, but these are written so as not to interfere with ISO compatibility even while they provide greater capability.<BR><BR>Q)  Is the M1 Flatrack used in the scope of your operation?<BR><BR>A)  I'm unsure this question is relevant to this solicitation.  Assets other than the solar-array shelter itself will not always be available when the array is set up; therefore, the array should not rely on other assets.  As for transporting the array, it should be possible to transport the array with any commonly available trailer -- military or commercial -- but providing that asset is not your responsibility.<BR><BR>Q)  If the M1 Flatrack is not an option, are there preferred or common modes of storage and that are used (TriCon containers, trailers with ball hitches or pintle hitches, etc)? My goal is to reduce the complexity and expense of a configuration by utilizing existing transport/ storage methods, without reinventing the wheel.<BR><BR>A)  This line of questioning appears to be irrelevant to the solicitation.  The solicitation is for a solar-array shelter only.  It is not for the TriCon refrigeration system or methods of transporting the array or the array storage system.  If I misunderstand where you are going with this, please feel free to rephrase.<BR><BR>Unrelated to this solicitation, you might find it interesting to know that one of our newest refrigerated assets -- the Multi-Temperature Refrigerated Container System (MTRCS) -- is fitted with structure to utilize a Heavy Expanded Mobility Tactical Truck (HEMTT) loading system.

<br />Vectren Natural Gas Company (Vectren) supplies odorized natural gas to Wright-Patterson AFB via a Government-wide supply contact administered by Defense Energy Support Center (DESC) through 14 metered delivery points located throughout WPAFB. A regulator, meter and valve station is located at each delivery point. The equipment at each delivery point is owned, operated and maintained by Vectren. In addition to the normal natural gas requirements on Base, the natural gas system also supplies fuel to two compressed natural gas (CNG) facilities for the Base's CNG vehicle fleet. The CNG stations are located in Areas B and C but are specifically excluded from Utility Privatization. <br />Gas distribution pressure ranges from 8 pounds per square inch gauge (psig) to 45-psig. <br />The gas is distributed throughout the Base through approximately 31 miles of underground pipelines. These lines are owned, operated and maintained by the Base, except for some privatized housing service laterals. Many of these lines are polyethylene (PE) pipe with tracer wire. The balance of the pipe is coated and wrapped steel and originally protected by a cathodic protection system utilizing sacrificial anodes. Pipe is typically buried at a minimum of three feet below the surface. The Wright-Patterson AFB gas distribution system has undergone significant replacement projects in the last 20 to 30 years. When it is necessary to add or replace lines, due to new construction or repair, PE pipe is usually the material of choice.<br />A generalized system assessment was conducted with Base engineering, operation and maintenance personnel. For assessment purposes, the Base was subdivided into 14 areas, generally around delivery/meter points and areas of similar age and condition. Base-wide, the coated and wrapped steel pipe system was protected by a cathodic protection system, which utilizes sacrificial anodes unless otherwise noted. Pipe failures do not seem to be a problem in any of the areas. Summaries of the condition assessments are as follows: <br />&bull; Meter Point (MP) 1, serving the northern portion of Area B, was the oldest gas system on Base but has undergone significant upgrades. The coated and wrapped steel pipe was originally installed around 1943 and is thought to be in average to poor condition. Over half of the pipe downstream from this meter point was replaced around 2001. The older plug valves in this area of the system are considered to be in average to poor condition. The 25-&not;psig distribution system pressure is adequate and serves facilities primarily utilized for research. The gas system served by this meter point is an isolated system and is not connected to distribution piping served by other delivery points. <br />&bull; MP 2 is also located in the northern portion of Area B. It serves an incinerator and an occupational health clinic. The pressure for this part of the system has a 25-psig pressure. The coated and wrapped steel pipe and plug valves were installed in 1947 and are thought to be in average condition. Approximately 40 percent of the pipe has been replaced in the last 15 years. This section of the gas system is also isolated from other sections of the distribution system. <br />&bull; MP 3 is located in the north central portion of Area B and serves research facilities. Much of this system was replaced in 1985 and consists of PE pipe and plug valves, which are considered to be in good condition. Piping was installed with tracer wire and warning tape. The distribution pressure in this portion of the system is 40-psig. This is also an isolated gas system. A major replacement project occurred in 2002 replacing lines along Skyline Drive. <br />&bull; MP 4 is located in Area B and serves the National Museum of the United States Air Force at Wright Field. The polyethylene (PE) pipe and plug valves were installed in 2000 and are considered to be in good condition. The gas pressure is 10-psig. The gas lines were recently extended to serve an additional hangar facility at the museum in 2004. <br />&bull; MP 5 serves The Prairies at Wright Field housing area, located west of Area B. The PE pipe and plug valves were installed in 1984 and upgraded during 2003 in some areas as part of the housing privatization initiative. Tracer wire and warning tape are in place; piping is considered to be good condition with a pressure of 25-psig. This is a looped system and pressure is not a problem. A normally closed Vectren valve is located on the north side of the housing area and provides an emergency backup source of gas for The Prairies housing area. <br />&bull; MP 6 serves only the school in The Prairies housing area with three-inch PE pipe. The gas pressure is 25 psig.<br />&bull; MP 7 (National Road Metering Station) is located on the east side of Area B and serves facilities located along the east boundary of Area B. The coated and wrapped steel pipe and plug valves were installed in 1950 and are considered to be in average condition. This section has a gas pressure of 25-psig. It is estimated that 100 percent of the pipe has been replaced in the last 15 years. As pipe is replaced, it is replaced with PE piping with tracer wire and warning tape. This is another isolated system consisting of several dead-end lines and one gas source serving primarily office buildings. A new childcare center and Air Force Institute of Technology building are also served by this sub-system. <br />&bull; MP 8 serves The Woods at Wright Field housing area, located east of Area B and south of Area C. The PE pipe and plug valves were installed in 1970 and are considered to be in good condition with a gas pressure of 45-psig. No significant sections of pipe have been replaced in the last 15 years. The regulators are considered to be in average condition. This is a looped system and pressure is not a problem. During the installation of the PE pipe, tracer wire and warning tape were not installed which makes locating the pipe extremely difficult and increases the chances of line damage when excavation is taking place in this area. <br />&bull; MP 9 is located on the north edge of The Woods housing area and serves only a heat plant, located near the meter point. The coated and wrapped steel pipe and plug valves were installed in 1991 and are considered to be in excellent condition. The system pressure at the heat plant is 35-psig. The cathodic protection for this section of pipe was also installed in 1991. <br />&bull; MP 10 is located on the south boundary of Area A and serves Area A. The coated and wrapped steel pipe and plug valves were originally installed in 1970 and are considered to be in average condition with a gas pressure of 8-psig. An estimated 25 percent of the pipe has been replaced in the past 15 years. The gas distribution system in this area primarily serves office buildings in the west portion and MFH in the east portion of Area A. Gas lines from Vectren MP 11, serving Area C, are also connected to this distribution system in the Area A Housing. A recent project was completed to replace a section of 4-inch steel piping with 6-inch piping and an upgrade of the regulators serving this section resulting in reduced operational problems. A section line along Communications Blvd. was replaced in 2000. Most recently, the entire system in the housing area known as The Bricks was replaced in 2003 with PE pipe; tracer wire and warning tape was also installed. <br />&bull; MP 11 is located near Gate 35C on the east side of Area C and serves Area C. The PE pipe and plug valves were installed in 1980 and are considered to be in good condition. The distribution pressure in this area of the system is 8-psig and serves a combination of office, industrial, and flight-line hanger facilities. The distribution system in Area C is a looped system and is also interconnected with the distribution system serving Area A, which provides a second source of gas for Area C. No facilities are currently being planned which will significantly increase the gas demand in Area C. <br />&bull; MP 12 is located along the east boundary of Area C and serves the West Ramp Area. In 1993, approximately 3500 linear feet of 6-inch PE pipe was installed from MP12, along the east boundary of Area C and into the West Ramp area. The pipe is considered to be in good condition with a gas pressure of 8-psig, and was installed with tracer wire and warning tape. This is a radial system that is isolated from other systems serving the Installation. <br />&bull; MP 13 is located along the east boundary of the Kittyhawk Center, which is in the northeast portion of the Installation. The coated and wrapped steel lines date back to 1943 and are in poor condition. All pipes in this area were replaced in 1999/2000. This portion of the gas system is isolated from the other distribution systems and serves facilities that range from office to small industrial type facilities. This section of the system has a gas pressure of 8-psig. <br />&bull; MP 14 is located at the southwest corner of the Kittyhawk Center and serves only one heat plant. The 8-inch PE line was installed in 1994 with tracer wire and warning tape and is considered to be in excellent condition. This system is isolated from the other distribution systems.<br />There is currently an active cathodic protection program at the Base. This program is cognizant of many problems in the system such as inadequate insulation unions and flanges, PE pipe sections installed between metal pipes without jumper wires, and old anode beds that cannot be located. The gas distribution system has both sacrificial anode and impressed current cathodic protection systems. Generally, the sacrificial anode systems are associated with steel pipe. Installation technicians are more concerned about sections of steel pipe in Area B, primarily because soil conditions are more corrosive than in Areas A and C. <br />There is no Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system or Energy Monitoring and Control System (EMCS) included in the natural gas privatization package.<br />There are no natural gas components to be privatized at either the Huffman Radar Site or the Kauffman Avenue Switching Station.

<p><br />Wright-Paterson AFB receives water from two primary sources: on-base wells and off-base supply from Montgomery County Water District. An emergency supply is also available from the City of Fairborn.<br />The Mad River Aquifer is the primary source of water for the on-base wells at Wright-Patterson AFB. Water quality from all the wells requires on-site treatment and is classified as very hard with a median hardness concentration of 378 milligrams per liter (mg/l), as reported in the 1994 Long-Range Water Plan. High Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) levels are also present, with most wells exceeding the 500 mg/l TDS Secondary Maximum Contaminant Level (SMCL) set by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency (OEPA). The wells currently used are generally below the 0.3 mg/l OEPA SMCL for iron and 0.05 mg/l OEPA SMCL for manganese. <br />The active wells with finished depth ranging from about 50 to 90 feet provide the primary supply for potable water and fire protection. Originally constructed in the early 1940s, the wells have received periodic upgrades with the most recent major project occurring in 1994/1995. This project replaced motors and pumps in each of the wells with submersible pumps ranging from 40 to 125 horsepower (HP). All wells are metered at the wellhead and nine wells are located inside dedicated structures primarily constructed of brick or cinder block. The wellheads for Nos. 8 and 9, in addition to the inactive wells, are located underground and do not have dedicated buildings. <br />Wells in each area supply the individual water needs for their respective distribution systems. Areas A and C are adjacent to each other, Area B is separated from Areas A and C by a major state highway, State Route (SR) 444. The Woods at Wright Field housing area is supplied from Area B and The Prairies at Wright Field housing area is served by water purchased from Montgomery County.<br />Secondary water sourcing for Areas A and C is provided by the City of Fairborn through two six-inched metered lines connecting to the east side of Area C near Gate 35C. <br />Area A is serviced by two wells, Wells 8 and 9, which have a maximum combined production capacity of 1,900 gallons per minute (gpm) or 2.74 million gallons per day (mgd). These wells are located in underground vaults and share an emergency back-up generator. Area B is serviced by four wells, Well nos. 1, 2 (well 2 has two pumps 2a &amp;2b, which share the same well), 4 and 5, which have a maximum combined production capacity of 6,400 gpm or 9.3 mgd. However, Area B treatment capacity is limited to 4,000 gpm or 5.8 mgd. Area B wells each have dedicated well house structures. Area C is serviced by four wells, Well nos. 1, 2, 3 and 7, which have a maximum combined capacity of 3,400 gpm or 4.90 mgd. Area C wells also have dedicated well house structures.<br />The East Wellfield is located in Area C but serves Area B and contains Wells A, B, E and F, which are currently not in operation due to high levels of iron, manganese, total dissolved solids and relative hardness. The East Wellfield has significant potential productivity with a rated combined pumping capacity of 7,330 gpm or 10.5 mgd. Wells A, B, C, E and F are located in underground vaults. These wells are included as part of the UP solicitation and could be incorporated into the active system at a future date, with appropriate treatment, to meet any increase in demand but are currently limited by Area B treatment capacity.<br />Water Treatment <br />Each of the three Areas of the Base (Areas A, B and C) has a separate water treatment facility. The Areas use the same treatment processes and are operated in the same manner. The treatment process performs the following functions: <br />&bull; VOC removal<br />&bull; Scaling control<br />&bull; Disinfection<br />&bull; Fluoridation<br />&bull; Softening (for family housing areas)</p>
<p>Water Storage <br />Wright-Patterson AFB has a mixture of ground level and elevated water storage facilities in each area of the installation. As with other elements of the distribution systems, each area independently operates its own pumps, ground level storage and elevated storage. All of the pump houses have electrically powered pumps for normal daily usage. Each elevated storage tank uses impressed current cathodic protection.<br />Area A storage is provided by two ground storage reservoirs and the elevated Tower 6. The ground storage reservoirs consist of two 375,000 gallon circular, concrete facilities originally constructed in 2009. These reservoirs are co-located with the Area A air strippers and share a fenced enclosure. Tower 6 is a 250,000 gallon elevated steel tank constructed in 1984 and last painted in 1997. <br />Area B storage is provided by three ground storage reservoirs and three elevated steel tanks. The ground storage reservoirs consist of three circular, concrete facilities of 250,000, 300,000 and 370,000-gallon capacity. Two were originally constructed in 1943, roofs were added in 1997. The third 300,000 gallon reservoir was constructed in 2009 with the 1997 roof reinstalled on it. These reservoirs are located near the Area B pumping station. "High Service" Tower 8 serves the high pressure zone and has a 250,000 gallon capacity. "Fire Towers" 2 and 9 serve the domestic water system and have a 500,000 and 200,000 gallon capacity, respectively. <br />Area C storage is provided by one ground storage reservoir, No. 6, the elevated Tower 7 and "SAC" Tower 10. Consisting of a circular, concrete 300,000-gallon ground storage tank, Reservoir 6 was originally constructed in 1949 and a new roof was added in 1997. Tower 7 is a 200,000-gallon elevated steel tank constructed in 1996. Tower 10 is a 150,000-gallon elevated steel tank constructed in 1960 and last painted in 1997. <br />Net storage capacity includes 1.0 million gallons (MG) in Area A, 1.87 MG in Area B, and 0.65 MG in Area C for a total Base-wide storage capacity of 3.52 MG.<br />Water Distribution <br />The original distribution system was constructed in the 1940s (with some pipe installed prior to the 1940s) using cast iron as the dominant pipe material. Newer lines are ductile iron or PVC pipe. Small amounts of other pipe materials are present in smaller diameters. Depth of burial of distribution lines ranges from four to eight feet. Generally, tracer wire or marker tape has not been effectively installed with non-metallic pipe during initial installation or replacement projects. <br />The water system for Areas A and C are usually operated independently. A small four-inch main connecting the two areas is normally open; however, this provides minimal hydraulic interconnection. Other larger interconnecting water mains are normally kept closed but could be opened should the need arise. <br />The Area A distribution system was originally constructed in the 1940s, is primarily cast iron pipe, and is considered to be in average condition. The system is generally looped with a few dead-end lines. <br />Area A Pumping Station 10855 consists of three 150 hp pumps capable of pumping 6,900 gpm. One pump is a variable frequency drive (VFD) pump able to pump directly into the distribution system. The pumps were last replaced in 2001. This building also contains the water lab for sample testing. The facility has an on-site, 450 kW back-up generator installed in 2001.<br />The Area C distribution system was originally constructed in the 1940s and originally consisted of cast iron pipe. Base maintenance personnel rate the distribution system to be average. 30-40% of the pipe and 40-50% of the valves have been replaced in the past 20 years.<br />Area C Pumping Station 30172 consists of three 100 hp pumps, one of which is a back-up, capable of pumping 3,000 gpm. Three 225 hp dedicated fire pumps are also located in this building and are included in the utility privatization solicitation. The domestic pumps were installed in 1989. <br />The Area B distribution system was originally constructed in the 1940s. The distribution piping consists of a mixture of cast iron, asbestos cement, and PVC. Base maintenance personnel rate the distribution system in Area B as being in good condition. <br />Area B Pumping Station 20085a consists of two 150 hp pumps (with a third back up pump) capable of pumping 2,000 gpm feeding the High Zone and two 50 hp pumps capable of pumping 3,500 gpm feeding the Low Zone. One pump in the High Zone is a VFD pump able to pump directly into the distribution system. The pumps were last replaced in 1996. The facility has a 500 kW back-up generator installed in 1996. <br />Pump Stations<br />The East Wellfield, currently inactive, is connected to the Area B reservoirs via a 24-inch pipe which crosses SR 444. While the East Wellfield is located in Area C, there is no existing connection between these wells and either Area A or Area C. <br />The Kittyhawk and West Ramp distribution systems were originally installed around 1955 using cast iron pipe. Base maintenance personnel rate the systems to be in average condition. The fire pressure at the West Ramp is less than the pressure in the other areas of the Base due to its distance from the Main Base. <br />Two housing areas on the perimeter of the Main Base are The Prairies and The Woods. While Wright-Patterson AFB owns and maintains the water distribution systems serving these areas, The Prairies receive their water from the Montgomery County Water District. The Woods receives its water from the Area B water system. Numerous projects have been completed in The Prairies over recent years through housing privatization projects causing the replacement and relocation of parts of the distribution system. The service laterals in these two housing areas are no longer owned by the Air Force and are excluded from the utility privatization solicitation and some of the distribution mains in the Prairies are excluded.<br />Wright-Patterson AFB has no Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system or Energy Monitoring Control System (EMCS) to be included in the water distribution system privatization package. <br />GSUs<br />Huffman Radar Site has a domestic-sized water well, pump, pressure tank, and connecting piping that provides for the site's minimal water requirements. Kauffman Avenue 69kV Switching Station has no water components.</p>

<br />Vectren Natural Gas Company (Vectren) supplies odorized natural gas to Wright-Patterson AFB via a Government-wide supply contact administered by Defense Energy Support Center (DESC) through 14 metered delivery points located throughout WPAFB. A regulator, meter and valve station is located at each delivery point. The equipment at each delivery point is owned, operated and maintained by Vectren. In addition to the normal natural gas requirements on Base, the natural gas system also supplies fuel to two compressed natural gas (CNG) facilities for the Base's CNG vehicle fleet. The CNG stations are located in Areas B and C but are specifically excluded from Utility Privatization. <br />Gas distribution pressure ranges from 8 pounds per square inch gauge (psig) to 45-psig. <br />The gas is distributed throughout the Base through approximately 31 miles of underground pipelines. These lines are owned, operated and maintained by the Base, except for some privatized housing service laterals. Many of these lines are polyethylene (PE) pipe with tracer wire. The balance of the pipe is coated and wrapped steel and originally protected by a cathodic protection system utilizing sacrificial anodes. Pipe is typically buried at a minimum of three feet below the surface. The Wright-Patterson AFB gas distribution system has undergone significant replacement projects in the last 20 to 30 years. When it is necessary to add or replace lines, due to new construction or repair, PE pipe is usually the material of choice.<br />A generalized system assessment was conducted with Base engineering, operation and maintenance personnel. For assessment purposes, the Base was subdivided into 14 areas, generally around delivery/meter points and areas of similar age and condition. Base-wide, the coated and wrapped steel pipe system was protected by a cathodic protection system, which utilizes sacrificial anodes unless otherwise noted. Pipe failures do not seem to be a problem in any of the areas. Summaries of the condition assessments are as follows: <br />&bull; Meter Point (MP) 1, serving the northern portion of Area B, was the oldest gas system on Base but has undergone significant upgrades. The coated and wrapped steel pipe was originally installed around 1943 and is thought to be in average to poor condition. Over half of the pipe downstream from this meter point was replaced around 2001. The older plug valves in this area of the system are considered to be in average to poor condition. The 25-&not;psig distribution system pressure is adequate and serves facilities primarily utilized for research. The gas system served by this meter point is an isolated system and is not connected to distribution piping served by other delivery points. <br />&bull; MP 2 is also located in the northern portion of Area B. It serves an incinerator and an occupational health clinic. The pressure for this part of the system has a 25-psig pressure. The coated and wrapped steel pipe and plug valves were installed in 1947 and are thought to be in average condition. Approximately 40 percent of the pipe has been replaced in the last 15 years. This section of the gas system is also isolated from other sections of the distribution system. <br />&bull; MP 3 is located in the north central portion of Area B and serves research facilities. Much of this system was replaced in 1985 and consists of PE pipe and plug valves, which are considered to be in good condition. Piping was installed with tracer wire and warning tape. The distribution pressure in this portion of the system is 40-psig. This is also an isolated gas system. A major replacement project occurred in 2002 replacing lines along Skyline Drive. <br />&bull; MP 4 is located in Area B and serves the National Museum of the United States Air Force at Wright Field. The polyethylene (PE) pipe and plug valves were installed in 2000 and are considered to be in good condition. The gas pressure is 10-psig. The gas lines were recently extended to serve an additional hangar facility at the museum in 2004. <br />&bull; MP 5 serves The Prairies at Wright Field housing area, located west of Area B. The PE pipe and plug valves were installed in 1984 and upgraded during 2003 in some areas as part of the housing privatization initiative. Tracer wire and warning tape are in place; piping is considered to be good condition with a pressure of 25-psig. This is a looped system and pressure is not a problem. A normally closed Vectren valve is located on the north side of the housing area and provides an emergency backup source of gas for The Prairies housing area. <br />&bull; MP 6 serves only the school in The Prairies housing area with three-inch PE pipe. The gas pressure is 25 psig.<br />&bull; MP 7 (National Road Metering Station) is located on the east side of Area B and serves facilities located along the east boundary of Area B. The coated and wrapped steel pipe and plug valves were installed in 1950 and are considered to be in average condition. This section has a gas pressure of 25-psig. It is estimated that 100 percent of the pipe has been replaced in the last 15 years. As pipe is replaced, it is replaced with PE piping with tracer wire and warning tape. This is another isolated system consisting of several dead-end lines and one gas source serving primarily office buildings. A new childcare center and Air Force Institute of Technology building are also served by this sub-system. <br />&bull; MP 8 serves The Woods at Wright Field housing area, located east of Area B and south of Area C. The PE pipe and plug valves were installed in 1970 and are considered to be in good condition with a gas pressure of 45-psig. No significant sections of pipe have been replaced in the last 15 years. The regulators are considered to be in average condition. This is a looped system and pressure is not a problem. During the installation of the PE pipe, tracer wire and warning tape were not installed which makes locating the pipe extremely difficult and increases the chances of line damage when excavation is taking place in this area. <br />&bull; MP 9 is located on the north edge of The Woods housing area and serves only a heat plant, located near the meter point. The coated and wrapped steel pipe and plug valves were installed in 1991 and are considered to be in excellent condition. The system pressure at the heat plant is 35-psig. The cathodic protection for this section of pipe was also installed in 1991. <br />&bull; MP 10 is located on the south boundary of Area A and serves Area A. The coated and wrapped steel pipe and plug valves were originally installed in 1970 and are considered to be in average condition with a gas pressure of 8-psig. An estimated 25 percent of the pipe has been replaced in the past 15 years. The gas distribution system in this area primarily serves office buildings in the west portion and MFH in the east portion of Area A. Gas lines from Vectren MP 11, serving Area C, are also connected to this distribution system in the Area A Housing. A recent project was completed to replace a section of 4-inch steel piping with 6-inch piping and an upgrade of the regulators serving this section resulting in reduced operational problems. A section line along Communications Blvd. was replaced in 2000. Most recently, the entire system in the housing area known as The Bricks was replaced in 2003 with PE pipe; tracer wire and warning tape was also installed. <br />&bull; MP 11 is located near Gate 35C on the east side of Area C and serves Area C. The PE pipe and plug valves were installed in 1980 and are considered to be in good condition. The distribution pressure in this area of the system is 8-psig and serves a combination of office, industrial, and flight-line hanger facilities. The distribution system in Area C is a looped system and is also interconnected with the distribution system serving Area A, which provides a second source of gas for Area C. No facilities are currently being planned which will significantly increase the gas demand in Area C. <br />&bull; MP 12 is located along the east boundary of Area C and serves the West Ramp Area. In 1993, approximately 3500 linear feet of 6-inch PE pipe was installed from MP12, along the east boundary of Area C and into the West Ramp area. The pipe is considered to be in good condition with a gas pressure of 8-psig, and was installed with tracer wire and warning tape. This is a radial system that is isolated from other systems serving the Installation. <br />&bull; MP 13 is located along the east boundary of the Kittyhawk Center, which is in the northeast portion of the Installation. The coated and wrapped steel lines date back to 1943 and are in poor condition. All pipes in this area were replaced in 1999/2000. This portion of the gas system is isolated from the other distribution systems and serves facilities that range from office to small industrial type facilities. This section of the system has a gas pressure of 8-psig. <br />&bull; MP 14 is located at the southwest corner of the Kittyhawk Center and serves only one heat plant. The 8-inch PE line was installed in 1994 with tracer wire and warning tape and is considered to be in excellent condition. This system is isolated from the other distribution systems.<br />There is currently an active cathodic protection program at the Base. This program is cognizant of many problems in the system such as inadequate insulation unions and flanges, PE pipe sections installed between metal pipes without jumper wires, and old anode beds that cannot be located. The gas distribution system has both sacrificial anode and impressed current cathodic protection systems. Generally, the sacrificial anode systems are associated with steel pipe. Installation technicians are more concerned about sections of steel pipe in Area B, primarily because soil conditions are more corrosive than in Areas A and C. <br />There is no Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system or Energy Monitoring and Control System (EMCS) included in the natural gas privatization package.<br />There are no natural gas components to be privatized at either the Huffman Radar Site or the Kauffman Avenue Switching Station.

<br />The wastewater collection system at Wright-Patterson AFB consists of collection piping, manholes, cleanout T's and lift stations. There is no wastewater treatment facility at the Base. All wastewater generated at WPAFB is treated by either the City of Dayton or the City of Fairborn. The City of Dayton treats most of the wastewater from WPAFB. <br />The wastewater generated in the West Ramp area and all Facilities north and west of the intersection of Skeel Avenue and Xenia Drive, except for Facilities 30138, 30140, and 30143, flows into the City of Fairborn mains that run through the north side of the Base. Wastewater from Buildings 891 and 892 and any overflow from Lift Station 31440 flow into the City of Fairborn line that enters WPAFB near the intersection of State Highway Route 444 and Davis-Monthan Road. The wastewater flows are not metered regularly, and the City of Fairborn charges WPAFB a contracted fee based on estimated flow. The wastewater quantity is calculated from 100% of the potable water usage. <br />All wastewater from the other areas of WPAFB is conveyed to the City of Dayton. The wastewater collection system transports the effluent to two (2) main discharge points adjacent to the west of Area B. Wastewater from Areas A and C is pumped by Lift Station 30117 into a 20-inch 12,300-foot HDPE force main that proceeds southwest along Novick Road. Force main 1440 from Area A and force main 7000 from the Woods MFH (formerly Woodland Hills MFH) feed into this 20-inch main. Wastewater from Area C buildings between Communications Boulevard and Davis-Monthan Road is served by Lift Station 31440. Lift Station 31440 pumps the wastewater through an eight-inch force main into the 20-inch force main. Woods MFH area wastewater flows to Lift Station 27000, which pumps across State Route 444 through a six-inch force main into the 20-inch force main of Lift Station 30117. The 20-inch force main, after exiting Area C, discharges to Manhole 29L and from thereon becomes a gravity line. The 20 inch then changes to a 24-inch gravity main. The 24-inch gravity main runs along Springfield Pike and then changes to a back and forth from a 27 inch to a 24 inch (dependent on slope) east of Bong Street. This gravity main is approximately 12,000 feet in total length and terminates in a City of Dayton manhole approximately 200 feet south of Springfield Pike on Smithville Road. A portion of the 20-inch force main and most of the gravity line is outside WPAFB property. The force and gravity lines are operated and maintained by Base personnel and WPAFB has been granted an easement for the line. Wastewater from Area B is conveyed to the City of Dayton through either the above-mentioned 27-inch gravity main, or a 15-inch main that exits the Base approximately 500 linear feet west of Bong Street. The 15-inch main transmits effluent generated from Area B. The wastewater flow is metered for a short test period once every three years by the City of Dayton. The City then bills WPAFB at a negotiated rate based on the metered flow for the next three years. <br />A Montgomery County sewer main (county main) runs along Colonel Glenn Highway north of Prairies MFH area (formerly called the Page Manor MFH area). The wastewater generated in Prairies MFH is discharged to the county main at multiple points on the north boundary. There is another Montgomery County sewer line that runs through the southeast corner of Prairies MFH. Prairies MFH discharges at two other points on this line. The entire flow goes to the City of Dayton for treatment. <br />Lift Stations <br />There are numerous wastewater system lift stations at Wright-Patterson AFB. Three are relatively large lift stations; the rest are smaller lift stations. <br />Lift Station 30117 is located in Area C and was constructed in 1988. The station is a wet well/dry well station. There are three pumps in this station each with a 175 horsepower (hp) motor drive. This lift station pumps the wastewater through a Base-owned 20-inch, 12,300-foot force main to Manhole 29L. The lift station is equipped with a 400 kW emergency generator to power the station during electrical outages. The pumps are automatically controlled by wet well water level, and have an emergency alarm that annunciates in the Energy Management Control System (EMCS) area. <br />Lift Station 27000, located in the Woods MFH area, and was constructed in 2000. It is a wet well station with two 15 hp submersible grinder pumps. The pumps are automatically controlled by the wet well water level. The lift station is equipped with an emergency generator and the emergency alarm signal that is sent to the EMCS system. The station discharges to a six-inch force main which is approximately 1,100 feet long. The force main passes under State Route 444 and discharges into the 20-inch force main from Lift Station 30117. <br />Lift Station 31440 is located in Area C of the Base and was upgraded in 2002. There are two 7.5 hp submersible pumps that operate by rising and falling water surfaces. There are no emergency alarms at the station and no emergency generator at this lift station. The lift station normally pumps through a 370-foot eight-inch force main to the 20-inch diameter force main from Lift Station 30117. If the flows to the station exceed pumping capacity, excess flow is diverted to the Fairborn gravity wastewater main via a 450-foot, 12-inch gravity line. <br />Lift Station 10854 has two submersible pumps and is located in Area A. This lift station has automatic controls with a local emergency alarm and is not equipped with an emergency generator. Lift Stations 30056, 30138, 30143, and 30152 are located in Area C. Lift station 30056 serves several buildings along the flight line while the other lift stations serve individual single facilities. Lift Stations 30056 and 30143 have local alarms; other lift stations do not have alarms. Each lift station has one or two submersible pumps, and do not have alarms nor emergency generators. <br />Wright-Patterson AFB does not have a wastewater Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system or EMCS to be included in the wastewater collection system privatization solicitation.<br />Wastewater Lines <br />The average depth of wastewater pipe at WPAFB is eight feet. Based on the area served, WPAFB wastewater system is sub-divided into eight areas. Each of the areas is discussed below. <br />The Area A wastewater system was installed in 1945. The lines are vitrified clay pipes and are in average condition. In the last 15 years, approximately 10 percent of the pipe has been upgraded by slip-lining, complete replacement, or point repairs. A few of the lines have less than the minimum required slope and a few have sags in the lines between manholes. Area A wastewater mains are flushed and cleaned every two years, or when a backup or stoppage occurs. Within Area A is the Bricks, Green Acres, and Pine Estates MFH areas; in these MFH areas, only the wastewater mains are included in the privatization action as mentioned before. Wastewater mains in the Bricks, Green Acres, and Pine Estates MFH areas are flushed and cleaned every six months, or when a backup or stoppage occurs.<br />Most of the wastewater piping in Area C is vitrified clay, installed in 1945, and is in average condition. Similar to Area A, a portion of the pipe is installed at less than minimum slope and some reaches of the pipe have sags in the line. Within the last 15 years approximately 10 percent of the pipe has been replaced. Area C wastewater mains are flushed and cleaned every two years, or when a backup or stoppage occurs. <br />In the Kittyhawk Center, the lines are vitrified clay pipes that were installed in 1955. Sections of the pipe have less than minimum slope and, in some cases, the sections have sags. In the last 15 years approximately 20 percent of the pipe has been replaced. The lines are considered to be in average condition. <br />The wastewater lines in the West Ramp area are also vitrified clay pipes that were installed in 1955. Within the last 15 years, approximately 20 percent of the pipe has been replaced. Sections of the piping have less than the minimum required slope and a portion of them have sags. The pipes in this area are in average condition. The pipes are flushed and cleaned every two years, or when a backup or stoppage occurs. <br />Area B was the first area constructed on the Base in the 1920s, and some lines in Area B were constructed in the 1940s. Some lines were for new facilities were added in the mid 1990s. The piping material is vitrified clay and it is in poor condition. There are problem areas where the pipe has less than a minimum slope. Within the last 15 years, approximately 5 percent of the pipe has been relined. The mains are flushed and cleaned annually. <br />The wastewater lines in the Prairies MFH area were installed in 1952. The buildings in this area were renovated. Some of the wastewater mains were replaced, some new lines were constructed, some old lines were abandoned and some of the old mains were reused. The older mains are vitrified clay pipes that are considered to be in average condition. Some sections of the pipe have less than minimum slope but the sections do not have any sag. The lines are flushed and cleaned every six months. The wastewater generated in this area is discharged into the Montgomery County sewer line at multiple points along the north side of the MFH area and at two points on the southwest part of this area. Within the Prairies MFH area is a trailer park area that has been abandoned. The wastewater mains in this section are PVC pipe installed in 1979. All sections of the pipe have slopes greater than the minimum requirement and have no sags. The pipes are considered to be in good condition and are flushed annually. As discussed previously, only the old wastewater mains, not installed and owned by the HP contractor, are included in the privatization package.<br />The Woods MFH area wastewater system was installed in 1972 with a combination of clay and PVC piping (approximately 90 percent of the pipe is PVC). The pipe sections are installed with adequate slopes and have no sags. There have been no replacements in the last 15 years. The pipes are flushed annually and are in good condition. As discussed previously, only the wastewater mains are included in the privatization package.<br />Generally, tracer wire or marker tape has not been effectively installed with non-metallic pipe during initial installation or replacement projects. <br />Manholes<br />Manholes are adequately located and are of either concrete or masonry/brick construction. The manholes in all of the WPAFB non-housing areas are in poor condition and the manhole covers are not watertight. The manholes in the Prairies MFH are in average condition; the manholes in Woods MFH area are in good condition. The manholes in these areas have watertight covers and are inspected regularly. Manholes installed prior to 1950 are assumed to be of masonary/brick construction. Manholes installed subsequent to 1950 are assumed to be of pre-cast concrete construction.

<p><br />Wright-Paterson AFB receives water from two primary sources: on-base wells and off-base supply from Montgomery County Water District. An emergency supply is also available from the City of Fairborn.<br />The Mad River Aquifer is the primary source of water for the on-base wells at Wright-Patterson AFB. Water quality from all the wells requires on-site treatment and is classified as very hard with a median hardness concentration of 378 milligrams per liter (mg/l), as reported in the 1994 Long-Range Water Plan. High Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) levels are also present, with most wells exceeding the 500 mg/l TDS Secondary Maximum Contaminant Level (SMCL) set by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency (OEPA). The wells currently used are generally below the 0.3 mg/l OEPA SMCL for iron and 0.05 mg/l OEPA SMCL for manganese. <br />The active wells with finished depth ranging from about 50 to 90 feet provide the primary supply for potable water and fire protection. Originally constructed in the early 1940s, the wells have received periodic upgrades with the most recent major project occurring in 1994/1995. This project replaced motors and pumps in each of the wells with submersible pumps ranging from 40 to 125 horsepower (HP). All wells are metered at the wellhead and nine wells are located inside dedicated structures primarily constructed of brick or cinder block. The wellheads for Nos. 8 and 9, in addition to the inactive wells, are located underground and do not have dedicated buildings. <br />Wells in each area supply the individual water needs for their respective distribution systems. Areas A and C are adjacent to each other, Area B is separated from Areas A and C by a major state highway, State Route (SR) 444. The Woods at Wright Field housing area is supplied from Area B and The Prairies at Wright Field housing area is served by water purchased from Montgomery County.<br />Secondary water sourcing for Areas A and C is provided by the City of Fairborn through two six-inched metered lines connecting to the east side of Area C near Gate 35C. <br />Area A is serviced by two wells, Wells 8 and 9, which have a maximum combined production capacity of 1,900 gallons per minute (gpm) or 2.74 million gallons per day (mgd). These wells are located in underground vaults and share an emergency back-up generator. Area B is serviced by four wells, Well nos. 1, 2 (well 2 has two pumps 2a &amp;2b, which share the same well), 4 and 5, which have a maximum combined production capacity of 6,400 gpm or 9.3 mgd. However, Area B treatment capacity is limited to 4,000 gpm or 5.8 mgd. Area B wells each have dedicated well house structures. Area C is serviced by four wells, Well nos. 1, 2, 3 and 7, which have a maximum combined capacity of 3,400 gpm or 4.90 mgd. Area C wells also have dedicated well house structures.<br />The East Wellfield is located in Area C but serves Area B and contains Wells A, B, E and F, which are currently not in operation due to high levels of iron, manganese, total dissolved solids and relative hardness. The East Wellfield has significant potential productivity with a rated combined pumping capacity of 7,330 gpm or 10.5 mgd. Wells A, B, C, E and F are located in underground vaults. These wells are included as part of the UP solicitation and could be incorporated into the active system at a future date, with appropriate treatment, to meet any increase in demand but are currently limited by Area B treatment capacity.<br />Water Treatment <br />Each of the three Areas of the Base (Areas A, B and C) has a separate water treatment facility. The Areas use the same treatment processes and are operated in the same manner. The treatment process performs the following functions: <br />&bull; VOC removal<br />&bull; Scaling control<br />&bull; Disinfection<br />&bull; Fluoridation<br />&bull; Softening (for family housing areas)</p>
<p>Water Storage <br />Wright-Patterson AFB has a mixture of ground level and elevated water storage facilities in each area of the installation. As with other elements of the distribution systems, each area independently operates its own pumps, ground level storage and elevated storage. All of the pump houses have electrically powered pumps for normal daily usage. Each elevated storage tank uses impressed current cathodic protection.<br />Area A storage is provided by two ground storage reservoirs and the elevated Tower 6. The ground storage reservoirs consist of two 375,000 gallon circular, concrete facilities originally constructed in 2009. These reservoirs are co-located with the Area A air strippers and share a fenced enclosure. Tower 6 is a 250,000 gallon elevated steel tank constructed in 1984 and last painted in 1997. <br />Area B storage is provided by three ground storage reservoirs and three elevated steel tanks. The ground storage reservoirs consist of three circular, concrete facilities of 250,000, 300,000 and 370,000-gallon capacity. Two were originally constructed in 1943, roofs were added in 1997. The third 300,000 gallon reservoir was constructed in 2009 with the 1997 roof reinstalled on it. These reservoirs are located near the Area B pumping station. "High Service" Tower 8 serves the high pressure zone and has a 250,000 gallon capacity. "Fire Towers" 2 and 9 serve the domestic water system and have a 500,000 and 200,000 gallon capacity, respectively. <br />Area C storage is provided by one ground storage reservoir, No. 6, the elevated Tower 7 and "SAC" Tower 10. Consisting of a circular, concrete 300,000-gallon ground storage tank, Reservoir 6 was originally constructed in 1949 and a new roof was added in 1997. Tower 7 is a 200,000-gallon elevated steel tank constructed in 1996. Tower 10 is a 150,000-gallon elevated steel tank constructed in 1960 and last painted in 1997. <br />Net storage capacity includes 1.0 million gallons (MG) in Area A, 1.87 MG in Area B, and 0.65 MG in Area C for a total Base-wide storage capacity of 3.52 MG.<br />Water Distribution <br />The original distribution system was constructed in the 1940s (with some pipe installed prior to the 1940s) using cast iron as the dominant pipe material. Newer lines are ductile iron or PVC pipe. Small amounts of other pipe materials are present in smaller diameters. Depth of burial of distribution lines ranges from four to eight feet. Generally, tracer wire or marker tape has not been effectively installed with non-metallic pipe during initial installation or replacement projects. <br />The water system for Areas A and C are usually operated independently. A small four-inch main connecting the two areas is normally open; however, this provides minimal hydraulic interconnection. Other larger interconnecting water mains are normally kept closed but could be opened should the need arise. <br />The Area A distribution system was originally constructed in the 1940s, is primarily cast iron pipe, and is considered to be in average condition. The system is generally looped with a few dead-end lines. <br />Area A Pumping Station 10855 consists of three 150 hp pumps capable of pumping 6,900 gpm. One pump is a variable frequency drive (VFD) pump able to pump directly into the distribution system. The pumps were last replaced in 2001. This building also contains the water lab for sample testing. The facility has an on-site, 450 kW back-up generator installed in 2001.<br />The Area C distribution system was originally constructed in the 1940s and originally consisted of cast iron pipe. Base maintenance personnel rate the distribution system to be average. 30-40% of the pipe and 40-50% of the valves have been replaced in the past 20 years.<br />Area C Pumping Station 30172 consists of three 100 hp pumps, one of which is a back-up, capable of pumping 3,000 gpm. Three 225 hp dedicated fire pumps are also located in this building and are included in the utility privatization solicitation. The domestic pumps were installed in 1989. <br />The Area B distribution system was originally constructed in the 1940s. The distribution piping consists of a mixture of cast iron, asbestos cement, and PVC. Base maintenance personnel rate the distribution system in Area B as being in good condition. <br />Area B Pumping Station 20085a consists of two 150 hp pumps (with a third back up pump) capable of pumping 2,000 gpm feeding the High Zone and two 50 hp pumps capable of pumping 3,500 gpm feeding the Low Zone. One pump in the High Zone is a VFD pump able to pump directly into the distribution system. The pumps were last replaced in 1996. The facility has a 500 kW back-up generator installed in 1996. <br />Pump Stations<br />The East Wellfield, currently inactive, is connected to the Area B reservoirs via a 24-inch pipe which crosses SR 444. While the East Wellfield is located in Area C, there is no existing connection between these wells and either Area A or Area C. <br />The Kittyhawk and West Ramp distribution systems were originally installed around 1955 using cast iron pipe. Base maintenance personnel rate the systems to be in average condition. The fire pressure at the West Ramp is less than the pressure in the other areas of the Base due to its distance from the Main Base. <br />Two housing areas on the perimeter of the Main Base are The Prairies and The Woods. While Wright-Patterson AFB owns and maintains the water distribution systems serving these areas, The Prairies receive their water from the Montgomery County Water District. The Woods receives its water from the Area B water system. Numerous projects have been completed in The Prairies over recent years through housing privatization projects causing the replacement and relocation of parts of the distribution system. The service laterals in these two housing areas are no longer owned by the Air Force and are excluded from the utility privatization solicitation and some of the distribution mains in the Prairies are excluded.<br />Wright-Patterson AFB has no Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system or Energy Monitoring Control System (EMCS) to be included in the water distribution system privatization package. <br />GSUs<br />Huffman Radar Site has a domestic-sized water well, pump, pressure tank, and connecting piping that provides for the site's minimal water requirements. Kauffman Avenue 69kV Switching Station has no water components.</p>

<br />Vectren Natural Gas Company (Vectren) supplies odorized natural gas to Wright-Patterson AFB via a Government-wide supply contact administered by Defense Energy Support Center (DESC) through 14 metered delivery points located throughout WPAFB. A regulator, meter and valve station is located at each delivery point. The equipment at each delivery point is owned, operated and maintained by Vectren. In addition to the normal natural gas requirements on Base, the natural gas system also supplies fuel to two compressed natural gas (CNG) facilities for the Base's CNG vehicle fleet. The CNG stations are located in Areas B and C but are specifically excluded from Utility Privatization. <br />Gas distribution pressure ranges from 8 pounds per square inch gauge (psig) to 45-psig. <br />The gas is distributed throughout the Base through approximately 31 miles of underground pipelines. These lines are owned, operated and maintained by the Base, except for some privatized housing service laterals. Many of these lines are polyethylene (PE) pipe with tracer wire. The balance of the pipe is coated and wrapped steel and originally protected by a cathodic protection system utilizing sacrificial anodes. Pipe is typically buried at a minimum of three feet below the surface. The Wright-Patterson AFB gas distribution system has undergone significant replacement projects in the last 20 to 30 years. When it is necessary to add or replace lines, due to new construction or repair, PE pipe is usually the material of choice.<br />A generalized system assessment was conducted with Base engineering, operation and maintenance personnel. For assessment purposes, the Base was subdivided into 14 areas, generally around delivery/meter points and areas of similar age and condition. Base-wide, the coated and wrapped steel pipe system was protected by a cathodic protection system, which utilizes sacrificial anodes unless otherwise noted. Pipe failures do not seem to be a problem in any of the areas. Summaries of the condition assessments are as follows: <br />&bull; Meter Point (MP) 1, serving the northern portion of Area B, was the oldest gas system on Base but has undergone significant upgrades. The coated and wrapped steel pipe was originally installed around 1943 and is thought to be in average to poor condition. Over half of the pipe downstream from this meter point was replaced around 2001. The older plug valves in this area of the system are considered to be in average to poor condition. The 25-&not;psig distribution system pressure is adequate and serves facilities primarily utilized for research. The gas system served by this meter point is an isolated system and is not connected to distribution piping served by other delivery points. <br />&bull; MP 2 is also located in the northern portion of Area B. It serves an incinerator and an occupational health clinic. The pressure for this part of the system has a 25-psig pressure. The coated and wrapped steel pipe and plug valves were installed in 1947 and are thought to be in average condition. Approximately 40 percent of the pipe has been replaced in the last 15 years. This section of the gas system is also isolated from other sections of the distribution system. <br />&bull; MP 3 is located in the north central portion of Area B and serves research facilities. Much of this system was replaced in 1985 and consists of PE pipe and plug valves, which are considered to be in good condition. Piping was installed with tracer wire and warning tape. The distribution pressure in this portion of the system is 40-psig. This is also an isolated gas system. A major replacement project occurred in 2002 replacing lines along Skyline Drive. <br />&bull; MP 4 is located in Area B and serves the National Museum of the United States Air Force at Wright Field. The polyethylene (PE) pipe and plug valves were installed in 2000 and are considered to be in good condition. The gas pressure is 10-psig. The gas lines were recently extended to serve an additional hangar facility at the museum in 2004. <br />&bull; MP 5 serves The Prairies at Wright Field housing area, located west of Area B. The PE pipe and plug valves were installed in 1984 and upgraded during 2003 in some areas as part of the housing privatization initiative. Tracer wire and warning tape are in place; piping is considered to be good condition with a pressure of 25-psig. This is a looped system and pressure is not a problem. A normally closed Vectren valve is located on the north side of the housing area and provides an emergency backup source of gas for The Prairies housing area. <br />&bull; MP 6 serves only the school in The Prairies housing area with three-inch PE pipe. The gas pressure is 25 psig.<br />&bull; MP 7 (National Road Metering Station) is located on the east side of Area B and serves facilities located along the east boundary of Area B. The coated and wrapped steel pipe and plug valves were installed in 1950 and are considered to be in average condition. This section has a gas pressure of 25-psig. It is estimated that 100 percent of the pipe has been replaced in the last 15 years. As pipe is replaced, it is replaced with PE piping with tracer wire and warning tape. This is another isolated system consisting of several dead-end lines and one gas source serving primarily office buildings. A new childcare center and Air Force Institute of Technology building are also served by this sub-system. <br />&bull; MP 8 serves The Woods at Wright Field housing area, located east of Area B and south of Area C. The PE pipe and plug valves were installed in 1970 and are considered to be in good condition with a gas pressure of 45-psig. No significant sections of pipe have been replaced in the last 15 years. The regulators are considered to be in average condition. This is a looped system and pressure is not a problem. During the installation of the PE pipe, tracer wire and warning tape were not installed which makes locating the pipe extremely difficult and increases the chances of line damage when excavation is taking place in this area. <br />&bull; MP 9 is located on the north edge of The Woods housing area and serves only a heat plant, located near the meter point. The coated and wrapped steel pipe and plug valves were installed in 1991 and are considered to be in excellent condition. The system pressure at the heat plant is 35-psig. The cathodic protection for this section of pipe was also installed in 1991. <br />&bull; MP 10 is located on the south boundary of Area A and serves Area A. The coated and wrapped steel pipe and plug valves were originally installed in 1970 and are considered to be in average condition with a gas pressure of 8-psig. An estimated 25 percent of the pipe has been replaced in the past 15 years. The gas distribution system in this area primarily serves office buildings in the west portion and MFH in the east portion of Area A. Gas lines from Vectren MP 11, serving Area C, are also connected to this distribution system in the Area A Housing. A recent project was completed to replace a section of 4-inch steel piping with 6-inch piping and an upgrade of the regulators serving this section resulting in reduced operational problems. A section line along Communications Blvd. was replaced in 2000. Most recently, the entire system in the housing area known as The Bricks was replaced in 2003 with PE pipe; tracer wire and warning tape was also installed. <br />&bull; MP 11 is located near Gate 35C on the east side of Area C and serves Area C. The PE pipe and plug valves were installed in 1980 and are considered to be in good condition. The distribution pressure in this area of the system is 8-psig and serves a combination of office, industrial, and flight-line hanger facilities. The distribution system in Area C is a looped system and is also interconnected with the distribution system serving Area A, which provides a second source of gas for Area C. No facilities are currently being planned which will significantly increase the gas demand in Area C. <br />&bull; MP 12 is located along the east boundary of Area C and serves the West Ramp Area. In 1993, approximately 3500 linear feet of 6-inch PE pipe was installed from MP12, along the east boundary of Area C and into the West Ramp area. The pipe is considered to be in good condition with a gas pressure of 8-psig, and was installed with tracer wire and warning tape. This is a radial system that is isolated from other systems serving the Installation. <br />&bull; MP 13 is located along the east boundary of the Kittyhawk Center, which is in the northeast portion of the Installation. The coated and wrapped steel lines date back to 1943 and are in poor condition. All pipes in this area were replaced in 1999/2000. This portion of the gas system is isolated from the other distribution systems and serves facilities that range from office to small industrial type facilities. This section of the system has a gas pressure of 8-psig. <br />&bull; MP 14 is located at the southwest corner of the Kittyhawk Center and serves only one heat plant. The 8-inch PE line was installed in 1994 with tracer wire and warning tape and is considered to be in excellent condition. This system is isolated from the other distribution systems.<br />There is currently an active cathodic protection program at the Base. This program is cognizant of many problems in the system such as inadequate insulation unions and flanges, PE pipe sections installed between metal pipes without jumper wires, and old anode beds that cannot be located. The gas distribution system has both sacrificial anode and impressed current cathodic protection systems. Generally, the sacrificial anode systems are associated with steel pipe. Installation technicians are more concerned about sections of steel pipe in Area B, primarily because soil conditions are more corrosive than in Areas A and C. <br />There is no Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system or Energy Monitoring and Control System (EMCS) included in the natural gas privatization package.<br />There are no natural gas components to be privatized at either the Huffman Radar Site or the Kauffman Avenue Switching Station.

<br />The wastewater collection system at Wright-Patterson AFB consists of collection piping, manholes, cleanout T's and lift stations. There is no wastewater treatment facility at the Base. All wastewater generated at WPAFB is treated by either the City of Dayton or the City of Fairborn. The City of Dayton treats most of the wastewater from WPAFB. <br />The wastewater generated in the West Ramp area and all Facilities north and west of the intersection of Skeel Avenue and Xenia Drive, except for Facilities 30138, 30140, and 30143, flows into the City of Fairborn mains that run through the north side of the Base. Wastewater from Buildings 891 and 892 and any overflow from Lift Station 31440 flow into the City of Fairborn line that enters WPAFB near the intersection of State Highway Route 444 and Davis-Monthan Road. The wastewater flows are not metered regularly, and the City of Fairborn charges WPAFB a contracted fee based on estimated flow. The wastewater quantity is calculated from 100% of the potable water usage. <br />All wastewater from the other areas of WPAFB is conveyed to the City of Dayton. The wastewater collection system transports the effluent to two (2) main discharge points adjacent to the west of Area B. Wastewater from Areas A and C is pumped by Lift Station 30117 into a 20-inch 12,300-foot HDPE force main that proceeds southwest along Novick Road. Force main 1440 from Area A and force main 7000 from the Woods MFH (formerly Woodland Hills MFH) feed into this 20-inch main. Wastewater from Area C buildings between Communications Boulevard and Davis-Monthan Road is served by Lift Station 31440. Lift Station 31440 pumps the wastewater through an eight-inch force main into the 20-inch force main. Woods MFH area wastewater flows to Lift Station 27000, which pumps across State Route 444 through a six-inch force main into the 20-inch force main of Lift Station 30117. The 20-inch force main, after exiting Area C, discharges to Manhole 29L and from thereon becomes a gravity line. The 20 inch then changes to a 24-inch gravity main. The 24-inch gravity main runs along Springfield Pike and then changes to a back and forth from a 27 inch to a 24 inch (dependent on slope) east of Bong Street. This gravity main is approximately 12,000 feet in total length and terminates in a City of Dayton manhole approximately 200 feet south of Springfield Pike on Smithville Road. A portion of the 20-inch force main and most of the gravity line is outside WPAFB property. The force and gravity lines are operated and maintained by Base personnel and WPAFB has been granted an easement for the line. Wastewater from Area B is conveyed to the City of Dayton through either the above-mentioned 27-inch gravity main, or a 15-inch main that exits the Base approximately 500 linear feet west of Bong Street. The 15-inch main transmits effluent generated from Area B. The wastewater flow is metered for a short test period once every three years by the City of Dayton. The City then bills WPAFB at a negotiated rate based on the metered flow for the next three years. <br />A Montgomery County sewer main (county main) runs along Colonel Glenn Highway north of Prairies MFH area (formerly called the Page Manor MFH area). The wastewater generated in Prairies MFH is discharged to the county main at multiple points on the north boundary. There is another Montgomery County sewer line that runs through the southeast corner of Prairies MFH. Prairies MFH discharges at two other points on this line. The entire flow goes to the City of Dayton for treatment. <br />Lift Stations <br />There are numerous wastewater system lift stations at Wright-Patterson AFB. Three are relatively large lift stations; the rest are smaller lift stations. <br />Lift Station 30117 is located in Area C and was constructed in 1988. The station is a wet well/dry well station. There are three pumps in this station each with a 175 horsepower (hp) motor drive. This lift station pumps the wastewater through a Base-owned 20-inch, 12,300-foot force main to Manhole 29L. The lift station is equipped with a 400 kW emergency generator to power the station during electrical outages. The pumps are automatically controlled by wet well water level, and have an emergency alarm that annunciates in the Energy Management Control System (EMCS) area. <br />Lift Station 27000, located in the Woods MFH area, and was constructed in 2000. It is a wet well station with two 15 hp submersible grinder pumps. The pumps are automatically controlled by the wet well water level. The lift station is equipped with an emergency generator and the emergency alarm signal that is sent to the EMCS system. The station discharges to a six-inch force main which is approximately 1,100 feet long. The force main passes under State Route 444 and discharges into the 20-inch force main from Lift Station 30117. <br />Lift Station 31440 is located in Area C of the Base and was upgraded in 2002. There are two 7.5 hp submersible pumps that operate by rising and falling water surfaces. There are no emergency alarms at the station and no emergency generator at this lift station. The lift station normally pumps through a 370-foot eight-inch force main to the 20-inch diameter force main from Lift Station 30117. If the flows to the station exceed pumping capacity, excess flow is diverted to the Fairborn gravity wastewater main via a 450-foot, 12-inch gravity line. <br />Lift Station 10854 has two submersible pumps and is located in Area A. This lift station has automatic controls with a local emergency alarm and is not equipped with an emergency generator. Lift Stations 30056, 30138, 30143, and 30152 are located in Area C. Lift station 30056 serves several buildings along the flight line while the other lift stations serve individual single facilities. Lift Stations 30056 and 30143 have local alarms; other lift stations do not have alarms. Each lift station has one or two submersible pumps, and do not have alarms nor emergency generators. <br />Wright-Patterson AFB does not have a wastewater Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system or EMCS to be included in the wastewater collection system privatization solicitation.<br />Wastewater Lines <br />The average depth of wastewater pipe at WPAFB is eight feet. Based on the area served, WPAFB wastewater system is sub-divided into eight areas. Each of the areas is discussed below. <br />The Area A wastewater system was installed in 1945. The lines are vitrified clay pipes and are in average condition. In the last 15 years, approximately 10 percent of the pipe has been upgraded by slip-lining, complete replacement, or point repairs. A few of the lines have less than the minimum required slope and a few have sags in the lines between manholes. Area A wastewater mains are flushed and cleaned every two years, or when a backup or stoppage occurs. Within Area A is the Bricks, Green Acres, and Pine Estates MFH areas; in these MFH areas, only the wastewater mains are included in the privatization action as mentioned before. Wastewater mains in the Bricks, Green Acres, and Pine Estates MFH areas are flushed and cleaned every six months, or when a backup or stoppage occurs.<br />Most of the wastewater piping in Area C is vitrified clay, installed in 1945, and is in average condition. Similar to Area A, a portion of the pipe is installed at less than minimum slope and some reaches of the pipe have sags in the line. Within the last 15 years approximately 10 percent of the pipe has been replaced. Area C wastewater mains are flushed and cleaned every two years, or when a backup or stoppage occurs. <br />In the Kittyhawk Center, the lines are vitrified clay pipes that were installed in 1955. Sections of the pipe have less than minimum slope and, in some cases, the sections have sags. In the last 15 years approximately 20 percent of the pipe has been replaced. The lines are considered to be in average condition. <br />The wastewater lines in the West Ramp area are also vitrified clay pipes that were installed in 1955. Within the last 15 years, approximately 20 percent of the pipe has been replaced. Sections of the piping have less than the minimum required slope and a portion of them have sags. The pipes in this area are in average condition. The pipes are flushed and cleaned every two years, or when a backup or stoppage occurs. <br />Area B was the first area constructed on the Base in the 1920s, and some lines in Area B were constructed in the 1940s. Some lines were for new facilities were added in the mid 1990s. The piping material is vitrified clay and it is in poor condition. There are problem areas where the pipe has less than a minimum slope. Within the last 15 years, approximately 5 percent of the pipe has been relined. The mains are flushed and cleaned annually. <br />The wastewater lines in the Prairies MFH area were installed in 1952. The buildings in this area were renovated. Some of the wastewater mains were replaced, some new lines were constructed, some old lines were abandoned and some of the old mains were reused. The older mains are vitrified clay pipes that are considered to be in average condition. Some sections of the pipe have less than minimum slope but the sections do not have any sag. The lines are flushed and cleaned every six months. The wastewater generated in this area is discharged into the Montgomery County sewer line at multiple points along the north side of the MFH area and at two points on the southwest part of this area. Within the Prairies MFH area is a trailer park area that has been abandoned. The wastewater mains in this section are PVC pipe installed in 1979. All sections of the pipe have slopes greater than the minimum requirement and have no sags. The pipes are considered to be in good condition and are flushed annually. As discussed previously, only the old wastewater mains, not installed and owned by the HP contractor, are included in the privatization package.<br />The Woods MFH area wastewater system was installed in 1972 with a combination of clay and PVC piping (approximately 90 percent of the pipe is PVC). The pipe sections are installed with adequate slopes and have no sags. There have been no replacements in the last 15 years. The pipes are flushed annually and are in good condition. As discussed previously, only the wastewater mains are included in the privatization package.<br />Generally, tracer wire or marker tape has not been effectively installed with non-metallic pipe during initial installation or replacement projects. <br />Manholes<br />Manholes are adequately located and are of either concrete or masonry/brick construction. The manholes in all of the WPAFB non-housing areas are in poor condition and the manhole covers are not watertight. The manholes in the Prairies MFH are in average condition; the manholes in Woods MFH area are in good condition. The manholes in these areas have watertight covers and are inspected regularly. Manholes installed prior to 1950 are assumed to be of masonary/brick construction. Manholes installed subsequent to 1950 are assumed to be of pre-cast concrete construction.

This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP).  The United States Air Force (USAF) is seeking interested sources regarding fielding additional tactical aerial targeting pods/Advanced Targeting Pod Sensors Enhancement (ATP-SE).  The sponsoring activity is Aeronautical Systems Center, 647th Aeronautical System Squadron, Wright- Patterson Air Force Base, OH.  The ! program office anticipates awarding, on or about 28 FEB 2010, a competitive Firm Fix Priced (FFP) Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract of five years in length for the production ATP-SE systems.  Total requirement are for an estimated 670 systems, of which approximately 275 new systems are anticipated to be procured via this activity.  The actual quantity will be dependent on requirements, price and available funding.  The ability to handle classified material will be a requirement for award of any contract(s) that may result from this notification.  The purpose of this notification is to determine whether any competitive sources exist and to notify industry of any impending actions so that possible subcontracting opportunities may be pursued.  Any IDIQ Contract resulting from this sources sought synopsis will be to acquire the non-developmental ATP-SE as a follow-on system to the AN/AAQ-33 targeting pod.  The ATP-SE is an external, pylon-mounted targeting pod and will be integrated onto the F-16, F-15, A-10, B-52 and B-1 platforms with the potential for integration onto other military platforms.  The targeting pod is capable of producing infrared and visible imagery of both ground and airborne targets.  The pod provides laser ranging and designation in support of weapon delivery, navigational functions, recording and data-linking of generated imagery and data.  The imagery will allow for greater stand-off ranges and increase target identification.  The Government does not contemplate providing any data or drawings related to the existing targeting pods already in the Government's inventory.  This contract may include activities for both existing and new targeting pods such as providing support equipment, spares an! d product support to include but not limited to: field and depot level support, sustaining engineering, software support and integration, technical data, aircrew and maintenance training, initial spares, provisioning, flight test support, Contractor Logistical Support (CLS), special studies, efforts in support of contingency operations and contractor field team support to include emergency fleet repair support, as well as integration, test, and production and installation of future modifications and enhancements as new technologies become available.

<DESC>To: 	All Requestors of the Prospectus for a Concession Business Opportunity for Marina, Merchandise, and Food and Beverage Operations within Amistad National Recreation Area.
Re:	Modification #2, CC-AMIS002-10

The responses to questions that were posted on Wednesday, October 7, 2009, contained an error.Question No. 4 asked why there were minimum and maximum numbers for houseboats and powerboats.  Our response was that there are no minimums which is incorrect.
There is a discrepancy between page 7 of Business Opportunity in the prospectus which identifies minimums required for houseboats and power boats, and the Draft Operating Plan (Exhibit B) which does not identify minimums for houseboats and powerboats. Our failure to include minimums in the Draft Operating Plan is an oversight that will be rectified in the final Operating Plan. 
The National Park Service has considered these minimums in terms of providing optimal visitor services based on current operations.  However, over the life of the Contract, these minimums may be adjusted based on changes in demand.
If you have any questions, please contact Jacque Lavelle, Chief of Concessions at jacque_lavelle@nps.gov or at (303) 969-2661

Sincerely,

Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by NSWC Division Crane. AMENDMENT 2 The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division requires Miniature Day/Night Sight subsystems for Crew-Served Weapons (MDNS-CSW).  A five year indefinite-delivery indefinite-quantity contract is anticipated; expected quantity is a minimum of 15 units and a maximum of 3000 units.  Delivery shall be FOB Destination NSWC-Crane.  Fifteen (15) units required 150 days from award date of contract with subsequent deliveries at a rate of 200 units every 30 days until order is complete.  Preliminary inspection will occur at source by a Government QAR and final inspection and acceptance will be at destination by NSWC Crane personnel.  This solicitation will be issued on a full and open competition basis using a performance specification. The MDNS-CSW required is a system of common, standardized aiming modules, illumination modules, and mounts that are system-integrated for use on crew-served weapons.  Prior public Market Survey activity on MDNS-CSW occurred pursuant to two previous NSWC Crane announcements: N00164-06-R-4887 WEAPONS QUADRANT MOUNTS (WQM) and N00164-06-R-4803 CREW SERVED AND HEAVY WEAPONS AIMING LASER (CSHWAL).  The original Market Surveys can be downloaded by clicking on the foregoing links; then entering the announcement numbers in the Search by Solicitation / Award Number block in the provided form.  No Performance Specification for the WQM is yet prepared.  A Preliminary Draft of the Performance Specification for the CSHWAL, dated April 25th, 2006, remains posted, but is closed for receipt of comments.  Market Survey results and field trials of commercial offerings in July 2006 revealed that no known existing laser meets the requirements for the CSHWAL.  Also revealed was that the future!   CSHWAL and WQMs need to be fully system integrated with a Visible Bright Light-Heavy (VBL-H).  Therefore, NSWC Crane has developed a new Performance Specification that unifies the CSHWAL, VBL-H, and WQMs subsystem capabilities into an integrated MDNS-CSW system.  The MDNS-CSW Revised Performance Specification will be published on or about December 2006-January 2007.  When it is published, interested parties are invited to comment on the MDNS-CSW Revised Performance Specification.  The Closing Date for receipt of comments on the MDNS-CSW Revised Performance Specification is Friday, 27 April 2007. NSWC Crane will hold a public pre-solicitation conference for the MDNS-CSW acquisition.  The tentative date for this pre-solicitation conference is Sunday, 14 January 2007, in Orlando, Florida.  Attendees must register for this conference with the Contracting Officer no later than Friday, 5 January 2007.  No additional attendees will be accepted for this conference after Friday, 5 January 2007, in order to accommodate the correct seating capacity at the conference site.     It is expected that the competitive solicitation will require offerors to submit two product samples, technical, past performance and price proposals.  Award will be on a best value basis.  To be eligible for award, contractors must be properly registered in the Government's Central Contractor Registration (CCR).  Offerors may obtain information on CCR registration and annual confirmation requirements by calling 1-888-227-2423, or via the Internet @ www.ccr.gov. It should be noted that during the course of this acquisition program, the Government plans to utilize employees from Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC), Wexford Group International (WGI) and possibly other direct Government contractors as advisors to the Government participants.  This sources sought announcement does not constitute an Invitation for Bids (IFB), a Request for Quote (RFQ), or a Request for Proposal (RFP) and it should not be construed as a commitment of any kind by the Government to issue a formal solicitation or ultimately award a contract.  The U.S. Government is in no way liable to pay for or reimburse any companies or entities that respond to this announcement.  Any costs incurred by interested companies in response to this announcement or incurred for participation in the pre-solicitation conference will NOT be reimbursed.  Any information provided that is marked as proprietary information will be safeguarded to prevent disclosures to !  non-government personnel and entities.  Your interest in this program is appreciated.  Questions should be directed to Stacy McAtee, Contracting Officer, Code 0562NS, telephone 812-854-1988, fax 812-854-5095, e-mail stacy.mcatee@navy.mil.

<DESC>This synopsis is being posted to both the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) page located at http://www.fbo.gov and the Navy Electronic Commerce on Line (NECO) site located at https://www.neco.navy.mil/.  While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the Internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable.  Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the NSWC Division Crane. Amendment 0003: PURPOSE AND BACKGROUND:  The government previously held two industry pre-solicitation conferences for N00164-06-R-4810 FOR MINIATURE DAY/NIGHT SIGHT DEVELOPMENT FOR CREW-SERVED WEAPONS (MDNS-CSW).  This is to formalize and detail the planning announced to industry at those conferences.  The MDNS-CSW Development Project will be conducted in two major phases, immediate and long-term.  The immediate phase, Phase 1, will occur over the upcoming months and will establish a simple, partially-integrated baseline ensemble for MDNS-CSW.  The long-term phase, Phase 2, which will be conducted on a full and open competition basis, will be a fully integrated ensemble, which may require several years of developmental, test, and integration efforts.   SCOPE:  This announcement is expressly for Phase 1.  The immediate MDNS-CSW ensemble will consist of Government-Off-The-Shelf (GOTS) subsystems, possibly supplemented by Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) or commercial and government Non-Developmental Item (NDI) subsystems.  No COTS/NDI items that have remaining developmental issues will be considered for Phase 1.  Any and all COTS/NDI submissions should already be in production or in production-ready status.  Any subsystems not in this status should not be submitted in Phase 1, being more appropriate for Phase 2. ACTIVITY:  The SOPMOD MDNS-CSW Project will utilize an independent Operational Test Agency (OTA) to conduct an Early User Assessment (EUA) of GOTS/COTS/NDI subsystems on or about 9-20 July, 2007.  The government participants in the EUA will mount, fire, and assess the various subsystems to establish which ensemble most closely meets the current MDNS-CSW Performance Specification and the operational tasks and missions outlined in applicable weapons field manuals and operators manuals.   OBJECTIVE:  The EUA results and other information may be used to develop a Market Survey Report.   There is no intent to procure anything other than existing GOTS items at this time, however, if any COTS/NDI items are found to be operationally superior to existing GOTS items, the Government may choose to procure these COTS/NDI items in relatively small quantities to support continued exploratory testing, or to meet urgent combat needs, until the long-term Phase 2 MDNS-CSW solution is achieved.  To be eligible for award, contractors must be properly registered in the Government's Central Contractor Registration (CCR). Offerors may obtain information on CCR registration and annual confirmation requirements by calling 1-888-227-2423, or via the Internet @ www.ccr.gov. WEAPONS OF INTEREST:  While the EUA may conduct exploratory testing of subsystems using any and all SOF Weapons in the inventory, the only weapons of interest currently planned for the EUA include: (1) the M2 HB .50 Caliber Machinegun, (2) the M240 7.62mm Machinegun, (3) the Mk19 40mm Machinegun, (4) the Mk13 .300 WinMag Sniper Rifle, and (5) the M3 84mm MAAWS.  These weapons are listed by priority of government effort to be given at the EUA.   GOVERNMENT SUBSYSTEMS:  The GOTS subsystems currently selected are to consist of SOPMOD Blocks 1 and 2, as well as various lasers and aiming items from other government programs. INVITATION TO VENDORS:  For vendors wishing to participate, the COTS/NDI items of interest correspond to those found in the N00164-06-R-4810 specification. Generically, these are: 1.  Crew Served Heavy Weapon Aiming Laser (CSHWAL) 2.  Visible Bright Light - Heavy (VBL-H) NOTE:  This also includes VBL-Medium for medium machineguns 3.  Remote Control Subsystem (RCS) NOTE: For Phase 1 these include remote controls of all kinds, to include switches, cables, video monitors, heads-up displays, helmet-mounted visual aids, etc. 4.  Rail Interface System - Heavy (RIS-H), NOTE: For Phase 1, these include any and all mounting solutions needed to mount COTS/GOTS items. 5.  Enhanced Combat Optical Sight - Heavy (ECOS-H)  6.  Laser Range Finder (LRF) 7.  Clip-On Night Vision Device - Heavy (CNVD-H) Vendors interested in participating in this immediate Phase 1 activity will: Submit, not later than 4 June 2007, 3:00PM Central Time:   1.  Two production or production-ready samples 2.  A signed letter statement of intent to participate, to include a corporate certification that the devices intended for submission are certified safe for intended use.  For items containing lasers, submit evidence of technical tests proving that the lasers are emitting within the ranges specified by their respective laser classes.  Also include any other vendor-supplied technical test data, such as shock, environmental etc.  The letter of intent should clearly explain how the submitted samples improve the operational capabilities of the weapons of interest. 3.  Pricing utilizing the attached table(s)  4.  Completed/signed Bailment Agreement(s)  5.  Standardized data sheet(s) (Documents referenced in 3, 4 and 5 above may be obtained at: http://www.crane.navy.mil/acquisition/synopcom.htm 6.  Any other relevant manufacturer's information, such as Quick Reference Cards, Operators Manuals, and training materials.   Vendors will be notified by 15 June of the subjective opinion of the government as to whether or not the submitted items are within the scope of the EUA.  The government is not obligated to test items it determines are outside the scope of the EUA.  Items that will be considered outside the scope of the EUA include: 1.  Samples that have no clearly explained or apparent value to the increased operational capabilities of the weapons of interest; 2.  Samples that cannot be mounted to or otherwise applied to the weapons of interest; 3.  Samples not safe for intended use; or 4.  Passive day/night aiming systems for Sniper Rifles, a capability which is managed by a separate USSOCOM Program, namely the Integrated Night/Day Observation Device (INOD).  This program is independent of the SOPMOD Program and the MDNS-CSW Development Project.  Other sniper capabilities, such as active aiming, illumination, and ranging, are of interest to the EUA. If participants have questions regarding the applicability of their proposed samples, please send the questions by email to the Contract Specialist listed below. INVITATION TO CONDUCT NEW EQUIPMNENT TRAINING:  Industrial participants whose submissions are accepted in June will be invited to send factory representatives/instructors to deliver New Equipment Training (NET) on or about the second week of July 2007.  The exact times and location of the NET will be provided by later separate correspondence.  INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY (IP):  Currently, the government desires to experiment and test GOTS, COTS/NDI, or militarized versions of COTS products, and has no interest in the acquisition of vendor intellectual property.  The government, however, wishes to maintain open system architectures, and will have very limited interest in items that restrict future spiral development by using proprietary interfaces.  The SOPMOD Program does not have technical data packages for the weapons and sighting systems listed above.  Please do not request drawings or descriptions.  PARTICIPATION:  This announcement is a public invitation.  Failure to participate in this Market Survey will not preclude abstaining vendors from bidding on possible future solicitations.  This announcement is part of the full-free-and-open competition process, which encourages industry and academia to help shape Government specifications to match what is possible, affordable, and timely.  Failure to participate in this open Market Survey process may result in a future Government performance specification over which the abstaining vendors have limited influence in the acquisition process, and may deprive abstaining vendors of potentially valuable direct early interaction with end-users, contracting officials, and acquisition planners.  Participating vendors will be provided access to redacted excerpts of the Market Survey Report, covering selected portions of the report limited to only the individual vendor's samples. Vendors who already have GOTS-qualified products may cons!  ider participating with the bailment loan of newly-manufactured items, since many GOTS items are in short supply and cannot be assured of being available for testing from government stockages.  Those available from government stockages may be in used or other unfavorable condition due to wartime demand. OTHER NOTES:  The government will provide common batteries at the EUA, such as BA5590, DL123, 3N, AA, and AAA series.  Vendors participating with samples requiring non-standard batteries should provide sufficient non-standard batteries for 96 hours of test operations.  All loaned items will be returned to vendors after the Market Survey Report is complete, on or about December, 2007.  It should be noted that during the course of this acquisition program, the Government plans to utilize employees from Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC), Wexford Group International (WGI), Weapons System Technology Integration Center (WSTIAC), Booz Allen Hamilton (BAH) and other direct Government contractors as advisors to the Government participants.  This sources sought announcement does not constitute an Invitation for Bids (IFB), a Request for Quote (RFQ), or a Request for Proposal (RFP) and it should not be construed as a commitment of any kind by the Government to issue a formal solicitation or ultimately award a contract.  The U.S. Government is in no way liable to pay for or reimburse any companies or entities that respond to this announcement.  Any costs incurred by interested companies in response to this announcement or incurred for participation in this activity will NOT be reimbursed.  Any information provided that is marked as proprietary inf!  ormation will be safeguarded to prevent disclosures to non-government personnel and entities.  Your interest in this program is appreciated.

<a href="mailto:Meyer.Manuela@epamail.epa.gov">U.S. Environmental Protection Agency</a>
<DESC>NAICS Code: 541380   The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has the responsibility of enhancing national capabilities for decontamination and disposal as a result of terrorist events and environmental sampling and analysis of all environmental matrices in response tonationally significant incidents (NSI). To protect the nation from the potential threats posed by terrorism or environmental emergencies, the EPA implemented the Environmental Response Laboratory Network (ERLN). The ERLN is one of five laboratory response networks under the Integrated Consortium of Laboratory Networks (ICLN). The mission of the ERLN is to provide known laboratory capabilities, capacities, and quality data in a scalable, systematic, and coordinated response to environmental emergencies providing preparedness, response, remediation and recovery analytical support. Consequently, the USEPA Office of Acquisition Management (OAM) intends to establish Basic Ordering Agreements (BOAs) in accordance with FAR Part 16.703 with vendors who are capable of analyzing environmental sample matrices contaminated by toxic industrial chemicals (TICs), chemical warfare agents (CWAs), biological agents, and radiochemical agents as a result of acts of terrorism or an environmental emergency. A BOA is not a contract, as referenced in FAR Part 16.703; it is a written instrument of understanding, negotiated between an agency, contracting activity, or contracting office and a contractor, that contains: (1) terms and clauses applying to future contracts (orders) between the parties during its term, (2) a description, as specific as practicable, of supplies or services to be provided, and (3) methods for pricing, issuing, and delivering future orders under the BOA. Additionally, a BOA does not imply any agreement by the government to place future contracts or orders with the contractor or to be used in any manner to restrict competition. 
Potential vendors' viability will be evaluated on the following six factors: Accredited Quality System, Plans and Procedures, Sample Management System, Facilities for Sample Handling and Storage, Data Management and Exchange, and Integrated Consortium of Laboratory Networks (ICLN). The ERLN review team will review these documents and calculate a score for the application based on criteria established by the EPA. This score is used to determine if the laboratory is eligible for ERLN and, as applicable, Water Laboratory Alliance (WLA) membership.

This requirement will be posted for 90 days with a closing date of December 30, 2009 at 3:00 pm EST.  All questions for this requirement are due on October 30, 2009 at 3:00 pm EST.  A copy of this request for quote (RFQ) # RFQ-DC-09-00337 including attachments will be available at the following locations: http://www.epa.gov/oam/srpod/index.htm, and https://www.fbo.gov/.
Please submit ERLN application packet via electronic mail or in hard copy form to EPA Office of Acquisition Management (OAM) using the address provided below. No phone calls please.

The building is a timber-framed single story warehouse with exterior concrete walls. The building is supported on timber piles with concrete followers. The followers are 14inch in diameter by 11 feet long and extend from the underside of the concrete slab to the top of the timber piles. Single piles are spaced 8 feet on center. The building is approximately 330 feet wide by 1100 feet long and is immediately to the west of the historic Albert Kahn-designed Ford Motor Company Assembly Plant (1201) completed in 1932, at 4735 East Marginal Way Seattle, WA. The proposed project site will encompass approximately 50% of the footprint of the existing building. The 1202 building has been determined not to be historic. This project will provide for the projected 15-year space requirements of the USACE and is the pivotal undertaking for a campus-like site redevelopment that can accommodate the 30-year expansion requirements for a number of other Federal Agencies. This project will help to revitalize the neighborhood and receive an architectural treatment that is responsive to its context and due to its adjacency to the 1201 building compatible with historic precedents.</p>
<p>The Design Build project shall include the performance of architectural/egineering services based on an approved concept selected during the Request for Proposal (RFP) stage of the acquisition process. The design will be in accordance with GSA quality standards and will address the specific tenant requirements of the USACE. The warehouse redevelopment/modernization will include 150,000-200,000 gross square feet of new office space for the USACE and may include space for a child care facility and cafeteria food services. As required by the ARRA legislation, the facility will be designed to be a high performing green building (HPGB) and as such will meet the most current federal energy goals. The project goal is to meet LEED-NC, Gold rating requirements. All Federal accessibility requirements and standards will also be met as required by law.</p>
<p>PROJECT SCOPE: This project includes the redevelopment of the building through a strategy of structure and materials reuse to the greatest practicable extent, introduction of modern building systems and use of innovative technologies to meet HPGB strategies. The work will also include seismic upgrades and repair and/or replacement of the existing foundation, stabilization of liquefiable soils and any associated site development. The scope of professional services will require at a minimum: Professional architectural, landscape architectural, engineering, interior design, HPGB consulting service, historic architecture and related consulting services for concept design documents, design development documents, Building Information Modeling (BIM), metric and English construction documents, specifications, cost estimates, schedules, space planning, value engineering services, LEED-AP services, computer-aided design and drafting (CADD). The project shall comply with GSA design standards for secure facilities, USACE force protection requirements and USACE tenant requirements. The design-builder should incorporate Low Impact Development (LID) strategies. The design-builder will be required to work with artist(s) in support of the Art-in-Architecture Program.</p>
<p>PROJECT MAGNITUDE: The maximum Estimated Cost of Construction is between $50,000,000.00 and $70,000,000.00.</p>
<p>PROJECT DURATION: 30 - 36 months (Design and Construction)</p>
<p>MARKET RESEARCH: A survey was conducted with industry to assist in the development of the Acquisition Plan for this project. Following are the results:<br /><br />Delivery Method: Design Build is the most appropriate acquisition approach<br />Contract Type: Preference for Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP) vs Firm Fixed Price because it is more representative of a collaborative delivery effort.<br />Design Competition: Recommendation to limit the design competition (Phase 2) to no more than 5 offerors. <br />Stipend: A $50,000 - $75,000 stipend would help defray costs to participate in the Design Competition.<br />Award Fee: Preference for good partnering<br /><br />COMPETITION: Unrestricted<br />This procurement will be open to large and small business firms. Any qualified responsible firm, including small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business is encouraged to participate as a prime contractor or as a member of a joint venture with other small businesses, or as a subcontractor Pursuant to Section 8(d) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(d), FAR subpart 19.702 and FAR subpart 19.12. An Offeror that is not a small business concern, offering to perform a contract that has subcontracting possibilities, will be required to submit a Subcontracting Plan that is acceptable to the Contracting Officer which provides subcontracting opportunities to small businesses, HUBZone small businesses, small disadvantaged businesses, and woman-owned small businesses to the maximum extent practicable.</p>
<p>PROCUREMENT STRATGY: The Design Build contractor will be selected using Best Value Source Selection pursuant to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Two-Phase Design-Build Selection Procedures, FAR Subpart 36.3, Source Selection Procedures, FAR subpart 15.3 and the GSA Design Excellence Program. For this contract award process, GSA will issue two Solicitations in sequence: 1) Phase One, and 2) Phase Two. The Phase One procedure (which is analogous to a Request for Qualifications (RFQ)) is designed to select a "short list" of the most highly qualified Offerors who will then be requested to submit Phase Two proposals. The short list will not be published in FedBizOpps. All responsible sources may submit a Phase One Proposal. The contracting officer may limit the number of proposals in the competitive range (short list) to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals. The most highly rated Offerors will be selected to participate in Phase Two (analogous to Request for Proposals (RFP)).</p>
<p>In Phase One, the Government shall identify the evaluation factors other than cost or price that will serve as the basis for the determination of the most highly qualified Offerors. Interested Offerors will be required to submit their responses to the RFQ by the due date established in the RFQ. The Government will evaluate all the responses to the RFQ in accordance with the criteria in the RFQ, and advise each Offeror in writing whether it will be invited to participate in the Phase Two process. Offerors that do not submit a timely RFQ response in Phase One will not be allowed to participate in the remaining phase of the procurement.</p>
<p>In Phase Two, the Government will issue the RFP to the most highly qualified Offerors from Phase One and request that they submit Phase Two proposals. Phase Two of the solicitation shall be prepared in accordance with FAR Part 15 and include Phase Two evaluation factors, developed in accordance with FAR 15.304. Phase Two of the solicitation shall require submission of technical and price proposals, which shall be evaluated separately in accordance with FAR Part 15. The Government will reserve the right to make an award upon the basis of the initial Phase One and Phase Two offers without discussions.</p>
<p>CONTRACT AWARD: GSA R10 contemplates awarding a Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP) type contract provided all waivers, deviations, and approvals are authorized prior to issuance of the Phase 2 solicitation. Failure to obtain the necessary GMP type contract approvals will result in awarding a Firm Fixed Price Contract. The Phase 2 RFP will identify which pricing methodology will be awarded, and will contain special provisions and clauses as necessary.</p>
<p>SOLICITATION ISSUE DATE: The RFQ will be issued electronically on or about 09/17/2009 on the internet at: http://www.fedbizopps.gov/.</p>
<p>CLOSING DATE: The estimated closing date for receipt of Phase I submittals is October 16, 2009.</p>
<p>This project will be funded by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act for 2009. THERE IS REASONABLE CERTAINTY FUNDS WILL BE AVAILABLE. All reporting requirements from the Contractor are mandated per the Act. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PRICE OR TECHNICAL PROPOSALS.</p>
