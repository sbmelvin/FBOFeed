<DESC>The United States Agency for International Development, Regional Services Center (RSC), Budapest, intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) on behalf of its client Mission, USAID Serbia and Montenegro, in anticipation of a cost-reimbursement completion contract to implement a five year project entitled the Separation of Powers Program (SPP) to be implemented in Serbia. 

Shortcomings in the rule of law, separation of powers among the three branches of government, and judicial independence have been identified as fundamental obstacles to Serbia's accession to the European Union (EU) and as reform priorities by the Serbian government. The SPP is designed to help Serbia move closer to EU accession by addressing these issues and strengthening the division of power and authority more equably among Serbia's three branches of government. Part of SPP's work with the courts will develop the judiciary's capacity to plan for, allocate, acquire and manage the judiciary's resources, through the establishment of a budget and finance office. SPP's other work with the courts will assist the judicial branch in making its administration of justice more efficient, transparent and responsive to the needs of its users by helping to establish a career track and training program for court administrators, helping the judiciary learn to manage courts effectively and openly, and reducing backlogs and improving case processing times in selected courts. Work with Serbia's National Assembly will focus primarily on assisting parliamentary staff and leaders to plan for, acquire, allocate and manage its own institutional resources in both the short and long term.  

This is a full and open competition and the procedures set forth in FAR Part 15 shall apply. 
Interested firms can register and use the Interested Vendor List (IVL) on the FedBizOpps page: http://www2.fbo.gov/EPSVendorsManual/VG6-Interest.html, so that firms can contact one another for consideration of teaming arrangements and/or small business subcontracting opportunities in response to this solicitation. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 541990. The small business size standard is $6.5 million.

In accordance with FAR 5.102(d) availability of the solicitation is limited to this electronic medium only. The solicitation will be posted herewith at FEDBIZOPPS web page (www.fedbizopps.gov) on or about or not less than fifteen (15) days after this notice is issued.  

Please do not contact USAID/Serbia and Montenegro. All communication must be through this office. Questions must be directed to Mr. Hani Takla and Mr. Andrew Holland, U.S. Agency for International Development, email: htakla@usaid.gov, and aholland@usaid.gov.

We anticipate to make one direct award for the implementation of this project. The release of this notice in no way obligates USAID or the US Government to release an RFP or make an award of any type.

Concerns having the expertise and required capabilities to furnish the above engineering support services may submit their capabilities to be considered for future acquisitions.  This data must include sufficient information to allow the Coast Guard to evaluate the offeror?s capabilities relative to the above requirements.  The submission of this data for review shall not impede award of this purchase order.  The Government does NOT intend to pay for information solicited.  All responsible sources may submit a quotation, which, if timely received, shall be considered by the Agency.  Request for Quotation (RFQ) Number HSCG40-08-Q-6B811001 shall be available for download from FedBizOpps (www.eps.gov) on or about November 26, 2007.

<DESC>The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) is soliciting proposals on a full and open competitive basis from qualified businesses, organizations, colleges, universities and institutions to award a contract to serve as the NIDDK Genetics Repository. The Genetics Repository will provide for the continued storage, maintenance, quality control, and equitable, ethical distribution of DNA and other resources important to the study of diseases under the mandate of the NIDDK. The Genetics Repository facilitates the sharing of resources, thus encouraging work by a broad group of investigators and, perhaps, increasing the sample size and the resulting power of a study to identify the genetic determinants of a disease. The Genetics Repository helps ensure that research participants will be making a maximal contribution, and decreases duplicative sampling efforts.

The objective of this acquisition is to continue the NIDDK Genetics Repository in order to accomplish the following activities in a highly efficient, rapid, and cost-effective manner:

?	Receive blood samples from NIDDK funded grants and contracts.
?	Process these data and materials to create cell lines, cryopreserved lymphocytes, and/or DNA or RNA samples.
?	Receive externally produced immortalized lymphocyte cell lines.
?	Widely distribute all materials to qualified investigators in the scientific community in variety of customized formats.

Since 2003, Rutgers University has served as the contractor for the NIDDKGenetics Repository. Request for Proposal No. NIH-NIDDK-07-05 will be issued at the www.fedbizopps.gov website on or about September 8, 2007 with a receipt date for proposals on or about November 20, 2007.

The Biosample Repository stores and maintains biosamples under high quality conditions, and distributes them in an equitable and ethical manner. This facilitates the sharing of NIDDK-supported resources, thus encouraging work by junior investigators, investigators with novel approaches, and others not included in current collaborations, without excluding those who are established in their fields. The Biosample Repository helps to ensure that research participants make a maximal contribution, and decreases duplicative sampling efforts.
 
The objective of this acquisition is to continue the NIDDK Biosample Repository in order to accomplish the following activities in a highly efficient, rapid, and cost-effective manner: 

?	Receive and store biosamples collected in many different studies. 
?	Carry out specified sample processing and analyses.
?	Widely distribute biosamples to qualified investigators.

The specimen archiving tasks outlined in this statement of work are highly technical, and require extensive experience, expertise, and long-term commitment. The samples were collected over several years from carefully chosen subjects and are present in a finite quantity. Each sample is unique and cannot be replaced if lost, damaged, or contaminated. Therefore, it is essential that the samples be stored under optimal conditions, which vary from sample type to sample type. The contractor?s project director must have extensive experience in successful management of an archival storage facility that stores various types of biosamples, including blood, stool, urine, DNA, and tissue, and that distributes aliquots to many different investigators. The contractor?s staff must be highly trained to carry out technical tasks accurately and reproducibly. As all the work is with samples from human subjects, all staff must be familiar with human subjects protections and be sensitive to the bioethical and safety issues involved in handling human biosamples. Finally, the contractor must have a demonstrable long-term interest in providing these services, to ensure that there is continuity throughout the period of the contract, and to prevent repeated shipment of samples from storage site to storage site, as shipment can sometimes damage these unique materials.

NUMBER OF STUDIES
This project will potentially serve fifteen or more large multi-site NIDDK funded studies. 

?	The range for existing samples is 1,400,000 to 1,900,000 individual specimens in vials or slides. In addition, 20,000 to 60,000 new samples, in multiple aliquots (5 ? 20 vials), will be received annually.

Since 2003, Fisher BioServices (formerly McKesson BioServices) has served as the contractor for the NIDDK Biosample Repository. Request for Proposal No. NIH-NIDDK-07-06 will be issued at the www.fedbizopps.gov website on or about September 8, 2007 with a receipt date for proposals on or about November 20, 2007. See Numbered Note 26.

<DESC>The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) is soliciting proposals on a full and open competitive basis from qualified businesses, organizations, colleges, universities and institutions to award a contract to serve as the NIDDK Data Repository. The Data Repository stores the data from large clinical studies, including data associated with the stored biosamples, and acts as the Data Coordinating Center for the NIDDK Central Repositories. The Database Repository, acting as a central coordinating entity, facilitates efficient distribution of data and samples. As an archive and distributor of highly usable legacy datasets, the Repository also allows re-analysis of these data and, where relevant, of specific biosamples, thus encouraging work by junior investigators, investigators with novel approaches, and others not included in current collaborations.

The objective of this acquisition is to continue the NIDDK Data Repository in order to accomplish the following activities in a highly efficient, rapid, and cost-effective manner:

?	Assist study coordinating centers and the NIDDK Biosample and Genetics Repositories in setting up labeling systems to cross-reference samples and associated data.
?	Maintain a central inventory of samples from the NIDDK Biosample and Genetics Repositories, and provide inventory reporting structures for individual studies.
?	Receive and test the validity of electronic databases from completed studies.
?	Maintain and distribute those databases, including administering review of access applications.
?	Provide timely and informative analyses of databases in response to researcher inquiries.
?	Create and maintain a website for all of the NIDDK Central Repositories.
?	Carry out activities to advertise the availability of samples and data to the research community.

The information systems, consulting, and database archiving tasks outlined in this statement of work are highly technical, and require extensive experience, expertise, and long-term commitment. The data from each study represents the efforts of hundreds of investigators over five or more years to improve the public health through biomedical research, and the voluntary participation of hundreds or thousands of patients and family members. The data cannot be replaced without great expense and effort, and therefore it is essential that they be protected from loss, damage or misuse. The contractor?s project director must have extensive experience in successful database management. The contractor?s staff must be highly trained to work with, maintain, and analyze numerous databases, including those in Oracle and other DBMS?s. As all the work is with data from human subjects, all staff must be familiar with human subjects protections and be sensitive to the bioethical issues involved in handling subject data. Finally, the contractor must have a demonstrable long-term interest in providing these services, to ensure that there is continuity throughout the period of the contract.

Since 2003, Research Triangle Institute (RTI) has served as the contractor for The NIDDK Data Repository. Request for Proposal No. NIH-NIDDK-07-07 will be issued at the www.fedbizopps.gov website on or about September 8, 2007 with a receipt date for proposals on or about November 20, 2007.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

This is a  request for information only as defined in FAR 15.201(e).  Responses to  this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to  form a binding contract.  Respondents are solely responsible for all  expenses associated with responding to this RFI. The Government is in need of information on potential sources for a  contractor support contract for the B-2 Training System. Responses to this  RFI will support the development of an acquisition strategy for a contract  to supplant the current B-2 TSCLS contract (F33657-98-D-0005). B-2 Training System (TS) Components The B-2 TS provides aircrew, maintenance, and weapons loading training at  Whiteman Air Force Base, MO.  It includes training devices, software,  courseware, academic materials, and support elements (hardware, software,  support equipment, spares, and documentation) necessary to train B-2  aircrews, maintenance personnel, and weapons load crews, and to keep the  system current with the fielded aircraft.  The B-2 Training System  consists of the following: the Aircrew Training System (ATS) consisting of  Weapons System Trainers (WSTs) and Mission Trainers (MTs); the Maintenance  Training System (MTS) consisting of Cockpit Procedures Trainers (CPTs),  which are used for both aircrew and maintenance training, Computerized  Maintenance Training System (CMTS) suites each with six Weapon System  Training Aids (WSTAs), a Crew Escape System Maintenance Trainer, a Flight  Control Systems Trainer (FSCT), and a Weapons Loading Trainer.  The B-2  Training System also includes a Training System Support Center (TSSC)  which provides on-site sustaining engineering support activities for the  training system.  There is also a Training System Center (TSC), located at  the contractor?s facility, to handle any software updates to the  maintenance training system. There are 58 devices as follows: Device	                    Number    Location	        Location Weapon System Trainer	    3	      Whiteman AFBMission  Trainer	            2	      Whiteman AFB (1)  Contractor?s Facility (1) Cockpit Procedures Trainer  8	      Whiteman AFB (4)	Contractor?s Facility  (4) Computerized Maintenance Training System                            6	      Whiteman AFB (5)	Contractor?s Facility (1) Weapon System Training Aid 36	      Whiteman AFB (30)	Contractor?s  Facility (6) Crew Escape System Maintenance Trainer                            1	      Whiteman AFB Flight Control System Trainer                            1	      Whiteman AFB Weapons Loader Trainer	    1	      Whiteman AFBTotal  Devices	           58Services Anticipated The anticipated need for the B-2 TS will include: field services for  training systems, academic instruction, training system contractor  logistics support, and concurrency management and software and systems  engineering.  The effort will include work associated with Distributed  Mission Operations (DMO), the Radar Modernization Program (RMP), and the  Extremely High Frequency (EHF) SatCom Program, as well as future efforts  needed to maintain training system concurrency with the jet. DMO For DMO, the B-2 Weapon System Trainers and Mission Trainers will connect  into the DMO Network (DMON) via a portal provided by Northrop Grumman  Mission Systems (NGMS), the DMO Operations and Integration contractor, and  will have to meet the Combat Air Forces (CAF) DMO Interoperability  Standards.  The contractor will be responsible for ensuring that the WST  design achieves and maintains compliance with DMO System Standards as they  evolve. RMP The B-2 RMP modifies the radar system to operate in a different, approved  radar frequency band.  The B-2 RMP does not provide new capability;  however, it is forcing changes to the aircrew and maintenance training  systems. EHF Satellite Communications (SATCOM) The B-2 EHF SATCOM and Computer Upgrade Program provides a secure, command  and control EHF communications system that ensures the interconnectivity  with a survivable communications link in either a nuclear or conventional  combat-stressed environment at all times throughout the mission. The  Training System will have to evolve in step with the changes being made to  the jet. Security Contractors will be required to have a secure facility.  Personnel working  on the B-2 Training System are required to have security clearances. Contract Items Effort for the B-2 Training System is desired to begin 1 January 2009  (immediately after the current contract expires on 31 December 2008). The Government anticipates a 10-year service delivery period. The B-2 Training System will remain at Whiteman Air Force Base, MO, where  it will be operated and maintained under Contractor Support.  The customer  at Whiteman is Air Combat Command (ACC) and Air Education and Training  Command (AETC). CONTRACTOR CAPABILITY SURVEY B-2 Training System Part I.

<SUBJECT>A -- NIDDK Genetics Repository
<SOLNBR>NIH-NIDDK-07-05

<CONTACT>Dana Harris, Contract Specialist, Phone 301-594-9987, Fax 301-480-4226, Email harrisd@extra.niddk.nih.gov - Edward Kostolansky, Contract Specialist, Phone 301-594-4758, Fax 301-480-4226, Email ekostola@niddk.nih.gov
<DESC>The National Institutes of Health, National Institutes of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases is conducting a market survey to help determine the availability and technical capability of qualified small businesses, veteran-owned small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses and/or HUBZone small businesses capable of serving the needs mentioned below. 

The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) is seeking an organization or an institution to serve as the NIDDK Genetics Repository. The repository shall allow the continued storage, maintenance, and quality control, and equitable, ethical distribution of DNA and other resources important to the study of diseases under the mandate of the NIDDK. It facilitates sharing of resources, thus encouraging work by a broad group of investigators and, perhaps, increasing the sample size and the resulting power of a study to identify the genetic determinants of a disease. It helps to ensure that research participants will be making a maximal contribution, and decreases duplicative sampling efforts.

The objective of this acquisition will be to continue the NIDDK Genetics Repository, in order to accomplish the following in a highly efficient, rapid, and cost-effective manner:

?	Receive blood samples from NIDK funded grants and contracts
?	Process these data and materials to create cell lines, cryopreserved lymphocytes, and/or DNA or RNA samples
?	Receive externally produced immortalized lymphocyte cell lines; and
?	Widely distribute all materials to qualified investigators in the scientific community in variety of customized formats

The cell immortalization and other tasks outlined in this statement of work are highly technical, and require extensive experience and expertise.  The success rate for cell immortalization is extremely variable.  It depends, in large measure, on how well the established methods are implemented.  As the entire value of many genetics studies rests on the ability to analyze the DNA of sib-pairs and other relatives, inability to recover DNA from any particular sample may negate the value of multiple samples.  Therefore, it is essential that the success rate for establishing cell lines be as close to 100% as possible.  Furthermore, the ability to track thousands of genetic samples, preventing sample mix-ups and cross-contamination while maintaining a high-throughput processing system, is crucial to the integrity of the studies being supported.  The Contractor?s project director must have extensive experience in successfully providing these genetics and sample processing services, including blood cell immortalization and DNA extraction and distribution, to a large group of investigators.  The Contractor?s staff must be highly trained to carry out exacting technical tasks accurately and reproducibly.  As all the work is with samples from human subjects, all staff must be familiar with human subjects protections and be sensitive to the bioethical and safety issues involved in handling human biosamples.  Finally, the Contractor must have a demonstrable long-term interest in providing these services, to ensure that there is continuity throughout the period of the contract.
 
Currently all of the required work is in the final year of a NIDDK 5-year funded contract with the Rutgers University Cell & DNA Repository.

All qualified small businesses, veteran-owned small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses and/or HUBZone small businesses interested in submitting a corporate capability statement should demonstrate experience and knowledge for performing the following tasks:

1)	Establish biospecimen preparation, shipping, receipt, and tracking systems for numerous individual multi-center clinical studies;

2)	Maintain the confidentiality of subjects by removing all traditional personal identifiers from samples;

3)	Establish one or more subcontracts for timely and cost-effective shipping of biosamples between multiple sites and the repository;

4)	Create and store viable cell lines via Epstein-Barr virus transformation of lymphocytes from blood samples, with a success rate of 97% or greater and expanding the lymphoblastoid cell lines;

5)	Receive and store lymphoblastoid cell lines prepared at other facilities and carry out quality control assessments;

6)	Cryopreserve blood cells for eventual transformation and/or DNA extraction;

7)	Extract and store DNA from cell lines or from isolated blood cells and, with designated samples, separating the white blood cells (buffy coat) from the plasma;

8)	Receive externally produced DNA;

9)	Carry out whole genome amplification, pedigree analyses and RNA extraction;

10)	 Distribute cell lines and biosamples to investigators granted access by the PO, including arraying in a variety of formats, packaging, handling, and coordinating sample shipments to domestic and international sites;

11)	Withdraw and destroy samples from the repository as directed in writing by the Project Officer;

12)	 Establish and maintain Quality Assurance (QA) and Quality Control (QC) programs;

13)	 Provide security and back-up systems and a plan for disaster recovery;

14)	 Maintain high quality, secure information systems to allow detailed tracking and reporting of sample receipt, processing, storage and distribution, rapid retrieval of samples, storage of QA/QC information associated with the sample, seamless interaction with the Database Repository, and listing of investigators using the repository; and

15)	 Work in a cooperative fashion with the Project Officer, the External Advisory Committee, and the Steering Committee.

The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) is seeking an organization or an institution to serve as the NIDDK Biosample Repository. The repository stores and maintains biosamples under high quality conditions, and distributes them in an equitable and ethical manner.  This facilitates sharing of NIDDK-supported resources, thus encouraging work by junior investigators, investigators with novel approaches, and others not included in current collaborations, without excluding those who are established in their fields.  It helps to ensure that research participants make a maximal contribution, and decreases duplicative sampling efforts.
 
The objective of this acquisition will be to continue the NIDDK Biosample Repository, in order to accomplish the following in a highly efficient, rapid, and cost-effective manner: 

?	Receive and store biosamples collected in many different studies, 
?	Carry out specified sample processing and analyses, and
?	Widely distribute biosamples to qualified investigators

The specimen archiving tasks outlined in this statement of work are highly technical, and require extensive experience, expertise, and long-term commitment.  The samples were collected over several years from carefully chosen subjects and are present in a finite quantity.  Each sample is unique and cannot be replaced if lost, damaged, or contaminated.  Therefore, it is essential that the samples be stored under optimal conditions, which vary from sample type to sample type.  The Contractor?s project director must have extensive experience in successful management of an archival storage facility that stores various types of biosamples, including blood, stool, urine, DNA, and tissue, and distributes aliquots to many different investigators.  The Contractor?s staff must be highly trained to carry out technical tasks accurately and reproducibly.  As all the work is with samples from human subjects, all staff must be familiar with human subjects protections and be sensitive to the bioethical and safety issues involved in handling human biosamples.  Finally, the Contractor must have a demonstrable long-term interest in providing these services, to ensure that there is continuity throughout the period of the contract, and to prevent repeated shipment of samples from storage site to storage site, as shipment can sometimes damage these unique materials.

NUMBER OF STUDIES
This project will potentially serve fifteen or more large multi-site NIDDK funded studies. 

The range for existing samples is 200,000 to 400,000 individual vials. In addition, to 20,000 to 60,000 new samples, in multiple aliquots (5 ? 20 vials), will be received annually.
 
Currently all of the required work is in the final year of a NIDDK 5-year funded contract with the Fisher Bioservices.

All qualified small businesses, veteran-owned small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses and/or HUBZone small businesses interested in submitting a corporate capability statement should demonstrate experience and knowledge for performing the following tasks:

1)	Establish biospecimen preparation, shipping, receipt, and tracking systems for numerous individual multi-center clinical studies;

2)	Maintain the confidentiality of subjects by removing all traditional personal identifiers from samples;

3)	Establish one or more subcontracts for shipping of biosamples between multiple sites and the repository and for timely and cost-effective laboratory processing and/or testing of biosamples;

4)	Store biosamples under optimal conditions to minimize loss, damage or contamination;

5)	Distribute biosamples to qualified investigators granted access by the Project Officer, including packaging, handling, and coordinating sample shipments to domestic and international sites;

6)	Withdraw and destroy samples from the repository as directed in writing by the Project Officer;

The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) is seeking an organization or an institution to serve as the NIDDK Data Repository. The Data Repository stores the data from large clinical studies, including data associated with the stored biosamples and acts as the Data Coordinating Center for the NIDDK Central Repositories.  The Database Repository, acting as a central coordinating entity, facilitates efficient distribution of data and samples.  As an archive and distributor of highly usable legacy datasets, the Repository also allows re-analysis of these data and, where relevant, of specific biosamples, thus encouraging work by junior investigators, investigators with novel approaches, and others not included in current collaborations.

The objective of this acquisition shall be to continue the NIDDK Data Repository, in order to accomplish the following in a highly efficient, rapid, and cost-effective manner:

?	Assist study coordinating centers and the NIDDK Biosample and Genetics Repository in setting up labeling systems to cross-reference samples and associated data
?	Maintain a central inventory of samples from the NIDDK Biosample and Genetics Repositories, and provide inventory reporting structures for individual studies
?	Receive and test the validity of electronic databases from completed studies
?	Maintain and distribute those databases, including administering review of access applications
?	Provide timely and informative analyses of databases in response to researcher inquiries
?	Create and maintain a website for all of the NIDDK Central Repositories
?	Carry out activities to advertise to the research community about the availability of samples and data

The information systems, consulting, and database archiving tasks outlined in this statement of work are highly technical, and require extensive experience, expertise, and long-term commitment.  The data from each study represent the efforts of hundreds of investigators over five or more years to improve the public health through biomedical research, and the voluntary participation of hundreds or thousands of patients and family members.  The data cannot be replaced without great expense and effort, and, therefore, it is essential that they be protected from loss, damage or misuse.  The Contractor?s project director must have extensive experience in successful database management.  The Contractor?s staff must be highly trained to work with, maintain, and analyze numerous databases, including those in Oracle and other DBMS?s.  As all the work is with data from human subjects, all staff must be familiar with human subjects protections and be sensitive to the bioethical issues involved in handling subject data.  Finally, the Contractor must have a demonstrable long-term interest in providing these services, to ensure that there is continuity throughout the period of the contract.

Currently all of the required work is in the final year of a NIDDK 5-year funded contract with the Research Triangle Insitute.

All qualified small businesses, veteran-owned small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses and/or HUBZone small businesses interested in submitting a corporate capability statement should demonstrate experience and knowledge for performing the following tasks:

1)	Receive and test the accuracy, completeness and validity of electronic databases of participant information from completed studies that include clinical, diagnostic, genotypic, pedigree structure and other data, along with supporting documentation;

2)	Link phenotypic data to high-density genotyping data stored in the dbGAP (database of Genotype and Phenotype) or comparable database;

3)	Consult with data coordinating centers from new and ongoing studies and with the NIDDK Genetics and Biosample Repositories to facilitate use of the NIDDK Central Repositories;

4)	Work in a cooperative fashion with the Project Officer, the External Advisory Committee, and the Steering Committee;

5)	Maintain the confidentiality of subjects by removing all traditional personal identifiers from data; 

6)	Provide timely and accurate analyses of databases regarding the availability of samples, including the determination of the feasibility of the repository to meet the needs of a research request, such as the number of samples available that meet specific criteria;

7)	Maintain and distribute stored databases or selected portions of stored databases to qualified investigators granted access by the Project Officer;

8)	Establish and maintain general Quality Control (QC) and Quality Assurance (QA) programs;

9)	Provide security and back-up systems and a plan for disaster recovery; and

10)	 Maintain a public forum, including a web site, as a resource for users of the repository, and as a tool for public education about the repository and its goals, including a list of publications resulting from use of repository samples.

The work required will assist the Agency Human Resources office to provide management and required support services to coach and mentor incoming Junior Officers (JOs).  The JO program is the primary entry-level mechanism for new Foreign Service Officers (FSOs) in USAID.  The FSO coaches will establish relationships of trust with their assigned JOs.  The coaches? primary task will be to work with the JOs to define their training needs (based on a predetermined matrix of USAID skill competencies), and help the JOs to define an appropriate training plan that will include a mix of classroom training, and on-the-job training through rotations both in USAID/W and in USAID overseas missions.   The coaches, drawing on their own in-depth knowledge of USAID from a Foreign Service perspective, will also advise JOs on USAID processes and organizational culture to prepare them for their professional careers with USAID.

Each coach will carry a case load of approximately 15-20 JOs at any one time and their relationship with a JO will last for approximately 2 to 3 years.

The coaches will also be required to travel to USAID missions to work with assigned JOs, supervisors and mission management.  The coaches will advise JOs on adapting to the USAID workplace culture, on mission operations, and will work with JO supervisors to ensure that the supervisory relationship will meet/satisfy the JOs? training needs.  Coaches will also work with mission management in support of the professional development of the JOs.

Coaches will be expected to work on an as- needed basis and to travel out to the field at least once per quarter.  Coaches must have recent in-depth knowledge of USAID operations and organizational culture from an overseas as well as Washington DC perspective and be sensitive to the needs of the new generation of USAID employees.

Interested and qualified concerns are asked to provide identifying and contact information for their concern and its program(s) eligibility via email to lmaProposals@usaid.gov, not later than 15:00 PM, U.S. Eastern Standard Time, 11/30/2007.
